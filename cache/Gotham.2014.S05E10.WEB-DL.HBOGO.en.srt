1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,320
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,360
Did Walker destroy Haven?

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,440
This part of the op is need-to-know.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,560
I come bearing gifts.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,320
Reunification with the mainland hangs
on by a thread.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,920
Toxic chemicals rain down
onto the City,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,880
and the government cuts us adrift
for good.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
The filtration system
that Lucius designed is working.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
It's not glamorous work,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,640
but we are helping to save
the lives of thousands of people.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,800
You're leaving Gotham.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,520
I believe the time has come
for a change of scenery.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,360
You found a way out of Gotham?

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,720
It's a submarine.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,960
Jim Gordon and Lee Thompkins
are Man and Wife.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,680
He will never see you as anything

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,240
but a dangerous woman
keeping his child from him.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
Eduardo.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Walker.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Professor Strange will have
you fixed up in no time.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,880
Rest easy, Eduardo.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,080
I made you a promise when I found
you in that hole in Peña Dura.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,920
And I intend to keep it.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,560
To give you a true purpose
and the strength to see it through.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,400
However, I'm afraid this process
will be agonizing.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,360
And, unfortunately quite lengthy.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Apologies in advance.

28
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,680
You're going to be reborn.

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,800
And then you'll be the bane
of the unjust.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
The bane of the corrupt.

31
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,800
The bane of anyone who opposes us.

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,240
{\an5}Radio confirmation, General Wade's
landing-craft docked.

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
{\an5}His convoy is on the way here now.

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,720
{\an5}Reunification day is today.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
{\an5}Oh, that is great news.

36
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
{\an5}But then what?

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,840
{\an5}Just 'cause we rebuild
some bridges doesn't mean

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
{\an5}things are gonna suddenly improve.

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,760
{\an5}So, future got you spooked?

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
{\an5}Yeah, I guess.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
{\an5}I mean, I wanna believe things
are gonna get better,

42
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,520
{\an5}but sometimes it's just hard
for me to see it, you know.

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,240
{\an5}Can't say I understand.

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,520
{\an5}I don't have kids, at least none
that I know of.

45
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,440
{\an5}But you got one coming.

46
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,520
{\an5}So we got no choice but to believe.

47
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,720
{\an5}It's gotta be better than what we've
been through, right?

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
{\an5}It damn well better be.

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,800
{\an5}Seven days in a row of point-oh-seven
water toxicity levels.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,400
{\an5}Lucius's filters did the job.

51
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
{\an5}Good work. Hope it's not wasted.

52
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,640
{\an5}Is there any reason to think
there's a problem?

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
{\an5}Jim's got a lot on his mind.

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,800
{\an5}And what with Gotham rejoining
the world

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,520
{\an5}and a baby coming
into the world next week.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
{\an5}Give it a rest, Harvey.

57
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,720
{\an5}All joking aside,
we're here because of you.

58
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,400
{\an5}Now you're gonna be a father.
That's a future I'll take.

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,520
Well done.

60
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,440
Over the past year,
you've all done good work.

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,080
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

62
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
You've given people the food
and medicine they needed.

63
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
But it's not over, yet.

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,520
So no matter what General Wade
says today...

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
work continues.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
Give yourselves
one more round of applause...

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,320
and get back to work.

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
Here they come.

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Captain Gordon.

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,480
Nice to finally meet you
in the flesh.

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720
General, welcome to Gotham.

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
Good that you've re-established
some semblance

73
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,720
of law and order around here.

74
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,200
Seems like the Green Zone stretches
to every corner of the island.

75
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,960
General, Wayne Labs
show toxicity levels

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,080
way below the threshold
the government set for us.

77
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,880
With all due respect, Mr. Wayne,

78
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,080
but I gotta go with what
my people tell me on this.

79
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Cutting it a little close, aren't we?

80
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,840
Is that under 27 pounds, 13 ounces?

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,280
It can't possibly make
that big a difference.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
It's only the difference between
getting off this island

83
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,960
or sinking to the bottom
of the river.

84
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,920
Well, then Pengy can off-load
a few of his knick-knacks.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Not a chance.

86
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,560
Because you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Gold.

88
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,760
Congratulations!

89
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Go to the clinic, go have your baby.

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,200
What, so the two of you can high-tail
it off this rock without me?

91
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I don't think so.

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,400
I assure you
we will not launch without you.

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,200
Ed and I will finish making
preparations

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,520
and we'll be ready to launch

95
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,800
the moment you get back here
with that little bundle of joy.

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Or unless I should drive you

97
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
to the clinic in light
of your delicate condition?

98
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
I can do it.

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm not that delicate.

100
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,640
Remember that, if you even think
about double-crossing me.

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Very kind of you to offer
to drive her.

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,160
I knew she would never accept
my help.

103
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Should I start the engine?

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
One less passenger to worry about.

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,560
No, two, actually.

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
You are so right.

107
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Found it.

108
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh, well done, Miss Kyle.

109
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
All right, let's have a look.

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
All right, here we go.

111
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor?

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah, that's right.

113
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
With a reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

114
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,240
And it'll be just like the old one?

115
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,080
Oh, nothing is just like it was.

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
So why are we looking
at the old plans?

117
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,920
Perhaps I'm not ready to let
go of the past.

118
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,840
Well, if it makes you feel better,
I wish I could blow up my past.

119
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Or maybe you will.

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,080
But one day
when you build something new,

121
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,520
the past will always be part of it.

122
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,720
As for me, now master Bruce is grown,

123
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,720
building a new manor might be
my last great service to him.

124
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
A home.

125
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
And then what?

126
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
You retire?

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
No.

128
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
I will stand guard.

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,840
As I've always done.

130
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, I thought this was all settled.

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
This is bull.

132
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,800
My results are accurate, Jim.

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,960
We don't know this general.

134
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Maybe he's with Walker.

135
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
Let's not get carried away.

136
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

137
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
It's Gordon.

138
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
<i>It's Lee.</i>

139
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Everything okay?

140
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,240
Barbara just showed up here.

141
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
In labor.

142
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You're kidding.

143
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
<i>You better come quick.</i>

144
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Are you okay?

145
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah.

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Yeah.

147
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,040
<i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

148
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
<i>Try to...</i>

149
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,560
Try to wait for me?

150
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,000
It doesn't really work that way.

151
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I know.

152
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
Okay.

153
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
<i>Wait.</i>

154
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I love you.

155
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I love you, too.

156
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Jim!

157
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,280
What? What's wrong?

158
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,680
We did it.

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,200
You did it. We got through it, Jim.

160
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Captain.

161
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,640
All clear.

162
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Congratulations.

163
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
Reunification can begin.

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,160
Well, I'm glad
I could make you so happy.

165
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,400
Funny thing is, sir,

166
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,800
that's just the second
best news I've gotten today.

167
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
What's that?

168
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,760
- Jim?
- Incoming!

169
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,440
Everybody get back!
Get inside! Get inside!

170
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Go! Go!

171
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Eduardo?

172
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,640
Not anymore.

173
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,480
All right, people, listen up!

174
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,320
I want squads
headed for Knights Stadium,

175
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,760
Yeavely Park and Granton Station.

176
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,880
Work your way out.

177
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,320
We gotta find them, people.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
What the bloody hell happened?

179
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
Seems that Jim's old army buddy
wasn't quite as dead as we'd hoped.

180
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
I got squads covering the North Side,

181
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,960
they're sweeping from Coventry
down to Miller Harbor.

182
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
But they could be anywhere.

183
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
Well, give us an area to search.
We'll get it covered.

184
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, take Reatton.

185
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,560
Work your way to South City Park.

186
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,120
Looks like you're not done protecting
Bruce yet, Alfred.

187
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Eduardo?

188
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,520
What did Walker do to you?

189
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,160
When I was in Peña Dura prison,
Jim, the guards played a game.

190
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,600
They'd choose one of us
and they buried us alive.

191
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
They'd take bets on whether
you could dig your way out,

192
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,400
but then they'd bury you deeper
and play again.

193
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
I was the champion.

194
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,200
To survive that,
I had to stop being human.

195
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,280
I had become something else.

196
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,840
I became Bane.

197
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Only I didn't know it yet.

198
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,040
But she knew and she showed me
the way.

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,320
If the world is full of monsters,

200
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,760
the only way to defeat them
is to become one yourself.

201
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,280
You were a good soldier.

203
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,160
Don't pity me, Jim.

204
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,400
We are building the future.

205
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,720
She's given me a purity of mission.

206
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,080
And unlike the Army,
she is willing to carry things out.

207
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,640
A new world is coming.

208
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,560
Strong, merciless, unyielding.

209
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,120
I've heard it all before.

210
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,560
Not gonna happen.

211
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,120
And how are you going to stop me,
Jim?

212
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Not me.

213
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,200
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne
and a general of the US Army.

214
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,200
You talk about your future, Eduardo.

215
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,360
But you don't have one.

216
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
But Eduardo's dead, Jim.

217
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,880
There is only Bane now.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Rise.

219
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,640
I said rise!

220
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
Not so formal.

221
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Captain and I are acquainted.

222
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
Get the other one.

223
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,760
I recognize your voice.
But I don't know what to call you.

224
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,400
I know it's not Walker.

225
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
So who are you?

226
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,840
That's a good question.

227
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can help us
figure that one out.

228
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
You okay?

229
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Yeah.

230
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
You want hostages?

231
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
You've got me and the general
of the US Army.

232
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Let him go.

233
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
This has nothing to do with him.

234
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
This has nothing to do with him?

235
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,520
But, Captain,
you don't even know what this is.

236
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,240
This, everything I have done here,
is about punishing Gotham.

237
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,840
For the sins of Bruce Wayne.

238
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
You can start now.

239
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,920
No! No!

240
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
And again.

241
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,200
So, Bruce Wayne.

242
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm thinking of a name.

243
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,840
Can you guess whose it is?

244
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
What?

245
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,240
Wrong.

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,480
And again.

247
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,360
Wanna take another guess?

248
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,520
Farewell, my beloved Gotham,
city of my birth.

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,800
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

250
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Though I leave you today,
my heart will always remain...

251
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,960
I do so hate good-byes.

252
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
Well, you're in luck.
We're not going anywhere.

253
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,360
- What are you talking about?
- Engine won't start.

254
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,960
Pressure regulator valve's missing.

255
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
Or rather, it's stolen.

256
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Barbara!

257
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,360
Blood pressure's normal.

258
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,320
I'm glad something
about this is normal.

259
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,280
So how long is this gonna take,
Doc, soup to nuts?

260
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
Are you in a hurry or something?

261
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,360
No, it's just that...

262
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,280
I just feel like you've been so great
about this and, you know,

263
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
it's been awkward as hell for you
and...

264
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,480
I haven't even really said thank you.

265
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,240
I don't expect a thank you from you,
Barbara.

266
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,760
Then perhaps the best thank you
would be for me

267
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,280
to get out of here as soon
as possible.

268
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Whatever's on your mind,
the health of the baby comes first.

269
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,920
I know that.

270
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,280
So long haul or short, we're here

271
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,160
until you have a healthy baby
in your arms.

272
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
That's all I want.

273
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Okay.

274
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Stop it!

275
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,560
A name.

276
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
A person.

277
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
The reason this is all happening.

278
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,640
Can't you guess, yet?

279
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,600
I don't know!

280
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
If you wanna punish me, then do it.

281
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,640
Hurt me, not him.

282
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
I am hurting you.

283
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,120
There's nothing more painful
than seeing your friends suffer.

284
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,720
But he's more than just a friend,
isn't he, Bruce?

285
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,480
Jim Gordon's been
like a father to you.

286
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,280
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

287
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Who am I doing this for?

288
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,480
Say the name.

289
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,680
When the ones you love die,

290
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,080
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off forever.

291
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,040
You know that.

292
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
So why do I hate you so much?

293
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,280
Who was cut away from me?

294
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,560
Last chance.

295
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Yes.

296
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,840
Now you know.

297
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,120
Say his name.

298
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
Say it.

299
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,040
Ra's al Ghul.

300
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,400
This is revenge for his death.

301
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,920
And who am I?

302
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,440
You're his daughter.

303
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

304
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,400
And revenge is just the beginning
of what I want.

305
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,600
The League of Shadows is everywhere.

306
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,920
Did you think my father's mission
would die with him?

307
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,360
Humankind will be purged of weakness.

308
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm just starting with you and yours.

309
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,080
You're right.

310
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,760
I killed Ra's.

311
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,800
So whatever you need to do,
do it to me.

312
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,360
No.

313
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,080
You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.

314
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,040
I mean, you did have some help,
right?

315
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,360
Someone who quite literally
gave you a helping hand.

316
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
What are you doing?

317
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
Well done, Barbara.

318
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,000
Go get Barbara Kean.

319
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Eduardo.

320
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
She's pregnant.

321
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,080
She's carrying a child.

322
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,600
A child.

323
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,960
One soul's future
weighed against the world's.

324
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,720
Your concern seems petty, Jim.

325
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,560
If he touches a hair
on that child's head,

326
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,000
I will destroy everything you have.

327
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,440
I don't have anything left.

328
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
Just my father's mission.

329
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,680
Bane wants you
to join that mission with us.

330
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,640
To see the world as he sees it.

331
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Never.

332
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,440
Never say never, Captain Gordon.

333
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,560
No!

334
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,440
How does it feel, Bruce,

335
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,760
knowing that all of this
is your fault?

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Tell me, I'd really like to know.

337
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,440
There must be something
you can give me.

338
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,040
We're out of the drugs that you need.

339
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,280
It's okay. You're almost there.

340
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,440
I'll get you some ice chips,
so you don't get dehydrated.

341
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,720
Gee, thanks.

342
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Lee.

343
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Ed.

344
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Don't worry. I'm not here for you.

345
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,080
But for the record,
you stabbed me first.

346
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,440
If you two are quite done,
we are actually here for Barbara.

347
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
- Oh, no.
- Or more precisely,

348
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,400
what she stole from us.

349
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,880
I don't know what this is about
and I don't care.

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
You two need to get out of here
right now.

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Gladly.

352
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,600
Just as soon as Barbara
gives us the...

353
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,120
- What's it called?
- Pressure regulator valve.

354
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,920
Right. That.

355
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,600
I should've known that you would
try to screw us over.

356
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,400
You only noticed because you tried
to screw me over first.

357
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
Second. Technically.

358
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,480
Okay, she's in the middle
of having a baby.

359
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
And we are in the middle
of trying to leave Gotham.

360
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,240
And we can't do that without
a crucial part of the submarine,

361
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,480
which will ferry us all away
from here.

362
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,520
That's why you were in such a rush
to get out of here.

363
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,320
As are we.

364
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,280
Hand over the part, now.

365
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
Don't point that at the baby.

366
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
What? No, I did not.

367
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,000
I...

368
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,080
I was merely trying to make a general
threatening gesture with the firearm.

369
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,560
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

370
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,880
All right. Fine.

371
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,760
I'm sorry! Now give us what we want!

372
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,680
Oh, you think I'm stupid enough
to have the part on me?

373
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,880
It's hidden away somewhere safe.

374
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,120
And if you think you can torture me
into telling you where,

375
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,680
there is literally nothing
more painful

376
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,880
then what I am going
through right now!

377
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,320
Hey! You stay out of here.

378
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
This is a hospital.

379
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,720
Mommy Kean.

380
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,320
<i>Your time is up.</i>

381
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
<i>There is no place for you hide.</i>

382
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,400
No one will save you.

383
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,400
No mercy that will spare you.

384
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
You certainly cannot run
from your sins.

385
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,080
And you cannot run from me.

386
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,360
What do you want from me?

387
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,760
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

388
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,560
It's called Special Order 3-8-6.

389
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,920
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

390
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,040
a contingency plan was put in place
to reduce this city to rubble.

391
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,320
No. There are still innocent
people here.

392
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,960
You asked me what I want from you.

393
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,800
I want you to suffer, Bruce Wayne.

394
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
And then I want you to die.

395
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,920
Spend a little time
with that thought.

396
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,480
We'll be starting soon.

397
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,960
- Who are those guys?
- No idea.

398
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,160
Exactly how many people have
you screwed over?

399
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
Present company excluded?

400
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,520
But there are 79 people
in this building.

401
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,040
Fortunately, they seem to only be
interested in trying to kill one.

402
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,320
So by all means,
let's gather around the target.

403
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Maybe we can cut through
the abandoned wing

404
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,120
and we can get to the
ambulance bay that way.

405
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,240
It might take some time, but...

406
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,880
Oh, if only there were two able
bodied men who could buy us some.

407
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,480
And why, pray tell, should we risk
our necks for you?

408
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,880
For chivalry?

409
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,600
But if that's too much remember,

410
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,120
if I die, you will never find
that sub-part.

411
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Fine.

412
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
We'll keep them busy.

413
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,840
- We'll meet you at the docks.
- Thank you.

414
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,960
- What?
- Keep them busy?

415
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,640
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

416
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,240
not to repel a paramilitary assault.

417
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,280
What do we use, bedpans?

418
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,840
I was actually thinking of something
a little more flammable.

419
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,440
Why, Captain Gordon,
how nice that you're awake.

420
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,800
You picked the losing side, Strange.

421
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
The Army's coming to Gotham.

422
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,160
Help me and you can do
what you do best.

423
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
Survive.

424
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,600
I happen to think more
of Ms. Al Ghul's chances

425
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,000
for success than a man in your,
well, position.

426
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,800
You really think she can take
on the entire Army?

427
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,560
As a matter of fact, I do.

428
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,000
With my help...

429
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,800
you are just a few modifications away

430
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,640
from being a mighty soldier
in her forces.

431
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,440
Not unlike your friend Eduardo...

432
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,400
I will help you to realize
your full potential.

433
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,320
Give you true strength.

434
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,760
- I'll pass.
- Consent is hardly a prerequisite.

435
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,600
We will begin with,
physical improvements.

436
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Sorry.

437
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,480
And finish with certain mental
adjustments.

438
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,000
Your contractions
are about a minute apart.

439
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,360
We gotta get you out of here.

440
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,560
Nice shot!

441
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,160
Keep breathing.

442
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,800
Some try to hide, some try to cheat.

443
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
But time will let us always meet.
What am I?

444
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,400
- Pregnant lady with a gun?
- Death. But close enough.

445
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,080
So, where to now?

446
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,120
Well, I believe
we have a sub to catch.

447
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
How long have you had that?

448
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Long enough to know she'd never
let it out of her sight.

449
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,520
And you stuck around long enough

450
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,160
to risk both of our lives
to save Barbara's?

451
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
Or was it to protect Lee?

452
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,520
Do you want me to answer that or do
you wanna sail away from here?

453
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,640
Bon voyage.

454
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Those bastards have stolen
the damn sub-part!

455
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,720
You mean stole it back.

456
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
Whose side are you on?

457
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,960
Clearly, I'm on the baby's side,
Barbara.

458
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,320
What was your plan, anyway?

459
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,760
You were going to be a fugitive
with Nygma and Penguin?

460
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,320
Well, I'm not exactly
the stay-at-home

461
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,840
and bake apple pie type.

462
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,480
Yeah, and running off on a submarine
seems like a great alternative.

463
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,200
Barbara, you can live here.

464
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
You can have this baby here.

465
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,360
Jim is not taking the baby away
from you.

466
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,520
You really believe that?

467
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,320
You really think Captain Jim Gordon

468
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,600
is gonna let a criminal raise
his kid?

469
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,760
People are already shooting
at my baby.

470
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,800
I have to protect him...

471
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,360
or her.

472
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
I have to be strong.

473
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,280
Hey. Being strong does not mean
you have to be a criminal.

474
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,640
Jim will help you.

475
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
And so will I, if you let me.

476
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Well, that's just weird.

477
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
I know.

478
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,840
Hey, baby, this is your auntie Lee.

479
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,000
Mommy tried to kill her once.

480
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,560
Maybe twice.

481
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,600
All right.
Okay, that's enough of that. Come on.

482
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
We gotta keep moving.

483
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,080
I think this is happening now.

484
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,960
What's going on in there?

485
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,320
This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?

486
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,080
This is Bruce Wayne.
Does anyone at the GCPD read me?

487
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,320
This is Bruce Wayne.
Can anyone read me?

488
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,640
Bruce. It's Alfred.
Where the devil are you? Over.

489
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
Some abandoned mansion
in North Side Park.

490
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,160
- On my way.
- No.

491
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,480
I'll get out myself.

492
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,920
I need you to get to the clinic.

493
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The clinic?

494
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,000
<i>It's Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Alfred.</i>

495
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,240
<i>She wants revenge.</i>

496
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,280
<i>She mutated Eduardo Dorrance
and sent him after Barbara.</i>

497
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,120
Oh, gosh.

498
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm fine.

499
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,880
I need you to get to Barbara
and the baby.

500
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,120
Now, you're going to feel
a slight discomfort.

501
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,600
That's the stimulant I've given you
to prepare your muscles.

502
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
You'll need it for what's comes next.

503
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Which...

504
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,160
I'm afraid is going to be
excruciating.

505
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
Do you feel that?

506
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Yes.

507
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,600
There's that fighting spirit
I've always admired so much.

508
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,800
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's an alarm I must sound.

509
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,280
What the hell are you doing?

510
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,320
Checking to make sure Strange doesn't
have one of those chips in your head.

511
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,400
We gotta hurry up, get out of here,
before he trips the alarm.

512
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Come on.

513
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,360
Alfred and GCPD are on their way
to the clinic.

514
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,160
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know.

515
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,480
But she's planning on using
the military to wipe out Gotham.

516
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,200
I can order them to stand down.

517
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
Then let's get you out of here.

518
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,040
She's beautiful.

519
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
Congratulations.

520
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Hi, there.

521
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,720
Guess I have to figure out
what to call you.

522
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Thank you.

523
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,200
Come on.

524
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,720
Get in the car now.

525
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
I'll hold him off.

526
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,240
Alfred and I got this.

527
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,160
Selina, get in the car.

528
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,280
- Selina, get back in the car!
- No!

529
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Go.

530
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,360
Oh, my. Look at you.

531
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,960
You're big 'un ain't you?

532
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,440
Bloody baby.
Well then, let's see what you got!

533
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,360
Dirty bastard.

534
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,680
No!

535
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Alfred.

536
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
Alfred.

537
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,400
Alfred? No.

538
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,960
Somebody help!

539
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,880
Somebody? Oh, no.

540
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,560
Atten-hut!

541
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Welcome back, General.

542
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,640
Get me a secure line
to the mainland now.

543
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,040
Jim, hey.

544
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,240
Just got word from Lee.

545
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,440
She and Barbara made it out
of the clinic okay.

546
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,880
And your baby daughter, too.

547
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,840
Congratulations.

548
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,040
They're going to The Sirens.

549
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,320
You just had a baby girl, brother.

550
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Say something.

551
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,800
Just can't believe it.

552
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,480
We won, didn't we? It's over.

553
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
We did.

554
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,560
And she's gonna have a better world
because of it.

555
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,720
She is.

556
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,520
- Mainland, sir.
- I promise.

557
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
- Is Alfred with them?
- Didn't say.

558
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,880
This is General Wade.

559
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,160
I am authorizing Special Order 3-8-6.

560
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,880
- No!
- Gotham City is lost.

561
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
Begin your bombing run on my order.

562
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
Wait, wait, wait.

563
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Arrest them.

564
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,160
You can't do this.

565
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
Take them away.

566
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,960
You can't do this!

567
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,520
Okay, nice and slow.

568
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,200
Barbara Kean.

569
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Run!

570
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,880
It's nice to finally meet you.

571
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,160
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

572
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,040
I believe you knew my father.

573
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,520
I don't understand, how the general
could've been chipped?

574
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000
I didn't see a scar
on the back of his neck.

575
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,400
- Did you?
- No.

576
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Strange must have hidden it.

577
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,920
Nyssa let us escape.

578
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
She knew we'd bring the general here
and do her dirty work for her.

579
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
What now, Jim?

580
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,720
Son, if you're gonna stick a gun
in my face,

581
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,400
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

582
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Come on, let's go.
