355
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,211
I'm protecting this country.

356
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,126
-Everyone stand down.
-Miss Waller, I...

357
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,128
Stand down!

358
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,260
[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

359
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,917
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

360
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,788
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

361
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,660
...if this mission
weren't more important

362
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,183
than you could
possibly imagine.

363
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,750
Fuck your mission.

364
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,491
You have the military
experience necessary,

365
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,015
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

366
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,495
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

367
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,323
No, I'm no fucking leader!

368
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,325
Then I'll make you one.

369
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,544
[dramatic music playing]

370
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,722
Are you in or out?

371
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,642
Good. Let's meet your team.

372
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,080
-Come on.
-Fuck me, man.

373
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,040
[guard] Let's go.

374
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,259
She was gonna kill his kid?

375
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,873
[Waller] Each member
of the team is chosen

376
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,572
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

377
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,576
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

378
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:49,275
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

379
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,407
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

380
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,366
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

381
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,411
-Are you having a laugh?
-What?

382
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,239
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

383
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,763
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

384
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,200
But better.

385
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,331
I always hit
my targets dead center.

386
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,898
I hit them more in the center.

387
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,160
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

388
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,509
-I use smaller bullets.
-What?

389
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,815
They go inside
your bullet holes

390
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:08,990
without even touching the side.

391
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,601
Next up is King Shark.

392
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,602
[Peacemaker] Holy shit.

393
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,952
What the fuck?

394
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,606
[Waller] Some people claim

395
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,435
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

396
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,655
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

397
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,352
Does it talk?

398
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,441
-[King Shark] Book read.
-[Bloodsport] Wow. [chuckles]

399
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:26,877
[Peacemaker]
Book's upside-down.

400
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,270
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

401
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:32,796
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

402
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,233
Be a mite careful,

403
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,930
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

404
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:36,931
Huh?

405
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,412
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

406
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,892
-Ratcatcher 2.
-[inmate whistles]

407
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,459
-[inmates cheering]
-Settle down!

408
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,808
Ooh.

409
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,419
What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

410
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,811
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

411
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:48,943
[knocks]

412
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,553
Cazo, will you be joining us?

413
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,642
[groans] I just woke up.

414
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,949
I don't function well
early in the morning.

415
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,517
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

416
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,735
Hmm, it's all right.

417
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,607
-Get your ass out here!
-[gasps]

418
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,697
[sighs, moaning]

419
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,180
Millennials.

420
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:11,966
[continues moaning]

421
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,969
Oh, no way.

422
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,493
-That's not coming with us.
-She controls rats.

423
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,582
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

424
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,542
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

425
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:26,981
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

426
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:28,330
[Sebastian whines]

427
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,941
And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

428
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,204
What's that 'round his neck?

429
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,554
A power dampener.

430
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,295
They call him
the Polka Dot Man.

431
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,514
[scoffs] Polka Dot Man.

432
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,429
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

433
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,781
He does.

434
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,479
He throws polka dots at people.

435
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,132
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

436
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,396
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

437
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:54,182
You fucking pussy!
[laughing hysterically]

438
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,140
-[chuckles]
-These are soldiers?

439
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,751
We need to debrief.

440
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,058
[glass squeaking]

441
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,935
[groans] Fuck.

442
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,372
Corto Maltese

443
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,767
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

444
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,508
Over the past 100 years,

445
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,206
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

446
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,513
by the Herrera family.

447
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,299
But, a week ago, this guy,

448
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,868
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

449
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,784
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

450
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,308
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

451
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,919
in a violent military coup.

452
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:40,837
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

453
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,970
Although the United States
did not condone

454
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,451
the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

455
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,541
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

456
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:52,675
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

457
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,155
So, you want us to kill Luna?

458
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,374
No.

459
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,115
This is Jotunheim.

460
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,553
A scientific
experimentation facility

461
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,992
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

462
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,037
Our intelligence sources
tell us

463
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:10,432
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

464
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,956
In the hands
of the Luna regime,

465
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:17,352
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

466
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:21,748
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

467
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:25,404
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

468
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,796
How are we supposed to get in?

469
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,972
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

470
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,062
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

471
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:35,109
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

472
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,068
known as La Gatita Amable.

473
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,941
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

474
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,117
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

475
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,380
Any questions?

476
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,602
What is that?

477
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,865
[Waller] That is
an overhead projector.

478
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,388
Do you ever use it anymore?

479
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,911
No, not really.

480
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,870
So, why don't you
just throw it away?

481
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:58,785
[Waller] Peacemaker?

482
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,614
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

483
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,615
Think there's any connection?

484
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,227
No.

485
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,664
No...

486
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,709
Nanaue.

487
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,058
[Peacemaker] ...connection.

488
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:12,625
Hand.

489
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:15,802
Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

490
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:20,328
We're all gonna die.

491
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:22,243
I hope so.

492
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:25,681
Oh, for fuck's sake.

493
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:27,727
[dramatic music playing]

494
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,788
[explosion]

495
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,751
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

496
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,622
[Waller on radio] It's just 
a diversion, Bloodsport.

497
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,712
All right,
we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

498
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,671
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

499
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,542
That's the word.

500
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,675
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

501
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,111
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

502
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,242
You're the leader.

503
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,766
You're supposed to be decisive.

504
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:07,941
And I've decided
that you should eat

505
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:09,725
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

506
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,640
You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

507
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:12,815
was completely covered in dicks

508
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,469
and somebody said I had to eat

509
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,731
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

510
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,428
I would say no problemo.

511
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,127
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

512
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:21,389
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

513
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:22,782
Well, you know what I think?

514
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:24,174
I think liberty
is just your excuse

515
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,089
to do whatever you want.

516
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:28,614
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

517
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:34,228
Oh, yeah?

518
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,057
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

519
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,798
Oh, here we go.

520
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,408
There's something wrong
with your skin.

521
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,628
It's just a rash.

522
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,064
That's a rash?

523
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,893
[explosions]

524
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,854
[screams]

525
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:54,117
[grunts]

526
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,771
-[gunfire]
-[soldier shouts indistinctly]

527
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,557
[whispers] Oh, no.

528
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,258
[whispering] You...

529
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,174
are the only one...

530
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,179
fit to carry my javelin.

531
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,233

[Waller over radio] 
Task force X, come in.

01:47:12,948 --> 01:47:13,949
 Are you there?

1781
01:47:16,995 --> 01:47:18,519
Uh-huh.

1782
01:47:18,606 --> 01:47:19,868
 Whatever signal jammers

1783

1784
01:47:21,652 --> 01:47:23,654
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1785
01:47:23,741 --> 01:47:26,440
Yeah, well, we've got a mite
issue over here, Waller.

1786

It's Project Starfish,
Miss Waller.

1787
01:47:28,833 --> 01:47:30,792
It's headed towards the city,
and I think it wants

1788
01:47:30,879 --> 01:47:32,924
to feed on as many people
as it can.

[Waller] Not our problem.

1791

 If you've destroyed Jotunheim

1792

 you've achieved the objective.

1793
01:47:42,673 --> 01:47:45,197
 Corto Maltese 
is no longer a U.S. ally.

1794
01:47:45,284 --> 01:47:46,895
If anything,
the White House will consider

in a hostile nation

in you for a reason.

away from me.

1814
01:49:10,195 --> 01:49:11,022
