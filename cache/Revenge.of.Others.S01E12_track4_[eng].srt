1
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,114
Seok Jaebum.

2
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,833
Sooheon.

3
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,961
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,881
What is that in your hand?

5
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,550
This?

6
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,553
-It's a phone. Can't you see?
-That's Park Wonseok's phone.

7
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,013
What?

8
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,098
I know for certain
that's Park Wonseok's phone.

9
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,100
Give it to me.

10
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,749
Gi Osung.

11
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,710
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,755
Is that seriously
what you're concerned about right now?

13
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,632
I need to find out what's going on
in order to deal with it, don't I?

14
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,758
You're here because you got scared

15
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,219
after they sent you
that photo of Park Wonseok's phone, right?

16
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,512
I'm assuming you didn't realize Ji Sooheon

17
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,722
was following you on his motorcycle.

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,725
This was all part of Ji Sooheon's plan.

19
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,561
I was with Sooheon
when I received that photo.

20
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,939
Then Ok Chanmi must have been
the one who sent it to you.

21
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,899
Since they're in on this together.

22
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,321
Ok Chanmi was the one who sent it to me?

23
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,032
You're lucky I happened to see Ji Sooheon
when I was on my way to meet you.

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,368
By the way, why do you have
Park Wonseok's phone?

25
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,287
Are you trying to confess
that you killed him or something?

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,503
What?

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,605
This is the phone I had lost.

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,399
Did you steal it from me?

29
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,569
I had to figure out
what you were up plotting

30
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,778
before planning my next move.

31
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,864
You should be grateful
for what I did for you!

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,658
Grateful?

33
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
Hey.

34
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
Did you know from the very beginning?

35
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,755
And when did you figure it out?

36
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,133
When did your memory come back?

37
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,681
Why isn't he picking up...

38
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,979
When did my memory come back?

39
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,398
I knew as soon as I remembered
that it was you

40
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,108
who pushed me from that roof

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,694
and not Park Wonseok.

42
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,406
So you knew from the beginning, huh?

43
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,408
How?

44
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,203
How did you know it was me?

45
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,164
I may not have seen it
with my own two eyes,

46
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,665
but it's pretty obvious, don't you think?

47
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,418
-How did you know?
-Don't you realize what's important here?

48
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,545
You should be thanking me

49
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
for covering up
your murder up until this point.

50
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,386
So what's your next move?

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,097
What are you going to do now that
that bastard Ji Sooheon caught you?

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,099
Answer my question.

53
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,435
How did you know it was me
that killed Park Wonseok?

54
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,646
Stop messing around
if you don't want to end up in jail.

55
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,317
You knew there's another person
inside of me,

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,693
and you took advantage of that.

57
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,489
You sneakily planted fake memories
when my other self came out.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,284
You kept insisting that
it was Park Wonseok

59
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,744
who pushed me from the roof.

60
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,287
It was Park Wonseok, you said.

61
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,750
So yeah, I killed Park Wonseok.

62
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,503
You're the one who made me do it.

63
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
That's why I helped you
sweep things under the rug.

64
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,509
I wouldn't have killed him
if it hadn't been for you, you bastard!

65
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,929
I'm warning you.

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,056
Cut the bullshit.

67
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,894
You just wanted to hide the fact
that you pushed me off the roof!

68
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,020
Right?

69
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,064
That's why you tried to frame it
on Park Wonseok.

70
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,691
Stop making up excuses.

71
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,234
No matter what you say,

72
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,862
you're still a murderer.

73
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,324
Bring it on!

74
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,374
Motherfucker!

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,966
You!

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,898
Fucker!

77
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,394
CALL
JI SOOHEON

78
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,771
CALLING
JI SOOHEON

79
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,196
The number you have dialed is una...

80

MMA, JIUJITSU, KICKBOXING,
MUAYTHAI, LOSING WEIGHT

81
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,788
Hey, Sooheon!

82
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh, my god! What's up with your forehead?

83
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,919
Hey, what happened to you?

84
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,886
Let me get the first aid kit.

85
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,639
It was Seok Jaebum.

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,439
Seok Jaebum

87
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,150
had Park Wonseok's cell phone.

88
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,743
Seok Jaebum is the culprit.

89
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,863
REVENGE OF OTHERS

90
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,375
The main themes in Kafka's
"Metamorphosis"

91
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
are the loss of humanity and alienation.

92
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:46,382
Originally, Gregory was a hard worker
who took care of his family.

93
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,428
One day, he woke up as a huge cockroach.

94
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,182
Through this novel, the author suggests
a new model for a family structure.

95
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,564
I guess Seok Jaebum
didn't come to class today.

96
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,859
Of course not. How could he show his face
at school when you caught him last night?

97
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,986
What are you going to do now?

98
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,990
I guess I'll go to the police.

99
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
We have to tell the cops that Seok Jaebum
had my brother's cell phone.

100
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,579
Also...

101
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,457
we have to clear up the fact
that Gi Osung isn't the murderer,

102
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,876
since that's what we've been
telling them up until now.

103
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,880
Who do you think

104
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,673
beat me up last night?

105
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,343
That means there might have been
an accomplice.

106
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,887
Let's tell the police about that too.

107
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,769

KCSI
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION POLICE

112
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,255
So, are you saying Seok Jaebum

113
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,217
had Park Wonseok's phone
you told me about before?

114
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,510
Yes.

115
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,223
So you followed him to the horse track
without him knowing

116
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,936
and saw Seok Jaebum pulling out
Park Wonseok's cell phone?

117
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes, that's right.

118
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,023
I know this must be frustrating,
but we can't be certain

119
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
that the cell phone he had
was Park Wonseok's.

120
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,360
I mean...

121
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,238
Isn't it obvious if he went straight
to the horse track to find the phone

122
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,950
after we sent him that photo?

123
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,744
If we had tried to pull off something like
what you did yesterday,

124
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,079
we would've called that a sting operation.

125
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,207
It can't be constituted as evidence.

126
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,043
Please arrest Seok Jaebum.

127
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,004
You have to investigate
this properly this time.

128
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,841
Seok Jaebum

129
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,594
was reported missing this morning.

130
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,933
His car was found on a riverbed
near the horse track.

131
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,769
The cops are currently looking for him.

132
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,025
Sooheon,

133
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,778
I need to ask you a few questions
in the interrogation room.

134
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,697
Shall we?

135
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,950
Here.

136
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,121
What you're saying is that the person

137
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,999
who hit your head
must be the accomplice, right?

138
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,876
I guess what I mean
is that there's a good chance

139
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
they might have been an accomplice.

140
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
You didn't hurt your head
while fighting Seok Jaebum?

141
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,088
No.

142
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,214
I lost consciousness when that person
came out of nowhere

143
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,591
and hit me over the head.

144
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,887
You said you didn't see anyone else there
when you woke up.

145
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,431
Do you remember what time that was?

146
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,808
Uh, I didn't check the time.

147
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,977
Then what time was it
when you got back home?

148
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,897
Ah, I don't know.

149
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,565
Chanmi should know though.

150
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,113
Well, this isn't a good situation
for you, Sooheon,

151
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,117
now that Seok Jaebum has gone missing.

152
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,251
What do you think happened to Seok Jaebum?

153
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,088
How could he have gone missing...

154
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,006
He's not missing.
He probably just ran away.

155
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,966
Are you saying
that he faked his disappearance

156
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,176
by abandoning his car at the river bed?

157
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,803
He could do worse.

158
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,971
What a piece of shit.

159
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,391
After I learned that he was the murderer,

160
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,019
my hands and feet started shaking.
It gives me goosebumps.

161
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,773
Then why was he so nice to me like that?

162
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,067
I had always felt very grateful
to him too.

163
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,702
I want to confront him directly
and ask him why he killed my brother.

164
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,204
There is no such thing as a legitimate

165
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,206
or understandable reason
for killing someone.

166
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,418
It's only going to be hurtful for you
to hear what he says.

167
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,294
Don't even think
about seeing Seok Jaebum again.

168
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,683
Did you find anything?

169
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,059
Ah, yes.

170
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,396
I found two bloodstains on the ground,
so I took some samples.

171
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,106
Nothing worth reporting at the moment.

172
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,315
I see.

173
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,653
So, Seok Jaebum's family
owns this horse track?

174
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,946
It's right by the employee training center
of the Seungpil group,

175
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,406
which Seok Jaebum's family also owns.

176
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,369
Seok Jaebum didn't have any relation
to Park Wonseok's case, did he?

177
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,289
No, the first time he got involved
in the case was during

178
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,665
the live stream incident
at Sa Junggyeong's RV.

179
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,333
He was the one who appeared
wearing a mask instead of Ji Sooheon.

180
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,627
So at that point
when he appeared on the live stream,

181
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,047
it's safe to assume he was
on Ok Chanmi or Ji Sooheon's side, right?

182
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,382
I guess so.

183
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,427
And now that Ji Sooheon and Ok Chanmi
have pinned him down

184
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,137
as Park Wonseok's murderer,

185
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,264
he's become their enemy.

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,857
Those two are always
one step ahead of us cops.

187
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,824
Detective.

188
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,951
We just got the surveillance footage
from the park on the night

189
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,578
that the suspect called Ok Chanmi.

190
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,330
Really?

191
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,168
Let's have a look.

192
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,006
Isn't that Gi Osung and Seok Jaebum?

193
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,009
Yes, those two were
at the park that night.

194
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,011
Were they?

195
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,429
Okay, that's good to know.

196
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,764
Let's go.

197
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,780
It was like this
when we found it this morning.

198
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:49,662
The door was probably left open either
because there was an urgent situation,

199
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,916
or as a poor attempt to trick us
into believing he's gone missing, right?

200
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,417
It's probably one of the two, right?

201
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,585
Whichever one it is,

202
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,672
this means that Seok Jaebum
is somehow related to this case.

203
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,090
We need to find him.

204
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
Detective, something's fishy.

205
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
What?

206
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,318
This.

207
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
Doesn't something
about this seem familiar?

208
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,019
Ajung, come eat.

209
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,105
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,691
I'm just going to stock the items
that just came in.

211
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,859
These two definitely seem similar.

212
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,235
Whether it's the shape of the face
or the body,

213
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,654
there's definitely a resemblance.

214
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
To me, they seem like the same person.

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,785
Let's hand this over
to Video Analysis team.

216
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,161
Okay.

217
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,545
Thank you for coming.

218
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,922
I couldn't very well not show up.

219
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,048
Especially since you mentioned
you wanted to apologize

220
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,550
for accusing me of being the murderer.

221
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm so sorry.

222
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,887
It was all a misunderstanding.

223
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,223
I apologize.

224
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,516
Honestly,

225
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,852
it was kind of hard for me.

226
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,937
Put yourself in my shoes.

227
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,064
It's infuriating to be called a murderer

228
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,608
when you're not a murderer.

229
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,945
"I'm sorry."

230
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,323
I don't know that I can forgive you
with just those two words.

231
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,658
I'm truly sorry.

232
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,909
I will apologize to you again.

233
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,872
An apology only counts when the victim
agrees to accept it as one.

234
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,003
You haven't yet told me
the most important thing.

235
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,129
So...

236
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,424
who was Park Wonseok's murderer?

237
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,136
You already know who.

238
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,848
-What?
-You already know, don't you?

239
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,017
How would I know?

240
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,479
You were at the horse track last night.

241
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,155
So, Ji Sooheon saw me there last night?

242
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,618
I assumed he wouldn't have seen me.

243
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,161
So it was you.

244
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,831
You were the one
who attacked Ji Sooheon from behind.

245
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
He was knocked out immediately

246
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
when I hit him
over the head with a shovel.

247
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,503
It was a pretty good hit.

248
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,006
I'll never forget
how satisfying that felt.

249
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,383
I'm going to ask you politely.

250
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,344
So...

251
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,262
where's Seok Jaebum now?

252
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,556
I heard his family reported him
as missing.

253
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,141
How would I know where he is
when even the police can't find him?

254
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,894
-Where is Seok Jaebum right now?
-I said I didn't know, shit.

255
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,313
Why don't you just drop it?

256
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,357
You're the accomplice, aren't you?

257
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,483
This bitch...

258
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,902
You and Seok Jaebum killed
my older brother together, didn't you?

259
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,405
Fuck, here she goes again
with this nonsense.

260
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,201
I knew there was something off about you
telling me you wanted to apologize.

261
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,246
You're annoying as shit.

262
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,248
If you're not the accomplice,
you can just tell me.

263
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,376
Where's Seok Jaebum right now?

264
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,836
This crazy bitch.

265
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,420
Enough with that bullshit.

266
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,715
Hold on a second.

267
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,844
Let me stop recording.

268
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,018
Let me just make a call real quick.

269
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,104
One second.

270
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,188
DETECTIVE JIN SOJUNG

271
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,817
Hello?

272
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,906
Hi Detective Jin. It's Ok Chanmi.

273
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,577
It seems Gi Osung
went to the horse track last night,

274
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,747
and he was the one who hit Ji Sooheon
over the head to knock him out.

275
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,792
Please summon him to the station
and find Seok Jaebum's whereabouts.

276
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
Yes.

277
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm sending you the recording now.

278
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,179
Ok Chanmi.

279
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,974
I'm going to make sure
you die at my hands someday.

280
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,228
I'll make you crawl on all fours
like an animal and squeal for forgiveness.

281
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,816
I'll hold off on getting my apology
from you until then.

282
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm telling you the truth.

283
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,555
How would I know where he is
when he's been reported as missing?

284
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
Maybe he hasn't disappeared.

285
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,768
Maybe he just ran away.

286
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,269
Seok Jaebum

287
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,147
killed Park Wonseok.

288
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,482
What?

289
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,901
Jaebum is the murderer?

290
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,277
I'm positive.

291
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,034
Seok Jaebum tried to protect Park Wonseok.
Why would he kill him?

292
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,245
Are you sure
there wasn't some sort of mistake?

293
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,747
I'm sure it was Seok Jaebum.

294
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,375
Jihyun.

295
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,545
Either he went missing or is in hiding,
we have to find him as soon as possible.

296
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,839
That's the only way we can prevent
more casualties from happening.

297
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,133
What can I possibly do to help?

298
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,559
What's this?

299
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,019
A GPS tracker.

300
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,607
Put this in Gi Osung's backpack secretly.

301
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,489
Gi Osung's probably going to head over
to where Seok Jaebum is.

302
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,575
We need to get him to confess.

303
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,577
We need to stop this
before the situation gets any worse.

304
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,455
Jihyun.

305
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,884
Thank you so much.

306
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
Why were you at the horse track?

307
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,855
To meet with Seok Jaebum.

308
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,107
I just went there to hang out with him.
Anything wrong with that?

309
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,114
Was that right after you received
this photo of Park Wonseok's phone?

310
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,240
No.

311
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,867
That photo is a joke.

312
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,329
It could have been anyone's phone,
so I didn't pay much attention to it.

313
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,749
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

314
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,375
Then you must know where this is, right?

315
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,003
The park where you like
to play basketball.

316
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,758
The prime suspect in the Park Wonseok case

317
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:27,387
called Ok Chanmi
with Park Wonseok's cell phone

318
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,932
from this park that same night.

319
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,730
At the time, you and Seok Jaebum
were at this park.

320
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,196
Park Wonseok's cell phone
was hidden at the race track.

321
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,075
And fearing that someone
had discovered this phone,

322
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,951
you and Seok Jaebum rushed to the track.

323
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,288
Ji Sooheon, who was chasing
after the evidence, went to the track

324
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,749
and was hit over the head
with a shovel by you, Gi Osung,

325
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,125
then lost consciousness.

326
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,169
The next morning,

327
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,047
Seok Jaebum's car was found
by the river bed,

328
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,174
and he was reported missing.

329
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,968
Wow, that's quite a story you made up.

330
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,640
I have no idea what you're talking about.

331
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,851
Okay then.

332
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,481
If you choose to keep denying everything,
it won't be good for you in court.

333
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,234
In court?

334
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
At this point, Gi Osung

335
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,198
is probably pissed that he's being
investigated by the police.

336
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,451
Blinded by rage,

337
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,830
Gi Osung will probably head over
to Seok Jaebum's hideout.

338
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,126
We need to catch Seok Jaebum
before the police do.

339
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,257
By the way, do you really think
Kook Jihyun will help us out

340
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,008
by planting the GPS tracker for us?

341
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,970
I know she will.

342
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,555
But still,

343
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,181
they're siblings.

344
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,273
-What are you doing in my room?
-Where did you store my photos?

345
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,652
I have them on my phone, nowhere else.
And you know dad already took it away.

346
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,445
Don't you have an external hard drive
or something like that?

347
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,405
No, I'm telling the truth.

348
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,128
Hey, Sooheon, Chanmi.

349
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,631
Hey, you shouldn't run.
You have to look out for your baby.

350
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,882
It's fine.

351
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,509
By the way, that crazy bitch...

352
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,393
Have you heard anything
from that crazy girl, Soyeon?

353
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,519
Nothing yet.

354
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,147
She really must have gone crazy,
hasn't she? What happened to her?

355
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,025
-She just disappeared out of nowhere.
-When I catch that bitch Soyeon,

356
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,903
I'm going to pull out all her hair.

357
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
Crazy bitch...

358
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,040
Uh, hey!

359
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,417
Hey, Sooheon.

360
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,876
Hey, what's up?

361
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,023
EP1. BASE MAKEUP

362
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,649
HONG AJUNG
WHERE ARE YOU?

363
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,319
Crazy bitch.

364
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,029
HONG AJUNG
WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU?

365
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,032
VIDEO CALL FROM HONG AJUNG

366
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,249
Hey, Soyeon! What's with that uniform?

367
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,877
You're driving me crazy.
Are you working a part-time job somewhere?

368
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,837
I need to earn a living, don't I?

369
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,797
Screw that, where are you?

370
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,299
None of your business.

371
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,634
How have you been?

372
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,677
Oh, Chanmi!

373
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,845
Wow.

374
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,764
Well, I'm just relieved
to know you're alive.

375
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,390
Hey, hey, did anyone else die?

376
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,516
Seok Jaebum.

377
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,685
He went missing,
and things have been crazy over here.

378
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,854
Seok Jaebum went missing? How?

379
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,439
I don't know.

380
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,026
Words on the street
is that he killed Park Wonseok.

381
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,361
What? Seok Jaebum?

382
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,988
Are you telling me Seok Jaebum
is the culprit?

383
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,114
Don't you think we killed it today?

384
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,199
Yeah, 3 goals and all.

385
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,867
-Hey all three goals were...
-Hey, I'm hanging up now.

386
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,786
Don't tell anyone we video-chatted.

387
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,163
Hey, there's a reason
why I'm earning so much.

388
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,416
Come on, once you earn that much,
you just retire and...

389
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,270
He went missing,
and things have been crazy over here.

390
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,899
Words on the street
is that he killed Park Wonseok.

391
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,947
Gi Osung

392
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,908
hasn't budged since he got home.

393
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,457
When I saw your email
asking for that video

394
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,167
of Wonseok falling from the science lab,

395
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,044
I felt like a coward
for running away to the US.

396
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,923
Especially since this isn't over yet.

397
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,802
Seok Jaebum was the murderer.

398
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:27,682
Hold on.

399
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,685
It was Seok Jaebum and not Gi Osung?

400
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,728
Yeah.

401
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,982
I really want to ask Seok Jaebum
why he did it, but he's currently missing.

402
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,860
He literally disappeared.

403
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,826
Actually, I...

404
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,915
was dating Wonseok.

405
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,049
When Wonseok and I
were in the science lab,

406
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,676
we were unknowingly photographed.

407
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,935
It's going to be nice.

408
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,228
Ah, I'm so happy.

409
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:43,049
Gi Osung used that video against Wonseok
and that was when he started bullying him.

410
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,262
He toyed with Wonseok
and made him do bad things.

411
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,558
Gi Osung didn't even have
to get his hands dirty.

412
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,771
He made Wonseok
do all kinds of dirty work for him.

413
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,693
That's why the other students
didn't like Wonseok.

414
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,070
Seok Jaebum was the one

415
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,240
who tried to protect Wonseok
from Gi Osung.

416
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,577
I don't know what happened...

417
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,997
I'll uncover the truth.

418
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,882
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

419
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,137
Huh?

420
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,181
Detective Jin,
it was actually Seok Jaebum.

421
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,350
Seok Jaebum.

422
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,145
-Get a warrant for him right away.
-Yes, ma'am.

423
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,521
-Where are you going this late at night?
-Huh?

424
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,482
Uh...

425
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,275
To see Ajung.

426
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,986
Ajung asked me to come visit her
since she's feeling lonely.

427
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,905
It's about the baby.

428
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,657
Oh, yeah?

429
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,741
Yeah, I'm going to head out now.

430
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,244
Take this.

431
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,081
I'll have this on my way over there,
thanks.

432
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,124
Hey, I'm running late,
so I'm going to head out.

433
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,545
Chanmi.

434
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,218
Why did you kill him?

435
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,847
Why did you kill my brother?

436
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,520
-Chanmi.
-Stay right there!

437
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,771
Don't come near me.

438
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,732
Ok Chanmi!

439
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,400
I'm going to shoot
if you try anything stupid.

440
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,905
It's over now.

441
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
Tell me everything!

442
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,368
Why did you kill him?

443
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,954
How did you kill him? Hurry up and answer!

444
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,802
Don't you have a match today or something?

445
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,262
Watch it!

446
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,223
You can't disrespect me like that.
I'm older than you.

447
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,225
How about you win a gold medal this time

448
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,561
so you can hang it around
your older brother's neck?

449
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,771
I mean, of course.

450
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,231
Nothing will ever change the fact
that I'm your older brother.

451
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,321
Tomorrow I start winter vacation,
so I'll come down to Busan on Sunday.

452
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,198
I have something I need to tell you.

453
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,699
Uh...

454
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,159
I'll tell you when we meet.

455
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,078
Oh...

456
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,253
Hey, hold on a second.

457
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,470
Jaebum, were you released
from the hospital?

458
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,556
Are you feeling better now?

459
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,725
Ah, I'm so confused.
What's going on with you all of a sudden?

460
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,188
I'll get you back

461
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,941
for what you did to me.

462
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,317
Huh?

463
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,862
Get me back? What do you mean...

464
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,888
OK CHANMI

465
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,731
Have you been lying to me
since the day we met?

466
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,276
How could you bring yourself
to act all nice to me

467
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,652
and feign a kind expression
after you killed my brother?

468
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,862
No!

469
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,156
I didn't mean to! I didn't know.

470
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,116
I didn't realize what I had done.

471
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,410
I honestly didn't even remember

472
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,745
that I had pushed Park Wonseok
out the window.

473
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,166
It was only a few days ago
that I remembered everything again.

474
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,627
I remembered that it was all because
of the other person living inside of me.

475
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,464
I only remembered that I called you
from Park Wonseok's cell phone

476
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,966
just a few days ago.

477
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,302
I'm telling you the truth.

478
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,320
CALL
OK CHANMI

479
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,657
Hello?

480
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,993
Who are you?

481
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?

482
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,039
Hello?

483
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,415
OK CHANMI

484
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,429
So I heard that ringtone

485
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,390
because Gi Osung's cellphone
rang inside his bag?

486
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,978
That's why I incorrectly assumed
Gi Osung was the culprit.

487
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,355
When you were the real murderer.

488
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,733
Seok Jaebum.

489
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,362
Even if you have another person
inside of you, that's no excuse.

490
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,405
You're right.

491
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,912
-Chanmi, can you just kill me?
-Don't move!

492
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,833
-Give me the gun.
-I said don't move!

493
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,998
Seok Jaebum.

494
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,083
No.

495
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,418
You're Seok Jaejun, aren't you?

496
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,919
Seok Jaejun...

497
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
Stop saying my name.

498
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,048
How dare you call me by my name

499
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,299
when you don't even know
anything about me?

500
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,508
Seok Jaejun.

501
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,011
Why do you act like you're a living person
when you're actually dead?

502
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,264
Why did you enter Seok Jaebum's body
and do all these evil things?

503
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,642
Shut up!

504
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,728
You don't think I'll kill you?

505
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,566
Please set Seok Jaebum free.

506
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,695
We're the same person.

507
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,156
I'm Seok Jaebum,

508
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,533
and Seok Jaebum is me.

509
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,826
No.

510
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,747
Seok Jaebum isn't a demon like you are.

511
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,123
A demon?

512
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,211
Yeah, I'm a demon.

513
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,130
Why do you think I've become a demon?

514
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,216
Who do you think made me this way?

515
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,520
You.

516
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,314
What are you doing in my room?

517
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,774
Who are you going to see the game with?

518
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,444
I asked you who you're going to go with.

519
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,364
Ji Sooheon.

520
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm late. I have to go.

521
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,624
Fine, I'll get lost.

522
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,507
Jaebum, try and consider my feelings too.

523
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,436
What's this?

524
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,317
ADMISSION STUDY CAFÉ
ENTRANCE RECEIPT

525
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,873
The number
you have dialed is unavailable...

526
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,375
JI SOOHEON

527
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,466
GOGO STADIUM

528
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
Because Ji Sooheon
wasn't answering his phone

529
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,845
and seemed to be ditching him
for someone else,

530
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,098
Seok Jaebum got mad.

531
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,320
Sooheon!

532
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,990
Taxi!

533
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,453
On that night...

534
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
Seok Jaebum
shouldn't have followed Ji Sooheon.

535
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,791
It was Seok Jaebum's fault. Do you get it?

536
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,069
Excuse me.

537
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,531
Are you okay?

538
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,081
I know you.

539
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,999
You're Seok Jaebum, right?

540
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,210
You went to Chungwoo Middle school.
The billionaire, Seok Jaebum!

541
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,419
It wasn't me that did this to you!

542
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,505
-Did you do this to me?
-I'm telling you, it honestly wasn't me.

543
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,340
-Seok Jaebum, You son of a bitch!
-I didn't do it...

544
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,925
-You're fucking done!
-I didn't do it...

545
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,843
Do you really think you'll get away
with this? Come back here!

546
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,597
Please, please, it wasn't me.

547
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,558
-Please! I didn't do it.
-Seok Jaebum! You bastard!

548
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,395
Seok Jaebum, you bastard.
Seok Jaebum, you fucking bastard!

549
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,730
Seok Jaebum, get over here! Fuck, fuck!

550
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,731
I told you I didn't do it, shit!

551
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,150
Come here! You motherfucker!

552
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,443
Hey, you son of, son of a bitch...

553
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,487
I told you it wasn't me!
It wasn't me! Shit!

554
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,701
Listen to me when I tell you it wasn't me.

555
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,910
Huh?

556
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,788
You're pissing me off, shit.

557
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,595
What was I supposed to do?

558
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,513
Ju Hyeokgeon had already seen
Seok Jaebum's face.

559
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,891
Seok Jaebum would never reveal
that Ji Sooheon was the culprit.

560
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,018
So he just made sure
to keep Ju Hyeokgeon's mouth shut.

561
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,229
I did it because of Seok Jaebum.

562
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,232
We're one.

563
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,318
It was Seok Jaebum's fault.

564
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,070
Park Wonseok and Ju Hyeokgeon...

565
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,406
Seok Jaebum and I
killed both of them together.

566
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,033
Stop making up excuses like a coward!

567
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,328
Seok Jaejun,
you were responsible for all of it.

568
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,080
Seok Jaebum is not that kind of person.

569
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,831
Seok Jaebum is a good guy.

570
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,669
I trust Seok Jaebum.

571
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,296
I trust that there's good inside of him.

572
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,424
Are you...

573
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,304
saying you trust Seok Jaebum,

574
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,932
even though we killed your brother?

575
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,025
Please let Seok Jaebum go.

576
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,698
I'm devastated to have lost my brother.
I feel so empty inside.

577
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,619
But nothing can bring him back.

578
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
You're stuck on something
that can't be reversed.

579
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,334
You left this world a long time ago.

580
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,420
There's nothing you can do
about things that have already happened.

581
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,339
Leave Seok Jaebum's body.

582
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,677
That's the only thing you can do
for your brother.

583
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,169
Chanmi.

584
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,255
I'm sorry.

585
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,383
The police couldn't do anything for you.

586
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,301
It's fine.

587
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,930
Get in.

588
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,971
OK CHANMI

589
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,517
I found Seok Jaebum.
He confessed everything.

590
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,062
Detective Jin Sojung took him with her.

591
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,897
Don't worry, I'll be on my way.

592
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,072
-Uh!
-What's up?

593
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,698
Ugh, looks like we're not going to
have study hall instead of PE today.

594
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
Class 3 and 4 will be together.
Let's go play basketball.

595
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,202
Change into your gym clothes, quick.

596
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,120
-I'll be there soon.
-Okay.

597
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,043
I have something to discuss
with you about Gi Osung.

598
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,379
Come to the rooftop. Now.

599
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,471
RESTRICTED AREA
DO NOT ENTER

600
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,263
What are you doing?

601
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,974
How dare you use a tracker to find me?

602
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,645
And you. How could you betray me?

603
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,107
Kook Jihyun didn't do anything wrong.
Let her go.

604
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,694
I forced her to do it. I'm sorry.

605
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,155
Please, let her go.

606
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,200
Kook Jihyun, I'll take care of you
after I'm finished with Ji Sooheon.

607
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,537
Wait here.

608
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,164
Kneel.

609
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,292
I told you to kneel! You fucker!

610
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,209
Okay.

611
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,544
I'll kneel.

612
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,634
You owe me an apology.

613
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,764
Bow your head!

614
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,975
Bow your head!

615
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,145
I'm sorry.

616
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,189
Please let her go.

617
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:16,948
You, motherfucker!

618
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,909
How's this, eh?

619
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,453
How do you fucking like that?
You fucking son of a bitch!

620
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,247
Son of a bitch!

621
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,991
Hey, what's going on?

622
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,619
-How do I win this?
-Hey!

623
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,996
Shit, they're calling for us.

624
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,957
I guess we should run over there.

625
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,377
Die, you son of a bitch!

626
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,882
Fuck!

627
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,645
-What's that... up there? Shit.
-Huh, what's that?

628
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,105
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Oh, no. What do we do?

629
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,940
-Ji Sooheon? What the hell?
-What the hell? What? What?

630
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,442
-Is he dead?
-Hey, move aside.

631
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,820
-Isn't that Gi Osung?
-It's him.

632
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,741
-It really is Gi Osung.
-It's Gi Osung.

633
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,827
-What do we do?
-I guess he went over the edge.

634
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,371
Call, call the police, hurry!

635
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,081
What are you doing? Call them!

636
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,584
-What is it?
-What is it?

637
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,673
-Ji Sooheon?
-Was it Ji Sooheon?

638
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,341
It couldn't be. He's such a nice guy.

639
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,384
-Isn't that Ji Sooheon?
-It's him.

640
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,052
-This is terrible.
-It was Ji Sooheon?

641
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,512
Ji, Ji, Ji...

642
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,014
Ji Sooheon did it?

643
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,687
-I can't believe this.
-Seriously?

644
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,405
We need to call the police now.

645
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,865
Ah, my eyes.

646
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,534
Is he alive?

647
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,411
I didn't bring my cell phone.

648
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:34,461
119 EMERGENCY
AMBULANCE

649
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,637
Is he really dead?

650
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,722
Oh, my goodness,
I don't think he's breathing.

651
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,848
Seriously.

652
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,000
Stop standing around,
and go back to your classroom.

653
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:14,960
Go back now!

654
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,461
Go back to your classrooms now!

655
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,838
Stop taking pictures.
Go back to your classrooms now!

656
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,507
Go back now!

657
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,050
It was Ji Sooheon on the roof, right?

658
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,426
Did Ji Sooheon push him?

659
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,428
Does that mean Ji Sooheon
will get arrested?

660
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,066
Why else would he have been up there?

661
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,651
What other reason would there be?

662
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,403
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

663
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,696
Did you get the message?

664
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,155
It's spreading quickly.

665
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,156
-What message?
-What? What is it?

666
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,491
-Here.
-I just got it. I got it too.

667
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,575
-Oh, yeah, me too.
-What's this?

668
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,453
Please forward this to people around you.

669
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,914
Please forward this
to people around you.

670
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,915
What's this? Amazing!

671
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,041
I'm Min Seonha,

672
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,879
Ji Sooheon was the hero
who punished that rapist Sa Junggyeong.

673
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,090
Please root for Ji Sooheon.

674
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,718
-Oh, my god! Was Ji Sooheon the hero?
-Dang!

675
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,052
Ji Sooheon?

676
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,095
Amazing.

677
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,806
Then why were Gi Osung and Ji Sooheon
fighting each other on the rooftop?

678
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,058
Maybe that wasn't a fight.
Maybe it was punishment?

679
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,351
Oh, that sounds right.
That sounds about right.

680
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,602
-Wow, Ji Sooheon.
-He was punishing him.

681
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,522
-Wow, he's so cool.
-That was punishment.

682
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,816
He's a total hero, right?

683
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,234
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

684
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,696
Apparently, Gi Osung threatened
Kook Jihyun with a knife on the rooftop.

685
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,031
-Huh?
-What?

686
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,574
Aren't they siblings?

687
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,660
-Where's the decency?
-It's unbelievable.

688
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,579
I just got goosebumps.

689
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,706
Gi Osung's the ultimate villain.

690
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,833
I heard the only reason Park Wonseok
did all that shit was

691
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,252
because Gi Osung was blackmailing him.

692
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,170
Seriously?

693
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,713
That’s ridiculous, seriously.

694
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,797
I remember Gi Osung
treating him like trash.

695
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

696
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,967
The police
have arrested Park Wonseok's murderer.

697
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,677
-The culprit was Seok Jaebum.
-Seok Jaebum?

698
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,720
-Yeah.
-What?

699
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,972
-Why would he do that?
-Did Seok Jaebum do that?

700
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,058
You know, when Seok Jaebum
lost his memory, Gi Osung gaslighted him,

701
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,393
and that's why he killed Park Wonseok.

702
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,228
So Gi Osung killed him, basically.

703
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,022
-Ugh, how cruel.
-Wow, is he out of his mind?

704
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,441
I also heard Gi Osung
had pushed Seok Jaebum off the rooftop

705
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,777
to kill him, and that was
how Seok Jaebum lost his memory.

706
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,111
-Really?
-Yeah.

707
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,365
Wow, seriously?
Gi Osung's a real piece of shit.

708
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,325
Yeah, he's a real psychopath. Huh?

709
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,369
He deserved it then. He deserved it.

710
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,371
I knew that's the kind of person he was.

711
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,288
I agree.

712
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,124
DO NOT ENTER-POLICE LINE-
UNDER INVESTIGATION

713
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,025
Let's go.

714
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,501
Was Gi Osung fighting
with anyone on the rooftop?

715
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,756
No, I don't think so.

716
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,051
It looked like he jumped by himself.

717
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,678
Was there anyone else there?

718
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,639
I didn't see anyone
but Gi Osung on the rooftop.

719
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,599
Gi Osung was the only one there.

720
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,851
He was alone up there?

721
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,520
I could see only Gi Osung up there.

722
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:25,733
Yeah, I think Kook Jihyun
was the only other person there.

723
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,861
Right, I think Gi Osung
was the only one there.

724
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,614
It seemed like Gi Osung was fighting
with someone up on the rooftop.

725
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,657
-No, he wasn't.
-No, he wasn't.

726
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,616
-No, he wasn't.
-I have no idea.

727
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,742
-I don't know.
-No idea.

728
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,994
-I didn't see it.
-He was alone up there.

729
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,120
I didn't see it.

730
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,746
I didn't see anyone else up there.

731
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,040
-You were close to Gi Osung, right?
-Yes.

732
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,668
Do you know
who Gi Osung went to see on the rooftop?

733
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,794
I'm not sure.

734
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,713
I didn't see anyone else
but Osung up there.

735
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,424
Yeah, it was just Osung.

736
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,634
Ah...

737
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,219
Is that so?

738
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,597
Um.

739
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,313
Here's something warm to drink.

740
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,617
Gi Osung suddenly lost his temper
and told me he was going to kill me.

741
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,537
Then he

742
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,999
jumped from the rooftop.

743
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,045
So he wasn't fighting anyone?

744
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,634
There was...

745
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,262
no one else up there.

746
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,610
So far, it doesn't seem
like it was a murder.

747
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,118
If everyone decides
to corroborate a lie...

748
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,122
...then it becomes the truth.

749
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,993
YONGTAN HIGH

750
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,919
Summer vacation ended.

751
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,255
Your haircut came out great.

752
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,841
And we took our graduation photos.

753
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,301
Hey, Jihyun, hurry up.

754
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,510
-Hurry!
-Come on, what's wrong with you?

755
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,053
How pretty.

756
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,263
For memories' sake.

757
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,098
-Do I need to do this?
-What's wrong?

758
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,517
Hey, Snow White,
in the middle, put a smile on.

759
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,603
One, two, three!

760
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,188
All right, perfect.

761
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,066
I'm taking it. One, two, three!

762
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,738
Now, look here. One, two, three!

763
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,157
That was good. Well done, everybody.

764
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,491
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

765
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,784
Okay, here we go.

766
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,037
One, two, three!

767
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,790
One, two, three!

768
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,543
-Did you get the shot?
-Yes, it came out great.

769
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,712
I thought about the people

770
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,006
who couldn't be there
to take graduation photos with us.

771
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,174
Let's take one without it.

772
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,759
-Chanmi.
-Let's take one together.

773
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,885
-Come on!
-Hey, Chanmi.

774
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:39,969
Hurry up. Get in here!

775
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,763
-One, two, three!
-One second.

776
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,098
-Great, that was a nice shot.
-Wait, wait.

777
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,351
-Hey, let's all take one together.
-Everyone together!

778
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,727
-One with everyone!
-Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

779
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,396
To the back, back, back.

780
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,773
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

781
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,483
-A silly one.
-Okay.

782
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,652
Here we go. One, two, three!

783
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,780
Jump! One, two, three!

784
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:05,870
Sooheon didn't take
a graduation photo.

785
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,890
He left school.

786
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,727
He said he wanted to enjoy himself more.

787
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,229
Sooheon!

788
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,149
-Bye, Sooheon!
-So long, Sooheon!

789
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,986
Don't get yourself in trouble.

790
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,700
Make sure you eat well!

791
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,619
You know we love you, right?
Stay healthy. Don't get sick!

792
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,288
You know we love you, right?

793
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,916
So long!

794
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,626
He's so cool.

795
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,529
And I was accepted
into the marine corps

796
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,698
