622
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,822
I've been having these dreams.

623
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,493
Mostly at night
but sometimes during the day.

624
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,748
But they don't really feel
like dreams. They...

625
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,667
They feel real.

626
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,756
What happens in the dream?

627
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,676
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

628
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,183
And he kills me.
