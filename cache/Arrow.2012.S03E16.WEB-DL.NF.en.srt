You're punishing my love for her.

At least do me the courtesy of admitting it,
you never approved.

I never approved of you allowing
weakness into your life.

Got out of Iron Heights two months ago.

-He escaped?
-No, released.

Turns out he was serving his sentence
based on a coerced confession.

Cops beat it out of him.

I might sew my mouth shut too.

He's not innocent anymore.
What was he after tonight?

329
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,050
His crew made off with a couple crates,
all containing these.

330
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,593
Industrial-grade diamonds.

331
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,637
The shipment was loaded
with high-end jewels they didn't take.

Why steal worthless diamonds?

-Million-dollar question.
-Street value's only a couple thousand.

We could use Felicity on this, Oliver.

I know a couple of fences
from my less socially-responsible days.

I could talk to them, find out where
Amar's trying to move these diamonds.

You wanna tell me what's going on now?

340
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,177
Ra's predicted this.

341
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,723
He said that the city would turn against me,
and I would die alone.

Then we come back and the first thing
that happens is, Lance is shutting me out...

It's like he looked into my future.

with your head.

Question is, why are you letting him?

347

He wants me to take his place
in the League of Assassins.

348

It's why he let us go.

As a sign of good faith.

350
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,878
Is there even a world
where he can imagine you saying yes?

351
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,090
He said that I can do more as the new Ra's
than I could ever do...

352
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,343
...as Oliver Queen or the Arrow.

That I would have unlimited resources.

That I could make a difference,
not just a dent.

You're not really considering this?

356
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,940
Just because Captain Lance is angry,
and Felicity is momentarily unavailable.

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,900
It's more than that.
