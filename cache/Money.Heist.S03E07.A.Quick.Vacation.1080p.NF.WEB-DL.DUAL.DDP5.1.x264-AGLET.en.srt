1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,833
- Rise and shine, baby.
- Good morning, my queen.

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,833
- Wanna fuck?
- Sure, of course I do. First, come look.

3
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,500
Look.

4
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,250
They're Brazilians. Hasn't it been a while
since we've seen Brazilians?

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,083
I think the last people we saw
were from Puerto Rico or Guyana.

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,500
No idea.

7
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,291
They seem nice, no?

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,208
CIA, FBI,

9
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,041
Interpol… they've all got agents
that seem nice too.

10
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,083
Come on. They're tourists.
Take one look and you can tell.

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,208
My love.

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,333
We need to get a social life.

13
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,166
I'm being serious.
Couples have a social life.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,416
They go out, see friends, go to dinner.

15
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,291
They don't hang out all day with the Kuna,
laying on the beach.

16
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,375
- No.
- "No" what?

17
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,291
No way.

18
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,958
Please, come on.

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,375
Absolutely not.

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,833
Tokyo, look, it's not safe.

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,916
Hey!

22
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,416
Hey!

23
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,708
Hello, <i>mis amigos</i>!

24
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:55,458
<i>Rio! Rio! Rio!</i>

25
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>Rio! Rio! Rio!</i>

26
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,250
<i>Rio! Rio! Rio!</i>

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>Rio! Rio! Rio!</i>

28
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,791
<i>Rio! Rio! Rio!</i>

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
DAY THREE

30
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:31,208
<i>Aníbal Cortés is here,</i>
<i>walking</i> <i>towards the Bank of Spain.</i>

31
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:37,125
<i>The police are handing over one</i>
<i>of the most wanted fugitives in the world.</i>

32
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>It's only been 44 hours</i>
<i>since the heist began</i>

33
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,750
<i>and the police are already giving in.</i>

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>They're handing over Cortés,</i>
<i>the man who was allegedly tortured.</i>

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,833
<i>The Professor's gang is reunited.</i>

36
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,541
<i>Rio is at the entrance</i>
<i>of the bank.</i>

37
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,791
<i>Now it's your turn.</i>

38
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,833
Doors.

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,875
Helsinki,

40
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,416
<i>all clear.</i>

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,708
Advance!

42
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,375
{\an8}HOSTAGE SWAP AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

43
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,250
{\an8}You look so handsome!

44
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,250
{\an8}Look at you, tie and everything!

45
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,083
{\an8}It was the only nice thing
the police did for me.

46
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,500
I can imagine.

47
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,500
<i>You look beautiful</i>
<i>in that red jumpsuit.</i>

48
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,666
<i>How are you?</i>

49
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,458
- <i>Better now.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,416
{\an8}What the fuck are you doing
in the Bank of Spain?

51
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,833
{\an8}We came to rescue you.

52
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,958
{\an8}It's over now, son.
You're back home, my friends!

53
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,958
{\an8}All of Spain is standing with you!

54
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,708
{\an8}Look at this bravery! So much bravery!

55
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,291
{\an8}Don't worry. You're with me now.
You're all with me.

56
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,000
{\an8}Let's see what Suárez has to say.

57
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,583
{\an8}Where is he? Suárez!

58
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,750
{\an8}- Get me back there!
- Calm down.

59
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,875
{\an8}I need more men! Explosives!
We were this close! I'm gonna kill them!

60
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,125
{\an8}- Can we calm down, please?
- Tamayo!

61
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,916
{\an8}Isn't this your little friend?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,375
{\an8}That's Arturo Román. The former director
of the Royal Mint of Spain.

63
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,458
{\an8}Shut the doors!

64
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,416
{\an8}That motherfucker!

65
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,291
Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm unarmed.

66
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,708
I'm Arturo Román.

67
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,375
Arturito?

{\an8}Hey, you're Arturo Román, yeah?

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,375
{\an8}Obviously.

81
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,208
{\an8}I… I read your book.

82
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,125
{\an8}Fucking psychos!

83
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,375
{\an8}You could be out there,
living the good life.

84
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,625
{\an8}Instead, you're here,
in the fucking lion's den.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,291
{\an8}Have you seen that shit outside?

86
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,875
{\an8}Shut up and come hug your Helsi!

87
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,958
You may be completely fucking nuts, Helsi,
but you're a big softy.

88
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,416
Hey!

89
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,625
- What should I call you, Mónica?
- No, Stockholm.

90
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,416
Looking great. Brother!

91
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,125
How high did you have to be
to end up here?

92
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,208
The life of a millionaire
is boring anyway.

93
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,291
Thank you, man.

94
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,333
The fact that you're here, after all
you've lost, is fucking incredible.

95
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,500
NAIROBI: Oh, my baby!

96
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,875
- My little baby! I could eat your face.
- What's up gorgeous?

97
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,125
I feel like I gave birth to you myself.

98
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,583
You're all fucking amazing.

99
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,875
Yeah, we're fucking amazing.

100
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,583
But the real rock star here
is your girlfriend, the ugly one.

101
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,083
- If it wasn't for her…
- Okay.

102
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,291
You'll have to excuse me,
but now… it's my turn.

103
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,666
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

104
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,208
How are your men?

105
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Positive for halothane.

106
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,750
But there are no traces
of anything else. We're all fine.

107
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,833
Glad to hear. They won this battle,
but not the war.

108
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,958
So chins up, for fuck's sake!

109
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,041
And one more thing.

110
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,125
This operation never happened.

111
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,125
- Understand?
- Are you serious?

112
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,083
That kind of command isn't even worthy
of a unit in Burkina Faso.

113
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,333
How about a bit of respect?

114
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,250
This won't go any further than it has.

115
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,916
No victims, we rescued 40 hostages,

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,708
so let's try to be positive
and just keep moving forward.

117
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,833
Yeah, I'm being positive.
Look at this. I'm super positive.

118
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,416
The problem is we never learn our lesson.

119
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,875
This guy's the Einstein of heists,

120
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,083
so we decide to send agents in
through the toilets.

121
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,291
Everything we've done
was strictly necessary.

122
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
What did the Navy Seals do
when they hunted down Bin Laden?

123
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,041
The Russians in the Dubrovnik?
What they had to.

124
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,875
Exactly, we're following the manual.

125
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,541
How long did it take us
to make this decision?

126
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,916
Twenty minutes?

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Because this guy has been thinking
of the answers for years.

128
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,625
Every move we've made so far,
he's had a response ready.

129
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,208
These types of operations
always have the risks. Always.

130
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,666
Unless you care to enlighten us
with a proposal that doesn't have any.

131
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,416
Not one,

132
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,083
no less the three.

133
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,583
Antoñanzas, donuts.

134
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,458
Mónica.

135
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,708
- You look beautiful.
- I'm Stockholm.

136
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,625
Sit there.

137
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,375
Lift up your shirt.

138
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,333
Put your arms up.

139
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,541
Why are you here?
You could have been hurt.

140
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,500
I don't care.

141
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,833
Life hasn't meant shit to me
since I lost everything.

142
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,500
Laura left me and took the kids away.

143
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,166
I live in an apartment
with the kitchen inside the closet.

144
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,250
I have cans of tuna for dinner.

145
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,708
And all my stuff is still in boxes
in the hallway, but…

146
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,541
Well, I'm still trying.

147
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,708
Bit by bit, Arturo.

148
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,000
Listen, I was terrible of both of you

149
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,208
I'll admit that.

150
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,291
Believe me, Laura's on my mind, but…

151
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,250
But I always think about you.

152
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,958
I can't stop thinking about you.

153
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,791
About you and our son.

154
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,583
The kid's a boy, right?

155
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,166
Yes, he's a boy. Put this on.

156
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,625
I know I fucked up, Mónica.

157
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,833
But I don't wanna lose my son.

158
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,625
You lost him the moment
you said you weren't his father.

159
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,583
Put on the jumpsuit, please.

160
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,458
What did you expect?

161
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,083
Think about how fucked up it is
to tell a married guy with three kids,

162
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,125
"Look at this pregnancy test.
This kid is yours." I was terrified.

163
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
Yeah, I was fucking scared to death but…

164
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,125
Who wouldn't be scared by that?

165
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,041
But it was only three minutes.

166
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,458
Three minutes of complete insanity
right after those terrorists came in

167
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,458
and started shooting up the whole place.

168
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,416
Please, don't judge me
for those three minutes.

169
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,833
And I know I have no right
to just show up out of nowhere…

170
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,333
ask you to let me be
the father of our son.

171
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,166
I know.

172
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,875
But I'd like to see him, that's all.

173
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,583
Just to hug him, you know?
See what he's like.

174
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,291
I don't care where he is.

175
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,375
I'd go all the way to Brazil,
Romania, Burma, Thailand… wherever!

176
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,458
He's my son and I just wanna meet him.

177
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,625
Please.

178
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,041
Even if you deserve that,
I don't know if I'll be able to.

179
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,250
I'll try, all right?

180
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,833
Thank you.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,916
Thank you.

182
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,791
Some things never change, huh?

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,041
Look.

184
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,666
What?

185
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,875
Look at me, look at this.

186
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,458
- God, Arturo.
- Look. Come here.

187
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,583
I know you still think about me.
About how we fucked on my desk.

188
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,916
I know you still want it.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
I know you still want it.

190
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,458
I know you want it.

191
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,750
Touch me again and you're a dead man.

192
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,666
You're disgusting, Arturo!

193
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,791
You disgust me.

194
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,625
I disgust you? I disgust you?

195
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,291
Shoot me!

196
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,375
Shoot me right here.

197
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,291
If you don't, this will be
the only face our kid ever sees.

198
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,166
They'll put you away with Denver
and you'll never see the light of day.

199
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,875
Arturito Junior will never know
who his mother was.

200
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,625
He'll call <i>me </i>Papa! Me!

201
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,000
His real father!
That's why I came here, you understand?

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,250
My son is called Cincinnati.

203
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,583
And you'll never meet him
in your fucking life!

204
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,875
Helsinki, finish this.

205
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,333
Arturito.

206
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,333
Relax.

207
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,250
You remember… men look after men.

208
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,916
Let's go. Take off your clothes.

209
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,375
<i>♪ I want you ♪</i>

210
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,916
<i>♪ Oh, and I want you ♪</i>

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,875
<i>♪ But that's all the reason for me</i>
<i>For me, for I want you ♪</i>

212
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,125
<i>♪ Oh, I want you ♪</i>

213
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,041
<i>Those were the happiest moments</i>
<i>of the heist.</i>

214
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,541
<i>And it may have been</i>
<i>the happiest moments in my life.</i>

215
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
<i>But happiness is like lightning.</i>

216
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,791
<i>Blink and you'll miss it.</i>

217
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,375
<i>After that came the fall.</i>

218
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,166
<i>When you reach heaven,</i>
<i>the fall is devastating.</i>

219
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,458
<i>We were all rushing</i>
<i>towards the edge of the abyss,</i>

220
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,708
<i>even the Professor.</i>

221
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,000
Point number one, we're making
the very same mistake

222
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,041
we've made with the last heist
by choosing to go after the Professor.

223
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,916
He's a professional card sharp.

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We need to change our strategy and focus
on the only thing we know that's inside.

225
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,625
The gold.

226
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,041
If we find out
how they plan to get it out,

227
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,291
they'll only be able
to negotiate one thing.

228
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,833
Their surrender. That's why
we'll interrogate all hostages.

229
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,708
No one is going home.
I wanna know if they're working.

230
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,625
How they're working. How many?

231
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,125
When? And finally…

232
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,416
Who is this? These two?

233
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,666
Because these new guys, right here,

234
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,791
are the key to the plan.

235
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,458
And most importantly, the compensation.

236
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,708
Shit, these guys
are handing out cash and what?

237
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,416
The state isn't offering anything?

238
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,791
I want to offer the biggest reward
in Western history.

239
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,583
Tamayo, how much do you think
a snitch would cost us?

240
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,250
- I don't know. Three million euros?
- Any higher bidders?

241
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,333
- Three and a half million.
- The auction's open!

242
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,958
Martínez.

243
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,916
- Four million?
- Four million.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
- Five million!
- Shit, that's great! Antoñanzas?

245
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,041
Six million.

246
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,875
Suárez, you have a counteroffer?

247
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Six million going once, going twice…

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,875
Eight!

249
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,541
Eight. Get paid and get laid.

250
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,125
If we round up,
we're talking ten million euros.

251
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,791
And for that kind of reward

252
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,791
any Spaniard would sell their own mother.

253
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,958
- Ángel, give me some good news.
- <i>We've got something.</i>

254
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,333
- <i>Somebody saw them.</i>
- Great!

255
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,166
A Civil Guard here raised the alarm.

256
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,708
We've narrowed down our search area
and the radio signal suggests movement.

257
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,791
They're close by.

258
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,291
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- In Aracena, Huelva.

259
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,708
In some kind of warehouse.

260
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,291
There's an RV. They were here, Colonel.

261
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,125
Looks like they left it in a hurry.

262
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,000
- Do you think this could be a trap?
- <i>I don't think so.</i>

263
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,041
I'm going in.

264
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,916
There's no one here.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

265
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,500
Shit.

266
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,083
Shit, Colonel. This is some kind of
command center of something.

267
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,041
There are screens
and radio equipment everywhere.

268
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,333
I need the forensic in here now.

269
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,083
They had an accident yesterday
and some farmers helped them.

270
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,041
They've confirmed their identity, Colonel.

271
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,458
Great work, Ángel.

272
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,083
You got the army, the police
and whatever you need at your disposal.

273
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,291
Let's start the hunt.

274
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,208
I got you, fucker. I got you.

275
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,916
Colonel, give me a helicopter.
I'll be in charge of the hunt.

276
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Let's go.

277
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,916
Inspector, they're talking
to the Professor.

278
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,625
<i>Rio, I need you to answer</i>
<i>as precisely as possible.</i>

279
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,958
<i>Where did they keep you?</i>

280
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,500
In a cell.

281
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,041
Very small.

282
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,875
Like a coffin. I couldn't sit.

283
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,750
<i>I would stand the entire time.</i>

284
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,541
- How many days?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

285
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,708
I lost track at the fourth or fifth day.

286
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,458
There wasn't any natural light.

287
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,208
Rio, can you continue?

288
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,333
Yeah.

289
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>What did they feed you?</i>

290
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,791
<i>Some sort of lumpy mush.</i>

291
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,875
<i>Maybe made from flour. And coffee.</i>

292
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,666
<i>Lots of coffee.</i>

293
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,500
Thirty, forty, fifty coffees a day.

294
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,291
I was amped.

295
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,458
They deprived you of sleep.

296
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,166
Do you think that the coffee
had any other substance in it?

297
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
It's possible.

298
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,250
It tasted like shit.

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,375
Either way, I was drugged.

300
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,291
<i>When they interrogated me,</i>
<i>they</i> <i>made me inhale this gas.</i>

301
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,750
<i>I don't know what the fuck it was.</i>

302
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,583
When that happened,
at least I could leave the cell.

303
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,083
Sometimes I could even sit down.

304
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,416
Apart from when
they were interrogating you,

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,916
did they ever let you out for…
for anything?

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,041
Not even to shit.

307
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,375
They left me

308
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,208
<i>covered in shit and piss for hours.</i>

309
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,666
<i>Days.</i>

310
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,333
<i>I don't know.</i>

311
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,708
<i>Did they ever</i>
<i>let you wash yourself?</i>

312
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,750
The most they've ever did
was spray me with a hose.

313
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,250
And what was like, Rio?

314
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,375
First, they would hang me naked,
in chains.

315
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,625
Then, they'd aim the pressure hose at me.

316
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,375
"If you want this all to end,

317
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,916
just tell us where the Professor is."

318
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
<i>Alicia kept saying that.</i>

319
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,333
I swear to God, Professor…

320
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,833
<i>if I'd known where the fuck you were</i>

321
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,000
I would have said it.

322
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,833
<i>Anyone would have.</i>

323
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,875
Anyone would have.

324
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,625
<i>You were afraid for your life, right?</i>

325
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,916
I knew we weren't in Spain.

326
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,750
When the wind changed direction,

327
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,708
<i>I could hear the call to prayer</i>
<i>from a mosque.</i>

328
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,958
And I was completely convinced…

329
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,291
that they were gonna shoot me
and bury me in the desert.

330
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,250
Every day…

331
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,750
I'd wake up wondering if it was my last.

332
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,375
It's all over now, Rio.

333
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,708
Listen, I need you to tell me

334
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,875
exactly what happened
when they took you out of there.

335
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,000
They put me on a plane.

336
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,083
When we landed, they put me in a car

337
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,583
and they took me to a military hospital.

338
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,125
So… so how was last night?

339
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,083
The best sleep I've ever had.

340
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,250
They gave me some powerful shit

341
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,958
and I didn't open my eyes
until this morning,

342
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,625
when I was woken up by Alicia.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,875
So, what now?

344
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,541
Where's my red jumpsuit?

345
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,958
If they hand over Rio, they'll probably
have implanted a microphone.

346
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,791
So if it's suspicious, the code phrase
will then be "small vacation."

347
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,958
<i>Rest a bit more.</i>

348
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,208
Someone prepare him a hot bath.

349
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,666
You've earned a small vacation.

350
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,166
A GPS beacon in a dental implant.

351
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,750
A mic hidden in the intramuscular
tissue of his skull, anywhere.

352
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,208
And whatever the cavity,

353
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,666
we'll teach you how to remove it.

354
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,583
Any volunteers?

355
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,125
I… I won't do it.

356
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,375
Is the shy guy afraid
of the little scalpel?

357
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,500
No. I have my principles.

358
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,541
It's just that I'm against
the suffering of animals.

359
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:08,458
But you're a soldier. You kill people.
What's the problem? I don't get it.

360
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,083
People are one thing,
animals are something else.

361
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,375
And I love animals.

362
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,291
An assassin and animal lover.

363
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,583
Can I believe whatever I want or
are you gonna tell me what to believe in?

364
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,333
You mean with loving animals?

365
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,333
That's it.

366
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,375
Oh, yes.

367
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,500
This is what I have to say.

368
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,833
If you truly love that pig,
you'll open it and take out the chip.

369
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,416
And with all the love in the world,
you'll eat it.

370
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
I won't cut the pig.

371
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,333
I can do the same with a dummy.

372
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,291
No. There's no dummy
because we need it to be real.

373
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:49,333
This is the best we can get
for simulating human tissue.

374
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,458
I was in the war.

375
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,125
With a dog, right here, next to me.

376
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,708
The whole time, with me.

377
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,875
People ran away,
but the dog stayed with me.

378
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,291
From then on, I promised.

379
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,416
I won't cut the pig.

380
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,791
Cut open the fucking pig!
You're a hit man.

381
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:11,875
Hey, hey, hey!

382
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,208
Back off!

383
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:17,791
You push me again and the tissue I'll cut
will be yours entirely.

384
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,083
From top to bottom.

385
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,666
Marseille. The scalpel.

386
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,750
- Both of you leave the room.
- Me?

387
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,750
It was his fault. He wouldn't cut the pig.

388
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,666
Get out.

389
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,416
- I can go but if I do--
- Right now.

390
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,875
Fine.

391
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,791
Okay then.

392
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,750
Okay, continuing from there.

393
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,458
I don't care who, but you have 15 minutes
to locate the chip and start surgery.

394
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,416
Tokyo, until we operate on Rio,
it's important that you behave normally.

395
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,041
And robbing the Bank of Spain,
is that normal?

396
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,208
<i>They can't suspect we know.</i>

397
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:57,166
You need to speak with Rio
the way you always do. Act naturally.

398
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,083
Talk about what you missed
about each other.

399
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,166
Do what you logically do.

400
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,333
Are you suggesting that we have sex?

401
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,625
Because Rio needs to be hugged.

402
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,583
Not fucked.

403
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:16,416
The police know you're together
and haven't seen each other in two months.

404
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,791
<i>They need to think they have access</i>
<i>to your intimate moments, that way,</i>

405
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,291
<i>they won't suspect anything.</i>

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,833
<i>Tokyo.</i>

407
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,333
Tokyo.

408
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,208
They'll do what they have to do.

409
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,375
Seriously? Seriously,
all of this is necessary?

410
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:06,125
They had this poor kid two months
without sleep, stuck in a hole,

411
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,666
shitting and pissing himself,

412
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,000
thinking he was on fucking death row
and you use him like that?

413
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,541
This is the moment for us
to capture a piece that's fundamental.

414
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,291
Fundamental for winning this war.

415
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,750
To get control
of the microphone and trackers

416
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,208
they could have put in his body.

417
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,541
If they have to have sex,
even if they're not in the mood,

418
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:23,750
they have to do it.

419
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,041
You haven't realized
Tokyo hasn't answered you.

420
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,875
You're complaining more than she did.

421
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,375
<i>That's the problem,</i>
<i>that I'm here.</i>

422
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,500
And you'd prefer to do this alone.
Like a lone wolf.

423
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,833
Let's be clear about something.

424
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,500
What's happening?

425
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
Sergio, look at me. What's happening?

426
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,083
- What? Tell me.
- I feel like I'm betraying the gang.

427
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,750
What?

428
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,875
It's like I'm disrespecting

429
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:57,916
the heist.

430
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,291
My brother could do all this
and be in a relationship. Not me.

431
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,416
It's impossible. I can't, Raquel.
I'm a chess player.

432
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,208
Bobby Fischer would never have faced
Spassky with his girlfriend by his side.

433
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,916
I'm not here because I'm your girlfriend.

434
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,375
I'm here because I know the police
much better than you

435
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,625
and much better than anyone on this team.

436
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,458
You know the protocols,
how they negotiate, but so do I.

437
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,875
I got you last time, Raquel.

438
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,041
You got me last time. Did you?

439
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,541
I must be an idiot.

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,250
Because I thought
that we'd fallen in love.

441
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,666
Look, I have my mom and my daughter
in the Philippines

442
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,666
and every police is looking for them.

443
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,458
I never asked you to come with me.

444
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,458
What if this is just revenge, right?

445
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,500
Since the Philippines.

446
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,250
Since you got up
in the middle of the night,

447
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,500
dreaming of your brother.

448
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:18,791
And everything with Rio
is nothing but an excuse to avenge Berlin.

449
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:19,708
Is that it?

450
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,416
<i>Do you know what happened?</i>

451
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,958
You've totally fucked up my life.

452
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,625
Shit.

453
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,208

{\an8}YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SURGERY

<i>♪ Oh di doo di doo di doo dah ♪</i>

476
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:17,083
<i>Rio and I always told the truth</i>
<i>when we fucked.</i>

477
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,291
<i>But you don't always want</i>

478
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:21,916
Tokyo…

479
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,208
I can't be with you.

480
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,958
I've been thinking about it.

481
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,083
I realized I've always been following you

482
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,875
like a little dog.

483
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,166
<i>In that cell, I discovered I was strong.</i>

484
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,125
<i>I used to be afraid.</i>

485
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,125
<i>I was terrified of living without you.</i>

486
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,750
On the island, after only three days…

487
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:57,625
…<i>I went crazy,</i>
<i>and that's a shitty way to live.</i>

488
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,375
- I'd just be like that again.
- Rio.

489
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,125
Tokyo, this is your world.

490
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,875
- No.
- Yes, I'm really sorry.

491
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:10,708
I swear, but I don't wanna live
on your roller coaster.

492
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,083
<i>That was the beginning</i>
<i>of my downfall.</i>

493
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,125
<i>Suddenly, I felt like a ship</i>

494
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,541
<i>that falls into the abyss</i>
<i>at the edge of the world.</i>

<i>And there, while falling,</i>

496
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,458
<i>you can only look up</i>

497
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:29,166
<i>and watch as what you love most</i>
<i>gets smaller and smaller.</i>

498
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,500
<i>If I had known that was</i>
<i>the last time we were gonna fuck,</i>

499
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,833
<i>I would've never let it end.</i>

500
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,083
<i>You're the person</i>
<i>I've loved most in my life.</i>

501
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,791
And I know that I'm just 22.

502
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,083
<i>But I'll feel the same way when I'm 70.</i>

503
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,083
Rio, don't leave me, please.

504
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,250
Please, don't leave me.

505
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,500
Do you hear me? Don't leave me.

506
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,625
Don't leave.

507
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,291
You'll find someone much better than me.

508
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,916
- You're gorgeous and loaded.
- No.

509
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,375
In a few years, we'll run into each other
and I'll have two or three kids

510
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,666
and some shopping bags.

511
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,458
And you'll be

512
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,916
in a fancy convertible with some

513
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
hot Brazilian guy
or something like that, yeah.

514
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,166
We'll have a glass of wine
and laugh about this.

515
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,375
I wanna go back to the island with you.

516
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,000
Please.

517
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:42,583
{\an8}DON'T BE AFRAID

518
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,791
Colonel, a drone
has located the Professor.

519
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,958
- You have a visual?
- Yes.

520
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,166
Put it on the screen.

521
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,041
Colonel Tamayo speaking.
Do you copy? Zoom in.

522
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,333
EMERGENCY

523
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,083
That's right, get in closer.

524
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,708
Get in closer. More.

525
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,291
- Ready?
- Ready.

526
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,625
No, no.

527
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:00,125
Shit. Pull up,
for fuck's sake! Get higher.

528
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,666
I wanna see where this bastard comes out.
Locate the end of that path.

529
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,625
I need to speak to you
about the escape protocol.

530
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,375
Take off those grandpa pajamas.

531
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,791
I think the protocol can wait.
That's perfectly fine.

532
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,583
No, no, no. Tell me.

533
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,000
Think of it as… ah…

534
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:06,125
a type of training exercise,
work-related, under pressure.

535
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,125
Very well. Um…

536
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,625
Point one.

537
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,958
Dispersal.

538
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,875
In the event that we're located,

539
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,250
our chances of escape double
if we separate.

540
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,375
And, well… we'll have to do so

541
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,250
very rapidly.

542
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,666
Raquel.

543
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,916
Be careful.

544
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,875
Stay alive or I'll kill you.

545
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,125
<i>Very good on plan A.</i>

546
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,500
And plan B?

547
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,625
Plan B?

548
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:19,958
I'm not hearing
the second part, Professor.

549
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:25,625
Um, part B. In the emergency backpacks,

550
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,125
we're gonna have to store money…

551
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,041
Uh-huh.

552
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,041
…a camouflage net,

553
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:32,916
a thermal blanket,

554
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,708
a gun.

555
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,666
The gun.

556
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,750
And water to last a minimum of 72…

557
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,750
Seventy-two hours.

558
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,541
Well, what's the name of the second part?

559
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,291
Since you give everything a name.

560
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,041
Epicenter.

561
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,833
- <i>Everyone's thinks…</i>
<i>- </i>Uh-huh.

562
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:03,000
<i>…the fugitive</i>
<i>is always going to try to run away.</i>

563
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,666
But we won't run away.

564
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,541
We're going to stay.

565
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:11,041
No matter what happens to us,

566
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,583
<i>we'll be within a 500-meter radius</i>

567
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,875
<i>of where they're looking for us.</i>

568
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,625
- The epicenter.
- The epicenter. Very good.

569
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,833
<i>We'll be just a few meters away from them</i>
<i>and they won't find us</i>

570
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,916
<i>as long as we remain hidden</i>

571
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,791
<i>during the first four minutes.</i>

572
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,541
How are we going to hide?

573
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,708
Seven, eight meters above ground.

574
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,958
In the treetops.

575
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,291
<i>We'll use the same technique</i>
<i>that military snipers use to hide.</i>

576
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,166
A perfect camouflage.

577
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,375
Class is over.

578
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,416
Raquel, you should be in position.

579
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,375
We have a problem.

580
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,000
What's wrong?

581
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,916
Fuck.

582
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,250
I won't have time. They're here.

583
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,833
No. Stick to the plan.

584
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,125
<i>Raquel!</i>

585
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,291
There it is!

586
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,291
Get in closer.

587
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,958
Fuck!

588
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:50,083
I want all forensics units there now!
We've caught them with their pants down.

589
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,041
And that ambulance
must be full of evidence. Let's go!

590
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,625
Raquel, I'm about two kilometers
northwest of the epicenter.

591
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,000
There are soldiers everywhere.
Did you get up there?

592
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,041
<i>- No, I had to improvise.</i>
- What?

593
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,625
There's a farm 400 meters
south of your location.

594
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,541
<i>That's the first place</i>
<i>they'll look.</i>

595
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,125
It's the only option.

596
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:48,708
Raquel?

597
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,333
<i>The Ministry of the Interior</i>

598
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,958
<i>has just announced</i>
<i>the highest reward in history.</i>

599
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,583
{\an8}<i>Ten million euros for any information</i>

600
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:17,375
{\an8}<i>that aids the authorities in catching</i>
<i>the Professor or thwarting the heist.</i>

601
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:21,041
<i>Popular support is one</i>
<i>of the authorities' main concerns.</i>

602
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,333
All of the hostages have confirmed

603
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,291
that this guy here
took a group of them to go help him.

604
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,750
He said they were going to work
at more than 65 degrees Celsius.

605
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,500
They're smelting the gold.

606
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,250
Why smelt the gold?

607
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,083
Stop fucking with me.

608
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,541
What are you saying?
They have a blast furnace?

609
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,875
An industrial furnace
occupies less space than a dishwasher.

610
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,625
- They went in with military trucks.
- Those motherfuckers!

611
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:52,708
<i>Okay so, why would they</i>
<i>be smelting the National Reserve?</i>

612
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,916
To take it out.
It's much easier to transport.

613
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,791
They can mold it however they want.

614
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,041
They could push it through the plumbing

615
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,833
or fly it out in their blimps,
convert it into pellets…

616
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,458
I don't know.

617
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,916
Go ahead with your plan.
We go after the gold.

618
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,833
They won't get a single gram!

619
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:12,750
Great.

620
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,291
Gentlemen, they have to be in the area.

621
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,250
Give the dogs the traces
we found in the RV.

622
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,583
And turn this place upside down!
Leave no stone unturned!

623
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,541
Any nearby buildings must
be thoroughly searched! Is that clear?

624
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,625
Let's go!

625
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,166
All right.
Come on, everybody. Let's go!
