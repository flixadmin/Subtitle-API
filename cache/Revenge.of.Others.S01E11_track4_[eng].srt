1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,674
-You killed Park Wonseok, didn't you?
-You're crazy!

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:08,883
I'm done listening to your nonsense.
Get out already!

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,512
Gi Osung, you need to die.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,680
You crazy bastard!

5
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,396
MEMORY CLOUD
TODAY A YEAR AGO 2021.04.22

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,776
TODAY A YEAR AGO AT BUSAN
2021.04.22

7
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,412
VOICE 0001_220421

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,789
It was the employee
training building next to the stables.

9
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,626
Do you realize that tomorrow will mark
a year since the incident happened?

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,505
We went horse riding together that day
because it was school foundation day.

11
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,507
April 22nd.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,620
You motherfucker!

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,212
Sooheon!

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,384
Don't do it!

15
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,846
He's not worth it.

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,889
Just stop.

17
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,167
Osung.

18
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
You say you saw Park Wonseok push me

19
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,713
off the roof
of the employee training building, right?

20
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,715
You caught Park Wonseok in the act.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,092
So what?

22
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,053
You said the reason
why you kept quiet about it

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,972
was because Park Wonseok
was wielding your weaknesses over you.

24
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,306
What about it?

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,766
What

26
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,893
was the weakness he was wielding over you?

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,312
Why would I tell you about my weakness?

28
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,773
Because it seems like
it has to be convincing enough

29
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,816
for me to be persuaded.

30
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,609
Forget it.

31
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,528
Get lost.

32
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,030
I said get lost.

33
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,962
How did you end up
coming to the RV earlier?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Gi Osung's phone was turned off
so I made a bunch of calls to people.

35
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,262
Nakjun seemed to know what was going on.

36
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,682
He said Sa Junggyeong went
to Gi Osung's house

37
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,017
and they left together.

38
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,769
I'm sorry to ask, but...

39
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,690
Was the accident that happened a year ago

40
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,319
actually a murder attempt by Park Wonseok?

41
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,115
It wasn't a traffic accident.
That was a lie.

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,661
It's true that I fell from the roof
of the employee training building.

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,416
It was Gi Osung who told me
Park Wonseok pushed me off the roof.

44
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,337
Did you two have any issues?
Enough for him to want to kill you?

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,048
I don't know.

46
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,468
I can't remember.

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,597
Gi Osung has been filling in the blanks

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,683
with the parts I can't remember.

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,937
But yesterday...

50
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,857
he told me the accident from a year ago

51
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,068
was actually Park Wonseok
trying to kill me.

52
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,612
He said he tried to push me off the roof

53
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,280
of our company's
employee training building.

54
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,574
I was so confused.

55
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,702
After finding out about that, Chanmi left.

56
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,584
But how did Gi Osung know about that?

57
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,962
And why did he decide to tell you
about that now?

58
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,546
What exactly happened

59
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,800
with you guys last year?

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,441
I'm...

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,778
even more convinced after today

62
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,489
that Gi Osung is the one
who killed Park Wonseok.

63
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,868
It's possible that Gi Osung
lied to you about that.

64
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,206
I also came to confirm that today.

65
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,672
It's me, Chanmi.
Are you available to talk now?

66
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,715
It's Chanmi.

67
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,307
Hey, Chanmi, where are you?

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,393
How could you just ghost us like that?
You can't be doing things like that.

69
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,062
How do you think people feel
when you ghost them like that?

70
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,815
Anyways, let's talk about it in person.
Where are you right now?

71
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,692
Please don't tell me
you're in Busan again.

72
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,569
Ah, fine.

73
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,654
I'll keep my mouth shut,
so tell me what's going on.

74
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,907
What?

75
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,784
Now?

76
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,678
Tell us what's going on.

77
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,306
We'll keep our mouths shut.
We're all ears.

78
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,683
What exactly were you planning to do
after ghosting us?

79
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,193
A year ago today,
we took this photo in Busan.

80
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,904
A year ago today?

81
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,199
A year ago today,
on the day of the school anniversary.

82
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Seok Jaebum,
wasn't this the day of your accident...

83
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,163
If Gi Osung's telling the truth

84
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
Park Wonseok wouldn't have been in Busan.

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,834
Gi Osung lied to me.

86
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,503
Gi Osung, that bastard.

87
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,922
He tried to frame Park Wonseok.

88
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,176
Chanmi, how...

89
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,804
how could you not double check
these things before ghosting us?

90
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,597
If this photo
hadn't popped up on your phone,

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,600
you would've cut off contact with us
like you were in hiding or something.

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,480
Gi Osung, that bastard.

93
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,815
Why did Gi Osung

94
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,192
have to lie and frame my older brother?

95
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,947
Especially when he wasn't even there
at that building on that day?

96
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,032
Because Park Wonseok isn't alive anymore.

97
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,326
He can't defend himself
against a lie like that.

98
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,955
Gi Osung is truly a terrible person.

99
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,417
I think...

100
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,921
Gi Osung was saying things like that
even while Park Wonseok was alive.

101
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,149
REVENGE OF OTHERS

102
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,906
What the hell
are you getting yourself into, huh?

103
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,701
Who did this to you?

104
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,536
Who did this to your face?

105
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,204
Give me their name?

106
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,206
I wasn't beaten up. We got into a fight.

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,500
He ended up like this too,
so it wasn't just one-sided.

108
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,509
Why were you guys fighting?

109
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,637
It's probably
because we were both pissed off.

110
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,764
Is this another kid from your school?

111
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,476
Why aren't you responding?
Should I investigate this myself?

112
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,478
It was Sa Junggyeong.

113
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,770
Sa Junggyeong...

114
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,149
Are you really involved
in that revenge beating case?

115
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,736
No, I don't have anything to do with that.

116
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,404
If you're not involved,
then what happened to your face?

117
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,530
I told you I had nothing to do with that!

118
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
Do you know what the police
are thinking right now?

119
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,499
Your study café receipt that was found
at the body shop murder scene.

120
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,584
That's an important piece of evidence.

121
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,962
What this means is that the culprit
is either you or someone around you!

122
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,672
You're the number one suspect!
Do you know that?

123
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,425
I told you it's definitely not me.
I have no idea why the receipt was there!

124
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,635
Osung, please!

125
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,059
Think about the situation you're in
right now before you do anything stupid.

126
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,353
I told you to lay low.

127
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,771
And not to get into any trouble.

128
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,861
I can't help you

129
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
if you don't tell me what's going on.

130
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,619
Were you responsible

131
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,664
for the body shop murder?

132
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,629
No.

133
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,006
Were you responsible

134
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,968
for Park Wonseok's murder?

135
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,720
No.

136
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,349
Ji Sooheon did it.

137
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
You need to go after Ji Sooheon.

138
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,118
You left this behind.

139
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,870
Oh.

140
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,791
You left behind a letter as well.

141
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,626
Yeah.

142
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,046
I had no idea I would be back so soon.

143
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,052
Don't you think
we should tell the police now?

144
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,389
About Gi Osung?

145
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,271
If we do that, we would need to talk
about Sa Junggyeong's case as well.

146
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,525
I don't want you to take the blame for it.

147
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll be fine.

148
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,321
We need to catch the murderer.

149
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,114
No.

150
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,449
You won't get arrested.

151
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,492
I won't let that happen.

152
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,791
Your time is very valuable right now.

153
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,835
Everyone's time is valuable.

154
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,087
But yours is especially.

155
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,757
Because I only have a few months left?

156
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,091
Please don't say that.

157
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:40,056
The doctor told me you might be able
to go on this way if you're lucky.

158
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,977
What do you think?

159
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,944
Do you think I'll have the luck?

160
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,163
You will definitely have that luck.

161
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,208
Because you've already spent
all your bad luck.

162
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,086
All that's left for you is good fortune.

163
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,967
Well, I guess my good luck
has started already.

164
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,892
Oh...

165
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,437
Should we go?

166
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,361
Why don't you go up first?

167
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
I left my bag at the convenience store.

168
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,072
GOGO STADIUM
MMA. KICKBOXING. JIUJITSU. LOSING WEIGHT

169
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,116
Let's go together.
I'll help carry your stuff.

170
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,034
It's fine. It's just one bag.

171
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,994
Just go up first.

172
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,454
All right.

173
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,042
Oh...

174
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,338
Go.

175
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,423
I'll go.

176
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,663
Hello. I left my bag here yesterday.

177
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,457
Ah, you must be the student
he was talking about.

178
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,626
The student who lives upstairs.
The one who left their bag here.

179
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,045
One of our employees
should have left your bag in the garage.

180
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,757
I'll go with you to look for it.

181
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,008
Ah, okay.

182
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,059
What the...

183
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,201
What are you doing?

184
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,702
Ugh, shit.

185
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,204
Who's this crazy bitch?

186
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,581
Hey you, fooling around.

187
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, also. If you call the police,
this guy's dead.

188
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,377
-No! Stop!
-Let's go.

189
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,214
No! Hey, open the door!

190
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,119
Hello?

191
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,329
It's me, Chanmi. Something bad happened.

192
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,958
Hey, Chanmi, what's up? What's going on?

193
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,711
Sa Junggyeong and some gangsters
took Ji Sooheon away.

194
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,671
-Ah, what do I do?
-Sa Junggyeong?

195
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,966
He said he'd kill Sooheon
if I call the police.

196
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,051
What should I do?

197
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,721
Don't call the police just yet.

198
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,723
I'll try to find them.

199
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,182
Do you think you'll be able to find them?

200
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,060
If we can't find Sooheon by tomorrow,
let's call the police then.

201
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,937
Do you think he'll be okay until tomorrow?

202
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,772
I'll figure something out.

203
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,511
Hey, lift your head.

204
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,138
Open your mouth.

205
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,891
Open your mouth, fucker.
Stay still. Stay still.

206
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,770
Hey.

207
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,854
Just like this.

208
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,273
This is exactly what you did to me
in the dark room that day.

209
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,983
Wearing a mask and all, huh?

210
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,985
What?

211
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,696
Now that you're experiencing it yourself,
are you uncomfortable?

212
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,243
Hey, you know what? I did some research

213
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,746
and I guess this machine
is used to cut medicinal herbs.

214
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,669
It works well, huh?

215
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,340
It can probably
cut off fingers and toes, or whatever.

216
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,426
Why don't you beg for mercy?

217
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,095
I told you to beg for mercy,
you motherfucker!

218
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,722
Why don't you grovel like a dog,
you fucker.

219
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,895
Oh, this one's nice. Don't you think?

220
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,816
Where should I hit you? Here? Or here?

221
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,567
Oh, wait. Hey!

222
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,069
I think toes would be good.

223
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,279
Since, you know,
you totally crushed my toes.

224
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,781
Junggyeong.

225
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,907
Let's hurry up and get this done.

226
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,952
Man, we have to wait
until tomorrow morning anyway.

227
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,079
That bastard Gi Osung said
he wants to finish him off himself.

228
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,540
So for today, we're just going to...

229
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,375
Ah, shit!

230
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
Agh, fuck! Ack!

231
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,712
You son of a bitch!

232
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,339
You, fucker.

233
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,134
Fucking asshole.

234
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,554
I told you to grovel like a dog,
you son of a bitch!

235
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,261
Gi Osung...

236
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,517
It was Gi Osung.

237
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,870
SEOK JAEBUM

238
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,167
Hey, Jaebum.

239
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,461
Chanmi, I think I know where Sooheon is,

240
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,963
so don't call the police.

241
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,964
Really?

242
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,133
Don't worry. I'll call you later.

243
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,260
Oh, okay.

244
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,427
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,323
Ah, oh shoot. I'm sorry.

246
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,659
Oh, I, um... I saw this taxi first,
from way over there.

247
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,120
-Well, I caught it first.
-Ah, but... I mean... I was first...

248
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,329
I don't know about that.

249
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,123
I was about to get in the taxi.

250
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,543
I guess you're in a hurry.

251
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,711
Okay, then. Go ahead.

252
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,879
You can go first.

253
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
-Have you had breakfast?
-I did.

254
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,374
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey. Don't you see we're eating now?

255
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,682
There's something
I need to hear from you later.

256
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,060
You'll need to tell me the truth.

257
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:32,064
If you lie, you'll pay the price.

258
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
TRACKER

259
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,910
Go straight, then turn right.

260
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,328
Yes, sir.

261
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,060
I got a phone call
from my brother not long ago.

262
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,687
Excuse me?

263
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,274
That's... What are you talking about?

264
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,819
Oh.

265
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,029
I just confirmed that the culprit

266
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,823
of the Ju Hyeokgeon body shop case
is left-handed.

267
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,408
Ah.

268
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,660
Huh?

269
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:32,582
Oh, it's... It seems someone called Chanmi
from Park Wonseok's cell phone.

270
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,711
Oh, it was probably a different person.

271
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,712
Park Wonseok's phone
contract probably expired,

272
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,463
so someone else
must have taken the number afterwards.

273
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,340
It also seems they failed

274
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,550
to lift fingerprints
from the victim's neck.

275
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,135
Oh, I see.

276
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,137
Did he say...

277
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,347
Ju Hyeokgeon's murderer is left-handed?

278
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,600
I guess Ji Sooheon is no longer
a suspect now. That's a relief.

279
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,935
Chanmi.

280
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,772
Yes?

281
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,399
So did you answer the call?

282
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,817
Did you hear their voice?

283
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,737
No, the person didn't say anything.

284
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,990
Why are you telling us about this now?

285
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,286
If the caller was actually the murderer,
isn't that just too bold a move?

286
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,079
I mean, how could they dare to call her?

287
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,291
This is the record of the call
from April 8th.

288
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,044
My older brother's name is saved
as Ok Chankyu in my contacts.

289
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,129
OK CHANKYU

290
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,047
Oh.

291
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,468
Why don't you go
and ask the mobile carrier about it?

292
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,303
Whether my brother's phone number
has been reassigned.

293
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,888
If his number is still active,

294
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,390
that means
someone's still paying his bills.

295
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,475
Is that even possible?

296
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,771
If this person called Chanmi
from Park Wonseok's phone...

297
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,273
they're a prime suspect.

298
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,192
Yes.

299
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Call the mobile carrier now.

300
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,694
Okay.

301
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,491
This caller must be crazy.

302
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,492
We get a specific location
if we trace the call.

303
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,660
Didn't they know
they were putting themselves at risk?

304
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,164
It's Gi Osung.

305
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,836
Please find evidence to confirm
that it's Gi Osung.

306
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,515
How can you be so sure it's Gi Osung?

307
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,308
That's what you need to investigate.

308
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,311
Because I'm certain that it's Gi Osung.

309
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,076
I'm going to ask you some things now.

310
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,828
Think carefully before you answer.

311
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,830
First.

312
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,998
The bastard who tied up Sa Junggyeong
in the dark room

313
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,709
and crushed his foot.

314
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,129
It was you, wasn't it, Ji Sooheon?

315
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,674
That fucking bastard.

316
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,883
Fine.

317
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,510
Now we're talking.

318
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,515
So I guess you were playing hero,
beating up bullies, huh?

319
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,600
Yo, is that why you killed Park Wonseok?

320
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,228
No.

321
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,147
No?

322
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,399
Oh, that wasn't you?

323
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,370
From now on,
every answer I don't want to hear

324
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,581
will cost you a finger.

325
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,545
Park Wonseok bullied a lot of guys.

326
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,172
He would've been a nice target
for your hero act.

327
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,841
Ah.

328
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,261
But I imagine you weren't
originally planning to kill him.

329
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,306
You probably just wanted to scare him
when you pushed him at the science lab.

330
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,517
Anyways, think carefully
before you answer.

331
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,979
Are you the one

332
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,857
who killed Park Wonseok?

333
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,734
No.

334
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,113
It was you who killed Park Wonseok.

335
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,157
Oh.

336
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,455
Are you trying to frame me?

337
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,711
Is that why you left
my study café receipt at the body shop?

338
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,421
You fucking murderer?

339
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,426
You killed Park Wonseok, didn't you?

340
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,886
Answer me.

341
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,851
Answer me!

342
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,775
-What the... Who the fuck are you?
-You motherfuckers!

343
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,276
Fuck...

344
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,741
Freeze! Don't move!

345
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,704
I'm gonna kill you all
if you try anything stupid.

346
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,872
Ah, oh shoot. I'm sorry.

347
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,547
Yeah, you can go first.

348
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,514
What do you think you're doing?

349
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,518
Why did you lie to me?

350
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,186
Huh?

351
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,070
You crazy fucker.

352
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,740
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Did you have fun playing me for a fool?

353
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,575
I said, what the fuck
are you talking about, you crazy bastard?

354
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,909
You've been playing me...

355
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,913
I think we'd better clean up
this place quickly and move.

356
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,722
Please just confirm that the issue
has been resolved.

357
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,350
The company will take care of the payment.

358
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,188
SEOK JAEJOON

359
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,736
I think you misspelled your name.

360
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,114
Aren't you Seok Jaebum, not Seok Jaejoon?

361
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,911
Oh, right.

362
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,333
SEOK JAEJOON
SEOK JAEBUM

363
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,005
We'll wrap things up here
so that you won't run into any issues.

364
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,298
You can head out first.

365
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,716
Yes, thank you.

366
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,974
Are you all right?

367
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,518
Yeah, I'm fine.

368
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,061
Let's head out for now.

369
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,000
GOGO STADIUM
MMA. KICKBOXING. JIUJITSU. LOSING WEIGHT

370
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,925
Are you all right?

371
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,052
Yeah, I didn't get hurt too much.

372
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,679
Thanks to Jaebum.

373
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,807
Luckily I was able to find you
because Gi Osung was behind all this.

374
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,728
Sooheon, you haven't eaten
anything all day, have you?

375
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,104
Do you want to eat something?

376
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,356
Why don't we take him
to the hospital first?

377
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,942
Then let's eat on our way to the hospital.
I'll get us some food.

378
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,613
Are you really okay?

379
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,992
Something weird happened.

380
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,910
Something weird?

381
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,036
What?

382
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,204
Between Seok Jaebum

383
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,873
and Gi Osung.

384
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,169
Between Seok Jaebum and Gi Osung? What?

385
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,302
Detective Jin, I just got a reply
from the mobile carrier.

386
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,889
Park Wonseok's account was never canceled.

387
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,265
It seems his account balance
was automatically charged

388
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,601
to a church account,
and the church has been paying for it.

389
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,145
Can you find the call that was made
to Chanmi on that same day?

390
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,397
Yes, the call was made on Apr 8th.

391
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,025
It was made
from the Yongtan Training Park.

392
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,068
Currently, Park Wonseok's cell phone
is turned off.

393
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,113
Do you think the surveillance cameras
near the park

394
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,239
still have recordings from Apr 8th?

395
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,908
-I'll look into it.
-Okay.

396
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,580
Can we be certain the culprit
is left-handed?

397
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,251
Look. The bruise
is much more pronounced on this side.

398
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,378
If you assume it was the thumb.

399
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,714
This is how
they would've exerted pressure.

400
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,967
In that case, the thumb
would have exerted the most pressure.

401
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,346
Do you remember if Gi Osung
is left-handed?

402
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,765
-How about Ji Sooheon?
-Do you want me to check?

403
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,600
No, it's fine. I'll check it myself.

404
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,435
Just go check the surveillance footage
at the training park.

405
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,853
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

406
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,824
Yet again, Gi Osung and Sa Junggyeong

407
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,450
proved that they're real pieces of shit.

408
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,328
How could those bastards kidnap someone?

409
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,955
Seriously, you can't even grant them
a quick death.

410
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,957
You'd have to hang them up
to dry like pollack.

411
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,333
Let them suffer through a slow
and painful death,

412
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,210
freezing and melting them,
over and over again.

413
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,795
So that you can draw out the suffering.

414
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,842
How's Sooheon doing?

415
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,594
He was hurt, but not too badly.

416
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,055
That's a relief.

417
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,849
I'm thankful for Jaebum.

418
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,101
-He saved Sooheon.
-Right.

419
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,687
Jaebum did a lot of things for us.

420
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,480
How's...

421
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,941
Sooheon's condition right now?

422
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,444
The issue with his brain.

423
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,946
Oh...

424
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,494
If he's lucky,
it'll stay the way it is right now.

425
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,455
It could also get worse.

426
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,963
So he won't get any better,
and he might also die.

427
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,676
Chanmi.

428
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,097
Actually, a detective stopped by
to pay me a visit yesterday.

429
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,351
He showed me surveillance footage of me
meeting with Min Seonha's dad.

430
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,061
Really?

431
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,772
Of course I told him it wasn't me.

432
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,566
But of course, he didn't buy it.

433
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,110
He said I was working as a broker

434
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,029
for Ji Sooheon
to dole out revenge beatings.

435
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,531
I asked my uncle about it and...

436
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,700
If Sooheon hadn't been paid
to beat people up,

437
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,911
it would simply be charged as assault.

438
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,913
But if he was paid to do it,

439
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,998
he'd be in jail for a long time.

440
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,083
Ah, this is terrible.

441
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,502
What should we do?

442
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,047
Actually, the bigger problem is...

443
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,091
Ju Hyeokgeon's case.

444
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,428
If the police suspect
that I was the broker,

445
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,554
they'll go to the OBGYN clinic and talk
to the mother of Shim Eunjin,

446
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,640
Ju Hyeokgeon's murder victim.

447
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,974
They'll go through
the surveillance footage

448
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,559
and whatever else they can find
to track me down.

449
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,270
It'll all be fine if I disappear.

450
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,814
You see, if there's no broker between them
who would have introduced them

451
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,983
to each other and handled the payment,

452
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,860
what could the police possibly do
to Sooheon?

453
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,738
Hey, what do you mean you'll disappear?

454
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,448
Well, I'll drop out of school...

455
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,575
dye my hair...

456
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,703
and hide out somewhere
in the countryside, you know.

457
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,083
I'm sure I can take care of myself.

458
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,296
It's not like I'll end up on some
nationwide watch list or something.

459
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,383
I've made up my mind.

460
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,426
I asked to meet up to tell you this.

461
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,138
I'm going to disappear tonight.

462
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,934
Don't you think there's another way?

463
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,315
No.

464
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,277
Don't tell Sooheon.

465
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,698
You don't need to worry about me.

466
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,157
I'll survive wherever I go.

467
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,162
Please take good care

468
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,331
of Sooheon.

469
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,797
I'm off.

470
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,869
Saying fare-thee-well?

471
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,666
Did you two fight?

472
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,751
Or patching up?

473
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,087
Well, it doesn't seem like
you were fighting.

474
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,339
So maybe it was a "goodbye" then.

475
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,010
-It could have been a celebration too.
-Oh, right. Hugs can be celebratory too.

476
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,387
-But what are you guys celebrating?
-Ugh, so annoying.

477
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,307
How did he find us here? Did he stalk us?

478
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,641
What are you two talking about?

479
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,019
I'll see you at school.

480
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,983
Hey, Tae Soyeon!
It's best for you to confess.

481
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,568
That way you can at least be pardoned.

482
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,196
Ok Chanmi.

483
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,702
When the suspect called you
with Park Wonseok's phone,

484
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,329
you picked up from Busan. Is that right?

485
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,580
Yes, I was in Busan.

486
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you know
that when you picked up that day

487
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,293
the suspect was calling you
from this very park?

488
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,798
Really?

489
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,176
Then can you ask Gi Osung
why he called me from here?

490
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,804
I would really like to know.

491
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,825
It's Gi Osung.

492
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,992
Yeah, it's Osung.

493
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,411
Osung is on our basketball team.
Why do you ask?

494
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,038
Well, I have something to ask him.

495
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,790
Osung hasn't been by lately
to play basketball with us.

496
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,416
-Yeah, right.
-Did something happen?

497
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,295
Oh, no. It's nothing, really. Thanks.

498
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,297
Hope you enjoy your game. Good luck!

499
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,758
-What's up with that guy?
-I know, right?

500
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,260
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

501
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,096
Don't come to the station for a while.

502
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,181
At least until the cases are closed.

503
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,101
What brings you here?

504
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,519
I'm here about the case.

505
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,478
The case?

506
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,771
Which case?

507
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,106
Soon,

508
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,693
another case will open up.

509
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,028
Or rather...

510
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,948
The incident already happened,
and it will be revealed soon.

511
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,702
What are you talking about?
Explain to me in more detail.

512
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,746
Everything that will happen
from this point on...

513
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,250
is all because of Jihyun.

514
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,251
Jihyun?

515
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,044
What about her?

516
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,713
I...

517
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,010
loved Jihyun.

518
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,514
And I still love her.

519
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,101
Osung...

520
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,062
What are you talking about?

521
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,480
It's exactly as you heard it.

522
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,400
I love Jihyun romantically.

523
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,528
Everything that will unravel
from this point onward,

524
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,906
was all because I loved Jihyun.

525
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,326
And I'm sharing this with you now

526
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,119
because if I tell you this
after everything unravels,

527
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,455
you won't believe me.

528
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,292
That's why I'm telling you this
in advance.

529
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,961
O... Osung...

530
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,963
You can't have feelings for her.

531
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,592
We're not legally a family, and...

532
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,678
and even though
she's not your biological sister. You...

533
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,223
You shouldn't have feelings for Jihyun.

534
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,350
There's no point in telling me that now.

535
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,353
It's too late for that now.

536
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,729
I said no!

537
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,648
That's forbidden.

538
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,151
Also, what do you mean
about everything unraveling?

539
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,070
What other case is there?

540
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,739
Park Wonseok's

541
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,451
murder case.

542
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,839
Jihyun.

543
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,062
Jaebum?

544
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,313
Are you on your way back from the academy?

545
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,358
I envy you. Some of us
are all caught up studying in academies.

546
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,859
In that case, are you in the mood
to blow off some steam?

547
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,111
Seriously?

548
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:19,755
CHIEF'S OFFICE

549
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,805
Excuse me, Osung.

550
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,517
Ah.

551
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,895
Here.

552
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
What's this?

553
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,277
Isn't this your wallet?
It was on the floor.

554
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,362
It's not mine.

555
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,698
Oh, I see.

556
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,658
Did you come to see the chief?

557
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,427
So, you went to the police station
to tell them about it?

558
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,428
Yeah.

559
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,056
I thought the police
should arrest Gi Osung

560
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,475
before he tries to hurt you again.

561
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,604
So we checked with the mobile carrier
and confirmed where the call was made.

562
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,148
It turns out that Gi Osung
had called from the park.

563
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,401
Oh, right. There was one other thing.

564
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,321
I heard something important
while I was at the police station.

565
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,366
They said the killer
from Ju Hyeokgeon's case was left-handed.

566
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,952
Ji Sooheon, I think you're finally off
the list of suspects.

567
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,496
For some reason,

568
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,955
the topic of being left-handed
has come up more than once today.

569
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,123
Was there something else?

570
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,249
Yeah, this morning,

571
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,627
in front of that warehouse
I mentioned earlier...

572
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,838
I saw that Jaebum was really good
at writing with his left hand.

573
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,674
He's good
at writing with his right hand as well.

574
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,176
Maybe he's ambidextrous?

575
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,011
Why didn't you ask him about it?

576
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,599
Uh, I mean... I don't know why, but...

577
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,852
it kind of felt like I had discovered
a secret or something.

578
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,939
That's why I couldn't bring myself
to ask him.

579
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,190
Hmm.

580
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,404
Oh, what did you want to tell me earlier?

581
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,864
You mentioned there was something weird
about Gi Osung and Seok Jaebum.

582
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,493
Oh.

583
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,495
Did you have fun playing me for a fool?

584
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,372
I said, what the fuck
are you talking about, you crazy bastard?

585
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,124
You've been playing me...

586
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,419
-Playing him for a fool?
-Yeah.

587
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,672
Gi Osung even used the F word
and everything.

588
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,299
Wow, I've never seen Gi Osung talk
to Jaebum like that.

589
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,176
It was kind of surprising.

590
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,849
Playing him for a fool?

591
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,861
What is this?

592
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,781
Didn't I say we should head back?
Why did we come all the way here?

593
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,867
-What is it you're trying to do right now?
-Be quiet.

594
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,160
Hey, Jaebum!

595
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,495
Take me home now.

596
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,788
I said be quiet.

597
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,834
I know Gi Osung loves you.

598
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,753
And that you two kissed.

599
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,760
So just quiet down.

600
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,279
I guess it must be uncomfortable
not being able to use your left hand.

601
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,365
Yeah. I guess that's why
we have two hands.

602
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,746
Is a left-handed person also left-footed?

603
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,832
Um, for like playing soccer or kicking?

604
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,752
Based on my experience at the gym,
I think so, yeah.

605
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,878
Hm.

606
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,547
When people kick, they kick with their...

607
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,091
left leg.

608
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,054
Park Wonseok.

609
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,140
In the video that played
in the auditorium...

610
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,476
the one of Park Wonseok falling
from the science lab.

611
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,355
The killer had kicked Park Wonseok
with their leg.

612
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,441
Are you saying
that it was with their left leg?

613
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,236
I don't know, I'm not sure.

614
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,323
Do you think Sejin still has that video?

615
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,741
We can call him and ask.

616
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,201
But Sejin's already left for the States.

617
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,078
Oh, right.

618
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,038
Well, you never know.

619
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,166
CALL
KOOK JIHYUN GWON SEJIN

620
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,796
The number you've dialed is no longer...

621
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,881
The number is no longer in service.

622
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,091
Email.

623
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,926
People don't change
their email addresses, right?

624
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,302
I don't know his email address.

625
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,388
Ah.

626
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,516
Maybe there's some other way
we can find out?

627
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,754
I'm here, so let Jihyun go.

628
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,172
Jihyun needs to stay.

629
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,675
I'll need someone to act as a witness.

630
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,554
I'll need to know what's going on,
so talk about it here.

631
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,894
Last year,

632
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,689
when I was pushed off the roof
of the training facility.

633
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,816
It was you, Osung.

634
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,986
What?

635
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,070
Are you serious?

636
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
Did you really push him?

637
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,824
Listen carefully.

638
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,994
Osung is the kind of a guy that will lie
about anything whenever he needs to.

639
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,204
And I'm a guy who lost his memory.

640
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,707
So people won't trust my word over his.

641
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,252
Why did you push me?

642
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,713
To kill me?

643
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,173
I wasn't trying to kill you.

644
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,925
I was just angry with you.

645
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,305
What made you so angry?

646
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,265
Because I told you to stop bullying
Park Wonseok?

647
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,935
Jihyun.

648
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,355
I'm sure you know that Osung
had been bullying Park Wonseok, right?

649
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,733
Other people thought Park Wonseok
was a low life

650
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,276
for bullying other students,

651
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,153
but it was actually Osung
who had put him up to it.

652
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,365
Jihyun.

653
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,574
You knew about it.

654
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,785
Yeah, I did.

655
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,621
So when I told him
to stop bullying Park Wonseok,

656
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:26,955
I guess it had offended him to the point

657
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,791
where he wanted to push me off a roof
to kill me, huh?

658
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,336
Tell me, Osung.

659
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,429
On that day...

660
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,558
I just happened to see a video

661
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,894
on Osung's phone.

662
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,773
But then...

663
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,152
...I saw something unbelievable.

664
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,743
A video...

665
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,371
of you two kissing.

666
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,086
Of course, Osung,
you had forced the kiss on her, but...

667
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,631
I'm pretty sure that was part of your plan

668
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,966
and that you took the video
without her knowing.

669
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:24,805
Anyways, Osung couldn't go on
bullying Park Wonseok

670
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,976
after I confronted him about the video.

671
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,978
So...

672
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,106
that was why you were so mad at me, huh?

673
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,484
Mad enough to try
and kill me by pushing me off the roof.

674
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,238
You son of a bitch.

675
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,870
This is when the real fun begins.

676
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,955
Too bad Jihyun's left.

677
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,626
Hey.

678
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,380
When did you learn
that there's another guy inside me?

679
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,507
Your mother told me.

680
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,678
I only learned about that recently.

681
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,891
And I learned yesterday that

682
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,351
it wasn't Park Wonseok but you...

683
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,604
pushed me off the roof.

684
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,067
I guess you've cracked the code.

685
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,236
We still have
the most important part left.

686
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,666
Good night.

687
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,084
Good night.

688
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,632
Oh, right. About Jaebum...

689
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,260
Why did he have to write his name
with his left hand

690
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,012
and then switch to his right hand?

691
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,764
I can't think of a reason.

692
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,225
SEOK JAEJOON

693
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,684
I think you misspelled your name.

694
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,687
Aren't you Seok Jaebum? Not Seok Jaejoon?

695
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,730
Right.

696
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,607
He misspelled his name

697
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,484
as Seok Jaejoon.

698
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,363
Then he started writing his name
as Seok Jaebum with his right hand.

699
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,157
Isn't that strange?

700
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,162
During summer vacation of my first year
in middle school, he suddenly died.

701
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,290
He was the younger twin.

702
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,709
It's hard to explain, but...

703
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,921
In any case, I feel like I'm not alone,
and that there's someone else next to me.

704
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,261
What's wrong?

705
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,137
Huh?

706
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,225
There's something weird about it.

707
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,939
Maybe you could call this gaslighting?

708
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,484
You made me believe Park Wonseok

709
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,945
had pushed me off the roof
with your scheme.

710
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,618
Because I relied on you for my memories.

711
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,832
Is that why you started
to hate Park Wonseok?

712
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,670
So much as to push him out the window
of the science lab?

713
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,360
Hello.

714
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,154
Hi, how can I help you?

715
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,655
I have a question about Gwon Sejin.

716
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,241
He used to take lessons here
before he left for the US recently.

717
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,246
I'm Ok Chanmi,
a friend of his from school.

718
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,205
Ah.

719
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,124
Sejin... What about him?

720
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,793
It seems like he canceled his phone.

721
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,339
Is there any chance I could get a hold
of his email address?

722
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,049
Email address?

723
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,343
I need to ask him something.

724
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,636
Oh.

725
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,933

Are you okay

732
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,406
to watch the video?

733
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,825
Yes.

734
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,005
Sorry.

735
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,091
It's okay.

736
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,525
I can't tell
if it's the left or the right leg.

737
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,735
I think it's the left leg.

738
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,531
-Really?
-Let's assume that it was the left leg.

739
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:54,908
In that case...

740
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:59,663
If it's the left, that means it might
not have been Gi Osung?

741
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,541
Up until this point,
I was certain that it was Gi Osung.

742
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,353
Sorry.

743
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,150
Chanmi says she's going to go
to the police station tomorrow.

744
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,276
To the police station?

745
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,030
-For Park Wonseok's case?
-Yeah.

746
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,615
But I thought she didn't go to the police
because she couldn't trust them.

747
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,828
We can't collect fingerprints
or analyze videos ourselves, so...

748
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,913
Makes sense.

749
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,337
-How's your hand?
-It's fine.

750
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,299
You didn't have to come all the way here
to see me when your hand's injured.

751
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,259
Because I wanted to thank you.

752
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,094
I was also craving a burger.

753
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,599
Uh, hey, sorry.

754
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,020
Look. You didn't have to come
all the way out here,

755
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,146
especially when you're injured. Seriously.

756
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,314
I guess you're right.

757
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,774
Come on, let's eat.

758
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,025
Okay.

759
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,110
-Thanks for the food.
-Enjoy.

760
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,033
Ah, I'm full.

761
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,870
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yeah, a lot.

762
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,789
If you're done, I'll take this back.

763
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,249
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I can do it with just one hand.

764
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,375
Thanks.

768
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,554
My phone.

769
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,722
My phone's gone. It was just here.

770
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,057
Huh?

771
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,767
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't realize
you left your phone behind,

772
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,102
so I went to the restroom.

773
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,062
I should've looked out for it.

774
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,982
I'm sorry.
Let's go tell one of the employees.

775
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,817
Wow, how could someone snatch it
in such a short amount of time?

776
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,152
I'll go talk to them.

777
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,879
Sooheon.

778
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,881
What are you doing here?

779
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,174
Where were you?

780
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,634
The shooting range.
I'm just on my way back from practice.

781
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,679
-Will you come with me to buy a new phone?
-A phone?

782
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,806
You have to choose one for me.

783
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,562
Nothing here.

784
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,398
Let's go there.

785
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,368
Is there a certain model
you're looking for?

786
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,705
This one.

787
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,123
Can I see this?

788
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,083
-This one?
-Yes, may I see it?

789
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,757
This is a newer model, but it's cheaper.
I think this one is better.

790
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,675
No thanks. Can I just have the other one?

791
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,344
Which carrier do you use?

792
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,012
I'm just going to buy one
without a phone plan.

793
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,722
Oh, okay then.

794
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,600
Is this the same phone Park Wonseok
was using?

795
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,019
Yes, it's the same one.

796
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,929
Jaebum.

797
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,555
Hey, Sooheon.

798
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,475
I'm not taking up
too much of your time, am I?

799
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,852
No, not at all. I was just chilling.
Let's head upstairs.

800
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,112
So what happened?

801
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,323
Sa Junggyeong's cousins
and some other gangsters

802
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,492
were waiting for me by my place.

803
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,869
I didn't want to fight, so I left.

804
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,788
I don't know why I have to be
the one to run away like that.

805
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,999
You made the right choice.
They're not worth the hassle.

806
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,876
Ugh, when will this end? Seriously?

807
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,295
Don't let them stress you out.

808
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,588
I'll get you something to drink.
What do you want to drink?

809
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,465
Just plain water is fine for me.

810
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,758
If you have ice, that's even better.

811
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,593
All right, hold on a sec.

812
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,772
SEOK JAEBUM

813
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,495
Here. With ice.

814
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,913
Thanks.

815
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,548
010-0814-1212
PICTURE HAS BEEN SENT

816
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,220
I'VE SECURED PARK WONSEOK'S CELLPHONE.
I CAUGHT YOU.

817
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,378
Sooheon, I'm so sorry.

818
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,339
Something urgent just came up.
I think I have to head out.

819
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,424
No worries. I'll leave.
You should tend to your business.

820
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,675
Ah, I'm so sorry.

821
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,843
No worries.

822
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,471
Thanks.

823
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,680
Sorry.

824
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,808
-See you later.
-Bye.

825
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,916
Seok Jaebum.
