1
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,910
Why?

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,414
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,340
I don't care who he knows.

4
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,095
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

5
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,057
Big man.

6
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,892
Big generalissimo!

7
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,020
Big fry cook is more like it.

8
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,731
The "chicken man."

9
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,942
You will do what you want.

10
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,278
But you have my vote.

11
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,454
Never trust a south American.

12
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,124
Dirty, dirty people.

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,299
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

14
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,635
He was just having fun.

15
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,805
You'll get over it.

16
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,933
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,741
Marco.

18
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:02,581
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

19
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
No, no. A cold one.

20
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,222
This is what you wanted.

21
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,100
Your brother dead. Right?

22
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,357
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

23
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,151
If you want to save him.

24
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,448
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

25
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,827
One minute? Maybe more?
Maybe less?

26
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,846
Family is all.

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,322
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

28
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,658
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

29
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,619
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,164
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

31
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,501
Christ!

32
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,297
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

33
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,133
Talk! Who you working with?!

34
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,164
Yes, sir.

35
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,594
If you're ready to talk...

36
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,679
They wanna get a statement.

37
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,932
Your side of what happened here.

38
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,270
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

39
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,235
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

40
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
There it is.

41
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,626
Yo, Adrian.

42
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,128
Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

43
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,590
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

44
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,718
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

45
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,803
You understand
get-out-ofâ€”jail-free card?

46
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,098
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

47
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,102
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

48
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,272
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young master Pinkman...

49
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,943
For fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

50
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,947
If this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

51
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,240
Best thing for you.

52
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,784
You're home free.

53
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,662
Good, right?

54
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,789
Right.

55
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,644
Oh, my god.

56
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:03,191
You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

57
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:15,161
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

58
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,626
No thanks to you.

59
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,674
But the plan did work.

60
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,178
We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

61
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,973
This... I just...

62
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,725
I never saw this coming.

63
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,234
What...?

64
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,528
What happens now?

65
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,697
What happens now?

66
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,909
I'll tell you what happens now.

67
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,539
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

68
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,541
Done.

69
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,209
You understand?

70
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,589
I will own him when this is over.

71
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,842
Every cent he earns...

72
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,512
Every cent his wife earns...

73
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,057
Is mine.

74
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,434
Anyplace he goes...

75
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,686
Anywhere he turns...

76
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,897
I'm gonna be there...

77
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,691
Grabbing my share.

78
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:31,780
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies...

79
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,282
And I'll be standing over him...

80
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,701
To get my cut.

81
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,245
He'll see me when he wakes up...

82
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,292
And when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him...

83
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,046
After I shred his house down.

84
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,967
I will haunt his crusty ass...

85
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,886
Forever...

86
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,222
Until the day...

87
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,725
He sticks a gun up his mouth...

88
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,977
And pulls the trigger...

89
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,314
Just to get me out of his head.

90
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:13,279
That's what happens next.

91
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,081
My advice:

92
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,501
That's probably
not a good strategy.

93
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,672
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

94
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,674
But if you hit them...

95
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,593
They're forced to hit back hard.

96
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,681
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon...

97
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,601
Until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you...

98
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,353
Present company included.

99
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,523
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

100
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,194
Jesse, move on with your life.

101
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,863
Leave it behind, all of it.

102
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,323
Nothing changes...

103
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,951
Once I walk out of here.

104
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,039
I get myself a new rv
and go start cooking again.

105
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,627
How exactly do you think...

106
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,214
You're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

107
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,216
- So what?
- What?

108
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,385
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

109
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:22,515
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

110
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,563
If the cops catch me...

111
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,859
I give them
what they want the most.

112
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,914
They nab me...

113
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,333
I make a deal...

114
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,171
To give up the great Heisenberg...

115
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,592
And his million-dollar drug ring.

116
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,057
You're my free pass...

117
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,935
Bitch.

118
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,107
You're so sure.

119
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,028
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him...

120
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,780
He's never going to talk.

121
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,282
What do you think that was, a bluff?

122
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,953
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

123
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,413
Creaming their underoos
for a case like that.

124
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,125
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

125
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,794
And him cooking again?

126
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,131
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

127
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,803
What'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honor among thieves.

128
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,056
Except for us, of course.

129
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,558
No, he'll...

130
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,769
He'll come around.

131
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,397
And if he doesn't...

132
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,066
There may come a time
to talk options.

133
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,818
Options?

134
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,252
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

135
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,755
In the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

136
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,091
Specifically what we call
the blue meth.

137
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,176
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

138
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,846
Where he stored
an early-'803 camper...

139
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,684
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

140
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,687
Which I believe to be
a rolling meth lab...

141
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,356
I received a telephone call...

142
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,653
Telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

143
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,113
Upon hearing the news...

144
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,534
I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

145
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,872
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the emergency call was a hoax.

146
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,459
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

147
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,466
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the rv was gone.

148
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,885
Most likely destroyed on site.

149
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,347
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

150
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,069
I think we're done here.

151
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,821
Agent schrader needs to get home...

152
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,031
Get some rest.

153
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,036
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the fifth here?

154
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,704
Yeah, that's correct.

155
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,706
Okay. Well...

156
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,376
We just wanna give you all
a heads up.

157
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,254
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

158
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,592
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

159
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,094
The word of a meth head.

160
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,929
We know all about his history.

161
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,599
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

162
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,186
His blood is clean, he's not using.

163
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,439
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

164
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,400
Far as we can tell.

165
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,408
Where do we go from here?

166
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,202
A couple of gentlemen
from opr will come down...

167
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,246
Probably tomorrow morning.

168
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,581
Janice will give us an exact time.

169
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,753
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

170
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,924
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

171
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,300
We need one more thing.

172
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,597
A photo of agent schrader's hands.
For the record.

173
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,308
Yes, of course.

174
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,811
Bandage off, if you would.

175
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,569
On the table is fine.

176
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,822
Flat on the table. That's fine.

177
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,049
It's all gonna work out.

178
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,928
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

179
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,433
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

180
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,270
Okay.

181
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,940
Marie...

182
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
Who?

183
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:55,924
http://hiqve.com/

184
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,938
Do you have a minute?

185
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,149
Sure.

186
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,999
I guess crime does pay.

187
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,673
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

188
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,222
You heard about Hank?

189
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,518
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

190
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,854
Yes, I know.

191
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,357
Whatever Hank was investigating...

192
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,444
Him trying to find an rv...

193
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,363
Is there any danger...

194
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,948
That could lead back to you?

195
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,203
Why would it?

196
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,875
Is this why you're here?

197
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,379
I'm here to talk about Hank.

198
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,552
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

199
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,391
Hank could lose everything.

200
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,396
I thought maybe...

201
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,775
There's a way you could help him.

202
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,860
How?

203
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,905
Contact Pinkman.

204
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,157
Get him to drop the charges.

205
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,578
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

206
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:09,250
- I'm not asking.
- He was... he's... he's not my friend.

207
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,877
- It's not as if we were even close.
- _|'m__

208
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,088
I'm not asking.

209
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,882
But there must be something
you could say.

210
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,094
Isn't it even worth a try?

211
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,305
Hank is your family.

212
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,102
Not currently.

213
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,353
What?

214
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,356
I said, not currently.

215
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,902
I'm late. I have to go.

216
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,564
I was starting to get worried.

217
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,984
Car trouble.

218
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,904
Oh, that's a bummer.

219
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,741
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

220
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,623
No sandals today?

221
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,000
I just thought...

222
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,670
A bit more professional.

223
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,299
Well, everything is on track.

224
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,970
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

225
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,097
Let's get our trays ready.

226
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,683
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

227
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,022
Is our...?

228
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,441
Our solvent filtered?

229
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,693
I thought you might ask that.

230
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,903
Done.

231
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,032
That's good.

232
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,534
That's good.

233
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,954
Hand in glove,
that's what we strive for.

234
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,210
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

235
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,244
So you the gentlemen?

236
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,585
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

237
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:02,089
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, lolly. Maybe Fran.

238
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,592
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

239
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,095
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10...

240
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:12,766
So I wanna wrap it up here asap
because traffic can be a wild card.

241
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,938
Thing is, women who like to get peed
on tend to be from the warmer climates.

242
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,108
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

243
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,694
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

244
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,197
But, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

245
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,576
Science is a mystery.

246
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,704
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

247
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,958
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

248
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:43,464
Jhps. Hollow-point bullets,
known as black death. Check it out.

249
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,466
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

250
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,968
Nickel-plated brass casing,
lubalox coat.

251
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,472
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

252
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,141
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

253
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,811
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

254
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,231
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

255
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,650
Vests.

256
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,778
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

257
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,655
Right here.

258
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,995
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-intennoven kevlar fiber.

259
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,999
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

260
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,836
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

261
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,839
They work?

262
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,676
Sure as shit, they do.

263
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,970
I don't leave home without it.

264
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,688
What the hell?

265
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,359
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

266
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,392
You're welcome!

267
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,664
What temperature did you set here?

268
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,374
Here?

269
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,252
Station five, 75 c.

270
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,592
Eight-five.

271
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,265
I wrote it down. You said 75.

272
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,601
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

273
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,436
That's not what I said.

274
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,274
It's always been 85.

275
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,237
Eighty-five.

276
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,075
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

277
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,954
I'm sorry.

278
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,123
I'm very sorry.

279
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,126
You're sorry, meanwhile...

280
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,255
You've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

281
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,800
Just dump it. Dump it all.

282
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,927
This batch is ruined.

283
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,962
You look nice.

284
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,007
I look like a TV weatherman.

285
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,845
You want a coffee?

286
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,938
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

287
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm all right.

288
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,867
What are you gonna tell them?

289
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,456
Here's what you'll tell them.

290
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,501
He attacked you.

291
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,214
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

292
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,384
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

293
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,219
A pipe.

294
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:05,184
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

295
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,644
And you had to disarm him.

296
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,563
Muscle memory.

297
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,860
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

298
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,737
You had no choice but to hit him.

299
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,073
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

300
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,829
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

301
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:30,417
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

302
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,046
Doing the job you're supposed to.

303
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,925
Why should you be the one
who pays...

304
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,927
For doing the right thing?

305
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,804
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

306
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,099
It's not what the job is.

307
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm supposed to be better than that.

308
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,774
And you made one mistake.

309
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,111
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

310
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,532
I've been...

311
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,288
Unraveling, you know?

312
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,586
I don't sleep at night anymore.

313
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,965
I freeze.

314
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,092
I freeze up.

315
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:25,347
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

316
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,894
I panic.

317
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,733
Ever since that salamanca thing.

318
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,944
I mean, tuco salamanca.

319
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:43,073
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the eyes...

320
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,997
It changed me.

321
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,170
And I can't seem to control it.

322
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,926
I tried to fight it.

323
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,894
And it's just gotten worse.

324
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,525
What I did to Pinkman...

325
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,698
That's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

326
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,703
All this...

327
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,540
Everything that's happened, I...

328
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,337
I swear to god, Marie,
I think the universe...

329
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,214
Is trying to tell me something...

330
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,550
And I'm finally...

331
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,720
Ready to listen.

332
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,731
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

333
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,570
I think I'm done as a cop.

334
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:19,836
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

335
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,713
I'm sorry.

336
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,760
This whole Gale situation, he's...

337
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,429
He's just not working out.

338
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,393
Yes, now.

339
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,604
It may sound unorthodox...

340
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:43,610
But I think our first best option...

341
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,864
Is Jesse Pinkman.

342
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,120
Hello?

343
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:04,965
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

344
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,925
Experience together...

345
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:12,639
At a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

346
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,938
Look, Mr. Fring...

347
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:25,986
When I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

348
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,655
And I know best how to run it.

349
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,537
Thank you.

350
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you.

351
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,417
Yes, I will. I will.

352
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,044
Okay. Goodbye.

353
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,928
Listen, something's come up.

354
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,308
I think it's a good opportunity.

355
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,855
There's been a job opening.

356
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,565
I need a new lab assistant.

357
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,070
I already did my time.

358
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,865
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

359
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,951
I don't want a monkey.

360
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,204
I want you.

361
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,706
Oh, gee, thanks.

362
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,209
Well, not interested.

363
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,213
I got my own thing going on.

364
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,467
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

365
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,349
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

366
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,184
There's more.

367
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,396
It's more than an assistant.

368
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,565
Partners.

369
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,735
We'll be partners again.

370
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,405
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

371
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:59,204
One-point-five million dollars each.

372
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:18,014
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

373
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,268
I said no.

374
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,565
Let me understand this.

375
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,902
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

376
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,698
I am not turning down the money.

377
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,243
I am turning down you.

378
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,287
You get it?

379
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,457
I want nothing to do with you.

380
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,378
Ever since I met you...

381
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,924
Everything I've ever cared about...

382
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,218
Is gone.

383
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,930
Ruined, turned to shit...

384
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,477
Dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

385
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,940
I have never been more alone.

386
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,319
I have nothing!

387
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,571
No one!

388
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,574
All right? It's all gone!

389
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,492
Get it?

390
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,581
No, no. Why...?

391
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:29,002
Why would you get it?

392
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:35,634
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

393
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,093
Right?

394
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,265
You don't give a shit about me.

395
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,770
You said I was no good.

396
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,522
I'm nothing!

397
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,193
Why would you want me, huh?

398
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,823
You said my meth is inferior, right?

399
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:04,621
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

400
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,123
Hey, screw you, man!

401
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,668
Screw you.

402
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,550
Your meth is good, Jesse.

403
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,136
As good as mine.

404
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,783
Fifty-fifty.

405
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,786
Yes, fifty-fifty.

406
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,957
Okay.

407
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,626
Partners.

408
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,977
And this is the statement
you want to give?

409
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,480
Yes, sir.

410
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,400
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

411
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,153
I do.

412
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,948
I'm good.

413
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:53,039
So we understand if we
write it up like that, you'll sign it.

414
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,001
That's the way it happened.

415
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,963
I accept the consequences.

416
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,887
In the light of these facts...

417
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,432
As of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

418
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,395
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

419
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,438
Yes, sir.

420
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,220
Schrader.

421
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,055
Hold up.

422
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,765
Yes, sir?

423
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,393
I just wanted to tell you something.

424
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,105
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up...

425
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,942
But the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

426
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,906
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

427
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,409
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

428
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,266
It went fine.

429
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,562
Well, fine means what it means,
yeah.

430
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,109
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

431
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,615
Yeah, it's just...

432
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,659
I don't know, baby, I just think...

433
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,995
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

434
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,581
Okay. I love you too.

435
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,939
- Schrader.
- I need you to listen very carefully.

436
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,191
Two men are coming to kill you.

437
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:26,776
Come again?

438
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:31,030
They're approaching your car.
You have one minute.

439
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,658
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

440
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,785
They're coming.

441
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,829
Hello?

442
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,845
Hey, iiâ€”-

443
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,893
gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

444
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,187
So call me when you get this.

445
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,935
Finish him.

446
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,753
Jesus.

447
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,301
Too easy.

448
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,325
