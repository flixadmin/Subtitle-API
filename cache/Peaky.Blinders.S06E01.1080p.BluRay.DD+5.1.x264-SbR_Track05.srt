It was Tommy himself
who warned us of the informant.

498
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,481
We're guessing
that the informant

499
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,761
was the one that tipped off
the police about me.

500

Gina, in today's paper,
you will read about a man

504
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,401
being fished out
of the Boston Harbour

505
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,801
with a bleeding heart tattoo

506
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,601
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

507
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,321
Single shot to the head.

508
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,641
Yeah, I know,
I read it already.

509
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,121
His death will lead to others.

510
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,961
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

is being carried out,

you must keep things
to yourself.

513
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:25,441
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

514
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,201
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

515
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,761
Do you understand?

516
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:36,001
Michael, I just want the truth.

517
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,601
No, fuck that -
I <i>need</i> the truth!

518
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,121
Why are you doing business
with him again?

519
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:44,881
Gina,
tell me what you're thinking

520
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,401
of getting Laurence
for Christmas.

00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:33,961
<i>Look, you just book
a new passage</i>

659
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:35,321
when Ruby's feeling better.

660
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:36,721
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

661
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,001
just as long as you get here,
right?

662
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,801
<i>And then I'll get
this business done,</i>

663
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:44,641
you get here
with the children...

664
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,121
...and then no more.

665
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:50,241
And it'll just be us
and the clean air

666
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:51,721
out in the West.

667
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,201
<i>I've found a place
in the mountains.</i>

668
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,721
<i>There'll be snow.</i>

669
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:58,601
Tell Ruby... Tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

670
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,041
Hmm.

671
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:01,841
<i>(SIGHS)</i>

672
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:03,441
<i>How long has she been coughing?</i>

673
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,081
<i>A few days.</i>

674
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:07,881
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

675
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,561
out in the cold by the river.

676
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,121
(SIGHS)

677
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,641
Are you OK, Tommy?

678
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:19,121
Your voice,
it sounds different.

679
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,721
<i>It's just cold.</i>

680
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:23,201
I'll get this business done
in Boston...

681
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:26,001
...and that'll be
the end of it.

682
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:29,201
And then I just want to...

683
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:32,681
...I just want to pick Ruby up

684
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:34,361
and hold her in my arms,
y'know?

685
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,761
I miss the weight
of carrying her.

686
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:39,321
<i>I gave her her presents early.</i>

687
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,161
She loves them.

688
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,041
But last night,
she was burning up.

689
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,801
She was delirious.

690
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:49,361
She kept talking.

691
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,241
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

692
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:55,881
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

693
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,401
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

694
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:00,561
When she was delirious,

695
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,361
she kept saying
these Gypsy words, er...

696
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:09,521
<i>"Tickner maura,
tickner maura, o beng, o beng, "</i>

697
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,841
<i>over and over again.</i>

698
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,241
What? Lizzie, what...?

699
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,761
What did you say?
What did Ruby say?

700
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:19,681
Tickner, tickner maura.

701
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:21,721
<i>- Something like that.</i>
- Did she say any...

702
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:23,681
Did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

703
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,001
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

704
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:30,361
No, Lizzie, did she say
any other words in Romany?

705
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,681
Fucking listen to me!

706
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:33,241
I don't know Romany words,

707
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:34,761
<i>Tommy. I don't think so.</i>

708
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,241
Just "tickner maura"
and "o beng"?

709
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:38,201
Yes.

710
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,321
Could she see anything
when she was burning up?

711
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:42,281
<i>- What could she see?</i>
- Oh, fuck.

712
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:43,961
Lizzie, please, just answer
the fucking question!

713
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:46,761
She said she could see a man.

714
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,881
A man with green eyes.

715
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:50,641
<i>She was delirious.</i>

716
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:52,441
<i>She was burning up.</i>

717
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:54,041
What the fuck is the matter?

718
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:55,201
All right, listen, Lizzie,

719
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:56,281
- I'm coming home.
<i>- Tommy,</i>

720
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:57,881
- it's just a fever, love.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

721
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,801
I'm coming home. I'll be
on the next steamer back.

722
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:01,321
<i>You keep her out of school.
You hear me?</i>

723
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:02,721
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

724
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:04,801
- Tommy...
<i>- Keep her away from the river.</i>

725
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:06,841
<i>Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.</i>

726
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:08,921
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives

727
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,721
the words
that Ruby has been saying.

728
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:12,881
<i>Do you hear me?
Tell Johnny's eldest wife</i>

729
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:14,961
to put a Black Madonna
around her neck.

730
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,041
You listen to Esmeralda

731
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:18,041
the same way you listen
to a fucking doctor.

732
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,081
<i>You hear me?</i>

733
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,401
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

734
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:24,121
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

735
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:25,721
- (GROANS)
<i>- And you get Curly there.</i>

736
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:28,521
<i>Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses.</i>

737
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:29,601
And you do everything

738
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:31,641
that Johnny Dogs
and his wives fucking tell you.

739
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:32,841
Do you understand me?

740
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,201
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

741
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:38,041
<i>OK!</i>

742
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,761
I'll do it.

743
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,161
All right, I'm coming home.

744
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,641
Polly?

745
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,121
Polly?

746
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,441
They know
I'm trying to get out.

747
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:03,921
Pol...

748
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:06,761
...they're coming for me.

749
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,281
<i>(FOOTSTEPS)</i>

750
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,001
You son of a fucking bitch.

751
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,561
You sound American, Michael.

752
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:52,961
I have to go back
to England early.

753
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,801
Let's make this quick, eh?

754
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:57,201
You just fuck people up
and you run away.

755
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:58,401
No, this business
will continue.

756
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,641
Jack Nelson is also travelling
to England.

757
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:03,641
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licences.

758
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:06,201
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

759
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:08,481
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

760
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:10,001
Of his personal correspondence.

761
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:11,761
Letters from the President
of the United States,

762
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:13,401
and his many mistresses.

763
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:16,161
I have contacts
in his organisation.

764
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:20,241
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

765
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,721
You're dead, Tommy.

766
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,721
You're out
of your fucking depth.

767
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:28,641
You're dead already.

768
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,801
You threatened
to sell to the Jews.

769
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,681
And I have contacts
in this prison.

770
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:37,521
These boys here will look
after you during your stay.

771
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,481
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

772
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:40,921
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

773
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:41,961
Oh, yeah?

774
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:43,521
Is he?

775
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,121
This is a letter.

776
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,081
Here, give him this letter,
will ya?

777
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:49,561
This is a letter

778
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,881
from the President's
personal secretary,

779
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,281
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

780
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:56,201
Just until the press
lose interest, Michael.

781
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:00,961
Fuck you.

782
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:02,761
You'll be released eventually.

783
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,961
And then you can execute
your business with me...

784
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:07,361
...as before.

785
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:12,361
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

786
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:15,081
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

787
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,521
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

788
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,841
So, you didn't learn.

789
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:27,161
When my mother died
at the hands of your ambition,

790
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:29,641
you didn't learn
your limitations.

791
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:33,361
I have no limitations.

792
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,321
Oh, and by the way, Michael...

793
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,001
...according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

794
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,641
he bought passage
for five people

795
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:48,161
from Boston to Liverpool.

796
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,241
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

797
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:54,561
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

798
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:57,481
...and Gina Gray.

799
00:56:59,961 --> 00:57:01,561
Gina's coming to London,
Michael...

800
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,481
...where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

801
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:07,921
Fuck! You fucking bastard,
Tommy!

802
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,001
- Spirits, Boston Irish...
- You're the devil!

803
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,681
- ...and Uncle Jack.
- You're the fucking devil!

804
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:13,281
I'm ready for the conversation.

805
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,481
