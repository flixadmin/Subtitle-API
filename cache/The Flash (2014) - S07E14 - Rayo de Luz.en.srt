The people that raised me were gone.

Carver put my parents in charge
of all international accounts.

My parents were in too deep.

And worse, they got
used to this lifestyle.

And no matter how hard I tried,
I could not pull them out.

Okay. Sorry. Look, I know

We couldn't track Ultraviolet's

But you and Ultraviolet
have the same powers,
