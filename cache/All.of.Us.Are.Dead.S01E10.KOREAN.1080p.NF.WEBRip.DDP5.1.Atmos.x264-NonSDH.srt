1
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,371
-Mom.
-Cheong-san, no.

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,796
What the hell?

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,969
Damn it!

4
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,267
There's another zombie here!

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,689
Dae-su!

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,941
Stop it.

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,944
Dae-su! Get up!

8
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,658
I said stop that!

9
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,833
-Stop that!
-Hey!

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,878
Cheong-san! What the hell?

11
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,548
You son of a bitch!

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,476
Stop it!

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
Let go!

14
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,652
Get the fuck off me!

15
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,947
Mom!

16
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,078
Mom…

17
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,937
Hurry.

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,565
Run!

19
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,191
Hey, let's go.

20
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,401
Hurry up!

21
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,527
Let's go.

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,034
Let's go, Cheong-san.

23
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,830
Pull yourself together, man!

24
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,209
Where are the others?

25
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,627
What?

26
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,171
Where are they?

27
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,506
-What now?
-Did you see them coming?

28
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,511
Cheong-san, please.

29
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,638
-Come with us.
-Let's go.

30
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,132
Mom!

31
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,056
Mom!

32
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,174
Mom…

33
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,343
They're here. Hurry up!

34
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,012
-Wu-jin!
-Get up.

35
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,556
Come on. We have to go. Let's go!

36
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,832
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,500
Shut up. You're so heavy.

38
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,211
Mi-jin. Thank you so much.

39
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,840
-Will you go out with me?
-No.

40
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,091
Screw you.

41
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,843
Hold on.

42
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,389
-Why? What is it?
-Shh.

43
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:24,991
Hear that?

44
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,870
Those goddamn fucking zombies. Shit.

45
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,873
Let's go.

46
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,878
Let's run.

47
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,837
To the mountain.

48
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,718
Aah!

49
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,810
Ji-min. Help me.

50
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,198
Hyo-ryeong!

51
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,205
Get up!

52
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,888
Get up.

53
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,729
Sister.

54
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,854
-Wu-jin.
-What are you doing here?

55
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,896
Come on.

56
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,981
Get going.

57
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,903
-Hey!
-Hyo-ryeong. You go first.

58
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,157
-Come on! Let's go!
-Let's go.

59
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,885
What's wrong, Nam-ra?

60
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,346
Run.

61
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,892
Let's go.

62
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,355
Oh, shit.

63
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,065
Run!

64
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm gonna die tonight!

65
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,029
-Run! Go!
-Just save yourselves!

66
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,907
Just go! You'll die! Believe me!

67
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,909
Whatever!

68
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,661
-Over here!
-This way! Hurry!

69
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,704
Come on!

70
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,673
Are you crazy? Let go!

71
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,639
Hey! No! No!

72
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,599
No!

73
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,683
What are you doing?

74
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,269
No! Let go of me, you assholes!

75
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,771
Let me go!

76
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,940
Let go off me! No!

77
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,942
Get out of here! Hurry!

78
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,947
No! Joon-seong! Joon-seong…

79
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,076
Joon-seong!

80
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,579
No! Let me go!

81
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,920
Shit.

82
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,720
Damn it.

83
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,946
Hey, Cheong-san, I'm…

84
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,243
so sorry.

85
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,538
I didn't know she was your mom.

86
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,836
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,409
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,386
Stop!

89
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,934
Don't do this.

90
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,065
No!

91
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,752
Mommy…

92
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>A virus</i>
<i>must have a consistent pattern</i>

93
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>for us to create a vaccine.</i>

94
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,369
<i>But the Jonas Virus…</i>

95
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,581
<i>transforms and evolves on its own.</i>

96
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,585
<i>It is an ever-changing monster.</i>

97
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,716
<i>It's impossible to create a vaccine.</i>

98
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,218
<i>There is only one solution.</i>

99
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,098
<i>Slaughter.</i>

100
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,352
<i>Completely burning and killing the host,</i>

101
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,772
<i>so not a single cell remains.</i>

102
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,068
<i>The moment we are consumed by arrogance</i>
<i>and think we can defeat the virus,</i>

103
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,071
<i>humankind will end.</i>

104
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,536
The file was massive,
so we couldn't analyze it all,

105
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,039
but a significant portion
of it is credible, sir.

106
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,458
And where is the proof for that?

107
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:17,421
Well, KDCA is creating a virus
using the exact method he described.

108
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,549
If they create the same virus,

109
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,385
then the KDCA will conclude it's credible.

110
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,554
Well…

111
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,059
Many soldiers are going insane
from this thing, but…

112
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,812
It's scarier when a scientist goes crazy.

113
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,814
Did you hear
they're expanding martial law?

114
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,024
Martial law?

115
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,985
Why would they do that
if we're handling it well?

116
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,530
My friend in the NIS analysis team

117
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,699
said they're discussing pulling back
the blockade to Yangdong

118
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,243
and expanding martial law.

119
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,748
What about Hyosan?

120
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,628
I think they're willing
to make sacrifices.

121
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,764
We may have ceased
our rescue operation for now, but…

122
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,102
there might not be another time
to rescue survivors.

123
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,815
Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

124
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,278
The moment the blockade
is penetrated by the infected,

125
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,656
we'll have to step up and…

126
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,534
abandon Hyosan.

127
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
Take this.

128
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,380
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

129
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,262
Childish to think the party leader
came personally to save me.

130
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,431
You came to dump me.

131
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,558
My NIS source says

132
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,228
something is going to happen very soon
in Hyosan.

133
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,816
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

134
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,737
I'll say you even resigned from your post
thinking it would help prevent it.

135
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,156
No one would even think of blaming you.

136
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,574
Blame me for what?

137
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,911
Trust me, you're gonna sign it.

138
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,456
I'll protect your political career
until the end.

139
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,585
Do you need time to think it over?

140
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,462
You failed Hyosan.

141
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,675
They'll just abandon it?

142
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,219
Sign it within the day,

143
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:33,223
and hand it to the person in charge
of this place.

144
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,818
Hmm…

145
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,158
Sir, um, can you hear me?

146
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,827
-Let's go.
-Excuse me, sir!

147
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,162
Oh, damn.

148
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,040
Assemblywoman?
You're getting us out now, right?

149
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,627
The party leader came,
so it'll all be resolved very soon, right?

150
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,464
He says he'll save us, right?

151
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,007
Ma'am?

152
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,780
I thought about it all night long.

153
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,866
How do I live?

154
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,286
What do I do?

155
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,049
Why don't we talk about this later?

156
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,677
Tomorrow or the day after.

157
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,054
Or next week, maybe.

158
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,433
Let's get out of here and eat some food,

159
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,186
and shower first, okay?

160
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,437
We'll talk about it then.

161
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,189
Hmm?

162
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,364
We have a lot to talk about, you know?

163
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,284
Let's give it time.

164
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,508
Whatever happens…

165
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,553
please don't give up.

166
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,056
Okay?

167
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,645
Okay.

168
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,698
Never.

169
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,702
Mm-hmm.

170
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:23,996
You too.

171
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,249
Mm-hmm.

172
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,835
It'll be okay.

173
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,565
What is it?

174
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,817
Do you see something?

175
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,367
The smell is stronger.

176
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,879
I can't really smell anything.

177
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,299
I think they're all coming this way.

178
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,134
The smell is really strong.

179
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,348
Doesn't matter.
We're all trapped in here for good now.

180
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,684
And there's no way to get out.

181
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,770
Please don't say that.

182
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,855
So don't.

183
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,857
I think we're done.

184
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,110
Ah, damn it!

185
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,320
Let them kill us if they want.

186
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,206
Ha-ri.

187
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,127
You didn't fail
in the preliminaries, did you?

188
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,422
No.

189
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,716
I did really well.

190
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,260
Your tournament.

191
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,054
What happened?
Why did you come to the school?

192
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,020
-You're her brother?
-Yeah, I am.

193
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,897
She got a perfect score,
so she made it to nationals.

194
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,815
I saw her.

195
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,068
Really?

196
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,363
Mm-hmm. It's true.

197
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,908
No way. Really?
You're really in the nationals?

198
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,660
Mom and Dad don't know?

199
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,163
Bro, how could they now? Look around.

200
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,416
She jumped out of archery bus
and ran to the school to find you.

201
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,375
Kid.

202
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,294
You be good to her.

203
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,505
And to me too.

204
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,094
Who is she?

205
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,805
Why does she keep
talking for you?

206
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,435
She's my friend.

207
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,772
Yeah. We're freaking besties.

208
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,192
You scared me.

209
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:41,985
What's your deal?

210
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,406
I…

211
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,076
You?

212
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,662
I think you're the perfect girl.

213
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,539
What? You freak.

214
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,875
Hey.

215
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,960
What's wrong with you?

216
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,797
I watched you
when you were shooting your arrows,

217
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,007
I saw you train every morning.

218
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,135
I went to every tournament
and cheered for you.

219
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,721
Caught myself yelling "copper beauty"
a few times.

220
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,391
I really liked you for many years.

221
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,018
Now…

222
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,438
I wanna be a man, not just a fan.

223
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,819
I'm gonna die, anyway.
I just wanna say what I want first.

224
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,996
Cool.

225
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,374
You're Dae-su, right?

226
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,168
You call my brother "brother-in-law"?

227
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,337
Yeah.

228
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,589
So that means you knew.

229
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,883
Brother-in-law, you told her?

230
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,511
Yeah, I might have.

231
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,976
Must be nice to meet me.

232
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,436
Yes.

233
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,438
-Then you're okay with dying?
-Yes.

234
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,356
What? Today?

235
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,694
Good. I'm pissed off and needed to vent.

236
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,070
Wu-jin, stop her.

237
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,321
-Ha-ri, hey.
-Stop her.

238
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,158
-Come here. Get over here.
-I'm sorry. I was wrong.

239
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,287
-No. I'm glad you told me.
-Hey. No, that's not it.

240
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,955
-Yes, it is. Get over here now.
-No, I…

241
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,458
Why don't you understand?
I really like you.

242
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,543
-Get over here, dear husband.
-Wu-jin. Hey.

243
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,670
-Sorry.
-Stop her, Wu-jin.

244
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,880
-No!
-Beat him up, sis.

245
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,715
Get over here. You punk.

246
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,593
-He needs a good beating.
-Look at him dodging.

247
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,388
What's that?

248
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,099
That's not it!

249
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,768
Guys.

250
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,105
Come here. Gonna get you, asshole!

251
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,859
-Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it. Stop her.
-I don't want to come between you two.

252
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,361
-Right now.
-Okay. Only if you promise not to hit me.

253
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,175
Where did those shitheads run off to now?

254
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,943
What are you doing?

255
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,487
Can we move this?
Do you think it's possible?

256
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,834
We can tie all the carts in a circle,
then we can just use them as a shield.

257
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,593
This way.

258
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,388
We need strings or something
to tie them together.

259
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,057
Is this it?

260
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,725
This?

261
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,276
Cut as many as possible.

262
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,197
Hey. There's no way this is going to work.

263
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,492
We should flip it over completely,
so that we can hide underneath.

264
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,578
Uh… We should stand it up.

265
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,871
Yeah, zombies sure can't climb that?

266
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,373
That's enough.

267
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,959
Don't be stupid. Okay? Let's redo them.

268
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,795
It's too short if we close the lids.

269
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,171
Unless you want us crawling?

270
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,048
Pulling rank right now?

271
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,174
Hey.

272
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,427
Say it to my face!

273
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,053
If you don't like it, make your own.

274
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,101
There.

275
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,686
Oh, shit. Are you crazy?

276
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,646
What's wrong with you?

277
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,191
-Sis, stop her.
-Come on. Say that again.

278
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,319
Do everyone a favor
and stay out of our way.

279
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,529
Hey, you.

280
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,032
Shithead!

281
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,284
"Shithead"? Shithead. What the fuck?

282
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,243
Stop it.

283
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,704
Joon-yeong, you too.

284
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,789
Who the hell is she to tell us
we have to redo it?

285
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,542
"Who the hell is she?"
Your fucking nightmare.

286
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,629
-You're coming with us, right?
-You're the ones coming with me.

287
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,715
You won't just leave them here, right?

288
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,924
I wish, but no.

289
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,178
We're going together, anyway.
Why fight now, huh?

290
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,555
Just do as I say
unless you wanna die out there.

291
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,640
Which you might.

292
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,933
We're tryna make it that high,
so we don't die out there.

293
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,435
Enough already.

294
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,439
How many people have died on our way here?

295
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,483
We can't lose anyone else.

296
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,361
We shouldn't waste energy
fighting among ourselves.

297
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,862
I'm not fighting to die.

298
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,365
I'm fighting because I wanna live.

299
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,034
Then do as I fucking say, asshead.

300
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,953
Unless we split up.

301
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,246
Problem solved.

302
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,083
-Get back here. You hear me?
-Joon-yeong.

303
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,292
Get back here!

304
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,794
Let go of me, asshole!

305
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,712
You think I'm doing this,
because I wanna die?

306
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,052
We'll vote on it.

307
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,637
You are?

308
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,932
Class prez.

309
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,811
One. Split up.

310
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,733
Two. Stay together.

311
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,199
-Okay, we voted to stay together, then.
-Is it smart to vote

312
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,743
on life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

313
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,038
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

314
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,499
You know, there's such a thing
as collective intelligence.

315
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,334
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

316
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,878
You can't make intelligence
with a bunch of idiots.

317
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,463
So then what do you suggest?

318
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,174
Do we vote about voting, huh?

319
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,302
Fuck! How the hell did
your kids survive up to now?

320
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,471
Sorry, but can you mind your own business?

321
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,807
You started the fight, now we're voting.

322
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
Give me an arrow, so I can stab him.

323
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,102
Anyway, let's move on now.

324
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,439
One. We make the outside higher.

325
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,533
Five votes.

326
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:04,993
Two.

327
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,496
We fold the lids, make a box.

328
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,170
So that's four.

329
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,672
What the hell? I thought you were with us?

330
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,883
I changed my mind.

331
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,345
Option one received the majority vote,
so make the walls high.

332
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,765
Wait. Your vote.

333
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,518
If you're for option two, it's a tie.

334
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,854
Option one.

335
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,314
Oh, shit.

336
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,609
Okay. Let's do it.

337
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,862
Okay, but don't resent me
when the zombies climb over

338
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,155
and kill us all.

339
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,949
Don't worry, I'll take the front
and any blame.

340
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,117
You hold back.

341
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,369
Oh, what an asshole. Fuck.

342
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,747
Why are kids so damn rude these days?

343
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,081
And you're not?

344
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,627
Don't say that in front
of the underclassmen.

345
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,715
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method precisely.

346
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,802
This is a sample from an infected.

347
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,263
The two viruses
are 98 percent match.

348
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,643
Are you saying everything he says
in the videos is true?

349
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,979
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

350
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,481
Only the virus survives.

351
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,983
It stimulates the brainstem
and moves the body.

352
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,819
They're like moving corpses.

353
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,656
We haven't found any way to save the dead.

354
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,536
You're telling me that he's dead?

355
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,332
Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

356
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,001
But she's, ugh…

357
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,920
Difficult to explain.

358
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,715
She was found alive.

359
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,012
There has never been a virus with such
a fast rate of infection in history.

360
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,849
Our only solution
is getting rid of the host.

361
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,102
I'm not going to tolerate
the sign of indifference!

362
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,312
Your only job is to find me a cure.

363
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,693
Commander, sir.

364
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,361
They broke through the barricade.

365
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,446
It's spreading into Yangdong.

366
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,950
How bad is the spread?

367
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,911
They're taking route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

368
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,914
<i>We sent army reservists</i>
<i>in the area to the barricades.</i>

369
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,963
Send all the reservists to create
a lockdown zone in Yangdong

370
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,381
and evacuate the city.

371
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,174
-Call in all the advisers.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,845
You said you had a friend in the NIS?

373
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,138
Yes.

374
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,931
Ask him to meet officially.

375
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,932
Yes, sir.

376
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,773
You have to tie
the knots harder.

377
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,609
Here too?

378
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,113
-I hope we're not doing…
-Can you do it?

379
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,948
-…anything stupid.
-My hands hurt.

380
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,034
-Just do it.
-Hey, that looks good.

381
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,660
Hand it to me. We're gonna die, anyway.

382
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,370
-Hey, come here.
-Me?

383
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,041
-I almost got killed confessing…
-Hey. Chocolate bar.

384
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,837
Let me see.

385
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,506
You think we can eat it, huh?

386
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,635
Oh, no, expired.

387
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,969
Okay, so what?

388
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,263
Okay, yeah, you're right.

389
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,733
Only take a tiny bite.

390
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,278
It needs to feed all of us. Okay?

391
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,452
Oh, shit. I said a tiny bite.

392
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,871
I only ate freaking this much.

393
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,248
Selfish bastard.

394
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm full, so…

395
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,113
Mmm.

396
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,211
I really don't want that. Here.

397
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,260
-Hey.
-What?

398
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,720
Joon-yeong didn't have any.

399
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,140
How could you eat it all?

400
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,811
I…

401
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,314
I… I thought I was last. I'm really sorry.

402
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,278
I guess we just… armor up, right?

403
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,367
-That asshole.
-Joon-yeong, you put on the best armor.

404
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,130
Take off your shoes
and I'll do yours first.

405
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,341
Just hold on a sec.

406
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,639
Hold on tight.

407
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,821
Hey, Cheong-san.

408
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,989
What?

409
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you really hate me?

410
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,371
Mm-mmm.

411
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,414
Why not?

412
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,457
Crazy.

413
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,918
I've never hated you at all.

414
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,420
That amazes me too.

415
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,441
This is it.

416
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,069
Here we go.

417
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:13,986
Hold on.

418
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,698
This will work?

419
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,326
It will work.

420
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,039
-Just stay next to me, okay?
-You stay next to me.

421
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,791
And don't get killed.

422
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,341
You don't want it, so we both can't move.

423
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,928
I'm scared.

424
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,399
I'm gonna take the lead.
You take the back.

425
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,323
Are you ready?

426
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,742
Shit.

427
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,370
You better be right with this.

428
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,497
We've seen so many zombies already.

429
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,668
They're not smart enough for this.

430
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,103
Push!

431
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,271
Hurry!

432
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,815
Let's go!

433
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,692
More!

434
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,693
Turn!

435
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
Turn!

436
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,781
Get in! Get in!

437
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,618
Close it!

438
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,623
Did you tie it?

439
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,708
Done! Push!

440
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,667
Push!

441
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,925
Push!

442
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,551
Damn it!

443
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,887
{\an8}They're climbing over!

444
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,934
It won't budge!

445
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,685
Push harder!

446
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,354
We can do this!

447
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,359
-Push harder! Harder!
-It won't move!

448
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,145
Be careful!

449
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,315
On-jo!

450
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,404
What are you doing? Push!

451
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,978
Su-hyeok! Above you!

452
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,941
Fuck!

453
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,915
Hey, are you okay?

454
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,294
Oh, shit.

455
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,890
Shit. I said I'd take responsibility.

456
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,810
-Where are you going?
-Hey, wait!

457
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,937
-Joon-yeong!
-Hey! Hey!

458
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,189
Joon-yeong!

459
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,191
-Where are you going?
-Hey! Don't go!

460
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,158
Get off!

461
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,705
Push! Push!

462
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,209
Hurry up and push!

463
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,643
Go home! Make it home!

464
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,604
Go home!

465
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,565
Make it home!

466
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,652
No! Hey!

467
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,115
-Ugh! Joon-seong!
-Keep going!

468
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
Keep going!

469
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,453
Keep going! Keep going…

470
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,584
No! No, stop it!

471
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,254
No! Wait!

472
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,507
I'm sorry!

473
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
Push!

474
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,232
Push!

475
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,031
Push!

476
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,458
Damn it!

477
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,125
HYOSAN

478
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,668
Each of those red dots

479
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,713
is the location
of a random cell phone in Hyosan.

480
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:54,595
At first, they begin with erratic movement
and that gives us nothing to analyze.

481
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,308
But slowly, they move collectively.

482
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,480
If you look at them as a whole,
they're traveling outward.

483
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,652
Because there is nobody left
in the city to eat.

484
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,239
They're slowly beginning
to increase their territory.

485
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,283
Consider them like a dangerous animal
in the mountains

486
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,411
entering civilization
when they run out of food.

487
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,164
Let's just cut to the chase.

488
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,417
You predicted a spread, right?

489
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,587
That's why you proposed
expanding martial law

490
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,422
to the NSC when Yangdong's gone.

491
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,930
So it isn't entirely precise.

492
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,682
But look.

493
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,478
In one week, it reaches Seongnam,
Hanam, Gwacheon, Anyang,

494
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,396
and Gwangmyeong.

495
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,901
Coming right after, the city of Seoul.

496
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,112
Seems a bit of a stretch, if you ask me.

497
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,655
Just one person.

498
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,949
It's a simulation of what will happen

499
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,535
if just one infected person
gets out of Hyosan.

500
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,417
That's what will happen.

501
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,799
Her heart rate
is reaching 250.

502
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,344
Abnormal heart rate detected!

503
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:34,361
I'M HUNGRY

504
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:44,121
Tell Tactics to come up
with a strategy to bomb Hyosan.

505
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,124
To bomb the city, sir?

506
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,753
Do you really plan to blow up Hyosan?

507
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,131
Hyosan may fall, but Korea will remain.

508
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,508
Act like a damn soldier.

509
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,468
We can't.

510
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,303
The infected are one thing,

511
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,513
but what about the civilians
that we haven't rescued?

512
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,849
Don't think about the ones
we have to kill.

513
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,435
The ones we will save
will justify everything.

514
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,824
{\an8}WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

515
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,611
Just a little bit more!

516
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,322
Untie it! Untie it!

517
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,578
It's untied! Push!

518
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,414
Push!

519
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,968
The door won't open!

520
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:21,885
Fuck.

521
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,095
What are you talking about?

522
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,388
The door won't open!

523
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,241
Ha-ri!

524
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,126
Fuckers! Get lost! Get out!

525
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,253
Let go! Damn it!

526
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,935
Come on. Hurry up already!

527
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,438
It won't open.
It's locked from the outside.

528
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,734
Shit.

529
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,324
Dad, you…
