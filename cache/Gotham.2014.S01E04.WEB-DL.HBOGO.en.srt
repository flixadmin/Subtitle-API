1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Jim.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,640
Hello, James. Old friend.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
- You must be Barbara.
- Yes, please come in.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,520
James, hi.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm Peter. Peter Humboldt.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,440
Lovely to meet you at last.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,320
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,920
Nice to meet you, Peter.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
I never meet Jim's friends.
He never tells me anything.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
- Men.
- Don't I know.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
- Would you like a drink?
- No.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
He's a work friend.
It's a work thing.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm just recently back in Gotham,
and I had an idea to pop by.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,880
Out of the blue.
But now is clearly not a good time.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
I'll walk you out.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,080
I told you never to come back here.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,240
I know. I know, I, I apologize.
But I just wanted to speak with you.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,800
No. If Falcone finds out
you're alive, he'll kill us both.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,160
I got no place else to go.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,920
Gotham is my home.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,280
I should have killed you.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,760
I should put a bullet
in your head right now.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
And you would have every right
to do so.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,680
But you won't, Jim Gordon.
You're a good man.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,240
You may very well be
the last good man in Gotham.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,680
And that's why I want to help you.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,160
- I don't want your help.
- No, no, but you need it.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,040
That vile creature Fish Mooney,

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,520
Don Falcone, the police.
Not even your own partner trusts you.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
They will always hide the truth
from you. But not me.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Never.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,440
- You saved my life.
- God knows I wish I hadn't.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Kill me now. Or trust me.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,640
I told you there's a war coming, Jim.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,160
There will be so many deaths.
So many.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
You wanna save Gotham?

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,880
I can help you.
I can be your secret agent.

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,720
Until Falcone finds out you're alive.

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,480
Nobody looks for a dead man.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,400
This war, what are you talking about?
Why will there be a war?

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,400
As you know,
war is just politics by other means.

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
And isn't politics just money?
Talking?

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
Talking about what?

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Arkham, of course.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
Ready to get some prime rib tonight?

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I am, sir.

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Excuse me.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Councilman Jenkins?

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,520
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm one of your constituents.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,120
Voted for you every time.

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Thank you very much, my friend.

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,560
I don't want to take up too much
of your valuable time.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,440
I just want to show you something.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Well, I'm always happy
to help constituents,

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
but perhaps you can come
by my office.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,280
Sir, please. Just one second.

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,480
Now, I got the idea for this
years ago.

58
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
Designed and built it myself.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,160
Here. Take a look

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
Go ahead. You just put your eye
on the end there.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
That's it.

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,600
- What is that thing?
- You'll see.

63
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
No, no, no.

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
You're next.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Honestly, sir,
I really did vote for you.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Hey, I'm working.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
{\an5}Caught a double homicide. You're up.

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,160
No way. Alvarez hasn't done
a case all week. It's his turn.

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,720
Alvarez put in double overtime
last week. Hey, Gordon.

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Captain.

71
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,560
{\an5}Councilman Ron Jenkins
and his aide were found dead

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,200
{\an5}in a parking structure this morning.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Still waiting on the ME's report.

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,240
Their wallets and jewelry
were missing.

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,240
Councilman?
Maybe it's a political hit.

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,960
No one hits councilmen.
It's cheaper to bribe them.

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,360
{\an5}You kill them and another bum
with his hand out takes his place.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
Sniff around City Hall if you want.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,440
{\an5}Smart money says this
is just wrong place, wrong time.

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
{\an5}Go work it.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
{\an5}Slave driver.

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Don't worry, Jim.

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,080
{\an5}I know just where to start.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>All at sea again</i>

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,840
{\an5}<i>And now my hurricanes</i>

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,240
{\an5}<i>Have brought down this ocean rain</i>

87
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
{\an5}She's got talent.

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
{\an5}- She's not bad-looking.
- That's plenty.

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Come to me so I can take you in.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
{\an5}You sing well.

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,040
{\an5}For this job I need more than a pair
of nice pipes and a pretty face.

92
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll do whatever it takes.

93
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
{\an5}I like hearing that.

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
{\an5}So you like boys or girls?

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Boys.

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
{\an5}Fine. Pretend I'm a boy.

97
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
{\an5}Seduce me.

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,920
{\an5}At least you can sing.

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
{\an5}Butch, put a pin in this one.

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
{\an5}We'll call you.

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,360
Not bad, but keep looking.

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
{\an5}Really, boss?
That's a good-looking girl.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,160
{\an5}Look at me.
I ain't looking for no girl.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm looking for a weapon.

105
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
{\an5}Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,120
{\an5}You're the crown prince
of parking lot muggers.

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,920
{\an5}No one's got a bigger rep.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,280
{\an5}I'm on sabbatical.

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,840
I didn't kill no one.
That's not my thing.

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Then why'd you have a shank
in your bag?

111
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,000
{\an5}Protection.

112
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
{\an5}Councilman Jenkins was murdered.

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,480
We know it was you.
We got witnesses.

114
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
I swear to God, I didn't do it.

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
{\an5}Hey.

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
{\an5}- Hey!
- He's not our guy, Harvey.

117
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
Alvarez, what's this?

118
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,080
Evidence from your crime scene.
A couple unis just dropped it off.

119
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Arkham?

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Forty acres. Twenty-six city blocks.

121
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,840
The last major undeveloped district
in the city of Gotham.

122
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Arkham.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,920
Now, before their untimely
and tragic deaths,

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Thomas and Martha Wayne
had a plan for their city.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,160
A progressive development plan,

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,400
that would raze Arkham's
shanty towns, and in its place,

127
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,840
build new, affordable housing
for Gotham's less fortunate.

128
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
- What about the old asylum, mayor?
- Torn down.

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
Brick by brick if need be.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,240
In its place, a cutting edge,

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,680
state of the art
mental health facility.

132
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,520
This is a vision
for the future of our city.

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,120
An opposing plan
is gaining support recently.

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,360
Then it would do away
with the asylum all together.

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,600
Use the surrounding land
as a waste disposal site.

136
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,200
No. No, the Wayne plan
is best for this city,

137
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,880
and more importantly,
for the people of this city.

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,000
This is why I am endorsing it.

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Don Maroni.

140
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,680
- Pleasure to see you.
- Thank you. How are you?

141
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Please, please, have a seat.
I'll bring wine and bread.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Today is a day of celebration.

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
A very lucrative deal
is coming my way.

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,040
Land, my friend. Land.
That's where the big money is.

145
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,280
I need information
about the Wayne plan for Arkham.

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,400
It's the Wayne plan in name only now.

147
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,600
When the Wayne's died,
Falcone stepped in.

148
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,920
He's back in the plan now.

149
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,640
And he stands to make
quite a chunk of change if it passes.

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,600
But Councilman Jenkins
was backing Falcone's plan.

151
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
That's right.

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
Then he was killed because...

153
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
Because, detective,

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,600
there is an opposing plan.

155
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Maroni.

156
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,080
He's the only one strong enough
to oppose Falcone.

157
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,880
He's making a play at Arkham.

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Are they related?

159
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
Bruce. How are you?

160
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,840
<i>"The new Arkham Asylum</i>

161
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,960
<i>will serve the mentally ill of Gotham
in ways the present asylum never can.</i>

162
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
<i>Those poor, sick souls
deserve our help."</i>

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
My mother wrote that.

164
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,680
She and my father fought for years
to get a new asylum built.

165
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,720
They thought that if they can help
the city's least fortunate...

166
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
it would show
there was hope for everyone.

167
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,480
I just don't want
my parents' dream to die with them.

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
I understand that, Bruce.

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,280
But this isn't just about the asylum.

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,480
If there's a fight
between Falcone and Maroni,

171
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
this could be the spark
that ignites a city-wide gang war.

172
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Innocents will die.

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,280
And whatever little faith people have
that police can protect them.

174
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
It will be crushed.

175
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
So you have to stop it.

176
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,200
- This is Gordon.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

177
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>Got a call.
Councilman Zeller's been abducted.</i>

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,080
<i>Listen, Gordon,
Zeller's one of Maroni's guys.</i>

179
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Be right there.

180
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,120
Please, don't. I'm begging you. Stop.

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
You know...

182
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,800
if it were up to me, this would be
over quick without all the fuss.

183
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,920
My father used to say, simplicity
is the ultimate sophistication.

184
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,280
But it's not up to me.

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,920
My customer specifically
asked me to send a message.

186
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,080
And you know what they say.

187
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,040
The customer is always right.

188
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,320
Please. You don't have to do this.

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Help, somebody!

190
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
No, wait!

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,680
Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.

192
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,120
I'll back the mayor!

193
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
I'll do anything he wants!

194
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Please, please! Please, help.
Please! Please! Plea...

195
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,120
Two councilmen dead in as many days.
Can't be a coincidence.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,080
Gotta be politics driving this.
He was right.

197
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,760
Never said he was wrong.
I just wanted him to be.

198
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,560
All right, genius.
Any other insights?

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Yeah, this is about the Arkham vote.

200
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
- How so?
- Arkham is more

201
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,920
than just a land deal.

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,040
It's a war between Falcone
and Maroni.

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,400
These councilmen
were on opposite sides of that war.

204
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
So who did who?

205
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,880
The way I see it,
Maroni struck first.

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,760
He had Jenkins killed
to change the vote his way.

207
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,480
Then Falcone retaliated.

208
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
Had Zeller killed
to change the vote back.

209
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Burning the body was Falcone's way
of sending a message.

210
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,360
I'll have guards put
on other councilmen

211
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
and the mayor until this plays out.

212
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
So you wanna tell me?

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,320
Come on. Falcone, Maroni, Arkham.

214
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,120
How the hell do you know
so much all of a sudden?

215
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,560
- Ed, what you got?
- I have a paradox for you.

216
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,240
- What?
- Well, a paradox,

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
detective, is when you...

218
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,160
I know what a paradox is, smart ass.
What paradox?

219
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,360
The medical examiner's reports

220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,360
on the murders of Councilman Jenkins
and his aide.

221
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,680
Both victims sustained fatal
puncture wounds

222
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,840
to the skull via the eye socket.

223
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,840
The weapon was some kind
of metal spike.

224
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
- Okay, so?
- Councilman Zeller,

225
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,120
also has wounds from a metal spike.

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,640
It's an extremely unlikely
coincidence, don't you think?

227
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
You're saying Zeller, Jenkins and the
aide were killed by the same person?

228
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,640
It would appear so, wouldn't it?

229
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Same killer working
for both Maroni and Falcone?

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
That's nuts.

231
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
Only in Gotham. Come on.

232
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,640
- Where we going?
- Go see a friend of mine.

233
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,000
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

234
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,720
You were snooping, you little worm.

235
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,880
I told you when I gave you this job

236
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,240
that in here, you don't see nothing,
you don't hear nothing.

237
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm sorry, sir. I beg your pardon.

238
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,520
You keep that sniveling nose of yours
to yourself, understood?

239
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Yes, sir.

240
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,440
Two cartons. Must be important.

241
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,360
- We're looking for a hit man.
- Yeah? Which family's he work for?

242
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,960
A few. He's an independent type,
like you.

243
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Not too many of them still around.

244
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
- Who'd they hit?
- Two city councilmen and an aide.

245
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
He uses a special weapon
to kill his victims.

246
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,040
A steel spike?

247
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,560
About so big?

248
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Could be.

249
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,560
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

250
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,520
His name is Gladwell. A real pro.

251
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,640
You know where we can find him?

252
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,800
Word was, he works out
of the Lansky building in Midtown.

253
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,360
You coming or what?
We got 12 more floors to check out.

254
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,960
What's got you so wound up?

255
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
Maybe I'm just doing my job.

256
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,760
No, you've been acting weird lately,
like you got something to hide.

257
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,440
G.C.P.D., ma'am. We're looking
for someone who may work here.

258
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,760
- Last name Gladwell.
- Oh, you mean Richard.

259
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,480
He works in Human Resources.

260
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,720
Richard's not in any trouble, is he?

261
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Which desk is his?

262
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,520
Third one from the back.

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,640
Gladwell. Richard Gladwell.
Has anyone seen him?

264
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,720
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?

265
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,200
He was just here.
Maybe he headed out the back?

266
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm gonna go check it out.
Stay here in case he comes back?

267
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,040
Jim, I found something.

268
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
Look what was in his desk.

269
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,120
Jenkins and Zeller. We got him.
Man, I love the easy ones.

270
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Freeze.

271
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,640
It's just a box of paper clips.
I didn't think anyone would mind.

272
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,640
Sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
CLM?

274
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
What do you think it means?

275
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know.

276
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
You all right?

277
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I'm fine.

278
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,480
- Why?
- Well...

279
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I heard screaming.

280
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Bad dream.

281
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Was I in it?

282
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Not this time.

283
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,840
Alfred, are there any more files
on the Arkham plan?

284
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Oh, yeah.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,560
Absolutely untold piles
of the bloody things.

286
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,760
I'd like to see them, please.

287
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
All of them.

288
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,720
And may I ask why?

289
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm looking for a connection.

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,280
Between the councilmen murders
and the murders of my parents.

291
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
I see.

292
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Nobody move. This is a robbery.

293
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,880
Money's in the back. Go, go!

294
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
What do you think you're doing?
Get over there.

295
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
Let's go. Move! Move!

296
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,640
Move. Out of my way.

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,080
Out of my way.

298
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Check the back.

299
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,120
They got the money, Frankie.

300
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
I got eyes, don't I?

301
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Thank goodness you're here.

302
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,280
They had guns, and Lou...

303
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,200
Lou was hit in the stomach. Is he...

304
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,560
Forget about Lou. Who did this?

305
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,840
They had masks. I couldn't see.

306
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,040
- But you got the money.
- Oh, yeah.

307
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,080
I managed to hide this bag,
but they got the rest.

308
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,240
- I'm sorry, I...
- Hey, relax, kid.

309
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,080
Save it for the boss.

310
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,400
You're off early for a change.

311
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I missed you.

312
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
You all right?

313
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,120
Long hours and late nights, Jim.
They make me worry.

314
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,040
- About what?
- All kinds of things.

315
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,080
- Just doing my job.
- Are you?

316
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,600
What is that supposed to mean?

317
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,560
It means I think you have secrets
from me.

318
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
And I hate it.

319
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,920
What do you want me to say, Barbara?
Yeah, I have secrets.

320
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,040
- It's part of my job. It's how...
- Who's Oswald Cobblepot?

321
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,680
- How do you know that name?
- Doesn't matter.

322
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Who is he?

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,560
- I can't even begin to answer that.
- Can't or won't?

324
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Montoya.

325
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,680
She came to see you, didn't she?

326
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes.

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,680
Why does she keep coming to you?
What is it between you and her?

328
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Years ago, before I was with you...

329
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,920
she and I were in a relationship.

330
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
What?

331
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,120
It only lasted a year.
And then I ended it and moved on.

332
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
And what? She didn't?

333
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I don't know.

334
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,920
I don't care, okay?

335
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Because you are the one that I want
to spend the rest of my life with.

336
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,960
- What? You're angry?
- What do you think?

337
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,720
- Because she's a woman?
- Because you lied to me.

338
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay, I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

339
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,560
Falcone thinks he can hit me

340
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,240
in my place of business
and get away with it?

341
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,800
He's got another thing coming,
Frankie. I want to hit him back.

342
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
This time where it hurts.

343
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
I wanna hit the Mouth.

344
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,440
His time's up.

345
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,200
I'll take care of him.

346
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,160
Then there's the other thing.

347
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Send him over.

348
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,400
You know, I'm a man
that shows appreciation

349
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,240
when appreciation is due.

350
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,760
Yes, Don Maroni.

351
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,840
What you did for me yesterday
did not go unnoticed.

352
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,360
Thank you, sir. I only wish
I was able to retrieve the other...

353
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,160
How long you been washing dishes?

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
- Not long.
- That ends today.

355
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,760
You've been promoted
to restaurant manager.

356
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,160
The position recently became
available.

357
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,800
Thank you, Don Maroni.
I won't let you down.

358
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're welcome.

359
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Frankie, get the kid a suit.

360
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
He's dead.

361
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,080
- Who?
- Richard Gladwell.

362
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
At least, the real one.

363
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
Sent some unis by his apartment,

364
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,800
found a moldy old corpse
sealed inside.

365
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
Puncture wound through the eye.
Been dead five years.

366
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,040
And no one found him until now?

367
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Landlord said he paid
his rent on time.

368
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,120
Kept quiet. The ideal tenant.

369
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
So our hit man killed this Gladwell
to use his identity as cover.

370
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,600
And it worked too.

371
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,240
Employee records, payroll,
contact information, all fake.

372
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,680
We got nothing but a face.

373
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Damn.

374
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,040
All right, there's gotta be something
to this.

375
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,880
CLM. You got any ideas?

376
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,240
It's a complete waste of time.

377
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,240
It's a lead. Our only lead.

378
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
- Says you.
- You can't be this lazy.

379
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,880
Lazy?
Maybe I just work smarter than you.

380
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,160
Ever consider that?

381
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,640
Yeah. I considered it.

382
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,320
Look, this Arkham vote is tomorrow,
we don't find this guy by then...

383
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,880
What? What happens?

384
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,280
Worst case? A major gang war.

385
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,200
People will die.
Maybe a lot of people.

386
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,520
We find this guy, we can stop it.

387
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
And where are you going?

388
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,360
To work the case.
You got your ways, I got mine.

389
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Hey, Harvey...

390
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
tell her I said hi.

391
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,840
<i>You hear laughter</i>

392
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
<i>Cracking through the halls</i>

393
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,560
<i>It sends you spinning</i>

394
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,320
<i>You have no choice</i>

395
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,360
<i>Following the footsteps</i>

396
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,480
<i>Of a rag doll dance</i>

397
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,280
<i>We are entranced</i>

398
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,760
<i>Spellbound</i>

399
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
<i>Spellbound</i>

400
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
<i>Spellbound</i>

401
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
What's your name?

402
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Liza.

403
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,520
How long have you been singing, Liza?

404
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Not long.

405
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
Do you like boys or girls?

406
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Boys.

407
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,040
So you want the job or what?

408
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
Well, you haven't told me
what it is yet.

409
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,440
You want to be a woman with power,
money and respect like me?

410
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,360
I guess. Yeah.

411
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,080
Are you willing to do whatever
it takes to have it all?

412
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,640
Yes, I am.

413
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
That's the job.

414
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Seduce me.

415
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
What?

416
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,200
You think I'm kidding.

417
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Harvey.

418
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
You see something you like?

419
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I do now.

420
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I need your help.

421
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,760
City councilmen
are dropping like flies.

422
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,040
- I heard.
- Bad for business.

423
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,200
You're not wrong.

424
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,520
The Button Man's called Gladwell.
You know him?

425
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,400
- Only by reputation.
- Think you can find him?

426
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,040
I can find anyone if I have the time.
The question is, what's in it for me?

427
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
I'll owe you.

428
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,640
Okay, but I still think
it's a waste of time, if you ask me.

429
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,600
Falcone will just get someone
to take his place.

430
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,480
- He's not going to let this bone go.
- Why's that?

431
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,600
Falcone cannot afford
to lose that vote.

432
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,040
If Maroni gets even
a piece of Arkham,

433
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,760
it'll only prove
what we already know.

434
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,040
And that is, Falcone is old and weak.

435
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
You seem kind of pleased about that.

436
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,120
How come?

437
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,880
Falcone goes down, so do you.

438
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,360
Harvey, don't you worry about me.

439
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
I always have a plan B.

440
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,720
Detective Gordon.

441
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
Hello, old friend.

442
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
What do you want?

443
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
To offer you help.

444
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,880
To prove that you can trust me.

445
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,040
There's gonna be another murder.

446
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,600
<i>- Maroni has put out the hit.</i>
- Who's the target?

447
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,800
Someone backing Falcone's plan.
Who it is, I can't be certain.

448
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
All the councilmen
are under police protection tonight.

449
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,480
There are many ways
around the police.

450
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,120
<i>But the hit will happen tonight.
That much I can be certain.</i>

451
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
How do you know this?

452
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
I told you, detective.
Gotham is my home.

453
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,920
I need a list of the officers working
police protection tonight.

454
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
<i>Officer Campos Officer Lazenby
Officer Martins</i>

455
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,640
Campos, Lazenby, Martins.

456
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,040
CLM.

457
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,080
<i>Hey, it's Harvey.</i>

458
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,840
Bullock, I found out
who Gladwell's next target is.

459
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
It's the mayor.

460
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,280
<i>Police</i>

461
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,840
Detective Gordon. What's going on?

462
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,360
Sir, I think your life may be
in danger.

463
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,600
I need to get you out of here.

464
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,160
What? No, I...

465
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm not going anywhere.
I got police protection.

466
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,040
- They're gone.
- What?

467
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
I just checked. No one's out there.

468
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
Sir, I think someone's coming here
to kill you.

469
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,920
I gotta get some things from my safe.

470
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,200
Sir, we need to go. Now.

471
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm moving as fast as I can.

472
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,760
Is there someplace I can take you?
Somewhere you'll be safe?

473
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,120
We're not going
to the police station?

474
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,960
Not sure you'll be safe there.
Police...

475
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,800
what the hell's this town coming to?

476
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,600
- Sir...
- All right, all right.

477
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,640
My sister's house. It's across town.

478
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Let's go.

479
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,640
Go. Go. Go.

480
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,120
- Is there another way out?
- Here.

481
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,560
He's trying to get in.

482
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,720
Shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?

483
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,720
He's got my gun, I can't. Go. Go. Go.

484
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Drop it!

485
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,040
Drop it, or I'll shoot.

486
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
You know why they hire
a professional?

487
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,440
Because he finishes the job.

488
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,840
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

489
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,360
Jim, I should've told you
about Montoya a long time ago.

490
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,240
- And why didn't you?
- I don't know.

491
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,480
Because she works with you.

492
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
Because she's a woman.

493
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,920
Are you sure there isn't another
reason?

494
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,760
No. There's nothing else.

495
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,680
Jim, I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

496
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
- Neither do I.
- Good.

497
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,640
So you'll tell me
who Oswald Cobblepot is.

498
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
Damn it, Barbara.
Why can't you drop this?

499
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,880
Why can't you just tell me who he is?

500
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Because...

501
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
it's work.

502
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,280
I know. But you told me
about your work before.

503
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,480
And that was a mistake.

504
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,480
One I am not going to make again.

505
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,920
All right, well...

506
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,280
I'm not going to live like this.

507
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,760
I can't live like this.

508
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,480
You're going to have to make
a choice, Jim.

509
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,920
You either let me in
or you let me go.

510
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,800
All right, I'm going to cut
to the chase.

511
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,240
I like you both,
but I only have one opening.

512
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,080
You've got the talent.

513
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
And you've got...

514
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
something else.

515
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,160
I can't decide. So you two are going
to have to do it for me.

516
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,160
You want us to fight for it?

517
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,480
So when do I start?

518
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
It's you.

519
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,080
Scared us there for a second.

520
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,360
We do good, or what?

521
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,440
Excellent work, my friends.
You were very convincing.

522
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,240
Yeah, I bet that manager thought so,
huh?

523
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
Ain't that right, Dickie?

524
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,720
Got any other joints
you want us to rob, let us know.

525
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,360
- There's good money in this.
- Good money.

526
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
What's that?

527
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,960
Oh, I brought cannoli.

528
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Hell, yeah.

529
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Eat up.

530
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,640
You guys deserve this.

531
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,720
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

532
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
It's really good.

533
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Real good.

534
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,320
<i>The Arkham development vote</i>

535
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,520
<i>has been a topic of controversy
for weeks.</i>

536
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,880
<i>Today we have the results.</i>

537
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,120
<i>We go live now
to Mayor James's press conference.</i>

538
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,520
Do you mind turning that down?
My head's killing me.

539
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Oh, shut up.

540
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,640
This is what we worked for.
We did this.

541
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,200
<i>How is today's outcome not simply
a failure of the Wayne plan?</i>

542
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,360
This is not a case of
either plan failing.

543
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,480
This is a case of compromise,

544
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,520
<i>for what's best for the people
of Gotham.</i>

545
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,040
<i>The Arkham district will be developed
into both low-cost housing,</i>

546
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,880
<i>as well as a much needed site
for waste disposal.</i>

547
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,320
<i>So this is the best of both plans.</i>

548
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,440
<i>Together in one.</i>

549
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,440
Yes. Yes.

550
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,680
For years, this city's been giving us
nothing but scraps.

551
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,880
But from now on...

552
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,920
From now on, we feast.

553
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,840
- Yeah.
- Yes.

554
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,640
Mayor James, what about the asylum?
What's going to happen to it?

555
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
<i>Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted</i>

556
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>to meet today's standards
and reopened.</i>

557
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,440
<i>Gotham needs... No, Gotham deserves,</i>

558
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,520
<i>a world-class treatment facility
for the mentally ill.</i>

559
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,800
Falcone took a shot
to the body today.

560
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,920
Maybe a few more
will put him on his back.

561
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,320
Looks like I got you just in time.

562
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,240
<i>And I know that the Waynes,
were they still alive,</i>

563
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,440
<i>would be proud of what
we've been able to accomplish today.</i>

564
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,200
The mayor's making this new plan
sound like it's good for Gotham.

565
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
- But it's not, is it?
- No, it's not.

566
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,440
Then why's he doing it?

567
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,760
He was caught between
two very powerful opposing forces.

568
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,160
Falcone and Maroni.

569
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,720
Maroni threatened the mayor's life.

570
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,560
Out of fear, I'm guessing,
the mayor made a compromise

571
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,680
and gave Maroni
a huge piece of Arkham.

572
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
What piece?

573
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Maroni gets to build
a waste disposal site.

574
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,240
And he gets the contract
to refurbish Arkham.

575
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,000
Falcone gets to build
a low-income housing project.

576
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
Look, Bruce...

577
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,080
I know it's not the outcome
you had hoped for.

578
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,680
But this compromise...

579
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,640
may have prevented
a lot of bloodshed.

580
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,760
May have even stopped a war.

581
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,480
My parents believed a new asylum
would bring hope to Gotham.

582
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,520
Now that's gone.

583
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,520
Everything they worked for is now
falling into the hands of criminals.

584
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Not everything.

585
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
You're alive.

586
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's not too late.

587
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,720
Do you really believe that?

588
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,120
Do you believe Gotham can be saved?

589
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,280
I believe it's worth trying.
