Nata. Why would I
be talking about your father?

250
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
What I was trying to explain is that

251
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,040
as a woman, you're going
to have to concede to certain things

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,320
because that's life.

253
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,680
And because that's men.

254
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
And it is much smarter
to compromise, move on, and forget

255
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,720
than to throw it all overboard.

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
You should thank me for not reporting you.

316
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
- But Nata, you said that...
- Listen to me.

317
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,960
You so much as think about blaming that
on me, I swear I'll get up and leave.

318
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,800
No. Sorry.

319
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
You were vile.

320
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I know.

321
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I've been apologizing since it happened.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
But how do I know
you won't act like that again?

323
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
Well, because I mean it.

324
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Since we broke up, I haven't slept at all.

325
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Yeah.

326
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,640
That has to be your guilty conscience, no?

327
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,240
Because you are the love of my life.

328
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,216
Don't fuck with me or I'll tell my mother,
and you can kiss Canada goodbye.

You need to work hard for it.

I want everyone to see
that you're desperate to get back with me

and that you'll do
whatever it takes to get me back.

Okay.

338

And I want a proper first date.

You'll have it, I swear.

If you do a good job, I may

342
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,160
potentially give you a second chance.

Yeah, he was pissed.

So yeah, in the end
we managed to come back.

[Nata] Yeah, I saw it.

- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

352

Mmm.

353
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,040
So, when are you coming back
to watch me play?

354
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,280
I'll dedicate a goal to you.

I'm right behind you.

- No, I'm not. So calm down, okay?

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
I don't understand
why you're even speaking to him.

It's done. Nothing happened.

Would you please cut the shit?

They were gonna rape you, Nata,

Uh, no, they weren't gonna rape me.

Right. And are you into it?

Well, no! I'm not!

374
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,456
- That's why we didn't do it.
- That's why you didn't do it?

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
Nata, can't you fucking see, girl?

You had no power at all,
this is beyond messed up.

Look, Alma, not everything
is black and white, okay?

He's apologized a million times.

And that's that. It's my fucking decision.

Yeah, you're becoming

Aha.

Could you grade these tomorrow?

REALLY? WHAT?

IT WON'T BE A SURPRISE

Uh, I'm having a hard time
holding all these snacks.

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Wanna lend a hand?

I just want us to speak, please, Mer.

I knew they'd be hard to resist, so I, um...

You and your trickery, huh?

Again with that?

that I will not even try
to make any sort of move on you.

498
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,080
I just want us to go somewhere where we

499
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
can talk about nothing
or we can smoke a blunt, and that's all.

Okay, fine.

Fine. If that's what you want,
I'll respect that.

507
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
And I'll disappear.

well, please tell me, okay?

514
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,480

Is that a yes or a no?

518

you can be friends with her, honestly.

she's not your biggest fan.

That so? Is there a story there?

she didn't want to hear about Alberto,

628
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,360
and now that they're together again,
so basically I'm the bad guy.

Right, typical.

because of that too.

there'd be no doubt in my mind

Right.

00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,680
We all feel pretty positive
that you'll be able to graduate.

to see this face for one more year.

With your friends?

Everything okay, any problems?

No.

Not really.

647
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,200
I mean, I'm the problem 'cause, uh...
I'm a bit lost.

648
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,160
I just... I just don't understand you.

You're extremely intelligent, Alma.

650

What's going on?

651
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,320
Well, it's like everyone seems
to know what they're doing and I don't.

652
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,280
I'm not like everyone else.

653
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,680
Well, what a blessing
not to be like everyone else.

654
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Huh?

655
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,840
I think that says
you're someone very special.

656
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,240
You're just saying that
because I feel low.

657
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
No, not at all.

658

Although, yes, perhaps you're right.
Your self-esteem seems low.

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,320
You're not interested
in your studies, I mean...

It's possible
those two things are related.

Don't you see, it's a trap, Alma?

675

That's how it began with me.

You wanna go through that?

No, obviously I don't!
But if he tries anything with me...

What? If he tries something
with you, then what?

679
