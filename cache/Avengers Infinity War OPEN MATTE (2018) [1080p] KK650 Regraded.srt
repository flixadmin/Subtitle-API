1
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:30,694
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel</i> Statesman.

2
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:36,909
<i>We are under assault.
I repeat, we are under assault.</i>

3
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:40,621
<i>The engines are dead, life support failing.</i>

4
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:43,749
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range.</i>

5
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,877
<i>We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.</i>

6
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,133
<i>Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.
We have very few soldiers here.</i>

7
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,262
<i>This is not a warcraft.
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.</i>

8
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:12,736
Hear me and rejoice.

9
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:21,537
You have had the privilege
of being saved by the Great Titan.

10
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,709
You may think this is suffering.

11
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:28,919
No.

12
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:32,298
It is salvation.

13
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:41,724
Universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,810
Smile.

15
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:50,649
For even in death,
you have become Children of Thanos.

16
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,125
I know what it's like to lose.

17
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:13,255
To feel so desperately that you're right...

18
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,759
yet to fail, nonetheless.

19
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,477
It's frightening.

20
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:29,772
Turns the legs to jelly.

21
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,026
But I ask you, to what end?

22
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:38,030
Dread it, run from it...

23
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,617
destiny arrives all the same.

24
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,662
And now, it's here.

25
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,081
Or should I say...

26
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,917
I am.

27
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,715
You talk too much.

28
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,426
The Tesseract.

29
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,971
Or your brother's head.

30
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:09,019
I assume you have a preference.

31
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,564
Oh, I do.

32
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:14,984
Kill away.

33
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,375
All right, stop!

34
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:36,922
We don't have the Tesseract.

35
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,883
It was destroyed on Asgard.

36
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:52,563
You really are the worst brother.

37
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,528
I assure you, brother...

38
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,697
the sun will shine on us again.

39
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,577
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

40
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:10,706
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

41
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,248
And for another...

42
00:04:14,543 --> 00:04:15,753
we have a Hulk.

43
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,809
Let him have his fun.

44
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:23,571
Allfathers...

45
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:28,701
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

46
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:30,619
time.

47
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:46,927
That was a mistake.

48
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:54,477
No!

49
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:06,238
You're going to die for that.

50
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,251
My humble personage...

51
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,963
bows before your grandeur.

52
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,470
No other being has ever had the might...

53
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,555
nay, the nobility...

54
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:36,644
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

55
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:44,527
The universe lies within your grasp.

56
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:26,527
There are two more stones on Earth.

57
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:31,490
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

58
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,200
Father, we will not fail you.

59
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:34,869
If I might interject.

60
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,331
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

61
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:42,877
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

62
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,254
If you consider failure experience.

63
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:48,174
I consider experience experience.

64
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,885
Almighty Thanos...

65
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:55,848
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

66
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:00,853
Odinson...

67
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:06,692
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

68
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:09,195
god of mischief...

69
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,572
do hereby pledge to you...

70
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,869
my undying fidelity.

71
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:28,923
Undying?

72
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:35,387
You should choose your
words more carefully.

73
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:57,910
You...

74
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,621
will never be...

75
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,416
a god.

76
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,761
No!

77
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,237
No resurrections this time.

78
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,013
No. Loki.

79
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,721
<i>Seriously, you don't have any money?</i>

80
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,933
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

81
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,392
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

82
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,479
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

83
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,438
Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

84
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,606
Dollars?

85
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,107
- Rupees.
- Which is?

86
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,109
Buck and a half.

87
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,486
What do you want?

88
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,280
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

89
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,711
Thanos is coming.

90
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,505
He's coming.

91
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,969
Who?

92
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:23,428
AVENGERS

93
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,800
INFINITY WAR

94
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:29,853
Slow down, slow down.

95
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:31,915
- I'll spell it out for you. No, I'm not.
- You're totally rambling. You lost me.

96
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:34,819
Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee.

97
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:35,860
- Yeah.
- Okay.

98
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,547
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.
There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?"

99
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:39,631
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.

100
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:40,966
- "I'm gonna go in my pants."
- And then you wake up...

101
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,670
and in real life you actually have to pee.

102
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:43,868
- Yes.
- Yeah.

103
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,161
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.

104
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:47,047
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

105
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:51,333
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt
we had a kid.

106
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,169
It was so real.

107
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,963
We named him after your eccentric uncle.
What was his name?

108
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,382
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.

109
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,176
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.

110
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:01,927
...and thought that we were...

111
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,179
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

112
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:04,345
- Yes?
- No.

113
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:05,907
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

114
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:09,351
If you wanted to have a kid,
you wouldn't have done that.

115
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,979
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

116
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,623
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

117
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:16,418
- You're not helping your case, okay?
- No, this is detachable. It's not a...

118
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:17,902
You don't need that.

119
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,555
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us...

120
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,281
and future usses and that's it.

121
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,092
Just in case there's a
monster in the closet.

122
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,035
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.

123
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,163
You know me so well.

124
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,957
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.

125
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,376
You should have shirts in your closet.

126
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:35,753
Yeah.

127
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:38,440
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

128
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:39,816
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

129
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,425
Show off this Harry Winston.

130
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,345
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

131
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,554
I should promise you.

132
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,014
- Yes.
- I will.

133
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:50,475
Thank you.

134
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,769
Tony Stark.

135
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,939
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

136
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,527
Congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

137
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,533
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

138
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:03,072
We need your help.

139
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:07,117
It's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake.

140
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,702
And who's "we"?

141
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,497
Hey, Tony.

142
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:12,665
Bruce.

143
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,458
- Pepper.
- Hi.

144
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,088
You okay?

145
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:24,093
At the dawn of the universe,
there was nothing.

146
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Then...

147
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,641
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

148
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:33,644
hurtling across the virgin universe.

149
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:39,233
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

150
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,360
Space.

151
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:43,654
Reality.

152
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,448
Power.

153
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:48,826
Soul.

154
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,120
Mind.

155
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,290
And Time.

156
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,050
Tell me his name again.

157
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,427
Thanos.

158
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,847
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

159
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:12,141
He wipes out half the population.

160
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:14,018
He sent Loki.

161
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:17,563
The attack on New York, that's him.

162
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,273
This is it.

163
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:21,358
What's our timeline?

164
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,736
No telling. He has the Power
and Space Stones.

165
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,583
That already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole universe.

166
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:29,950
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

167
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:33,329
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

168
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:35,456
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

169
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:37,684
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

170
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,709
Is that what it is?

171
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:43,881
I'm going to allow that.

172
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:49,154
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

173
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:50,179
No can do.

174
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,057
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

175
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,936
And I swore off dairy, but then Ben
& Jerry's named a flavor after me.

176
00:14:57,102 --> 00:14:58,562
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.

177
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,105
A bit chalky.

178
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,958
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge
is our favorite.

179
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,360
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

180
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,279
Our oath to protect the Time Stone
cannot change.

181
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,633
And this stone may be the best chance
we have against Thanos.

182
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:12,535
Yeah, so conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us.

183
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,078
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

184
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,956
What is your job exactly?
Besides making balloon animals.

185
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,626
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

186
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:23,295
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

187
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:26,715
The fact is we have this stone.
We know where it is.

188
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:31,303
Vision is out there somewhere with the
Mind Stone and we have to find him now.

189
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,514
Yeah, that's the thing.

190
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,681
What do you mean?

191
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:38,060
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

192
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,478
- What?
- Yeah.

193
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,564
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

194
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,983
I didn't lose him.
He's more than that. He's evolving.

195
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,609
Who could find Vision then?

196
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:49,613
Shit.

197
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,282
Probably Steve Rogers.

198
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,616
Oh, great.

199
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,285
Maybe.

200
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,911
But...

201
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:00,499
Call him.

202
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,543
It's not that easy.

203
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,427
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

204
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:06,588
No.

205
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,340
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

206
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,050
Broke up?

207
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,846
Like a band? Like the Beatles?

208
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,931
Cap and I fell out hard.

209
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,100
We're not on speaking terms.

210
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,062
Tony, listen to me.

211
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,482
Thor's gone.

212
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:29,069
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

213
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,338
Flip phone.

214
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,922
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?

215
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,073
Not at the moment, no.

216
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,065
You okay?

217
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,734
- Help him!
- Banner!

218
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:52,486
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!

219
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:53,755
Friday, what am I looking at?

220
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,114
<i>Not sure. I'm working on it.</i>

221
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:58,617
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!

222
00:17:58,784 --> 00:17:59,994
Might wanna use it.

223
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,732
Ned, hey.
I need you to cause a distraction.

224
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,192
Holy shit.

225
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,027
We're all gonna die!

226
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,403
There's a spaceship!

227
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,280
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!

228
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,792
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?

229
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,474
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.

230
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:04,809
<i>Will do.</i>

231
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,090
Hear me and rejoice.

232
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:41,053
You are about to die
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

233
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,392
Be thankful that your meaningless
lives are now contributing...

234
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

235
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,398
You better pack it up and get outta here.

236
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:53,691
Stonekeeper.

237
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,902
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

238
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,863
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

239
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,740
You're trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

240
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:04,201
He means get lost, Squidward.

241
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:05,536
He exhausts me.

242
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,663
Bring me the stone.

243
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,749
Banner, you want a piece?

244
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,503
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want?

245
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,671
That's right.

246
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,590
Okay. Push!

247
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,216
It's been a while.

248
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,903
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

249
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,051
Okay.

250
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:24,889
Let me just...
I need to concentrate here for a second.

251
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,348
Come on, come on, man.

252
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,850
God!

253
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,061
Where's your guy?

254
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,999
I don't know.
We've sorta been having a thing.

255
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,208
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.

256
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:36,792
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

257
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,218
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

258
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,161
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.

259
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:48,162
It's okay.

260
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,706
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

261
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,208
- I have him.
- Damn it.

262
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,070
Where'd that come from?

263
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:23,405
<i>It's nanotech. You like it?
A little something I...</i>

264
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,704
Doctor Banner, if the rest of
your green friend won't be joining us...

265
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,775
<i>Gotta get that stone outta here, now.</i>

266
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,092
It stays with me.

267
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:44,259
Exactly. Bye.

268
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,146
Tony, you okay?

269
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:56,438
How we doing? Good? Bad?

270
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:58,625
<i>Really, really good. Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?</i>

271
00:21:58,649 --> 00:21:59,942
I'm trying. He won't come out.

272
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:02,903
<i>Hammer.</i>

273
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,539
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

274
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,833
Come out! Come out! Come out!

275
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,210
No!

276
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,883
What do you mean, "no"?

277
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,265
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

278
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:34,226
- <i>Kid, where'd you come from?</i>
- A field trip to MoMA.

279
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,790
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

280
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,942
He's from space. He came here
to steal a necklace from a wizard.

281
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:12,264
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular with children.

282
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,019
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

283
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,146
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

284
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:37,289
You'll find removing
a dead man's spell troublesome.

285
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,125
You'll only wish you were dead.

286
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:50,552
No!

287
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,058
<i>Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.</i>

288
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,768
On it!

289
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:06,569
Not cool.

290
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,990
<i>Gotcha!</i>

291
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,325
Wait!

292
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,670
Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

293
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,130
<i>Hang on, kid.</i>

294
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,818
<i>Wong, you're invited to my wedding.</i>

295
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,607
Give me a little juice, Friday.

296
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:06,837
Unlock 17:A.

297
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,610
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

298
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,687
But you said save the wizard!

299
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:25,105
I can't breathe.

300
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:28,198
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

301
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,278
Yeah. That makes sense.

302
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:50,464
Mr. Stark,
it smells like a new car in here!

303
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,631
<i>Happy trails, kid.</i>

304
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:53,175
- <i>Friday, send him home.
- Yep.</i>

305
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,594
Oh, come on!

306
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,021
<i>Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.</i>

307
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,274
<i>Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right? What's going on?</i>

308
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,110
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might
have to push our 8:30 res.</i>

309
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:12,277
<i>Why?</i>

310
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:15,364
<i>Just 'cause I'll probably not
make it back for a while.</i>

311
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
<i>Tell me you're not on that ship.</i>

312
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,701
Yeah.

313
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,345
<i>God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.</i>

314
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:21,954
Honey, I'm sorry.

315
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,415
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

316
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:24,766
<i>Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.</i>

317
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,834
- Pep.
- <i>Come back here right now.</i>

318
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,002
<i>Come back.</i>

319
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,087
<i>Boss, we're losing her.</i>

320
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:32,298
<i>I'm going too.</i>

321
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,641
Oh, my God!

322
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:49,064
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

323
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:04,788
Where you going?

324
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,457
The Time Stone's been taken.

325
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,542
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

326
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:10,628
What will you do?

327
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,088
I'm gonna make a call.

328
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:54,547
Sing it, Drax!

329
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,519
Why are we doing this again?

330
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,397
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

331
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,649
I get that, but why are we doing it?

332
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,609
'Cause we're nice.

333
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,672
And maybe whoever it is will give us
a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

334
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,031
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.

335
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:22,908
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

336
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,118
We take his ship.

337
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,953
- Exactly!
- Bingo!

338
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
All right!

339
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:31,792
We are arriving.

340
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,563
All right, Guardians,
don't forget this might be dangerous...

341
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,881
so let's put on our mean faces.

342
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:44,763
Groot, put that thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.

343
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:45,973
Groot.

344
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,266
I am Groot!

345
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,433
- Whoa!
- Language!

346
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,810
- Hey!
- Wow.

347
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,645
You got some acorns on you, kid.

348
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,440
Ever since you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.

349
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:58,652
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash
that thing to pieces.

350
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,119
What happened?

351
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh, my God.

352
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,840
Looks like we're not getting paid.

353
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,053
Wipers! Wipers!

354
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,513
Get it off.

355
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,939
How the hell is this dude still alive?

356
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:36,899
He is not a dude.

357
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,609
You're a dude.

358
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,987
This is a man.

359
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,115
A handsome, muscular man.

360
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:46,282
I'm muscular.

361
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,967
But who are you kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich away from fat.

362
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:49,829
Yeah, right.

363
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,414
- It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.
- What?

364
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,710
Gamora, do you think I'm...

365
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:02,591
He is anxious, angry.

366
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,636
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

367
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:09,265
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

368
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:10,431
Wow.

369
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,393
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

370
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,397
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

371
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,041
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

372
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:21,277
It's like his muscles
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

373
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:23,154
Stop massaging his muscles.

374
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,114
Wake him up.

375
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,035
Wake.

376
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:49,889
Who the hell are you guys?

377
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:56,312
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

378
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,441
To bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life.

379
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:05,029
He used to kill people
planet by planet, massacre by massacre.

380
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,697
Including my own.

381
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,449
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

382
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,826
he can do it
with the snap of his fingers like this.

383
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,413
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

384
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,375
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

385
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,507
Your father killed my brother.

386
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,050
Oh, boy.

387
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,885
Stepfather, technically.

388
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,970
And she hates him as much as you do.

389
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:35,226
Families can be tough.

390
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:38,562
Before my father died, he told me
that I had a half-sister...

391
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,981
that he imprisoned in Hel.

392
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:44,109
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

393
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:45,569
So I had to kill her.

394
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:49,114
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...

395
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,950
I feel your pain.

396
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:53,410
I feel your pain as well, because...

397
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:55,955
I mean, it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

398
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,790
My father killed my mother.

399
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,668
And then I had to kill my father.
That was hard.

400
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,712
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

401
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,133
Plus, I came out with both my eyes,
which was...

402
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,009
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

403
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,931
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of...

404
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:17,017
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

405
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,479
- What are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

406
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,982
No, you're not.

407
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,988
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

408
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:32,867
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

409
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,412
- No.
- You are.

410
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,290
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

411
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,624
No, I'm not.

412
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,835
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

413
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,009
Are you mocking me?

414
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,387
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

415
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,116
- He's trying to copy me.
- I need you to stop doing that.

416
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,766
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.

417
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,310
We need to stop Thanos.

418
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,104
Which means we need to find out
where he's going next.

419
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,522
Knowhere.

420
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:05,357
He must be going somewhere.

421
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:07,526
No, no. Knowhere?

422
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,362
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

423
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,948
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

424
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:16,535
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

425
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:17,870
Because for years...

426
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,707
the Reality Stone's been safely stored
there with a man called the Collector.

427
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,602
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

428
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,336
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

429
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,879
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...

430
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,590
he's not going for one of the other stones?

431
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,134
There are six stones out there.

432
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,512
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

433
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:37,973
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

434
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:40,476
He stole the Space Stone from me...

435
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,312
when he destroyed my ship
and slaughtered half my people.

436
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,240
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

437
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,776
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

438
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,069
Like Kevin Bacon?

439
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,756
He may be on the team. I don't know.
I haven't been there in a while.

440
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,990
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

441
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:56,784
No one even knows where it is.

442
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,246
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

443
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:02,832
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

444
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,041
You're welcome.

445
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,519
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

446
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,255
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

447
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,633
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

448
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:14,802
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

449
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,595
That place is a legend.

450
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:20,307
They make the most powerful, horrific
weapons to ever torment the universe.

451
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,518
I would very much like to go there, please.

452
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,871
The rabbit is correct and clearly
the smartest among you.

453
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:25,938
Rabbit?

454
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,357
Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me
the weapon I need.

455
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,844
I assume you're the captain, sir.

456
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,901
You're very perceptive.

457
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,948
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

458
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,907
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

459
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,826
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

460
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,995
- Except for that I'm the captain.
- Quiet.

461
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,872
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.

462
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,665
Look, this is my ship.

463
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,584
And I'm not goin' to...

464
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,670
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

465
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,088
The Thanos-killing kind.

466
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,567
Don't you think that we should all
have a weapon like that?

467
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,634
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

468
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,280
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed into madness.

469
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,222
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

470
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:01,557
A little bit, yeah.

471
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,643
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

472
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,353
he'll be too powerful to stop.

473
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,689
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

474
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,026
We got two ships
and a large assortment of morons.

475
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,446
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

476
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,449
And the morons will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.

477
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,534
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

478
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,994
For the record...

479
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,345
I know that you're going with him
because it's where Thanos isn't.

480
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:29,126
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

481
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,420
Come on, Groot.

482
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,673
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

483
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:41,222
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

484
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:42,515
Bye.

485
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,489
Vis?

486
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,866
Is it the stone again?

487
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,660
It's as if it's speaking to me.

488
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:04,995
What does it say?

489
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,249
I don't know, but something.

490
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,710
Hey.

491
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,056
Tell me what you feel.

492
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,774
I just feel you.

493
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,868
So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...

494
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,179
which would give us more time together
before you went back.

495
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,663
What if I miss that train?

496
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,831
There's an 11:00.

497
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,417
What if I missed all the trains?

498
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,503
What if this time I didn't go back?

499
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,005
But you gave Stark your word.

500
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,339
I'd rather give it to you.

501
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,609
Well, there are people
who are expecting me too, you know.

502
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:00,968
We both made promises.

503
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,845
Not to each other.

504
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,429
Wanda.

505
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,558
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

506
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,768
trying to see if this could work and...

507
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,520
I don't know.

508
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,647
You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

509
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,524
I think...

510
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,775
- It works.
- It works.

511
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,235
It works.

512
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,947
Stay.

513
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,533
Stay with me.

514
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,541
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

515
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,342
What are they?

516
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:44,094
What the stone was warning me about.

517
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,397
I have to go.

518
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,564
No, Vision.

519
00:37:57,107 --> 00:38:01,237
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

520
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,322
Wanda, I...

521
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,489
Vision!

522
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:36,397
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

523
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:39,314
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

524
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,069
My systems are failing.

525
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

526
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Vis!

527
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,672
Give up the stone, and she lives.

528
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,003
Hands off.

529
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,062
Come on. Come on.

530
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,022
Come on, you gotta get up.

531
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,399
You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

532
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,902
Hey. We have to go.

533
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,365
Please. Please leave.

534
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,325
You asked me to stay.

535
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,744
- I'm staying.
- Please.

536
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,650
- Get up.
- I can't.

537
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,528
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

538
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,864
You'll never get the chance again.

539
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,381
Can you stand?

540
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,554
Thank you, Captain.

541
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,892
Let's get you on the jet.

542
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,274
Now, I thought we had a deal.

543
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,153
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

544
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,655
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,615
We just wanted time.

546
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,577
Where to, Cap?

547
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,915
Home.

548
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,546
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

549
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,155
<i>Zehobereians.</i>

550
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,031
Mother! Where's my mother?

551
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,575
<i>Choose a side or die.</i>

552
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,201
Mother!

553
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,537
<i>One side is a revelation...</i>

554
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,748
<i>the other an honor known only to a few.</i>

555
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,126
What's wrong, little one?

556
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,172
My mother. Where is my mother?

557
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,178
What's your name?

558
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,181
Gamora.

559
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,808
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

560
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,352
Come.

561
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,729
Let me help you.

562
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,368
Look.

563
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,707
Pretty, isn't it?

564
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,920
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

565
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,840
Too much to one side or the other...

566
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,680
Here. You try.

567
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,521
<i>Now, go in peace to meet your maker.</i>

568
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,319
Concentrate.

569
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,075
There. You've got it.

570
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,669
Gamora.

571
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,090
Do you know if these grenades are the
blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

572
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,009
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

573
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,696
- But I don't want to if they're the...
- I need to ask a favor.

574
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,764
Yeah, sure.

575
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,727
One way or another,
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

576
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,981
Which is what the grenades are for.

577
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,234
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

578
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,571
If things go wrong...

579
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,324
If Thanos gets me...

580
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,831
I want you to promise me...

581
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,000
you'll kill me.

582
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:12,834
What?

583
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,299
I know something he doesn't.

584
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,513
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe could be at risk.

585
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,265
What do you know?

586
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,476
If I tell you, you'd know too.

587
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,355
If it's so important...

588
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,522
shouldn't I?

589
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,858
Only if you wanna die.

590
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,145
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

591
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,029
Just...

592
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,451
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

593
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,953
I mean, I'd like to.

594
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,955
I really would. But you...

595
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,332
Swear to me.

596
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,129
Swear to me on your mother.

597
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,303
Okay.

598
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,353
Okay.

599
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,330
Dude. How long have you
been standing there?

600
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,497
An hour.

601
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,125
An hour?

602
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,960
Are you serious?

603
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:41,048
I've mastered the ability of standing
so incredibly still...

604
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,844
that I become invisible to the eye.

605
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,470
Watch.

606
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,976
You're eating a zarg-nut.

607
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,853
But my movement...

608
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,313
was so slow...

609
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,983
that it's imperceptible.

610
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,151
No.

611
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,570
I'm sure I'm invisible.

612
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,904
Hi, Drax.

613
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,616
Damn it.

614
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,346
This place looks deserted.

615
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,266
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

616
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,351
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

617
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,229
Let's put down right here.

618
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,534
I don't have it.

619
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,873
Everyone in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...

620
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,105
if you thought it would
add even the slightest

621
00:47:58,117 --> 00:47:59,752
trinket to your
pathetic collection.

622
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,970
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

623
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,391
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

624
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,230
I told you.

625
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,023
I sold it.

626
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,903
Why would I lie?

627
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,280
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

628
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,825
Like suicide.

629
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,493
You do understand.

630
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,455
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

631
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,998
I didn't know what it was.

632
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,960
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

633
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,336
It's him.

634
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,963
Last chance, charlatan.

635
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,466
Where's the stone?

636
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,634
Today...

637
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,176
Drax. Drax.

638
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,179
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

639
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,346
Drax, wait.

640
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,183
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

641
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,560
Drax.

642
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,732
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

643
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,152
He doesn't have the stone yet.

644
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,945
If we get it, then we can stop him.

645
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,949
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

646
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,200
No.

647
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,412
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

648
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,164
Sleep.

649
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,093
Okay.

650
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,347
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

651
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:37,975
The other right.

652
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,001
Why?

653
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:18,057
Why you, daughter?

654
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,701
That was quick.

655
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,379
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

656
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,425
<i>Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?</i>

657
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,056
<i>In my heart, I knew you still cared.</i>

658
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,692
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

659
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,745
<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

660
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,168
That is, it was.

661
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,588
Now...

662
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,384
reality can be whatever I want.

663
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,387
You knew I'd come.

664
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,181
I counted on it.

665
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,893
There's something we need to discuss,
little one.

666
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,232
Thanos!

667
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,866
No!

668
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,830
Let her go, Grimace.

669
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,456
Peter.

670
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,001
I told you to go right.

671
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,961
Now? Really?

672
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,546
You let her go!

673
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:14,673
The boyfriend.

674
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,841
No.

675
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,720
Like to think of myself more as
a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

676
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,931
- Let her go.
- Peter.

677
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:26,811
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin
right off your face.

678
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,896
Not him.

679
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,077
You promised. You promised.

680
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:48,457
Oh, daughter.

681
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,418
You expect too much from him.

682
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,590
She's asked, hasn't she?

683
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:01,554
Do it.

684
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,311
Do it!

685
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,486
I told you to go right.

686
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,408
I love you more than anything.

687
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,037
I love you too.

688
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,386
I like him.

689
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,002
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

690
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,797
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

691
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,342
<i>On a stolen Quinjet with four
of the world's most wanted criminals.</i>

692
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:23,280
You know they're only criminals because

693
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:25,052
you've chosen to call them
that, right, sir?

694
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,263
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

695
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,642
<i>Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.</i>

696
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:32,394
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

697
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:36,357
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

698
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,858
That's right.

699
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,695
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

700
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,072
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

701
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,949
Not anymore.

702
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,373
Mr. Secretary.

703
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,587
<i>You got some nerve.</i>

704
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:00,881
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

705
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,800
You could use some of that right now.

706
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,886
<i>The world's on fire.</i>

707
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,765
<i>And you think all is forgiven?</i>

708
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:14,436
I'm not looking for forgiveness.
And I'm way past asking permission.

709
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,440
Earth just lost her best defender.

710
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,151
So we're here to fight.

711
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,654
And if you wanna stand in our way...

712
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,574
we'll fight you too.

713
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:30,828
<i>Arrest them.</i>

714
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,539
All over it.

715
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,004
That's a court-martial.

716
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:43,545
It's great to see you, Cap.

717
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:45,885
You too, Rhodey.

718
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:47,428
Hey.

719
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,056
Wow. You guys...

720
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:53,893
really look like crap.

721
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,644
Must've been a rough couple years.

722
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,481
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

723
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,108
I think you look great.

724
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,242
Yeah, I'm back.

725
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:12,912
Hi, Bruce.

726
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,460
Nat.

727
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,423
This is awkward.

728
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,612
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

729
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:29,804
And they can clearly find us.

730
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,181
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

731
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:35,559
After the whole Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.

732
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,370
It was too tough on their families.
They're on house arrest.

733
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,687
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

734
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,314
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

735
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,232
Okay, look.

736
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:45,194
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

737
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:48,781
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

738
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:51,783
Vision's stone.

739
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,077
Then we have to protect it.

740
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,870
No, we have to destroy it.

741
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,559
I've been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.

742
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,085
About its nature.

743
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,796
But also its composition.

744
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:07,883
I think if it were exposed to
a sufficiently powerful energy source...

745
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,887
something very similar
to its own signature, perhaps...

746
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,641
its molecular integrity could fail.

747
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,435
Yeah, and you with it.

748
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,354
We're not having this conversation.

749
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:24,608
Eliminating the stone is the only way
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

750
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,361
That's too high a price.

751
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,243
Only you have the power to pay it.

752
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,541
Thanos threatens half the universe.

753
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,252
One life cannot stand in the way
of defeating him.

754
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,837
But it should.

755
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,716
We don't trade lives, Vision.

756
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,843
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

757
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,803
to save how many millions of people?

758
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,014
Tell me, why is this any different?

759
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,475
Because you might have a choice.

760
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:02,563
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct of overlays.

761
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,317
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

762
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,820
All of them mixed together,
all of them learning from one another.

763
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,947
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

764
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,201
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

765
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,329
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.

766
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,997
Can we do that?

767
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,749
Not me, not here.

768
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,544
Well, you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

769
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,380
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back.

770
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,010
I know somewhere.

771
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,277
The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

772
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,987
And the Border Tribe?

773
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,031
Those that are left.

774
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,450
Send word to the Jabari as well.

775
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,702
M'Baku likes a good fight.

776
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,706
And what of this one?

777
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,459
This one may be tired of war.

778
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,838
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

779
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,070
Where's the fight?

780
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,406
On its way.

781
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:56,385
In all the time I've served Thanos...

782
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,264
I have never failed him.

783
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:08,439
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan...

784
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:12,443
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

785
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,196
there would be judgment.

786
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,331
Give me...

787
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:30,335
the stone.

788
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:45,184
Wow, you're a seriously loyal piece
of outerwear, aren't you?

789
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,353
Yeah, speaking of loyalty...

790
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:48,938
What the...

791
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,999
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

792
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:52,209
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

793
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,919
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about you on the way...

794
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:54,591
And now I gotta hear it.

795
01:00:54,603 --> 01:00:55,796
...and kinda stuck to
the side of the ship.

796
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,863
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,
by the way.

797
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,031
God damn it.

798
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:01,992
So, if anything,
it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

799
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,637
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

800
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,149
And now, I'm here in space.

801
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,540
Yeah, right where I
didn't want you to be.

802
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,792
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

803
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:12,002
This is a one-way ticket. You hear me?

804
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,980
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- No, I did think this through.

805
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,774
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

806
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:19,051
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

807
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,100
Okay, that didn't really make sense,
but you know what I'm trying to say.

808
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:28,669
Come on. We got a situation.

809
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,915
See him down there?
He's in trouble. What's your plan?

810
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,107
Go.

811
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:34,775
Okay, okay...

812
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,696
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens</i>?

813
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:44,493
Painful, aren't they?

814
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:48,247
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

815
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,000
And any one of them...

816
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,299
could end your friend's life in an instant.

817
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,643
<i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

818
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:03,345
<i>Saving his life is
more of a professional courtesy.</i>

819
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,891
You've saved nothing.

820
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:11,061
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

821
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:13,105
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

822
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,455
Yes! Wait. What are those?

823
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,806
Hey, we haven't officially met.

824
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,183
Cool.

825
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,603
We gotta turn this ship around.

826
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,814
Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

827
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,357
No, I want to protect the stone.

828
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:59,318
And I want you to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

829
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:02,196
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

830
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:04,615
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

831
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:07,177
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head into that helmet.

832
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,453
Admit it, you should've ducked out
when I told you to.

833
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,121
I tried to bench you. You refused.

834
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,350
Unlike everyone else in your life,
I don't work for you.

835
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:16,377
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut...

836
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:18,304
billions of miles from
Earth with no backup.

837
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:20,297
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

838
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:21,465
The adults are talking.

839
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,218
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

840
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,011
What is he, your ward?

841
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,179
No.

842
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,557
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

843
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,123
Oh, you're using our made-up names.

844
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,602
I'm Spider-Man, then.

845
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,148
This ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

846
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,024
Can we control it?

847
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:41,110
Fly us home?

848
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:45,114
- Stark?
- Yeah.

849
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,532
Can you get us home?

850
01:03:46,699 --> 01:03:47,950
Yeah, I heard you.

851
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,704
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

852
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:56,500
Under no circumstances
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

853
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,919
I don't think you quite understand
what's at stake here.

854
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,422
What? No.
It's you who doesn't understand...

855
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:04,341
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

856
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,720
Since he sent an army to New York
and now he's back.

857
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:09,805
And I don't know what to do.

858
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:13,017
So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan
to fight him on our turf or his...

859
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:16,812
but you saw what they
did, what they can do.

860
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,190
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

861
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,109
So I say we take the fight to him.

862
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:23,277
Doctor.

863
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,655
Do you concur?

864
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,702
All right, Stark. We go to him.

865
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,830
But you have to understand...

866
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:39,210
if it comes to saving you or the kid
or the Time Stone...

867
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,213
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

868
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:46,717
I can't, because the
universe depends on it.

869
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,179
Nice. Good, moral compass.

870
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:52,973
We're straight.

871
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,601
All right, kid.

872
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:57,937
You're an Avenger now.

873
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,725
I thought you might be hungry.

874
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:50,447
I always hated that chair.

875
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,658
So I've been told.

876
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:57,246
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

877
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,540
I hated this room.

878
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:01,709
This ship.

879
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,669
I hated my life.

880
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,342
You told me that too.

881
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:14,889
Every day.

882
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,643
For almost 20 years.

883
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:24,607
I was a child when you took me.

884
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:26,817
I saved you.

885
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:31,322
No.

886
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:36,368
No. We were happy on my home planet.

887
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:39,914
Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps.

888
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:45,127
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

889
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,421
Do you know what's happened since then?

890
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:49,215
The children born...

891
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:53,219
have known nothing but full bellies
and clear skies.

892
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,637
It's a paradise.

893
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:59,183
Because you murdered half the planet.

894
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,228
A small price to pay for salvation.

895
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,395
You're insane.

896
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,523
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

897
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:08,484
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

898
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:13,030
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

899
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,532
It needs correction.

900
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,075
You don't know that!

901
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:19,662
I'm the only one who knows that.

902
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:24,667
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

903
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:27,253
For a time...

904
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:34,093
you had that same will...

905
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:38,097
as you fought by my side.

906
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:40,015
Daughter.

907
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:42,601
I'm not your daughter.

908
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,773
Everything I hate about
myself you taught me.

909
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:52,319
And, in doing so, made you
the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

910
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:58,075
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

911
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:03,914
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

912
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:07,251
I am disappointed.

913
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:10,504
But not because you didn't find it.

914
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:15,843
But because you did.

915
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:19,054
And you lied.

916
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:37,281
Nebula.

917
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:45,873
Don't do this.

918
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,044
Some time ago, your sister
snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

919
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,211
Please don't do this.

920
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,589
And very nearly succeeded.

921
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:55,716
So I brought her here.

922
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:58,511
To talk.

923
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:08,562
Stop. Stop it.

924
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:16,779
I swear to you on my life.

925
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,573
I never found the Soul Stone.

926
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:25,287
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

927
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:26,789
<i>You know what he's about to do.</i>

928
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:29,542
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

929
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,977
- <i>All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

930
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:34,004
- <i>He will!
- He can't, Nebula.</i>

931
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,465
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

932
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:39,468
<i>and I burned it to ash. I burned it.</i>

933
01:09:44,515 --> 01:09:46,308
You're strong.

934
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:49,353
Me.

935
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:53,524
You're generous.

936
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:55,860
Me.

937
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:00,281
But I never taught you to lie.

938
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,075
That's why you're so bad at it.

939
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:09,832
Where is the Soul Stone?

940
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,224
Vormir!

941
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:47,953
The stone is on Vormir.

942
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,709
Show me.

943
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:56,879
I am Groot.

944
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,590
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking. What's there to see?

945
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,926
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig before.

946
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,177
I am Groot.

947
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:06,024
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space and go in the cup again.

948
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:07,473
You speak Groot?

949
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,576
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

950
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,643
I am Groot.

951
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,812
You'll know when we're close.

952
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:16,857
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star.

953
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,695
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

954
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,156
It's truly awesome.

955
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:33,332
Okay, time to be the captain.

956
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:39,880
So, dead brother, huh?

957
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:42,383
Yeah, that could be annoying.

958
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:44,760
Well, he's been dead before.

959
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,764
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

960
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:51,559
And you said your sister and your dad?

961
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,018
Both dead.

962
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:55,312
But still got a mom, though?

963
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:57,064
Killed by a dark elf.

964
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:58,231
A best friend?

965
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,692
Stabbed through the heart.

966
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,240
You sure you're up
to this particular murder mission?

967
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:09,952
Absolutely.

968
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:13,622
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

969
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,459
they're all tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.

970
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,252
So I'm good to go.

971
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:21,088
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

972
01:12:21,547 --> 01:12:23,841
he's the toughest there is.

973
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:26,051
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

974
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,761
He's never fought me twice.

975
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:30,139
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

976
01:12:30,306 --> 01:12:32,558
It better be some hammer.

977
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:39,064
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

978
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:41,775
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

979
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:44,987
And every one of them would've rather
killed me, but none succeeded.

980
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:48,574
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

981
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:51,535
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

982
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:53,579
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

983
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,539
Fate wills it so.

984
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,876
And what if you're wrong?

985
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:03,964
If I'm wrong, then...

986
01:13:05,216 --> 01:13:06,801
what more could I lose?

987
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:24,193
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

988
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:28,989
Okay.

989
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:34,161
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

990
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,168
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

991
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:38,207
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

992
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,960
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

993
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:42,378
He gave you his eye?

994
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:43,671
No, he gave me 100 credits.

995
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:46,799
I snuck into his room later that night
and stole his eye.

996
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:49,969
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

997
01:13:58,269 --> 01:13:59,770
I would've washed that.

998
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:03,524
The only way I could
sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

999
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:05,943
Hey, we're here!

1000
01:14:09,947 --> 01:14:11,187
I don't think this thing works.

1001
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,408
Everything seems dark.

1002
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:16,579
It ain't the eye.

1003
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:31,302
Something's wrong.

1004
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:33,637
The star's gone out.

1005
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,056
And the rings are frozen.

1006
01:14:57,203 --> 01:15:00,498
I hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning.

1007
01:15:05,753 --> 01:15:08,839
Maybe they realized that they live
in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1008
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:11,967
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1009
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,889
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1010
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:18,224
Yes, why?

1011
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,434
It look anything like that?

1012
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,606
I am Groot.

1013
01:15:25,773 --> 01:15:27,274
Go back to the pod.

1014
01:15:31,362 --> 01:15:32,362
Eitri, wait!

1015
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:34,323
Stop!

1016
01:15:35,241 --> 01:15:36,242
Stop.

1017
01:15:37,117 --> 01:15:38,117
Thor?

1018
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:42,665
What happened here?

1019
01:15:43,082 --> 01:15:45,376
You were supposed to protect us.

1020
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:48,921
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1021
01:15:49,088 --> 01:15:51,298
Asgard is destroyed.

1022
01:15:53,551 --> 01:15:57,388
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1023
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:13,154
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1024
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,449
I thought if I did what he asked,
they'd be safe.

1025
01:16:19,952 --> 01:16:21,412
I made what he wanted.

1026
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:27,460
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1027
01:16:32,006 --> 01:16:34,592
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1028
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:38,471
All except me.

1029
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:41,432
"Your life is yours," he said.

1030
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:46,687
"But your hands are mine alone."

1031
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,648
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1032
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:53,861
Every weapon you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...

1033
01:16:54,028 --> 01:16:56,238
it's all inside your head.

1034
01:16:57,114 --> 01:16:59,033
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1035
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,743
Trust me, I know.

1036
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:05,915
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

1037
01:17:46,288 --> 01:17:48,582
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1038
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:50,960
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1039
01:17:57,716 --> 01:17:58,716
Hey, what's going on?

1040
01:17:58,801 --> 01:18:00,010
I think we're here.

1041
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:02,638
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1042
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,059
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.

1043
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:09,913
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.

1044
01:18:09,937 --> 01:18:12,040
This was meant for one big guy,
so we gotta move at the same time.

1045
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,064
Okay, okay. Ready.

1046
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:18,612
We might wanna turn.

1047
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,030
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1048
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:51,479
You all right?

1049
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,231
That was close.

1050
01:18:55,608 --> 01:18:56,859
I owe you one.

1051
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,280
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1052
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:02,716
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1053
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:05,075
I do not want another single
pop culture reference

1054
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:06,821
out of you for the rest of the trip.
You understand?

1055
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:08,553
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1056
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,796
Thanos!

1057
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:39,610
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1058
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:43,572
Stay down, clown.

1059
01:19:48,786 --> 01:19:50,871
Die, blanket of death!

1060
01:19:56,794 --> 01:19:59,713
Everybody stay where you are.
Chill the eff out.

1061
01:20:00,923 --> 01:20:02,925
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1062
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:04,927
Where is Gamora?

1063
01:20:05,094 --> 01:20:07,596
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1064
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:10,683
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1065
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:14,130
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1066
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:17,106
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1067
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:20,276
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1068
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:22,444
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.

1069
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:24,798
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me
where she is? That's fine.

1070
01:20:24,822 --> 01:20:27,783
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1071
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:28,950
Starting with you.

1072
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:32,288
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1073
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:34,457
What master do you serve?

1074
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:37,418
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1075
01:20:38,711 --> 01:20:40,564
- You're from Earth.
- I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1076
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:41,922
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1077
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:43,249
What are you hassling us for?

1078
01:20:43,299 --> 01:20:45,050
So you're not with Thanos?

1079
01:20:45,551 --> 01:20:47,344
With Thanos?

1080
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:50,514
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1081
01:20:50,681 --> 01:20:52,516
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1082
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,810
We're the Avengers, man.

1083
01:20:54,977 --> 01:20:57,438
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1084
01:20:57,605 --> 01:20:58,772
You know Thor?

1085
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:02,568
Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,
needed saving.

1086
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,403
Where is he now?

1087
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,460
This is the plan?
We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1088
01:21:21,504 --> 01:21:22,713
It's a mold.

1089
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:24,547
A king's weapon.

1090
01:21:25,424 --> 01:21:27,760
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1091
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:31,263
In theory,
it could even summon the Bifrost.

1092
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:32,890
Did it have a name?

1093
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:35,309
Stormbreaker.

1094
01:21:35,768 --> 01:21:36,894
That's a bit much.

1095
01:21:38,938 --> 01:21:40,022
So how do we make it?

1096
01:21:41,857 --> 01:21:44,068
You'll have to restart the forge.

1097
01:21:45,027 --> 01:21:47,238
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1098
01:21:49,865 --> 01:21:52,493
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1099
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:58,124
The hell happened to this planet?

1100
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:02,378
It's eight degrees off its axis.
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1101
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:06,507
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1102
01:22:07,466 --> 01:22:10,094
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1103
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:11,621
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1104
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,319
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

1105
01:22:14,473 --> 01:22:17,268
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.

1106
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:18,852
Are you yawning?

1107
01:22:20,312 --> 01:22:22,481
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

1108
01:22:22,648 --> 01:22:23,648
Did you hear what I said?

1109
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,694
I stopped listening after you said,
"We need a plan."

1110
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:28,088
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1111
01:22:28,112 --> 01:22:30,948
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1112
01:22:31,115 --> 01:22:32,616
What exactly is it that they do?

1113
01:22:32,783 --> 01:22:34,368
Kick names, take ass.

1114
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:35,786
Yeah, that's right.

1115
01:22:42,501 --> 01:22:44,021
All right, just get over here, please.

1116
01:22:44,253 --> 01:22:46,172
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks
to circle up?

1117
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:48,507
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1118
01:22:51,218 --> 01:22:52,511
We gotta coalesce.

1119
01:22:52,678 --> 01:22:54,448
'Cause if all we come at him with
is a plucky attitude...

1120
01:22:54,472 --> 01:22:56,765
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1121
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:58,100
We don't know what it means.

1122
01:22:58,517 --> 01:23:01,103
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan.

1123
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:03,731
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1124
01:23:03,898 --> 01:23:05,816
and that way it might be really good.

1125
01:23:05,983 --> 01:23:07,943
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1126
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,153
What dance-off?

1127
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,320
It's nothing.

1128
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:11,564
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1129
01:23:11,614 --> 01:23:12,990
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1130
01:23:13,532 --> 01:23:15,177
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1131
01:23:15,201 --> 01:23:16,327
It never was.

1132
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:17,971
- Don't encourage this, all right?
- Okay.

1133
01:23:17,995 --> 01:23:19,473
We're getting no help
from Flash Gordon here.

1134
01:23:19,497 --> 01:23:21,791
Flash Gordon?
By the way, that's a compliment.

1135
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:23,876
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1136
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:25,586
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1137
01:23:26,796 --> 01:23:27,797
that's 100% you.

1138
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:30,007
- Your math is blowing my mind.
- Excuse me.

1139
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:35,012
But does your friend often do that?

1140
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:38,724
Strange, we all right?

1141
01:23:48,943 --> 01:23:50,778
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.

1142
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:51,946
Hey, what was that?

1143
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:56,116
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1144
01:23:56,992 --> 01:24:00,454
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

1145
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:02,540
How many did you see?

1146
01:24:02,706 --> 01:24:04,959
14,000,605.

1147
01:24:06,627 --> 01:24:08,045
How many did we win?

1148
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,968
One.

1149
01:24:35,865 --> 01:24:38,868
The stone had better be up there.

1150
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:42,788
For your sister's sake.

1151
01:25:03,684 --> 01:25:08,439
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1152
01:25:10,524 --> 01:25:13,777
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1153
01:25:13,944 --> 01:25:15,112
You know us?

1154
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,825
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

1155
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:21,994
Where is the Soul Stone?

1156
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,371
You should know...

1157
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:28,167
it extracts a terrible price.

1158
01:25:29,502 --> 01:25:31,086
I am prepared.

1159
01:25:33,547 --> 01:25:35,966
We all think that at first.

1160
01:25:40,513 --> 01:25:42,807
We are all wrong.

1161
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,737
How is it you know this place so well?

1162
01:25:56,904 --> 01:26:01,242
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1163
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,411
I even held one in my hand.

1164
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:08,624
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1165
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:12,837
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1166
01:26:21,554 --> 01:26:24,473
What you seek lies in front of you.

1167
01:26:25,432 --> 01:26:27,560
As does what you fear.

1168
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:29,770
What's this?

1169
01:26:30,271 --> 01:26:31,814
The price.

1170
01:26:31,981 --> 01:26:36,610
Soul holds a special place among
the Infinity Stones.

1171
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:41,699
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1172
01:26:43,075 --> 01:26:44,910
Tell me what it needs.

1173
01:26:45,077 --> 01:26:48,622
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1174
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:51,333
understands its power...

1175
01:26:52,293 --> 01:26:56,046
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1176
01:26:56,213 --> 01:26:57,756
Of what?

1177
01:26:58,174 --> 01:27:02,636
In order to take the stone,
you must lose that which you love.

1178
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:06,849
A soul...

1179
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:08,767
for a soul.

1180
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:26,827
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1181
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:29,163
a moment...

1182
01:27:30,498 --> 01:27:32,583
when you got what you deserved.

1183
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:37,087
And I was always so disappointed.

1184
01:27:40,674 --> 01:27:42,134
But now...

1185
01:27:46,096 --> 01:27:49,183
You kill and torture...

1186
01:27:51,143 --> 01:27:53,145
and you call it mercy.

1187
01:27:57,233 --> 01:27:59,318
The universe has judged you.

1188
01:28:00,903 --> 01:28:05,366
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1189
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:08,410
You failed.

1190
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:11,664
And do you wanna know why?

1191
01:28:12,623 --> 01:28:14,458
Because you love nothing.

1192
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,794
No one.

1193
01:28:22,424 --> 01:28:23,592
No.

1194
01:28:28,222 --> 01:28:29,223
Really?

1195
01:28:30,266 --> 01:28:31,350
Tears?

1196
01:28:32,143 --> 01:28:34,103
They're not for him.

1197
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:49,577
No.

1198
01:28:51,078 --> 01:28:52,496
This isn't love.

1199
01:28:53,372 --> 01:28:56,041
I ignored my destiny once.

1200
01:28:58,502 --> 01:29:00,671
I cannot do that again.

1201
01:29:01,172 --> 01:29:04,550
Even for you.

1202
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:31,118
I'm sorry, little one.

1203
01:29:34,955 --> 01:29:36,207
No!

1204
01:31:13,804 --> 01:31:16,640
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1205
01:31:16,807 --> 01:31:18,058
I hope you're right about this.

1206
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:21,103
Or we're gonna land a lot faster
than you want to.

1207
01:31:36,827 --> 01:31:39,473
When you said we were going to open
Wakanda to the rest of the world...

1208
01:31:39,497 --> 01:31:41,749
this is not what I imagined.

1209
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:43,876
And what did you imagine?

1210
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:45,169
The Olympics.

1211
01:31:45,336 --> 01:31:47,087
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1212
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,686
Should we bow?

1213
01:32:02,853 --> 01:32:04,104
Yeah, he's a king.

1214
01:32:04,438 --> 01:32:06,440
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1215
01:32:08,275 --> 01:32:09,735
What are you doing?

1216
01:32:10,152 --> 01:32:11,821
We don't do that here.

1217
01:32:11,987 --> 01:32:14,240
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1218
01:32:14,406 --> 01:32:17,409
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1219
01:32:17,576 --> 01:32:18,576
How we looking?

1220
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:23,666
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1221
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:27,545
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1222
01:32:30,422 --> 01:32:31,590
How you been, Buck?

1223
01:32:31,757 --> 01:32:34,885
Not bad, for the end of the world.

1224
01:32:48,065 --> 01:32:50,151
The structure is polymorphic.

1225
01:32:50,609 --> 01:32:53,487
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1226
01:32:53,904 --> 01:32:57,950
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively?

1227
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:02,288
Because we didn't think of it.

1228
01:33:02,705 --> 01:33:03,998
I'm sure you did your best.

1229
01:33:04,165 --> 01:33:05,374
Can you do it?

1230
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:09,587
Yes, but there are
more than two trillion neurons here.

1231
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:12,923
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1232
01:33:13,299 --> 01:33:14,383
It will take time, brother.

1233
01:33:16,093 --> 01:33:17,093
How long?

1234
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:18,429
As long as you can give me.

1235
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,311
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1236
01:33:42,244 --> 01:33:44,538
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1237
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,883
God, I love this place.

1238
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:59,678
<i>Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming outside the dome.</i>

1239
01:34:19,073 --> 01:34:20,073
It's too late.

1240
01:34:21,033 --> 01:34:22,353
We need to destroy the stone now.

1241
01:34:22,868 --> 01:34:24,495
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1242
01:34:24,662 --> 01:34:25,996
We will hold them off.

1243
01:34:26,163 --> 01:34:29,583
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1244
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:30,751
you blow it to hell.

1245
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,253
I will.

1246
01:34:32,419 --> 01:34:35,214
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1247
01:34:35,965 --> 01:34:37,424
And get this man a shield.

1248
01:34:47,852 --> 01:34:50,146
<i>I don't think you get the scientifics here.</i>

1249
01:34:50,312 --> 01:34:52,773
<i>These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...</i>

1250
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,401
<i>you're gonna need something a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.</i>

1251
01:34:55,568 --> 01:34:57,653
- Leave that to me.
- <i>Leave it to you?</i>

1252
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:00,948
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1253
01:35:09,373 --> 01:35:10,374
<i>Fire the engines!</i>

1254
01:35:27,933 --> 01:35:30,603
More power, rabbit!

1255
01:36:02,051 --> 01:36:03,844
Well done, boy.

1256
01:36:05,638 --> 01:36:07,556
That's Nidavellir.

1257
01:36:27,701 --> 01:36:28,701
Damn it.

1258
01:36:29,036 --> 01:36:30,579
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1259
01:36:30,746 --> 01:36:32,623
- <i>The mechanism is crippled.</i>
- What?

1260
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:34,792
With the iris closed,
I can't heat the metal.

1261
01:36:34,959 --> 01:36:36,279
How long will it take to heat it?

1262
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:39,088
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1263
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:42,133
I'm gonna hold it open.

1264
01:36:42,299 --> 01:36:43,425
That's suicide.

1265
01:36:43,592 --> 01:36:46,011
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1266
01:36:55,813 --> 01:36:56,856
How we looking, Bruce?

1267
01:36:57,022 --> 01:36:58,691
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1268
01:37:02,444 --> 01:37:06,073
This is amazing, man. It's like
being the Hulk without actually...

1269
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:12,121
<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

1270
01:37:13,622 --> 01:37:15,982
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the tree line.

1271
01:37:44,153 --> 01:37:46,363
Thank you for standing with us.

1272
01:38:08,344 --> 01:38:09,970
Where's your other friend?

1273
01:38:10,721 --> 01:38:13,098
You will pay for his life with yours.

1274
01:38:14,099 --> 01:38:16,560
Thanos will have that stone.

1275
01:38:17,061 --> 01:38:18,521
That's not gonna happen.

1276
01:38:18,687 --> 01:38:20,981
You are in Wakanda now.

1277
01:38:21,148 --> 01:38:24,610
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.

1278
01:38:27,863 --> 01:38:29,949
We have blood to spare.

1279
01:38:41,168 --> 01:38:42,711
They surrender?

1280
01:38:43,504 --> 01:38:44,505
Not exactly.

1281
01:39:11,532 --> 01:39:12,950
What the hell?

1282
01:39:15,911 --> 01:39:17,538
Looks like we pissed her off.

1283
01:39:28,299 --> 01:39:29,842
They're killing themselves.

1284
01:40:06,086 --> 01:40:07,671
You see the teeth on those things?

1285
01:40:07,838 --> 01:40:10,198
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1286
01:40:22,353 --> 01:40:24,913
<i>Cap, if these things circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...</i>

1287
01:40:25,064 --> 01:40:26,857
<i>there's nothing between them and Vision.</i>

1288
01:40:27,233 --> 01:40:28,984
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1289
01:40:29,151 --> 01:40:30,528
How do we do that?

1290
01:40:32,905 --> 01:40:34,532
We open the barrier.

1291
01:40:36,784 --> 01:40:40,913
On my signal,
open North-West Section Seventeen.

1292
01:40:41,247 --> 01:40:44,875
<i>Requesting confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?</i>

1293
01:40:45,042 --> 01:40:46,252
On my signal.

1294
01:40:46,502 --> 01:40:48,379
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1295
01:40:49,713 --> 01:40:53,134
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

1296
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,565
Wakanda forever!

1297
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:21,161
Now!

1298
01:41:51,317 --> 01:41:52,735
How much longer, Shuri?

1299
01:41:52,902 --> 01:41:54,445
I've barely begun, brother.

1300
01:41:54,612 --> 01:41:56,447
You might want to pick up the pace.

1301
01:42:03,496 --> 01:42:05,372
Allfathers, give me strength.

1302
01:42:05,539 --> 01:42:07,333
You understand, boy?

1303
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,503
You're about to
take the full force of a star.

1304
01:42:11,462 --> 01:42:12,880
It'll kill you.

1305
01:42:13,547 --> 01:42:15,007
Only if I die.

1306
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:17,051
Yes.

1307
01:42:17,551 --> 01:42:20,304
That's what killing you means.

1308
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:50,209
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1309
01:43:40,676 --> 01:43:42,636
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1310
01:43:43,554 --> 01:43:44,555
Thor, you okay?

1311
01:43:50,227 --> 01:43:51,520
I think he's dying.

1312
01:43:51,687 --> 01:43:53,647
He needs the axe!

1313
01:43:55,107 --> 01:43:56,442
Where's the handle?

1314
01:43:59,487 --> 01:44:01,822
Tree, help me find the handle!

1315
01:45:10,683 --> 01:45:12,893
There's too many of 'em!

1316
01:45:40,254 --> 01:45:42,715
You guys are so screwed now!

1317
01:45:46,093 --> 01:45:48,095
Bring me Thanos!

1318
01:46:20,836 --> 01:46:22,338
Oh, yeah.

1319
01:46:25,466 --> 01:46:27,468
You're much more of a Thanos.

1320
01:46:29,804 --> 01:46:31,972
I take it the Maw is dead.

1321
01:46:34,266 --> 01:46:36,727
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1322
01:46:38,437 --> 01:46:40,606
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1323
01:46:41,065 --> 01:46:42,566
You may regret that.

1324
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,278
He brought you face-to-face with
the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1325
01:46:49,448 --> 01:46:51,909
And where do you think he brought you?

1326
01:46:52,993 --> 01:46:55,704
Let me guess. Your home?

1327
01:47:00,084 --> 01:47:01,377
It was.

1328
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:05,548
And it was beautiful.

1329
01:47:08,175 --> 01:47:10,636
Titan was like most planets.

1330
01:47:10,803 --> 01:47:13,681
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1331
01:47:13,848 --> 01:47:17,101
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1332
01:47:18,102 --> 01:47:19,311
Genocide.

1333
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:24,108
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1334
01:47:25,442 --> 01:47:27,611
They called me a madman.

1335
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,573
And what I predicted came to pass.

1336
01:47:33,284 --> 01:47:35,286
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1337
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:37,079
I'm a survivor.

1338
01:47:37,246 --> 01:47:39,457
Who wants to murder trillions.

1339
01:47:39,623 --> 01:47:43,335
With all six stones, I could simply
snap my fingers.

1340
01:47:43,878 --> 01:47:48,591
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1341
01:47:50,676 --> 01:47:52,178
And then what?

1342
01:47:53,512 --> 01:47:55,014
I'd finally rest...

1343
01:47:55,806 --> 01:47:58,934
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1344
01:48:00,102 --> 01:48:03,647
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1345
01:48:04,482 --> 01:48:09,195
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1346
01:48:10,654 --> 01:48:11,654
Our?

1347
01:48:17,703 --> 01:48:19,121
Piece of cake, Quill.

1348
01:48:19,288 --> 01:48:21,540
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1349
01:48:59,703 --> 01:49:00,913
Boom!

1350
01:49:01,997 --> 01:49:03,874
Don't let him close his fist.

1351
01:49:08,087 --> 01:49:09,088
Magic.

1352
01:49:09,713 --> 01:49:10,714
More magic.

1353
01:49:11,549 --> 01:49:12,550
Magic with a kick.

1354
01:49:13,175 --> 01:49:14,176
Magic with a...

1355
01:49:15,511 --> 01:49:16,511
Insect!

1356
01:49:54,216 --> 01:49:55,342
Well, well.

1357
01:49:55,509 --> 01:49:56,552
You should've killed me.

1358
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,429
It would've been a waste of parts!

1359
01:50:04,059 --> 01:50:05,186
Where's Gamora?

1360
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:50,356
<i>- Is he under? Don't let up.</i>
- Be quick. He is very strong.

1361
01:50:50,523 --> 01:50:52,566
Parker, help! Get over here.

1362
01:50:52,733 --> 01:50:55,027
<i>She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.</i>

1363
01:51:00,533 --> 01:51:01,676
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1364
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:04,340
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1365
01:51:05,454 --> 01:51:09,416
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?

1366
01:51:10,417 --> 01:51:13,671
- My Gamora.
- No, bullshit!

1367
01:51:13,963 --> 01:51:15,256
Where is she?

1368
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,633
He is in anguish.

1369
01:51:18,342 --> 01:51:19,468
Good.

1370
01:51:21,637 --> 01:51:22,763
He mourns.

1371
01:51:23,305 --> 01:51:26,934
What does this monster have to mourn?

1372
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:28,810
Gamora.

1373
01:51:32,606 --> 01:51:33,607
What?

1374
01:51:34,024 --> 01:51:35,526
He took her to Vormir.

1375
01:51:36,152 --> 01:51:38,112
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1376
01:51:38,904 --> 01:51:40,406
But she didn't.

1377
01:51:42,324 --> 01:51:45,494
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1378
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:49,832
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1379
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,250
Tell me she's lying.

1380
01:51:54,545 --> 01:51:57,339
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1381
01:51:58,799 --> 01:52:02,219
I had to.

1382
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,388
No, you didn't.

1383
01:52:04,847 --> 01:52:06,265
No, you didn't.

1384
01:52:10,102 --> 01:52:11,437
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1385
01:52:11,604 --> 01:52:13,397
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1386
01:52:14,106 --> 01:52:14,889
<i>Hey, stop! Stop!</i>

1387
01:52:14,901 --> 01:52:17,067
It's coming, it's coming.
I got it, I got it!

1388
01:52:20,696 --> 01:52:21,697
Oh, God.

1389
01:53:20,923 --> 01:53:23,259
Come and get some, space dogs!

1390
01:53:26,595 --> 01:53:29,181
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1391
01:53:29,348 --> 01:53:31,267
Come on! Get some!

1392
01:53:31,517 --> 01:53:33,561
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1393
01:53:34,186 --> 01:53:36,063
Okay. How much for the arm?

1394
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,942
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1395
01:53:48,826 --> 01:53:49,827
New haircut?

1396
01:53:50,202 --> 01:53:51,495
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1397
01:53:54,123 --> 01:53:55,875
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1398
01:53:56,792 --> 01:53:58,711
I am Groot.

1399
01:53:59,712 --> 01:54:01,172
I am Steve Rogers.

1400
01:54:21,233 --> 01:54:23,402
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1401
01:54:32,828 --> 01:54:34,538
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1402
01:54:35,122 --> 01:54:36,248
<i>I'm doing it.</i>

1403
01:55:00,147 --> 01:55:01,774
Why was she up there all this time?

1404
01:55:02,733 --> 01:55:05,611
She's on the field. Take it.

1405
01:55:37,226 --> 01:55:39,353
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1406
01:55:42,106 --> 01:55:43,482
Somebody get to Vision!

1407
01:55:44,233 --> 01:55:45,067
<i>I got him!</i>

1408
01:55:45,234 --> 01:55:46,826
On my way.

1409
01:55:51,407 --> 01:55:54,243
He'll die alone. As will you.

1410
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:55,703
She's not alone.

1411
01:56:21,937 --> 01:56:23,647
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1412
01:56:23,814 --> 01:56:25,374
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1413
01:56:25,441 --> 01:56:27,735
This suit's already kicked the crap
outta the Hulk.

1414
01:56:27,902 --> 01:56:28,903
<i>What? No! No!</i>

1415
01:56:32,656 --> 01:56:35,367
<i>Guys! Vision needs backup, now!</i>

1416
01:56:37,369 --> 01:56:40,956
Hulk? Hulk, I know you like
making your entrance at the last second.

1417
01:56:41,123 --> 01:56:43,751
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.

1418
01:56:48,214 --> 01:56:49,757
Hulk! Hulk!

1419
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,800
Hulk!

1420
01:56:52,802 --> 01:56:54,970
No!

1421
01:56:55,137 --> 01:56:57,890
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1422
01:56:58,057 --> 01:56:59,225
I'll do it myself!

1423
01:57:00,184 --> 01:57:02,019
<i>Come on! Yeah!</i>

1424
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:15,950
<i>See ya!</i>

1425
01:57:27,503 --> 01:57:30,005
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1426
01:57:41,058 --> 01:57:42,935
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1427
01:57:43,894 --> 01:57:46,438
But you're dying, like any man.

1428
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:56,282
Get outta here!

1429
01:57:59,827 --> 01:58:00,827
Go!

1430
01:58:19,472 --> 01:58:21,140
That was really gross.

1431
01:58:48,292 --> 01:58:49,376
I thought I told you to go.

1432
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:52,922
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1433
01:59:04,141 --> 01:59:06,227
I got you. I got you.

1434
01:59:06,477 --> 01:59:08,479
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1435
01:59:53,732 --> 01:59:55,234
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1436
01:59:57,319 --> 02:00:00,239
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1437
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:04,660
A fake.

1438
02:00:12,626 --> 02:00:16,088
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.

1439
02:00:16,255 --> 02:00:17,423
Stark.

1440
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:18,674
You know me?

1441
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,426
I do.

1442
02:00:20,968 --> 02:00:24,096
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

1443
02:00:25,014 --> 02:00:26,348
My only curse is you.

1444
02:00:28,934 --> 02:00:30,485
Come on!

1445
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,840
All that for a drop of blood.

1446
02:01:43,884 --> 02:01:45,678
You have my respect, Stark.

1447
02:01:47,346 --> 02:01:50,516
When I'm done,
half of humanity will still be alive.

1448
02:01:56,063 --> 02:01:58,149
I hope they remember you.

1449
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:09,159
Stop.

1450
02:02:15,374 --> 02:02:16,375
Spare his life...

1451
02:02:18,169 --> 02:02:19,920
and I will give you the stone.

1452
02:02:23,466 --> 02:02:24,758
No tricks.

1453
02:02:29,555 --> 02:02:30,556
Don't.

1454
02:03:21,982 --> 02:03:23,692
One to go.

1455
02:03:33,577 --> 02:03:34,995
Where is he?

1456
02:03:43,963 --> 02:03:45,339
Did we just lose?

1457
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:51,178
Why would you do that?

1458
02:03:54,515 --> 02:03:56,767
We're in the endgame now.

1459
02:04:22,710 --> 02:04:24,086
Are you okay?

1460
02:04:26,046 --> 02:04:27,756
What? What is it?

1461
02:04:29,925 --> 02:04:31,051
He's here.

1462
02:04:42,062 --> 02:04:45,107
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1463
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:49,820
What the hell?

1464
02:05:15,513 --> 02:05:16,513
Cap.

1465
02:05:17,097 --> 02:05:18,557
That's him.

1466
02:05:20,601 --> 02:05:23,187
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1467
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:48,920
Wanda.

1468
02:05:49,797 --> 02:05:52,258
- It's time.
- No.

1469
02:05:52,424 --> 02:05:54,635
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1470
02:05:54,802 --> 02:05:57,555
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1471
02:05:57,721 --> 02:05:59,849
- Don't.
- You must do it. Wanda, please.

1472
02:06:01,851 --> 02:06:04,436
We are out of time.

1473
02:06:05,229 --> 02:06:06,355
I can't.

1474
02:06:06,522 --> 02:06:07,940
Yes, you can.

1475
02:06:08,607 --> 02:06:09,859
You can.

1476
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,654
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1477
02:06:16,031 --> 02:06:17,533
It's not fair.

1478
02:06:18,742 --> 02:06:20,327
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1479
02:06:22,288 --> 02:06:23,747
It's all right.

1480
02:06:25,166 --> 02:06:26,876
You could never hurt me.

1481
02:06:35,926 --> 02:06:37,720
I just feel you.

1482
02:08:00,845 --> 02:08:01,971
It's all right.

1483
02:08:11,897 --> 02:08:13,232
It's all right.

1484
02:08:17,570 --> 02:08:18,654
I love you.

1485
02:08:47,975 --> 02:08:50,102
I understand, my child.

1486
02:08:51,645 --> 02:08:53,272
Better than anyone.

1487
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:56,859
You could never.

1488
02:09:01,697 --> 02:09:04,700
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1489
02:09:06,494 --> 02:09:09,121
But now is no time to mourn.

1490
02:09:11,373 --> 02:09:15,377
Now is no time at all.

1491
02:09:38,692 --> 02:09:39,692
No!

1492
02:10:37,668 --> 02:10:39,128
I told you...

1493
02:10:40,504 --> 02:10:42,339
you'd die for that.

1494
02:10:56,687 --> 02:10:58,439
You should have...

1495
02:11:01,066 --> 02:11:02,526
You should...

1496
02:11:05,029 --> 02:11:08,282
You should have gone for the head.

1497
02:11:10,201 --> 02:11:11,202
No!

1498
02:11:44,610 --> 02:11:45,820
Daughter?

1499
02:11:53,452 --> 02:11:54,829
Did you do it?

1500
02:11:56,747 --> 02:11:57,748
Yes.

1501
02:12:06,173 --> 02:12:07,758
What did it cost?

1502
02:12:11,470 --> 02:12:12,972
Everything.

1503
02:12:23,232 --> 02:12:24,775
What did you do?

1504
02:12:26,026 --> 02:12:27,528
What'd you do?

1505
02:12:41,167 --> 02:12:42,543
Where'd he go?

1506
02:12:45,629 --> 02:12:46,629
Thor.

1507
02:12:49,842 --> 02:12:51,469
Where'd he go?

1508
02:12:51,635 --> 02:12:52,887
Steve?

1509
02:13:27,713 --> 02:13:30,007
Up, General. Up!

1510
02:13:30,591 --> 02:13:32,468
This is no place to die.

1511
02:13:47,066 --> 02:13:48,984
I am Groot.

1512
02:13:51,153 --> 02:13:53,239
No, no, no!

1513
02:13:54,073 --> 02:13:56,909
Groot! No.

1514
02:14:10,339 --> 02:14:11,507
Sam!

1515
02:14:15,553 --> 02:14:17,304
Sam, where you at?

1516
02:14:26,522 --> 02:14:28,732
Something's happening.

1517
02:14:40,870 --> 02:14:42,037
Quill?

1518
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,546
Steady, Quill.

1519
02:14:50,713 --> 02:14:51,881
Oh, man.

1520
02:14:56,051 --> 02:14:57,052
Tony.

1521
02:15:00,598 --> 02:15:03,058
There was no other way.

1522
02:15:08,898 --> 02:15:09,898
Mr. Stark?

1523
02:15:14,195 --> 02:15:15,529
I don't feel so good.

1524
02:15:17,781 --> 02:15:19,821
- You're all right.
- I don't know what's happening.

1525
02:15:19,867 --> 02:15:20,867
I don't know...

1526
02:15:23,162 --> 02:15:26,040
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1527
02:15:26,207 --> 02:15:28,918
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

1528
02:15:33,464 --> 02:15:34,965
I'm sorry.

1529
02:15:49,814 --> 02:15:51,273
He did it.

1530
02:16:16,048 --> 02:16:19,260
What is this? What the hell is happening?

1531
02:16:36,152 --> 02:16:37,903
Oh, God.

1532
02:27:34,185 --> 02:27:35,519
<i>Still no word from Stark?</i>

1533
02:27:35,686 --> 02:27:36,937
<i>No, not yet.</i>

1534
02:27:37,104 --> 02:27:40,357
<i>We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.</i>

1535
02:27:41,358 --> 02:27:42,401
What is it?

1536
02:27:42,568 --> 02:27:44,904
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1537
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:46,989
Same energy signature as New York?

1538
02:27:47,156 --> 02:27:48,491
Ten times bigger.

1539
02:27:49,992 --> 02:27:51,952
- Tell Klein we'll meet him at...
- Nick! Nick!

1540
02:28:05,883 --> 02:28:07,176
They okay?

1541
02:28:08,177 --> 02:28:09,929
There's no one here.

1542
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:20,981
Call Control.

1543
02:28:21,732 --> 02:28:23,025
Code red.

1544
02:28:23,692 --> 02:28:24,693
Nick.

1545
02:28:26,362 --> 02:28:27,363
Hill.

1546
02:28:42,294 --> 02:28:43,462
Oh, no.

1547
02:28:45,089 --> 02:28:46,090
Mother...
