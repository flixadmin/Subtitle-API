been my son's 21st birthday.

And, as a gesture,

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,236
I thought I would
invite your brother, Arthur.

29

Not exactly forgiveness.

But something like that.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,873
And also it's a way of saying
thank you to the Shelby family

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,749
for helping me and my children get by

That's very kind.
Well, I will let Arthur know.

the Birmingham branch

Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness.

327
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,998
I'm going to put that on the label.

328
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,434
I'll book myself a room.

329

Already done. The Midland. Suite.

330
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,754
I stay there myself sometimes.

331
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,792
Sometimes, it's where you stay.

332
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,271
But not tonight, it would seem.

333
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,232
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

334
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,195
- 4:00 then.
- Where?

335
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I'll find you.

336
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,790
What the fuck
was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

337
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,634
Have a guess.

338
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,559
You know what,
I can't even guess any more.

339
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll be back at 4:00.

340
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Why is she still here?

341
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,717
Something to do
with the coal miners, apparently.

I wanted to illustrate to you

that at any time,
we can reach your son.

350

And we will kill your son

as you promised. Huh?

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,636
Fucking.

357
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,156
- Fucking what?
- Fucking her.

358

Ten thousand pounds?

359
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,156
She left it blank,
so I filled it in for her.

360

What's Tommy's diary looking like
for the rest of the week?

361
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,232
Fuck Tommy and his cock and his gin.

362
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,231
And his stuck-up whore.

363
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,679
I saved this.

364

You haven't done my leaves in ages.

Swirl the teacup.

Think about the man you love.

Fuck him.

372
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,670

Okay, I'll read your tea leaves
if you go and get Tommy's diary.

376
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,238
See if Tommy's got a free afternoon
in the next seven days.

377

Now, read my future
and make it fucking good.

Make sure Tommy
keeps that Friday free.

Tell him I have an
appointment for him.

And then go and see a doctor
about that baby in your tea leaves.

You're not at the fucking
fairground now, son.

Get down and skip me 200

He's got a head on him, that boy.

ABERAMA: And a fist.

395
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,398
So what do you say, Mr Maine?

396
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,517
He works hard. He's game.

397
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,671
I'll need to work on his defence.

398
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,673
Right now, his left hand
is just good for wanking

399
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,435
You don't have to earn your money.

400
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,273
We're paying you anyway. Is he ready?

401
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,433
Is he even registered?

402
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,118
I put him down as a welterweight,
Midlands division.

Just need your counter signature.

(SCOFFS) What?
Like I'm going to say no to you boys?

Just tell us, is he ready?

In 30 years, I've never seen
a raw boy so ready.

That's 200, Mr Maine.

So who am I fighting first, Mr Shelby?

409
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,510
When you step in the ring, Bonnie,
who do you see across the canvas, eh?

410
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,794
I see myself.

411
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,838
Forty years old having done fuck all,
except tramping the lanes.

412
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,353
I see my life wasted.

413
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,794
I won't let it happen.

Boy's name is Goliath.

418
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,239
He said he's at a meeting.

419
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,280
Yes, I was wondering,

420
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
do you have any boots
that I could borrow?

421
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,673
Why do you need boots?

422
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,274
Well, no one here will speak to me,

423
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,794
so I thought I'd take a walk
by the canal.

424
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,234
Is he really making gin?

425
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,036
He's going mad cooped up here
is what he is.

426
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,998
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

- Oh.
- Thank you, Curly.

430

If you're going to take
a walk along the canal,

431
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,795
you'll also need this.

432

being stuck inside a prison.

If you had any sense, Mrs Carleton,
you'd get out of here now.

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,714
They were busy.

447
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,437
Apparently, there was a report
of armed men in the Small Heath area.

448
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,678
And there was a murder
at the Summer Lane hospital.

And something happening
on the Stratford Road.

The strikers threatened
the men's families.

451

They said, come the revolution,
their names would be on a list.

452
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,194
Like in Russia.

453

And the buses turned round?

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,076
Yes. They turned round.

Did you ever consider the possibility
that the communists might win?

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,157
And you and me, traitors to our class,

will be put up against a wall
and shot.

460

As a businessman,
I consider all possibilities.

No. I don't really have time
for hobbies.

This is more of a...

More of a place
where I try things out.

478
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,278
I've decided, if I'm gonna be
stuck here in Small Heath,

479
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,832
I might as well do something useful.

Less of a hobby.

481
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,519
More of a venture.

482
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,313
Since the start of prohibition,

483
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,520
I've been sending
single malt Scotch whisky to Boston,

to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
hidden in crates of car parts.

00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,189
(CHUCKLES)

486
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,593
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable.

487
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,000
There's been a lot of thefts.

488
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,238
And in this modern age, American women
drink as much booze as the men.

489
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,231
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

490
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,039
So with the help of a friend of mine
in Camden Town,

491
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,157
I've set up my own source of supply.

492
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,472
Junipers, potatoes, sugar and water,

493
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,593
all turned into US dollars.

494
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,715
When we're up and running,
we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.

495
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,590
But before then,
I need to get my recipe right.

496
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,719
So tell me the truth.

497
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,312
- The truth?
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,471
You're unlike any man I've ever met.

499
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
- And the gin?
- Too sweet.

500
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,794
You said you'd booked a room.

501
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,393
No, I booked a suite.

502
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,754
Thank you.

503
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,039
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

504
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,757
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

505
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,515
- If only you could...
- If only I could what?

506
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,518
If only you could change?

507
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,832
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

508
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,476
And "the good" is laying off
a thousand men, which I do.

509
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,436
Like a good businessman,
and I do it like that. (SNAPS FINGERS)

510
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,953
And people go hungry.

511
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,354
And the bad, the bad's
a fucking win on the horses

512
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,036
and a gun
and some fucking self-respect.

513
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,993
You fucking people...

514
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,959
You bite like your horse.

515
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,992
I don't trust taxis any more.

516
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,719
Come with me.

517
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,879
ARTHUR: There we go, brother.

518
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,073
Home sweet home.

519
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,549
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

520
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,314
Play games, gamble, cards,

521
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,592
and you keep an eye on our backyard.

522
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,552
It's Artillery Square, the place
is full of communists and strikers.

523
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,511
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

524
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,790
Light the fucking fire.
Take some of this shit off the walls.

525
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,551
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

526
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,678
- Arthur?
- Huh?

527
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,594
This morning, I wouldn't
have been able to pull that trigger.

528
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,238
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

I'm notJohn.

530
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,033
- I know I'm not.
- All right.

531
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,069
All right, brother.

532
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
I know you're not.

533
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,114
I know.

534
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,917
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

535
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,278
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

536
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,434
Not us.

537
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,514
You just have to flick a switch
in your head.

538

Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

539
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,919
And he's right.

540

They all know we're on the ropes.

546
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,832
- And that's not including the mafia.
- Yup.

547
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,354
Here's your carriage.

548
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,591
You can catch the 7:15 train.

549
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,032
I thought there was a strike.

550
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,634
What gave you that idea?

551
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,314
My God.

552
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,039
I know.

553
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,713
The bad I can't help.

554
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,876
I wanted you to stay.

555
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,872
And normally, I get my own way.

556

doesn't she, Tom?

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
- Walk her to the train, Curly.
- Yeah.

This talk of national austerity,

562

this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with a resolute certainty.

563
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,352
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

564

We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage.

don't allow unaccompanied

In return for something very unusual.

- To sit down with you and talk.

we have no need to talk.

My brother's a bookmaker.

Bookmakers hedge their bets.

Sometimes, long shots come in.

617
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,038
And because we emptied
his buses today,

618
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,679
he thinks we are among
the runners and riders.

619
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,513
Beneath it all,
my brother is a very rational man.

620
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,954
Beneath all what?

621
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,633
You mean, beneath the beatings,
the cuttings,

622
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,916
- the shootings, the murders.
- Yeah. Beneath all that.

623
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,474
Tell your brother
that when we take power,

624
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,916
all means of production
will be owned by the workers.

I really have nothing to wear.

You'd need to wear boots.

635
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,400
He's suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

636
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,517
He said you'd appreciate
the sentiment.

If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

since we left London.

He grows in the dark.

- Do ya?

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,437
Yeah? Well, the place is a shit hole.

653
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,398
Yeah? So why don't you
just knock yourself out.

everybody's in fucking bed?

Right.

Let me introduce you to David.

Oh, right, the problem, right,
between rum and gin

671
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,474
is that gin, right,
it leads to the melancholy,

672
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,870
whereas rum incites violence.

673

You know, it also allows you
to be liberated from your self-doubt.

I hear you're probably
more in need of the old rum

00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,232
at the moment
rather than gin, mate. Hmm?

Oh, yeah.

There's no need.

It's all right, I'm, er...
I'm getting a kestrel.

I hear that you've got Italians, mate.

You've got a kestrel for them and all?

- Yes.
- Hmm.

I have a kestrel for them as well.

I know you don't touch it,
but you have a good nose.

691
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,800
Right. Well,
you've got to ask yourself,

692
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,155
seriously though, you know,

693
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,915
did I even want to
piss and shit indoors?

694
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,153
Or was I actually born that I were to
defecate in fields and the outhouses?

695
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,550
This is a serious issue,
though, Tommy,

696
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,712
'cause your people, your class

697
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,110
and my religion
is quite similar, actually,

698
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,431
because you just cannot
wash it out, right?

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,797
I heard a copper got shot.
Who shot him?

704

- My kestrel.
- Right, oh, up the stakes, very good.

Where are the Sicilians?

706
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,195
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

Mmm-hmm. And reinforcements?

Ah, they know the Sicilians,
don't they?

fucked a goat on the morning

They've got traditions.

- How many are here?
- Eleven.

who wrapped his balls in an OBE,

can ask you that question, eh?

But the truth is, Tommy,

720
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,999
you're going to be
fucking dead soon, yeah.

721
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,117
Then your starlings, right,

722
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,351
they will peck out
your blue eyes, won't they?

723
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,991
And the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals

and pretty soon it'll be as if

it never even
fucking happened, mate.

Tommy, there are men approaching.

727
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,514
Yeah, let 'em pass.

728
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,758
Right. You tell Darby Sabini from me,

729
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,435
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

730
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,110
And after me, it'll be him,
and then you, then the Titanic.

731
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,551
They're the fucking mafia, Alfie.

732
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,394
They've come here and can't believe
our coppers are unarmed.

733
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,120
They can distil their liquor
and it's against the law.

734
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,396
They've come here
and they like what they see.

735
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,676
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,591
Tommy, when a pikey walks in
with hair like that,

740
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,672
you've gotta ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

741
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,678
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

742
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,151
- Who the fuck is this?
- I, my friend,

743
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,034
I am the uncle,

744
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,192
I'm the protector
and the promoter,

745
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,079
of that fucking thing right there
in whose shadow

746
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,437
nothing good nor godly
will ever fucking grow.

747
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,753
That there, right, is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

748
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,396
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless,

749
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,392
he was adopted by Satan himself,

750
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,949
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness.

751
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,073
He is impossible to marry off
due to his lethal dimensions,

752
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,834
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

753
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,957
And there he is stood before you

754
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,078
like the first of some
brand new fucking species.

755
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,278
Any man that you put before him,

756
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,478
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

757
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,479
Now, will you offer your son?

758
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,238
