1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,668
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:03,913
After 6 years of being a vigilante,

3
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,790
the only way to achieve my goal

4
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:09,382
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,355
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

6
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,462
I am no longer a hero.

7
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:18,746
I am inmate 4587.

8
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:20,778
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,293
I am Dr. Jarrett Parker.

10
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:24,679
I'm here to conduct your
psychiatric evaluation.

11
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:26,820
- What is your name?
- My name is Oliver Queen.

12
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:29,133
You kidnapped and
imprisoned the Silencer?

13
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:30,180
She's gone.

14
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:31,739
How'd you know she was
gonna take the belt?

15
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:34,338
The RFID chip I installed in it
is gonna lead us straight to Diaz.

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,518
- Where is Diaz?
- I don't know,

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,824
but I know who does.

18
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:40,641
Everything that goes on here
goes through the Demon first.

19
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:43,308
What will you do after
you find this person?

20
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,766
I will use them to stop Diaz.

21
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,355
Still resistant.

22
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:48,847
Agh!

23
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,018
What is your name?

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,683
My name is inmate 4587.

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,180
On your feet, 4587.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,188
- Who are you?
- Your new best friend.

27
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:20,191
Now on your feet.

28
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:30,417
Hold out your hand.

29
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:40,197
This will be on you at all times

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,133
to ensure the safety of yourself

31
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,816
and the other prisoners.

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,338
Where's Dr. Parker?

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,378
He said you're ready for phase two,

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,258
which means you belong to me now.

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,758
- Move.
- Where are you taking me?

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,699
Down the rabbit hole.

37
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,998
Welcome home.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,908
Inmate 10-13. Inmate 10-13.

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,428
No, no.

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,418
No, please, please. No, no.

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,178
Where are they taking him?

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,640
Pray you never find out.

43
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,339
Your wife is dead.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,058
Friend of yours?

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,110
No.

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,788
Is there a problem?

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,560
No. No problem.

48
00:02:56,563 --> 00:03:00,443
Good. Keep it that way.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,988
When's visitation?

50
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,128
There's no visitation down here.

51
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,158
No... what do... what do you mean?

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,828
It's probably best that you forget

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,680
about anyone on the outside.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,980
They'll eventually forget about you.

55
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,457

56
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,993
I read through your mission report

57
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:36,158
from the Switzerland op.

58
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,688
Director Michaels signed off,

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,852
but I noticed a few abnormalities.

60
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:41,478
Sir, if this is regarding the 23 minutes

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,028
of unaccounted time in our field log,

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,748
it is because we took a pit stop

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,368
for chocolate.

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,008
When in Rome, right?

65
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,888
Do you want some? You should have some.

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,748
- Actually, I'm diabetic.
- Oh, okay. Don't have some.

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,368
And I was referring to the
Intel we got from that mission.

68
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,848
This is Malcolm Byrd, a
black market arms dealer

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,898
specializing in
chemical weapons trading.

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,708
The data we pulled from the bank

71
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,508
tipped us off to an ongoing transaction

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,918
involving a gentleman...

73
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,019
Dr. Nyambi Somto, biochemist.

74
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,641
Two weeks ago, Somto went missing

75
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,790
along with a cache
of nerve agents banned

76
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,058
by the Geneva protocols.

77
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,058
We believe that Somto's trying to sell

78
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,730
these chemicals to Byrd.

79
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:20,037
Fortunately, A.R.G.U.S.
already has Somto in custody.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,278
So mission accomplished. Yay.

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,948
Not exactly. Byrd still
believes the buy is going on,

82
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,788
which means we can catch him.

83
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,222
That's where you come in, Holt.

84
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,367
Why is there a mock-up photo of me

85
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,128
I.D.ed as Dr. Somto?

86
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,678
We need an undercover operative

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,089
to impersonate Somto

88
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,597
and make contact with Byrd.

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,532
Somto claims he and Byrd
only interfaced online,

90
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,378
never face to face, thus the mock-up.

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,336
Uh, why does it have to be my face?

92
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:45,758
We need someone who can pull
off a convincing charade.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,785
You have 14 PhDs, including one

94
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,441
in biochemical engineering,

95
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,165
and you're fluent in
5 different languages,

96
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,858
including Somto's native tongue.

97
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,594
6, actually. Nowadays, I'm more

98
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,768
of a chill in the back of a Van,

99
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,535
surrounded by monitors kind of a guy.

100
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,907
Curtis, we don't need you to engage.

101
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,597
Just put eyes on Byrd.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,108
Me and my team will handle the takedown

103
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,488
and package retrieval.

104
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,738
Also...

105
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,300
It's an order.

106
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,394
_

107
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,968
Remember me?

108
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,530
I need to talk to you.

109
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,857
Hey.

110
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,358
I know it was the Demon
who hired you to attack me.

111
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,808
Stop talking to me.

112
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,118
Tell me who the Demon is.

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,018
- Leave me alone.
- Hey. Hey.

114
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,528
Ugh!

115
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,458
It was an accident, I swear.

116
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,948
Looks like you're having a relapse.

117
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,878
We warned you about this.

118
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,208
You know what happens now.

119
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,277
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,478
It won't happen again.

121
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,338
Get him up.

122
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,338
No!

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,948
Not through there, please.

124
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:29,318
The tracker is now paired with
a facial recognition program,

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,089
targeting all CCTV and traffic cameras

126
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:34,027
within a 5-mile radius of the Silencer's
location, updating in real time.

127
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,158
So when the Silencer finally finds Diaz,

128
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,425
we'll get an immediate alert?

129
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,323
Yeah, as long as you don't
adjust any of the inputs,

130
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:41,327
change any of the settings,
or click any buttons.

131
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,528
I mean, basically, don't touch anything,

132
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,848
and, yeah, we will be... we
will be... we will be just fine.

133
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,688
I'm not sure I needed
an in-person tutorial

134
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,938
on how to watch a blinking dot blink.

135
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,268
Sorry. I'm just really
anxious, you know?

136
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,746
We're so close to getting Diaz,

137
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,450
and the last time I saw
Oliver was a while ago,

138
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,567
and it didn't end so well.

139
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,217
Relax. Visiting your
husband is not gonna cause

140
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,108
our operation to fall apart.

141
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,505
Although when the
blinking dot disappears,

142
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,754
that's not good, is it?

143
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:08,145
- Crap!
- Hey. I wanted it noted

144
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:10,074
for the record I did not touch anything.

145
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:11,661
- Is the signal dead?
- No. It's just faint.

146
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:13,465
It's still pinging, but I'm
gonna need to boost the signal

147
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,864
to get a secure lock
on her exact location,

148
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,385
which may take a while, so
maybe I should stay here,

149
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:17,521
keep an eye on the
program, you know, just...

150
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:20,214
You can keep an eye on
the program from the road.

151
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,386
Okay, but the moment...

152
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,212
The signal comes back online,
you want me to call you.

153
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:25,211
Yes. Look at us,

154
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:26,869
you know, finishing
each other's sentences.

155
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,189
- We got some...
- Go.

156
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,897
Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,440
If not for Oliver's
sake, at least for my own.

158
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,156
I understand you've been
looking for the Demon.

159
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,300
Talia?

160
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,678
You survived the explosion on Lian Yu.

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,248
- How?
- You know I'm not

162
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,758
so easily defeated.

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,568
What are you doing here?

164
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:16,356
Oh. I ran afoul of an old foe in Gotham.

165
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:20,618
What surprised me was to
see you here, a prisoner.

166
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,676
I believe I taught you better than that.

167
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,364
Oh, you taught me many things,

168
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,978
including how to manipulate people.

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,028
So the attack in the shower,

170
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,676
Brick's mind games...

171
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,387
You pushed every button
and pulled every string

172
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,090
just to get me down here.

173
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:40,036
You always were a quick study.

174
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,338
Where's Ricardo Diaz?

175
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,169
- I don't know.
- Liar.

176
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,718
I'm many things,

177
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,048
but a liar is not one of them.

178
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,008
You asked how I survived Lian Yu.

179
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,861
The answer is barely...

180
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:03,176
And only with the help of a
drug supplied by your Mr. Diaz,

181
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,669
so in exchange, I facilitated an attack

182
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:08,598
on the man who murdered my
father, left me for dead.

183
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,241
More than a fair trade.

184
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,468
There was a time, Talia,

185
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,278
when aligning yourself
with a man like Ricardo Diaz

186
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,350
would have been beneath you.

187
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,468
I do what it takes to survive.

188
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,648
Another lesson you
seem to have forgotten.

189
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,637
I taught you to separate
the man from the monster.

190
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,044
Instead, you exposed your true identity

191
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:34,898
for all the world to see

192
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,450
and became the monster
you always feared you were.

193
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,075
What do you want from me?

194
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,738
There is a way out of Slabside,

195
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,648
and I need your help to escape.

196
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,478
You expect me to help you

197
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,239
after all the pain and the suffering

198
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:51,368
that you inflicted on my family?

199
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,858
What does it tell you that I
would even ask for your help

200
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,580
after what you've done to mine?

201
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:04,217
You don't understand what
they do to people down here.

202
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,903
They reform criminals.

203
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,368
They destroy them.

204
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,520
You and I once stood on the same side.

205
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,038
We can do it again.

206
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
You stood on the same
side as Adrian chase...

207
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,548
And my son lost his mother,

208
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,688
so now I'm here, trying to save

209
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,598
what's left of my family

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,078
because I'm stuck

211
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,228
in a cycle of violence,
and I have been stuck there

212
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,078
since the moment

213
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,278
you told me what to do
with my father's list.

214
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,278
You don't honestly believe that, Oliver.

215
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,588
There's no Oliver in here.

216
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,118
I'm inmate 4587,

217
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:50,851
so I'm asking you, however
you broke into my cell...

218
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,480
Get out.

219
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,557
Uh, excuse me. My
husband is Oliver Queen,

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,268
and as your colleagues
have already triple-checked,

221
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,788
I am definitely on his visitor's list.

222
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,648
It's been 20 minutes, and he's not here.

223
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,198
Inmate 4587 has had his
visitation privileges revoked.

224
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,438
What? What happened? What
are you talking about?

225
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,778
I'm not at Liberty to say, ma'am.

226
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,948
I'm his wife. I have a
right to see my husband.

227
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,460
I'm afraid you don't.

228
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,843
- You're Oliver's wife.
- Yeah.

229
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,377
I recognize you from the
picture he looks at all the time.

230
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,742
You know Oliver.

231
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,547
I'm kind of his sidekick in here.

232
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,408
Can you give him a message for me?

233
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,683
Can you tell him that
I have a lead on Diaz?

234
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,545
- He'll know what it means.
- I know what that means.

235
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,068
He'll be so excited,

236
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,568
but I can't give him that message.

237
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,138
Why not?

238
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,748
Because he got sent down to Level Two.

239
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,281
What's Level Two?

240
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,070
It's bad, it's really bad.

241
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,408
It's where they send
the worst of the worst.

242
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,158
But Oliver isn't the worst of the worst.

243
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,508
It's kind of a long
story, but he got set up,

244
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,498
and then he had to stab a guard or two.

245
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
It all kind of happened fast,

246
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,304
and there was a lot of blood.

247
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:15,715
No. Oliver... Oliver would never...

248
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,374
He would never do something like that.

249
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,447
I don't know if you've noticed,

250
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,906
but the guards aren't exactly
on the side of good in here.

251
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,342
- I should go.
- Wait just one second.

252
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,836
Sorry about your husband.

253
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,439
He's the best.

254
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,688
Target sighted.

255
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,788
Heading into the sketchy
loading dock to confirm.

256
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,708
Okay, Curtis. Once you
get firm confirmation,

257
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,117
we'll move in but not before,

258
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,306
so keep it cool, okay?

259
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,672
Sure. That will be easy
to do in wool pants.

260
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,414
_

261
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,961
_

262
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,851
_

263
00:12:58,064 --> 00:12:59,401
_

264
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,408
We still don't have eyes on Byrd.

265
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,490
Find out why.

266
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:20,140
_

267
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,523
_

268
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:23,729
_

269
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,461
_

270
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,588
Uh...

271
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,593
You do. Yes, you do, Curtis.

272
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:32,837
Yes. Yes. I do.

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,668
You speak English.

274
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,098
Bring you entire supply to the
Mandrake Gallery tomorrow, 8 P.M.

275
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,458
Monsieur Byrd will be waiting.

276
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,958
You'll get your money then.

277
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,998
Wait.

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,348
A second meeting was not
a part of our agreement.

279
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,593
Do we have a problem, Dr. Somto?

280
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,747
What are you doing? Just
agree to the meeting.

281
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,048
Curtis!

282
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:56,304
No. No problem at all.

283
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,234
What the hell was that?

284
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:00,957
You said this was a one-time deal...

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,818
Meet the guy, get out, done.

286
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,228
Getting roped into the sequel
was not part of the plan!

287
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,390
We're in the field.

288
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:08,318
Sometimes, plans change in the field!

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,156
You, of all people, should know that!

290
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,037
Look. My days in the field were over

291
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,968
the day Oliver went to prison.

292
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,788
I would like to keep it that way.

293
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,708
Curtis, we still need to nail Byrd.

294
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,500
We can't do that without you!

295
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:23,169
Well, then you better hope I have
a twin or a clone or something

296
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,308
because I am not doing that again!

297
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm out!

298
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,414
That doesn't make any sense.

299
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,159
Mr. Queen has two hours

300
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,987
of visitation left this month,

301
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,459
so I suggest you get
it straightened out,

302
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:38,153
or I will have the U.S.
attorney so far up your ass

303
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,808
that you'll have to turn
your head to the left

304
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,308
and cough.

305
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,188
Whew! I mean, no offense to Black Siren,

306
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,238
but I actually think you're
scarier as an attorney.

307
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,838
Black Siren gets results.

308
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,804
All the D.A. got was stonewalled.

309
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,705
Prison authorities insisted that Oliver

310
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,554
already maxed his visitation
allowances this month.

311
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:57,347
How? I've only been there once. I...

312
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,998
Something's wrong.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,470
Obviously.

314
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,739
Sorry. Empathy's a word I'm learning.

315
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:07,867
It's a work in progress.

316
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,118
The prisoner that knew Oliver said

317
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,656
they took him somewhere
called Level Two.

318
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:12,945
- We need to figure out what that is.
- We?

319
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,500
Consider it a lesson in empathy.

320
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,117
Okay. I'm accessing the
federal Slabside records...

321
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,148
Employment, inmate sentencing,

322
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,343
infrastructure.

323
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:20,812
I don't know what's more amusing...

324
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,869
The fact that you just
broke 6 laws in front of me

325
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:25,617
or that you're forcing me
to feel empathetic about it.

326
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,265
What? What's wrong?

327
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:29,906
Wherever they took Oliver
is completely off the books.

328
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,672
There's no record of anything
at Slabside called Level Two.

329
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,070
What the hell happened to him?

330
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,411
You don't recognize a dead body?

331
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,906
What goes on in that room?

332
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,437
That's where they reform you.

333
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,742
Therapy doesn't kill people, Talia.

334
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,378
You have a surprising amount of empathy

335
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,959
for a man who assaulted you.

336
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:31,015
He's dead because

337
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,206
of whatever happened behind those doors.

338
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:35,281
Then he's one of the lucky ones.

339
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:37,172
- What?
- Those who walk out alive

340
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:39,633
suffer much more.

341
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:42,834
You have no idea what your
doctor is really doing down here.

342
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,505
Come on.

343
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:46,914
Dr. Parker's behind this?

344
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,765
Not so quick a study after all.

345
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:50,875
You fell for Parker's lies.

346
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,898
That's what happens when you fail
to keep your two sides separate.

347
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,148
You become weak.

348
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:58,250
Whatever is happening,
we need to stop it.

349
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,631
These people are criminals

350
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:03,782
the likes of which you've spent
the past 6 years putting away.

351
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:05,664
I'm surprised you want to help them.

352
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,928
But you were the one who pushed
me towards helping others,

353
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:13,079
towards fighting for justice.

354
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,840
You had honor then.

355
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:18,001
That was a long time ago.

356
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,953
Now all I care about
is getting out of here.

357
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,294
Are you prepared to help me with that?

358
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,397
Then we have nothing further to discuss.

359
00:17:34,494 --> 00:17:36,442
I need to see Dr. Parker.

360
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:37,898
That's not how it works.

361
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,750
I need his help. I'm having a relapse.

362
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:46,351
Hey, Dinah. Do you have a sec?

363
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,092
Yeah. Uh, is this about the Hudson case?

364
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:50,043
Because I would like to
get 3 counts if we can.

365
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,258
Hi, Dinah.

366
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:53,492
Hi. Wow. Okay. Since
when are you two friends?

367
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:56,244
Well, we decided to start a support group
for women who've been attacked by Diaz.

368
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:59,554
Or his assassins. Do you care to join?

369
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,586
Uh, thanks, I'll pass,

370
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,417
but, hey, maybe you should get back

371
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,672
to witness protection

372
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,339
and you should head on back to Earth Two

373
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,963
before you both remember
you hate each other.

374
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,282
Okay. Real talk. We're working
together, and we need your help.

375
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:12,664
- We?
- It's called empathy, Dinah.

376
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,847
I'm about 100% sure that's not
what we're dealing with here,

377
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:15,970
but what is going on?

378
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,312
Slabside is denying
Felicity access to Oliver.

379
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,994
They're keeping him
somewhere called Level Two,

380
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,518
but there's no record
of anything at Slabside

381
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,454
called Level Two, so we dove
into the employee records,

382
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,810
- and we found something.
- Yes. A psychiatrist by the name

383
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,750
of Dr. Jarrett Parker with a "P."

384
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,901
We need you to check to see if
there were any complaints made

385
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:32,500
to the SCPD about Parker
during his private practice.

386
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:34,541
Surprised you didn't just
hack into SCPD yourself.

387
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,735
Oh, I did. There was just
nothing in the digital records.

388
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,410
I was hoping to do this
the old-fashioned way

389
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,160
and go through the hard
copies in the SCPD archive.

390
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:44,731
Okay, but what makes us believe
this Parker guy is shady?

391
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:48,702
Slabside doesn't have a psychiatric
program for their inmates.

392
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:53,123
Whatever Parker is doing
is not being reported.

393
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,764
Please. If Oliver is in trouble,

394
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,187
we have to help him.

395
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,187
Surprised to see you here.

396
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,579
Thought you'd be out.

397
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,062
Well, still have a job to do,

398
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:05,653
you know, the one that doesn't involve

399
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:07,324
possibly dismemberment and/or death.

400
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,562
Since when have you been
afraid of any of that?

401
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,304
- Since always.
- You know what I mean.

402
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,157
You always ran the risk
of dying with Team Arrow.

403
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,530
Why is it any different
now with A.R.G.U.S.?

404
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,530
It just is. Let's leave it at that.

405
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,281
No. We can't just leave it at that.

406
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,203
You're sidelining yourself.
I want to know why.

407
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:28,023
I just don't have it in me anymore.

408
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,750
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

409
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:36,179
Oliver's in prison. Even
he couldn't outrun the risk

410
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:39,830
that it takes to be out there fighting.

411
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,109
This life has cost me my marriage,

412
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,070
gotten me stabbed,
and people I love shot.

413
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:48,360
Maybe you and Lyla and everyone else has

414
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,748
what it takes to cope with it,

415
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:52,869
but I can't keep lying to myself.

416
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,852
Being Mr. Terrific...

417
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:00,962
It's just not me anymore.

418
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:06,213
I've been at war, seen the
faces of men who are done.

419
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:07,623
Curtis, that is not you.

420
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,633
Yeah. I am pretty sure that is me.

421
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,242
14 PhDs, fluent in multiple languages,

422
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,648
genius, bronze medal decathlete.

423
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,648
Mr. Terrific isn't just an
alter ego you can lay aside.

424
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:24,234
It's who you are, Curtis.

425
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:27,445
The only real risk you're running
is denying the truth in that.

426
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:30,086
Now, I respect your decision
to sit out this mission.

427
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,451
Just make sure it's the right one.

428
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:44,140
When did you notice the rage happening?

429
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,111
When I saw the inmate with
the Grim Reaper tattoo.

430
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:51,986
Interesting. Why do you think you
responded so negatively to him?

431
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,711
He was among the group who
attacked me on level one.

432
00:20:54,714 --> 00:21:01,328
Hmm. Well, the good news is you didn't
give in to your violent tendencies.

433
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:05,039
You came here. That means
the treatment is working.

434
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:10,920
Dr. Parker, the main reason
that I didn't do anything was

435
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,961
he was dead.

436
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:16,132
I... I saw him being
w-wheeled out of the room

437
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:19,093
with the blue door.

438
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:23,648
Unfortunately, some
inmates don't respond

439
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,559
as well as you to the process.

440
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:29,150
When you're breaking
new scientific ground,

441
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,828
setbacks are inevitable.

442
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,589
It seems like a...
ahem... Prisoner dying is

443
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,992
a little bit more than a setback.

444
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:40,743
Look at what we've done together,

445
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:44,133
h-how we've eliminated
that part of yourself

446
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,054
that was trapped in a cycle of violence.

447
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,435
Imagine that on a grander scale.

448
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:53,757
The world would be a much safer place.

449
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,078
Right, but people are dying.

450
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,088
What about them?

451
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,906
That sounds like something
the old you would say, 4587,

452
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,320
the hero who insisted on
righting the wrongs of strangers

453
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:14,164
at the expense of the
safety and well-being

454
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,935
of the people he loves.

455
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:18,646
I thought you weren't
that person anymore.

456
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:20,209
I'm not.

457
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,781
Good.

458
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:29,292
You need to continue
focusing on yourself,

459
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:31,813
on the man you need to be

460
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,834
for the sake of your family.

461
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,925
If you're unable to do that,

462
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,306
we'll be forced

463
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,949
to pursue some other treatment options.

464
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:48,570
Why is an arrest report from 1985

465
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:51,397
in the same box as an
employee file from 2002?

466
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,414
It doesn't make any sense!

467
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,344
Well, after the department
switched to computerized files,

468
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:56,086
they just stopped taking
care of this place.

469
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:59,593
You mean, the SCPD is
late to the digital party?

470
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,703
Wow! Shocking.

471
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:04,218
Felicity, there may
be some other options.

472
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:05,789
Now I still have friends in the FBI.

473
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,836
- I can call...
- Because the FBI is known

474
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,273
for their speed and efficiency?

475
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,836
Do you have a better idea?

476
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,797
Yes. I asked the U.S.
attorney to file a motion

477
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,703
compelling Slabside to
release all their records.

478
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:19,314
Oh, and you think my way is slow!

479
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,191
That could take weeks, months.

480
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:23,707
Oliver may not have weeks,
he may not have months!

481
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,981
He may not even have days!
We don't know where he is.

482
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,379
I had no idea what his
life had become in there,

483
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,535
the things that he's had to do.

484
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,324
Felicity, you've been focused
on catching a homicidal maniac.

485
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,363
If anybody understands
that, it's Oliver.

486
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,375
And Oliver's the one who
decided to go to prison.

487
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:42,395
This isn't on you.

488
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,574
And I was pissed about that decision.

489
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:46,754
I should have visited him more.

490
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,960
I should have been able to prevent this.

491
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:50,551
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

492
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,302
Look. I get it, okay, but trust me,

493
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:56,063
there is nothing you could have done.

494
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:58,894
You have to stop blaming yourself.

495
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:02,975
I thought that the worst
thing that could happen

496
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:05,168
was me losing my husband to prison.

497
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:09,337
Well, what if I lose him permanently?

498
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:21,270
Ahem. If you still want to
get out of here, we go tonight.

499
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,538
Well, I'm glad you've
finally come to your senses,

500
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,798
though I suspect your willingness

501
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,738
to conspire comes with... conditions.

502
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:32,496
I need you to help me expose
the truth about Dr. Parker.

503
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,207
And how do you propose we do that?

504
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,558
The evidence we need is
behind those blue doors.

505
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:39,121
We break in, we get it, we escape.

506
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,285
That would be unwise.

507
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,927
You've seen what happens to
people who go into that room.

508
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,117
They come out in body bags.

509
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,478
Talia, we are doing this my way,

510
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,029
or we're not doing it at all.

511
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:47,774
You'd risk both our lives

512
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,668
to help these prisoners, despite knowing

513
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,020
that every last one
is a murderer or worse?

514
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,711
These people are being treated
like they are disposable.

515
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:58,418
- No one deserves that.
- Tell me, did you feel

516
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:01,169
that same compassion when you rammed
a sword through my father's chest?

517
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:03,349
No, because back then, I
still allowed the monster

518
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,098
that you helped unleash take over.

519
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:08,285
Don't insinuate that my father's
death was somehow my fault.

520
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:12,286
Look. I... Ra's' death was my fault.

521
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:17,417
I couldn't see past what he
intended to do to my city,

522
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,668
so I didn't stop and
think about his family,

523
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:23,929
and for that, I am truly sorry.

524
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:25,812
I know you hate me...

525
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,087
But I was your student once,

526
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,448
and we trusted each other completely.

527
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,626
We need to find that trust again

528
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:38,828
because it is the only way

529
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,230
both of us will get what we want.

530
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:50,057
Remember, the area surrounding
this meet is densely populated.

531
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,686
Byrd will not hesitate to leverage
this if he suspects something's up.

532
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:54,709
Dismissed.

533
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,188
But he won't, right,

534
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,518
as long as you all
send me in there alone?

535
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,998
Curtis, that's the hope, but
don't worry, man. You got this.

536
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,574
Right. I just need to turn off
the part of my brain going, "aah!"

537
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,492
Okay. Ready. What's the plan?

538
00:26:16,495 --> 00:26:18,410
We're gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

539
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,538
The chemical will be housed in this.

540
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,689
The case contains a
hidden targeting system.

541
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:28,737
Use it to scan the building
and locate the hostiles.

542
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,814
That way, we'll know exactly
where to hit and how hard.

543
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,608
Once you locate Byrd, hand
off the case and get clear.

544
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,254
We'll launch the attack on your go.

545
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:44,009
Dr. Somto.

546
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:47,793
_

547
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:49,649
_

548
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,337
_

549
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,399
Targets acquired.

550
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,030
Make the exchange and get clear.

551
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,463
Ahem.

552
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,090
_

553
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,668
_

554
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:14,793
_

555
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,688
A binary chemical bomb.

556
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,158
I didn't take you

557
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,032
for someone as crude as a terrorist.

558
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:32,985
What you call crude I see as lucrative.

559
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:35,103
All I needed was a fall guy,

560
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:38,538
and you were far too perfect a Mark.

561
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,448
Perhaps you are
forgetting you are standing

562
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,371
right in front of the bomb.

563
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:46,182
You've heard of remote
detonation, haven't you?

564
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:49,470
For someone so smart,
are you really this dumb?

565
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:51,268
Well, actually, if I
wanted to do something

566
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,548
super-dumb, I'd probably
do something stupid like

567
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,238
tackle you to the
ground, take that tablet,

568
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,928
and shove it down your throat.

569
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,308
That's our Mark. Get ready to move.

570
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,598
Still a sense of humor.

571
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,108
Quite impressive for
someone about to die.

572
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,108
Guess I'm just ready for it.

573
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,198
I do have one request first.

574
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,658
Can you give me a countdown
before you kill me?

575
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,298
First time I've heard that one.

576
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,387
I wasn't talking to you.

577
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,246
Too bad for you I am pretty damn smart.

578
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,848
The bomb's disarmed. Byrd's down.

579
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,528
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

580
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,188
Do I still have my legs?
I got so much adrenaline

581
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,040
going right now, I can't even tell.

582
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,581
Come on, Talia. Come
on, come on, come on.

583
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,340
Hey!

584
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,168
Stop!

585
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,520
About time.

586
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,358
You know, they say the
mark of a great teacher

587
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,338
is when her pupil finally surpasses her.

588
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,438
Unh!

589
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,785
What... what are you doing?

590
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,689
What I should have done
from the beginning...

591
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:25,968
Let you perish.

592
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,090
- Brace yourself.
- God, I could use a nap.

593
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,228
That's enough of that.

594
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,863
Take them to the room.

595
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,738
Ugh. Yeah. Felicity, I hate to say it,

596
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,900
but I think we might need to
try a different approach here.

597
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,398
It's not that we're giving up.

598
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,166
It's just that we need to
figure out another way to...

599
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:08,648
Found him.

600
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,598
During Parker's private practice,

601
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,876
he was also a defendant
in 3 malpractice cases,

602
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,231
all settled out of court.

603
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:15,522
Check this out.

604
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,997
Robert Goodman. It's
one of his patients.

605
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,259
22-year-old male referred
to Parker back in 2015

606
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:24,078
after experiencing
several violent outbursts.

607
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,884
Parker promised the parents
he could make their son docile.

608
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:30,731
Instead, Goodman began suffering
spontaneous bouts of amnesia.

609
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,758
What the hell was this
guy doing to these people?

610
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,360
It's not clear. Some sort
of experimental treatment.

611
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,377
Looks like Parker's
making a career out of it

612
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,017
because I am looking at
about 8 different cases

613
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,642
that are exactly like Goodman.

614
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:43,108
Oh, my god!

615
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,465
Felicity, what is it?

616
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,467
"As Goodman's amnesia
became more frequent,

617
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,408
he eventually lost all
sense of identity and was"...

618
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,528
This is what they're gonna do to Oliver.

619
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,317
They're going to erase him.

620
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:15,223
I'm disappointed in you, 4587.

621
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:18,814
It's always so unfortunate
when a study doesn't work out,

622
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:23,047
but this failure is especially painful.

623
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,598
You're a monster.

624
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:30,078
We could have done such
great things together,

625
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,348
helped so many people.

626
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,934
This isn't helping people!

627
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,595
I misjudged you.

628
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,274
I thought after our work together,

629
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:46,705
you were committed to breaking
your family's cycle of violence.

630
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:50,246
My father pushed people away.

631
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,797
He kept secrets,

632
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,818
and I made those same mistakes,

633
00:31:55,821 --> 00:32:01,759
but if I choose to break the cycle,

634
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm gonna do it my way.

635
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:09,168
I suggest you hold very still, 4587.

636
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,636
Unh!

637
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,051
My name is Oliver Queen!

638
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,582
Well, it seems like you've picked up

639
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,465
a few new tricks without me.

640
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,270
These things are so barbaric.

641
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,365
Must have an anti-tampering alarm.

642
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,906
Lockdown procedure initiated.

643
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:04,707
All inmates should return
to their cells immediately.

644
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,398
I've got the key card.

645
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:11,759
I've got the file. We got to go.

646
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:13,982
We'll not be able to go quietly.

647
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,871
Hey!

648
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,742
Where the hell are you two going?

649
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,323
We're on lockdown.

650
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,582
You're supposed to be in your cells.

651
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,918
I said, get back to your cells.

652
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,588
Straight ahead.

653
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,297
Do you think they realized
they're outmatched?

654
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,780
I think they're about to.

655
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,458
This goes down to the water.

656
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,628
Right. The only way out
is through the morgue.

657
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,293
Shameful way to treat your dead.

658
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:16,224
They went this way. Over here!

659
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:19,387
They won't be long. We must go.

660
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,270
I need you to give this to Felicity.

661
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,746
If you stay, you will die.

662
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,012
If I leave, I'm a fugitive forever.

663
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,623
I won't do that to my family.

664
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:36,354
All those years ago, you were wrong.

665
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:39,397
Giving the monster an identity
didn't contain the darkness.

666
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,160
It just gave it power.

667
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:44,451
Separating into two selves,

668
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:46,934
hiding in the shadows...

669
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,217
That was never the answer.

670
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,857
Someone barricaded this.

671
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,465
Get someone to break this down.

672
00:35:54,468 --> 00:35:59,336
I will make sure your wife gets this

673
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,293
and that she knows her
husband is as stubborn as ever.

674
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,129
I'll hold them off.

675
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:53,383
Time to go, inmate.

676
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:54,863
Where are you taking me?

677
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,603
This whole place is getting shut down.

678
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:58,340
You're going back to Level One.

679
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:05,032
Despite official
denials of the allegation

680
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:07,733
of prisoner abuse at
Slabside penitentiary,

681
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,233
documents provided by SCPD

682
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:12,573
detailing the cruel
and unusual practices

683
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:15,053
of Dr. Jarrett Parker, a suspect

684
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:17,142
in the cold case death
of Robert Goodman,

685
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:19,493
appear to connect the
controversial therapist

686
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:22,860
to the prison, bringing
those denials into question...

687
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:25,384
Whoo! One for Team Felicity.

688
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,223
I'm still workshopping the name.

689
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:29,423
Question is which guardian angel do we

690
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,973
have to thank for this little baby?

691
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,473
Oh, don't know, don't care.

692
00:37:32,475 --> 00:37:34,403
Oliver is back sleeping soundly

693
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:36,313
in his regular maximum
security prison cell

694
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:38,483
with no evil scientists
trying to fry his brain.

695
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,973
This, plus what we got
from the records room,

696
00:37:40,976 --> 00:37:42,811
is enough to earn Dr. Parker

697
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:45,322
his own cozy little prison cell.

698
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:47,563
You know, Slabside's got

699
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,665
a real PR nightmare on
their hands right now.

700
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:52,723
What if we could use that for more
than just shutting down Level Two?

701
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:55,116
We can use this to appeal
Oliver's conviction.

702
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:58,434
We can use it to get
Oliver out of prison.

703
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,457
Agh!

704
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:31,813
You suffering from a relapse, doctor?

705
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:34,653
Allow me to provide the cure.

706
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:35,913
No!

707
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:40,574
You haven't made it home yet?

708
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,783
Ah. Wanted to get the
mission report wrapped up,

709
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:45,418
make sure there were no
abnormalities for Bell to find.

710
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:47,427
Yeah. Well, mission reports
don't usually take all night.

711
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,247
Besides, this was an on-the-books op.

712
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,382
Shouldn't be any abnormalities.

713
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,997
- Then why'd I find one?
- What's this?

714
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,595
Something I lifted off Byrd
before he went into custody.

715
00:38:56,598 --> 00:38:59,133
- Why?
- Lyla copied the bank data

716
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,143
because she suspected
A.R.G.U.S. has something to hide.

717
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:02,598
That data led us to Byrd.

718
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,323
If there's a deeper
connection that A.R.G.U.S.

719
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,535
Doesn't want anyone to find,

720
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:07,196
I figure we should know first.

721
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,232
- Worth the risk, right?
- Did you find anything?

722
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:10,375
Check it out.

723
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:15,023
It's a painting? It took you all night

724
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:16,527
to decrypt a single image?

725
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,652
Do you realize how many
decryption algorithms I had to run

726
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:20,012
just to get the drive to boot up?

727
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:21,933
This thing's security had security.

728
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:24,512
All right. Looks like someone
doesn't want us to see this.

729
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:27,235
- What's the origin?
- Well, this painting is

730
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:31,680
from the 19th century by a French
artist named Jean-Leon gerome.

731
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:34,781
The title is "Dante, he hath seen hell."

732
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:36,892
- Hidden meaning?
- Pfft. It's art.

733
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,883
There's always a hidden meaning.

734
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:41,405
We just need to find out what it is.

735
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,942
Welcome back, Queen!

736
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:50,443
What? Did you get
nostalgic or something?

737
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,373
Pretty boy walking.

738
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,009
Did you miss us?

739
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:57,403
Did someone want to go home?

740
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:03,293
Guess the morgue isn't the only way out

741
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:05,913
of Level Two after all.

742
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:07,553
I'm just glad I made it out of there.

743
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,317
Felicity will be, too.

744
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:13,083
What do you mean?

745
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:15,423
She came looking for you in visitation.

746
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:17,643
I told her about Level Two.

747
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,637
Was she okay?

748
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,573
Yeah. She asked me
to give you a message.

749
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:23,903
What message?

750
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,813
She's got a lead on Diaz.

751
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,512
She's close to getting him.

752
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,799
That's good news, right?

753
00:40:36,775 --> 00:40:41,403
Well, all this saving of
your husband crap has...

754
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,783
Well, it's made me very hungry,

755
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,243
so I'm gonna go get a pizza.

756
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,573
- Okay.
- If you...

757
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,696
Want to come or if you're hungry.

758
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,373
I don't know.

759
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:53,845
Are you asking me out on a friend date?

760
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:55,001
No.

761
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:57,753
Power boost is complete,

762
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,520
which means we have a signal.

763
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,000
What is the Silencer doing there?

764
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:08,883
_

765
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:30,133
Get what you came for?

766
00:41:30,135 --> 00:41:31,833
Yup.

767
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:34,553
Just making good on an old promise.

768
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,093
Isn't that right, Anatoly?

769
00:41:39,095 --> 00:41:40,235
Huh?

770
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:44,625
