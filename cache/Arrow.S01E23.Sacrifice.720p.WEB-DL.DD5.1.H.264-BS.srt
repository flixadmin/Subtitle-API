00:00:01,176 --> 00:00:02,738
<i>Previously, on</i>
Arrow...

2
00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:04,896
Maybe I'm finally ready
to admit that I still have

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,215
feelings for you, too.

4
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:10,273
No! Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,609
My father, he told me
that he failed the city,

6
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:14,711
but I never knew
what he meant until now.

7
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:17,497
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,423
Oh, no!

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,676
You can survive this.

10
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,428
Make it home.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,180
Make it better.

12
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:36,316
Right my wrongs.

13
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:44,875
Dad?!

14
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,194
Survive.

15
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:49,162
No! No!

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,578
I hope I didn't hurt you.

17
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:11,301
At least I can properly thank you
now for saving my life.

18
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:13,436
If I only knew

19
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,440
how you were
spending your nights...

20
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:21,194
My hope is that I can
explain everything to you

21
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,429
to help you understand.

22
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,615
You murdered my father!

23
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:29,569
You sentenced me
to that island,

24
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:32,873
to five years of hell.

25
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,042
I am truly sorry
for what happened to you.

26
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:41,331
You know I have
lost people.

27
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,116
Yeah, your wife.

28
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,051
Do you really think

29
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,171
that you're honoring
Tommy's mother

30
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,725
by destroying
the Glades?

31
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:53,234
As surely as you believe

32
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,376
you're honoring your father
with this hood.

33
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,465
Not a day goes by

34
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,268
I don't miss your father.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,187
You'll see him soon.

36
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:11,778
You can't beat me, Oliver.

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,246
Yes, you're younger.

38
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:14,864
You're faster,

39
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,817
but you always seem
to come up short against me.

40
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,953
Want to know why?

41
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:23,423
Because you don't know,

42
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:26,927
in your heart,
what you're fighting for.

43
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:31,664
What you're willing
to sacrifice, and I do.

44
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:38,138
No one can stop
what's about to come.

45
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:44,344
Not even the Vigilante.

46
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:01,411
The plane's holding steady
at 33,000 feet.

47
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:04,798
That's the range
for missile intercept, sir.

48
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:08,168
Lock missile one
on target.

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,254
Missile one locked
on the jet's heat trail.

50
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:14,307
Prepare to launch
on my mark.

51
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,926
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,278
Fire! Fire the missile now!

53
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,748
I take back every joke

54
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,047
I made about you sticking
a tracking device in your boot.

Felicity's
at Queen Consolidated.

58
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:58,611
She's still going through the data
she pulled off Merlyn's network.

59
00:04:58,613 --> 00:04:59,829
Did she find
anything?

60
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,281
Yeah, the design
schematics

61
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,648
of the earthquake
generator.

62
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,334
So we can shut it down.

63
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,919
Assuming
we find it in time.

64
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:09,589
Yeah, Felicity,
I got him.

65
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:11,958
Thank God.
Is he ok?

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,043
- Mostly.
- Ok.

67
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,595
I'm on my way.

68
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,164
Miss Smoak.

69
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:25,221
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

70
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:31,177
Please.

71
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,564
Take a seat.

72
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,783
You know, I think
I'd rather stand.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,820
You're not exactly
a hardened criminal, are you?

74
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:42,372
No, I'm not
any kind of criminal.

75
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,357
What do you call
computer hacking?

76
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,576
A hobby?

77
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,212
That I do not engage in.

78
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,268
Hey, I got a whole mess

79
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:53,584
of computer gobbedly gook
that I don't understand,

80
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:55,635
but it says otherwise.

81
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,578
I had my tech guys
go through your computer

82
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:59,079
at Queen Consolidated.

83
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,375
You used it to hack into
blackhawk squad security

84
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,394
to research arrows shipped to
a company called Sagittarius

85
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,923
and to analyze a water
sample to tie back

86
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:07,848
to a Vertigo drug lab.

87
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,150
These are all cases

88
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:13,719
involving... The Hood.

89
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,939
Tell me, Felicity.

90
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,024
What am I thinking?

91
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,662
Saved by the bell.

92
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,998
Excuse me.

93
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:28,368
Hello, Detective.

94
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,086
It's funny
you should call.

95
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,806
I got your trusty sidekick sitting
right in front of me.

96
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,040
I don't have a sidekick.

97
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,292
When I need help,
I call you.

98
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:39,462
Malcolm Merlyn plans to level
the Glades with a manmade earthquake

99
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:43,249
using technology
from Unidac Industries.

100
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,269
What?

101
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,022
Now you're just
trying to have some fun with me.

102
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,224
I don't know what
Merlyn's timetable is,

103
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:53,393
so you need to evacuate
the Glades immediately.

104
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,445
Get as many people
to safety as you can.

105
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,697
Whatever you think
of me, Detective,

106
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,651
please... believe this.

107
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,674
Sounds like you have
bigger problems than me.

108
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,381
Don't leave town.

109
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,454
You know...

110
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:24,424
I used to think the Vigilante
was a criminal, too,

111
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,310
but it seems to me,
whoever he is,

112
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,262
he's willing to sacrifice
an awful lot

113
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:33,149
to help the people
of this city.

114
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,301
Kind of makes him
a hero...

115
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:36,936
Doesn't it?

116
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,947
Look who it is.

117
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,584
My best friend in life.

118
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:52,985
Hey, buddy.

119
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,006
I took your advice,
you know.

120
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:00,760
I went to Laurel's,
to fight for her.

121
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:03,379
So imagine my surprise

122
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:06,432
seeing you there,
kissing her.

123
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,667
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,102
No, you're not.

125
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,976
Something's happening,
and it involves your father.

126
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,311
Keep my father
out of this.

127
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:22,231
Our fathers.
They aren't the men

128
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,116
we thought they were.

129
00:08:24,118 --> 00:08:26,786
They made a plan together...

130
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:30,539
to destroy the Glades.

131
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,460
Do you have any idea
what you sound like right now?

132
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,796
Your father's going to do it.

133
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:41,000
Because he thinks
it will avenge your mother's death.

134
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:43,836
Do not talk about
my mother!

135
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,012
The difference

136
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:55,648
between us, Tommy,

137
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,485
is that I didn't find out the truth
about my father

138
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:02,354
until it was too late.

139
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,774
But you've always known,

140
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:07,392
deep down,

141
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:12,064
you have always known
the man he is.

142
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:18,838
I wish you would have
died on that island.

143
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:54,373
We need to reprogram
the missile.

144
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,992
I don't know how to reprogram
a missile launcher!

145
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,613
I do.
Watch out!

146
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,795
Oliver, put the chip in.

147
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,197
Make it quick,
I got a comm stat meeting in five.

148
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,982
I don't want to be late for
my own funeral.

149
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,734
I've got it under
good authority

150
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:13,369
that Malcolm Merlyn
is planning on leveling the Glades

151
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,537
using some kind
of earthquake device

152
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,289
made by Unidac
Industries.

153
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,024
Who's your source
in all this?

154
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:21,526
The Vigilante.

155
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,830
He called me.

156
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:27,433
Has been
for the last few months,

157
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:30,803
he's been helpful
on some cases.

158
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,922
You asked for the task
force to catch him.

159
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,673
You swore to me you'd bring him in.
I know.

160
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,759
I swore to uphold the law,
because the law is steady,

161
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,378
the law is unchanging,
the law needed to be protected.

162
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,933
But what are laws, rules,

163
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,684
if they don't protect people?

164
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:48,487
Now listen, I know,
I'm throwing away my career

165
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,155
by telling you this,
but I am willing to sacrifice

166
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:54,326
catching this guy
if it means saving people's lives!

167
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,612
Please.

168
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:01,617
You're suspended.

169
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:04,086
Leave the gun and your badge
with the duty sergeant.

170
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:07,206
Lieutenant...
Suspension or incarceration.

171
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,458
You choose.

172
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,095
No more lies, Mom.

173
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,398
The Undertaking.

174
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,116
We need to stop it.

175
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,819
Everything I have ever
said or done

176
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,239
has been to protect you
and your sister.

177
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:43,325
What about all those
people in the Glades?

178
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:46,161
I'm not their mother.

179
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:49,781
I spoke to Malcolm.
You what?!

180
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,086
He could have killed you.

181
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,558
He killed your father.

182
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,477
No, he didn't.

183
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,929
After the "Gambit"
went down,

184
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,866
dad and I both made it
to the life raft.

185
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:11,270
And then we drifted,
for days.

186
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,238
In the end,
there wasn't enough

187
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,475
food and water
for both of us.

188
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,746
So he shot himself
in the head.

189
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:23,282
I don't want to hear this.

190
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:26,035
He sacrificed himself...

191
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,037
So that I could live.

192
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,122
Do you really think

193
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:32,591
that I could
go on living

194
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:34,676
knowing that
you sacrificed

195
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:38,130
thousands more
in my name?

196
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:39,965
Mom.

197
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,000
Please.

198
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:44,669
You have to help me

199
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,438
stop Malcolm.

200
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,942
We need to know
where the device is.

201
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,956
Malcolm.

202
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,241
How can I help you?

203
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,297
I see.

204
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,917
Yes, thank you
for calling.

205
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,718
What is it?

206
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,421
Malcolm's accelerated
his timetable.

207
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,141
The Undertaking is...

208
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,760
Is happening tonight.

209
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:30,766
Where you going?

210
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:37,656
Somebody in this family
needs to put an end to this.

211
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,394
Whatever the cost.

212
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,518
Hi.

213
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,857
Hey.

214
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,243
I woke up and you were gone.

215
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:08,279
I'm really sorry
about that.

216
00:15:08,281 --> 00:15:10,665
Oliver, I'm trying
not to think

217
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:14,452
that our history's repeating;
That you're scared again.

218
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,521
No.

219
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,223
That's not it.

220
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:22,076
Then will you tell me what's
going on with you?

221
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:28,633
There are so many things

222
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:31,386
that I have wanted
to tell you

223
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,805
for so long.

224
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:39,527
I never told you what
happened to me on the island.

225
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,696
You didn't have to.

226
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:43,481
I can see that
it changed you.

227
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,900
That's the thing.

228
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,987
Laurel, it didn't.

229
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,622
Those five years
didn't change me.

230
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:54,242
They just...
They scraped away

231
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,078
all the things that I wasn't,

232
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,714
and revealed the person
I always was,

233
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:02,884
which is the person...

234
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:06,104
That's who you always saw.

235
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:11,142
I don't know how you saw it,
but you did.

236
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,795
Nobody in my life
is who I thought they were...

237
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:17,131
Except you.

238
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:35,583
Laurel, I need you
to do something for me.

239
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,585
Stay out of the Glades tonight.

240
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:38,703
Why?

241
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,256
You'll know soon.

242
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,875
One way or the other.

243
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,629
I have to go.

244
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,941
It's over.

245
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:03,061
Laurel and me, I mean.

246
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,497
She's with Oliver,
again. Always.

247
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,982
I'm sorry, Son.

248
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,367
Yeah, and he said

249
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,853
you wanted to nuke
the Glades or something.

250
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,707
You know,
it's funny,

251
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,575
scotch doesn't make it
any more believable.

252
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,544
Maybe after your jihad,

253
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,163
we can grab
some steaks.

254
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,168
It's true, Tommy.

255
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,638
It's the reason
I closed your mother's clinic.

256
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,924
I didn't want
to see it leveled.

257
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:37,061
What?

258
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,647
I have something
I'd like you to listen to.

259
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:46,854
The night
your mother died,

260
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:48,740
she called me.

261
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:52,160
I awoke to a voicemail
from her.

262
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,561
Dad...

263
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:57,415
Her final gift to me.

264
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,452
Malcolm,
I'm in trouble.

265
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:04,622
I told--I told him
to take everything.

266
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:07,542
My money... my ring.

267
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,211
Turn it off.

268
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,364
They shot me.
I screamed for help,

269
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,683
but no one would come.
No one would come.

270
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:21,155
Malcolm, I don't want
to die alone.

271
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:25,393
She bled out into the pavement
while people passed,

272
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,029
did nothing.

273
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:31,699
Your mother
built her clinic in the Glades

274
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:34,769
because she wanted
to save this city.

275
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,372
It can't be saved.

276
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:41,342
Because the people
there don't want it to be saved.

277
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,327
So you kill them all--

278
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:45,046
Yes!

279
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:46,614
They deserve to die!

280
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,999
All of them!

281
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,269
The way she died.

282
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,844
The Undertaking
is happening tonight.

283
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:05,516
Oliver, Felicity
may have found something.

284
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:08,803
This symbol is a map of the old
subway tunnel system.

285
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,254
That's what got us
thinking the Undertaking

286
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,990
is connected to the Glades.

287
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,324
What if it's more
specific than that?

288
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,142
What do you mean?
If I had a machine

289
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:17,612
that could trigger
an earthquake in an otherwise

290
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,115
geologically stable area,
where would I position it?

291
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,151
Underground.

292
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,587
Yeah.

293
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:28,172
This is a U.S.
geological survey

294
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,958
of the tectonic plates
running underneath Starling City.

295
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,794
This red line here
is a known fault

296
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,829
that runs right below
the Glades.

297
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,146
About a mile, the fault
runs underneath the old

298
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,599
Tenth Street subway line.

299
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,135
Dollars to donuts, the seismic
device is somewhere along there.

300
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,937
I know where it is.

301
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:50,244
Now is not a good time.

302
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:51,779
Yeah, understate much?

303
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,181
Mom has a whole bunch
of reporters here.

304
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:58,018
She's holding a press conference
or something.

305
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,655
What channel?

306
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,373
Ah, it looks like
all of them.

307
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,526
Felicity, pull up
the local news, please.

308
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:09,497
My name is
Moira Dearden Queen.

309
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,967
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

310
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:17,088
And God forgive me,
I have failed the city.

311
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,642
For the past five years,
under the threat for my life

312
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:24,061
and the lives of my family...

313
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:27,815
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

314
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:30,968
with one horrible purpose--

315
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:37,024
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

316
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,777
I realize now

317
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,913
that my family's safety
will mean nothing

318
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:44,866
if I let this
dreadful act occur.

319
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,918
But you need to know

320
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,340
that the architect
of this nightmare...

321
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,408
is Malcolm Merlyn.

322
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,010
No!

323
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:59,213
Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens

324
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,081
in pursuit of this madness.

325
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,352
Adam Hunt, Frank Chen,

326
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,137
and my husband...

327
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,056
Robert.

328
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:15,646
Please.

329
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:19,200
If you reside in the Glades,
you need to get out now.

330
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:23,237
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

331
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:26,040
Please.

332
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,999
I don't understand.

333
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,300
I'm sorry. I love you.

334
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:39,086
I love Roy.
Roy?

335
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,422
He lives
in the Glades.

336
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:44,008
I can't leave him there.
Sweetheart--Thea!

337
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,894
Moira Queen, you're under arrest
for conspiracy.

338
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,980
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

339
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:51,265
You have the right
to an attorney.

340
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,768
Is it true?

341
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,939
Did you kill
all those people?

342
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,107
I did what I had to do.

343
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,519
Freeze!

344
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:32,506
Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest.

345
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,513
Dad, no!

346
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:45,519
Please, Dad.

347
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,739
Stay back.

348
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:50,524
I don't want to hurt you.

349
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:52,310
You can't.

350
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:55,129
And you can't stop me.

351
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:02,136
Oliver, I'm sorry.

352
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:04,005
Don't be.

353
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,174
She gave those
people a chance.

354
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:09,877
I thought Merlyn
broke your bow.

355
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:15,182
I have another.

356
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:20,821
I was going over
the device schematics.

357
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:22,907
The device can be set
for a timed detonation

358
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:25,743
or can be remote activated
by a mobile transmitter.

359
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,194
Something Merlyn
could have on him.

360
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:28,362
Listen, Oliver,
if we can just

361
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:29,947
get our hands
on this transmitter,

362
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,282
maybe we don't need
to track down the device.

363
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,750
It's too big
of an "if," Diggle.

364
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:34,468
I need you
in the subway.

365
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,338
Find the device,
disarm it.

366
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,956
So you can take on
Merlyn by yourself?

367
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,792
I have to.

368
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:44,862
Oh, he'll kill you, Oliver.

369
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:47,131
I know.

370
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,769
He's beaten me twice.

371
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:55,639
And I don't know
how to stop him.

372
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,977
Ok. Well, how about this time,
you bring along something

373
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,114
you didn't have the last time
you two fought--

374
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:05,449
Me.
I can't let you.

375
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:07,234
I can't let you do this
by yourself, man.

376
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,653
Oliver, you are not alone,

377
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:11,505
not since
you brought me into this.

378
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:14,658
Us into this.

379
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:19,130
Besides, army regulations--

380
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:22,166
a soldier never lets
a brother go into battle alone.

381
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:31,342
I'm out of bows.
I got my gun.

382
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,477
I guess it's up to me
to do the dismantling.

383
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,846
This whole area
is ground zero.

384
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,565
I want you
out of here.

385
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,017
If you're not leaving,
I'm not leaving.

386
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,470
Besides, if I don't
deactivate the device,

387
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:44,638
who will?

388
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,000
You were right.

389
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:57,701
I need one more
thing from you.

390
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,037
Yeah? What do I got
left to give?

391
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,006
I know where Merlyn
is keeping the device.

392
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:05,593
It's in an abandoned subway
station near Puckett Street.

393
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,962
How do you know?

394
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,297
That's where
his wife was murdered.

395
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,834
I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

396
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:18,338
We have a mutual friend
that I think could...

397
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,024
Talk you through it.

398
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:22,476
She says you care
about the people of this city,

399
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:24,979
that it needs you.

400
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,898
Right now, Detective...

401
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,734
It needs you.

402
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,700
Earlier today, Moira Queen,
CEO of Queen Consolidated,

403
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:48,586
admitted to a conspiracy
to destroy the Glades.

404
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:51,505
Everyone within a five mile
radius is asked to evacuate.

405
00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:54,842
Please leave the area
immediately.

406
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,295
Evacuation centers
have been set up in Starling City.

407
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:49,563
Looks like we missed him.

408
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,072
Shado!

409
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,991
Slade!

410
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:26,350
Boy, I should
have figured.

411
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:28,885
You couldn't
save the day...

412
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:32,272
without making a mess.

413
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:33,524
Where's Shado?

414
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,275
I thought
she was with you.

415
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,227
Actually...

416
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:39,029
She's with me.

417
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,116
Let her go!
It's over, Fyers!

418
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,506
Let her go.

419
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,575
Amazing.

420
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:54,428
A two year operation undone

421
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,765
because a young playboy happened
to wash up on the shore,

422
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:01,084
and now here you are--
a killer.

423
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:05,755
You wanted nothing
more than to leave this island,

424
00:28:05,757 --> 00:28:07,307
and now you can.

425
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,894
I can call in a rescue ship,
you can go home.

426
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,980
Tell me, Mr. Queen.

427
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,699
Are you prepared
to sacrifice your freedom...

428
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:17,151
For her?

429
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,583
Guess so.

430
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,734
Tommy.

431
00:28:50,736 --> 00:28:52,569
Tommy. Tommy!

432
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:54,071
Oliver.

433
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,857
Where's your father?

434
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,109
Ohh. I don't know.

435
00:28:59,111 --> 00:29:01,578
You were right.

436
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,648
You were right about him.

437
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,283
Oliver.

438
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:11,655
Are you going to kill him?

439
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:17,827
Get to safety.

440
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:29,005
Looks like a false wall.

441
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:40,534
Welcome, gentlemen.

442
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:43,620
I've been waiting for you.
I wanted to see you

443
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:45,455
watch your city die.

444
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:47,124
Where's
the transmitter?

445
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,876
Somewhere I can
easily get to it.

446
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:52,129
I doubt it.
You'll be too dead.

447
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,515
Aaah!

448
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:19,022
Stairs. Go, go.

449
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:28,282
So tell me--
are you ready to die?

450
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:31,785
You found it yet, Detective?

451
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:33,670
Not exactly sure
what I'm looking for.

452
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:36,707
Do you want me
to describe it to you?

453
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,576
No, I've got it.

454
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,577
You should see something
that looks like a circuit board.

455
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,230
Pull it out.
Do you see a timer?

456
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:52,450
Seven minutes.

457
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:55,086
Ok. Well, the good news is,

458
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:58,072
this is going to be
a paperweight in three.

459
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:04,462
What do you got there, grandpa?

460
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:08,132
Hey! Hey!

461
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,917
Hey!

462
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,769
Back off!

463
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:14,972
Learn how to count, jerkwad.
There's three of us.

464
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,590
Oh, is that right?

465
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,652
'Cause I only count one.

466
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:29,937
With a gun.

467
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,876
Where did you learn
how to do that?

468
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:36,827
I guess I have wicked aim.

469
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:39,547
What?
I went to your house.

470
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,666
Yeah, I figured I'd run for my life
with everyone else.

471
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:44,001
Did you--did you
come to rescue me?

472
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,953
Yeah.

473
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:48,005
Come on.

474
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:12,079
There are three wires--
you need a green one,

475
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,749
a yellow and one blue.

476
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:15,917
Cut the blue.

477
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,618
All right,
I got it, I got it.

478
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,327
Oh, my God.

479
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,097
No, no, no, no, no!

480
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:32,516
There must be some sort
of anti-tamper safeguard.

481
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:36,554
Hold on. I'm going to try to
figure out how to override it.

482
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:38,723
Not enough time.
There's not enough time!

483
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:40,141
Just hold on!

484
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,059
Not enough time.

485
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,447
Laurel.

486
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:48,566
Dad, don't worry,
I got your message,

487
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,352
and I did not
come into work today.

488
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,621
Save it, kiddo,
we both know you're there.

489
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,289
But listen--you got to
get out of the Glades.

490
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,658
You got to get out of
the Glades right now! Ok, please.

491
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,644
Dad?

492
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,830
Right now, Laurel!
Right now, Laurel!

493
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:04,999
Daddy,
you're scaring me.

494
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,585
Sorry, but I'm not...

495
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,421
I'm not going
to make it.

496
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,923
What?

497
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,225
What?!

498
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:15,643
You have to promise me
one thing, Laurel.

499
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,729
You're not going
to die along with me.

500
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:22,016
You have to go on
with your life.

501
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:23,717
After your sister died,
I pushed people away,

502
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,152
I became like a ghost.

503
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:26,904
I didn't think I had
the right to live

504
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:29,690
when my baby girl
didn't.

505
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:31,292
Promise me
you're not going

506
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:33,560
to make the same
mistakes as I did.

507
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:34,996
Where are you?

508
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:38,165
Promise me, Laurel.

509
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,168
Promise me.

510
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,954
I promise.

511
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,814
I love you, honey,
now and forever.

512
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,417
I love you.

513
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,021
Dad!

514
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:02,773
Detective Lance?

515
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:06,861
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

516
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,398
You do know how dangerous

517
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,366
it is to text and drive,
right? It can wait!

518
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:14,068
No, it can't. I'm trying to find us
another route out of here.

519
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,204
Let me. It's not
worth the risk.

520
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,457
Roy!

521
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,827
Roy!

522
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:25,279
Help me out! Help me out!
Help me out!

523
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,164
Roy, stop! Roy!

524
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,668
The device is about
to go off any second!

525
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,555
I can't leave
anyone behind.

526
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:36,957
I know you think
you have something to prove.

527
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:40,061
But you're not the Vigilante!

528
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:43,481
I can't do this
unless I know you're safe.

529
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:46,901
Then you better
haul ass out of it.

530
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,360
Don't struggle.
It's over.

531
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:31,695
There was never any
doubt in the outcome.

532
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:35,733
Don't worry. Your mother and
sister will be joining you in death.

533
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,818
Survive.

534
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,821
Thank you
for teaching me

535
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:00,207
what I'm fighting for.

536
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:04,711
But my father taught me how.

537
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:15,990
Come on!

538
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,953
Oliver,
Lance did it.

539
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:31,839
It's over.

540
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,375
If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman,

541
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:37,845
it's...

542
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,464
Redundancy.

543
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,593
Felicity...

544
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:55,596
there's another device.

545
00:36:55,598 --> 00:36:59,149
There's two of them!

546
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,108
What the hell's
happening?!

547
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:13,780
Ok, that's enough.

548
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,835
Ohh!

549
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,481
I turned
the damn thing off!

550
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:42,184
Merlyn had a second device!

551
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:46,722
My daughter! Laurel!
She's at CNRI!

552
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:50,159
Run!

553
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:11,013
Laurel!

554
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,632
Oliver?

555
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,184
Are you ok?

556
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeah.

557
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:23,592
The damage seems
to be contained

558
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,529
on the east side,

559
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,164
past Wells Street.

560
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:29,815
Laurel.

561
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,901
Are you going
to be ok?

562
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:34,737
Go, go, go.

563
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,876
Help!

564
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:50,052
Please! Help me!

565
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:53,222
Tommy!

566
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:55,558
What are you doing here?

567
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,177
I kind of figured that you might
come back to CNRI.

568
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:02,565
You came here for me?

569
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,103
I love you.

570
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:16,979
Get up! Go!

571
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,782
I'm right behind you!

572
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:22,501
Laurel! Laurel!

573
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:25,487
Dad! Dad!
Oh, thank God.

574
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,876
No!

575
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:33,796
No! Laurel!
No, you can't!

576
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:35,765
Tommy!
You can't!

577
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:41,771
It's too late,
it's too late.

578
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:49,145
Tommy!

579
00:39:57,788 --> 00:40:01,574
Ah, Tommy.

580
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:04,660
You're going to be fine.

581
00:40:04,662 --> 00:40:08,530
Another thing...
We got to disagree on.

582
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,706
Tommy...

583
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,059
Is--is Laurel safe?

584
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:22,511
Is Laurel safe?
I tried to get her out of here.

585
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:25,765
Yeah, yeah, you did.

586
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,234
You saved her.

587
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:30,853
I'm going to get you
out of here.

588
00:40:30,855 --> 00:40:32,354
You're going to be fine.

589
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,389
Stop.

590
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:41,363
I'm sorry.

591
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,332
No. Don't apologize.

592
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:45,284
I was angry.

593
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:49,338
And I was jealous. I--

594
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,675
I am my father.

595
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,576
No.

596
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,045
No, you're not.

597
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:59,862
Did--did you kill him?

598
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:03,434
No.

599
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:08,806
Thank you.

600
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:13,177
No, no!

601
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:17,565
Tommy!

602
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:24,188
It should have been me.

603
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,691
Open your eyes, Tommy!

604
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:35,866
Open your eyes.

605
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,490
