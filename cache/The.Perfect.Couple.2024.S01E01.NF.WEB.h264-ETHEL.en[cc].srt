00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,375
Hi. [exhales sharply]

322
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,125
You okay?

323
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,791
Uh, yes, yes, I'm fine.

324
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,666
Just taking care of some things
for your father.

325
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,375
-Um...
-Do you have a minute?

326
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,916
Of course, darling.

327
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,041
Uh...

328
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,500
Um, okay, so, this morning,

329
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,958
I... I don't think
you were very nice to Amelia,

330
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,833
and I would like you
to try harder, please.

331
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,541
[sighs] Me? Try harder? Come on.

332
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,375
Come on, Ben. She's the one running around
in her bra and her underwear

333
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,083
and I'm talking about
just, like, presenting your...

334
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Showing an interest in your in-laws.

335
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
Respectful.

336
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,750
Okay, look,

337
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,666
yes, she is, she is different
from you guys, right?

338
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,208
But she cares what you think.

339
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,458
She just doesn't place value
on the same things that you do.

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What same things?

341
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,666
I... I don't know,
like, uh, who you went to school with,

342
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,791
or what color the front door is,

343
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,875
or whether you're on the guest list
for Malia's wedding on Martha's Vineyard.

344
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,625
Oh, so, Malia Obama's getting married?
Fantastic, huh?

345
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,416
-Great.
-As I said, she's different.

346
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,458
-But her parents did a great job.
-[scoffs]

347
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,583
And... And it was them against the world.

348
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,000
And... And I think that's...

349
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,791
What, as opposed to your parents?
As opposed to us?

350
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,208
You don't think we've done a good job?
Come on.

351
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,083
Occasionally, sure, yes.
But that is not my point.

352
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,791
[sighing] Oh, Benj.

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Look.

354
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,666
It is clear that you adore her.

355
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,583
I want some reassurance
that she's equally adoring of you.

356
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,083
It is literally
the rehearsal dinner today.

357
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,083
-Mmm-hmm.
-What...

358
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,625
-What more...
-Do I have to say this?

359
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,125
When I came here,

360
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,875
when I came to Nantucket
to meet your father's family,

361
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
you want to know what I did?

362
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,291
I went out, I bought a whole new wardrobe.

363
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,416
I... I learned to crack a lobster.

364
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
I... I studied Tom Wolfe.

365
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,916
I mean, I... I can...
I can tell her to... To try harder.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, I'll get her
to dress fully in the morning.

367
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,458
-I'm sorry. Benj, listen to me.
-Make her read <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

368
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,166
I don't care. I don't care.

369
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,666
I don't care if she went to Harvard
or the University of Miami.

370
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,166
It's the Miami University of Ohio, Mom!
Okay?

371
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,791
It has the best zoology program
in the country,

372
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,958
and she went there
on a full fucking scholarship!

373
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,750
I didn't know that. You want to know why?

374
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,916
Because she never chose
any sort of interest in participating,

375
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,791
in being a part of your family.

376
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,958
I care that she loves you.

377
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,125
[scoffs] Wow. Uh...

378
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,250
You chose today. Sure. Uh...

379
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,375
Well, silly girl. I guess she thought
that marrying me would be enough.

380
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,875
[Greer] Well, let me tell you, it isn't.
It really isn't.

381
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,958
Not in the long-term.

382
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,958
-Okay.
-Okay.

383
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,458
[breathing deeply]

384
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,416
God damn it, Greer. Shut the fuck up.

385
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,166
[sighs wearily]

386
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,750
-[breathing heavily]
-[cell phone ringing]

387
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,625
Hello, Enid.

388
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,291
Greer, darling.

389
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,791
I don't want to keep you.
You have the wedding tomorrow.

390
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,833
But I wanted to check, you're all set
for your book launch next week?

391
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,041
<i>You and Tag are prepped
for the interview with</i> People Magazine?

392
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,791
<i>I believe the headline will be
"The Perfect Couple."</i>

393
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,583
I've been thinking
about all of this, Enid, and I just...

394
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
I actually would like
to distance ourselves

395
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,916
from all the "perfect couple" obsession.
It's ridiculous.

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,666
We all need something impossible
to aspire to, that's why we read fiction.

397
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,666
{\an8}[Greer] <i>I don't know why
they're even interested anymore.</i>

398
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,333
<i>We've been married for a hundred years.</i>

399
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,791
{\an8}They're interested
because you've been married for 29 years.

400
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,375
<i>You're their real-life Dash and Dolly.
It's part of your mythology.</i>

401
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I see.

402
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,333
Greer, are you all right?

403
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,333
All right. Have to go.
[sniffles] Thanks, Enid.

404
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,083
[cell phone ringing]

405
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:48,958
[ringing stops]

406
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,125
I can't say if Greer knew,
or if she didn't know,

407
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,250
but if she did, she never would've let on.

408
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,791
She keeps her cards
very close to the vest.

409
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:11,166
You never know
quite where you stand with Greer.

410
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,333
I mean,

411
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,208
beneath,

412
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,166
sure.

413
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
But...

414
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,208
I would do anything for her.

415
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,625
Well, not anything.

416
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,541
But a lot.

417
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,750
She's amazing.

418
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,958
[Amelia] Thanks for coming with me
to pick up my parents.

419
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,416
[Tag] No, I'm happy to.

420
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,291
I want them to feel welcome,
it's important.

421
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,875
-[ship horn blares]
-[birds squawking]

422
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,208
[Amelia sighs] I hope they made it on.

423
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,708
With her cancer,

424
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,708
my mom doesn't really have
a mind for details these days,

425
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,458
like departure times or anything.

426
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,000
My dad's just too busy taking care of her.

427
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,375
I'm sure he would've called.
They'll be here.

428
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,833
Um, about my mom...

429
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,583
She's really self-conscious
about everything.

430
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,125
Um, she never really takes her wig off.

431
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,041
I think she feels like if she does,

432
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,458
then everyone will notice that she's sick.

433
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,208
I promise I won't mention the wig.

434
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,250
Great.

435
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,583
Let me ask you something.
Does your mom smoke?

436
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,333
What, like pot?

437
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,416
-Yeah.
-No.

438
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,750
-Gummies?
-No.

439
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,458
Has she ever tried CBD?

440
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,083
-I don't think so.
-Oh, my God. No one's told her about that?

441
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,083
You know, it's a natural painkiller.

442
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,333
Yeah. When my dad had prostate cancer,
we used to grind it up in his cereal.

443
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,166
Oh! There they are! Mom! Dad!

444
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,541
-Honey!
-Mom! Dad! Hi!

445
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,000
-[Bruce] Hey, bug!
-The bride! Here comes the bride!

446
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,250
[both laughing]

447
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,250
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, sweetheart.

448
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
-You're here!
-[Karen] We made it.

449
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,666
-Yeah, we made it.
-Mom, Dad, you remember Tag?

450
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,875
-Hi.
-[Karen] Oh! So good to see you again.

451
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,958
[Tag] Nice to see you too.

452
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,083
Bruce.

453
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,708
-Shall we?
-Sure.

454
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,291
-Let me grab that.
-Oh! Leave it.

455
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,375
I'll take it.

456
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,833
-How was your trip?
-[Bruce] Good, good.

457
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,333
Yeah?

458
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,375
-Was there a big lineup at the ferry?
-[Bruce] Oh, there was. Yeah.

459
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,416
[Karen] Oh, look at this. Is this it?

460
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,708
-This is the house?
-[Amelia] Yeah.

461
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,875
Summerland, huh?

462
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,666
-[Bruce] Hey, there he is!
-[Karen] Hi!

463
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,666
[Benji] How's it going?

464
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,083
-Good, we're okay.
-Hi, Benji.

465
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,875
Welcome! Hello, Bruce.

466
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,666
-So glad you're here.
-Hi, Greer.

467
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,166
-Hello.
-Good to see you.

468
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,833
-Karen, I hope the trip wasn't difficult.
-Hi, I'm Abby.

469
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,708
-No, it was wonderful.
-[Bruce] Pleasure.

470
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,833
-Oh, thank you.
-[Abby] Hi.

471
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,458
Um, I... I wanted to bring this for you.
I mean, well, for all of you.

472
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,291
-How nice. For all of us.
-[Bruce] You're welcome.

473
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,833
-I'm Abby.
-[Karen] Oh, hi.

474
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:15,291
I'm so happy we could rearrange our plans
for the Fourth to be here.

475
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:21,166
And if the weather holds up, maybe we can
take a little trip into town later?

476
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,083
Absolutely. Are you a golfer, Bruce?

477
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,708
No, I'm not a golfer.

478
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,541
Well, you could probably pick it up, hon.
I mean, he's really athletic.

479
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,291
I don't think it's something you pick up,
but come on, Will.

480
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,791
We have a light refreshment.

481
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,291
-We have drinks for you.
-[Bruce] Wow, it's like a hotel.

482
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,708
We made, uh, blackberry martinis.

483
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,916
-It's a mojito.
-[Karen] Mojito?

484
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,666
It's kind of like a wine cooler,
but better.

485
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,458
-It's nothing like a wine cooler.
-Shut up, Tom.

486
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,708
-You'll like it, Mom, try it.
-Okay.

487
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,875
Um, the folks back at the Y,
they're gonna want a picture.

488
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,041
Do you think maybe...

489
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,333
-Yeah! Come on!
-Absolutely.

490
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,375
Thank you.

491
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,875
Would you like to do it
in front of the house?

492
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,166
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Hey, everybody get in. Everybody get in.

493
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,750
-Make it a group shot.
-[Bruce] Yeah.

494
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,666
Will. Okay, say cheese!

495
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,750
[all] Cheese!

496
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,375
-Got it.
-[Bruce] Thank you, sweetheart.

497
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,625
Maid of honor in the house!

498
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,416
[both shrieking and laughing]

499
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,083
[Amelia] I miss you so much
and I haven't even left yet.

500
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,083
Hey. Best man in the house.

501
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,625
-Hey!
-How you doing, dude?

502
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,291
-I'm good.
-You good?

503
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,208
-I'm fucking great.
-You all right?

504
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,250
Uh, yeah.

505
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,625
-Hey!
-Shooter.

506
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,041
Psyched to be the best man?
I know I would be, if I'd been asked.

507
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,625
It's not like you were my best man.

508
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:40,166
Oh, well, you were, but, hey, it's fine.
It's all good. It's okay.

509
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,250
You're... You're the worst man, so...

510
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,208
-It's funny. Good one.
-Don't be sore.

511
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,583
Shooter, I didn't know
you guys were traveling together.

512
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:51,125
Oh, well, he was on the taxi stand
and, uh, mooched a ride off me.

513
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,833
[Thomas] Hard labor for the groom.

514
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,666
Shoot, do I get a hug?

515
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,041
Hey, there's the Moose!

516
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,750
-Oh!
-Thank you.

517
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,625
-Elaine? Take it away.
-Yes, ma'am.

518
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:17,041
We moved up the wedding to accommodate
Mrs. Sacks' dying schedule,

519
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,333
and she brings
grocery-store bananas. [scoffs]

520
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,416
It's the day
of the rehearsal dinner, y'all!

521
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,041
Can you believe it?

522
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,833
I'm here at this sick pool,

523
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:41,833
so stay tuned because I'm coming back
with some really exciting updates.

524
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,083
Hey, um, Shooter.

525
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,041
-Take a picture with me.
-[chuckles]

526
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,166
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh!

527
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,000
-Don't answer that.
-DL?

528
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,500
It's just this guy
I was low-key hooking up with.

529
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,791
A code name, not his real name.
Nobody uses real names.

530
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,875
-Yeah, everybody knows that.
-Yeah.

531
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,291
Okay.

532
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,666
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

533
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,125
Yeah. What, do I...

534
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,875
His girlfriend just broke up with him.

535
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:12,375
Dude, come on, it clearly wasn't working
and so we made a mutual, like...

536
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,166
What? No, that doesn't make sense.

537
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,166
I'm gonna kill her.
She sounds like an idiot.

538
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,083
-Will you take a photo with me?
-Yeah, yeah.

539
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,083
Do you mind?

540
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,000
-Girls your age are just my demo.
-[chuckles]

541
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,166
[camera shutter clicks]

542
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,125
Okay, I'm gonna laugh really hard
like you said something really funny,

543
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,541
-'cause girls like funny boys.
-[chuckling] Okay.

544
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,125
-Let's see, is it cute?
-That's cute. Here.

545
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,125
-Aw, this is so cute!
-[chuckles]

546
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,583
Can I tag you?

547
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,125
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

548
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,583
-Will.
-Yeah?

549
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,458
[chuckles] Come on.

550
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,541
Your shoes are really cool.

551
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,333
Thanks.

552
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,875
-All right, I'll see you later.
-See you later, Will.

553
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,333
[man] Bye.

554
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,541
Uh, Merritt, she was a, how do you say,
I don't wanna say a <i>salope.</i>

555
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,208
I wouldn't say a slut, but she...

556
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,333
I think she's... She loves
having a good time, right?

557
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,416
I met Merritt once
at a dinner party in New York,

558
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,333
way before Amelia and Benji.

559
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,458
She was dating my friend's boss
from Sotheby's.

560
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,791
He was loaded, and 5'6".

561
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,375
I'm sure they were very much in love.

562
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,333
I can tell you one thing for certain:

563
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,833
I never fucked her.

564
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,416
[Thomas] I don't know
why you two don't go public.

565
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,625
That fucking toothpick
gets more attention than I ever did.

566
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,666
She's a well-kept woman.

567
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,875
[blues music playing]

568
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,375
[Tag] Mmm.

569
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,041
Thank you.

570
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,708
[Tag exhales]

571
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,416
-Big day for Benji, huh?
-Yeah.

572
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,250
Tomorrow our blue-eyed boy becomes a man.

573
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,541
[Tag chuckles]

574
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,500
Not that marriage is some kind of baptism
of manhood or anything.

575
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,291
I mean, not mine anyway.

576
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,541
Abby's got my fucking nuts in a vise.

577
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,625
[snickers]

578
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,958
I promised her we'd get a new apartment.

579
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,458
Hey. I need a loan.

580
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,291
Just a Band-Aid.

581
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,583
Got in a little over my head
on an options play.

582
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,875
[laughs]

583
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,291
Ah, Jesus.

584
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,291
You know,
I'll never forget the look on Nick's face

585
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,750
when I went up to Groton
to pick this thing up.

586
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,625
I could tell... I could tell
he'd put his heart and soul into it.

587
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,125
I mean, look at the inlay on that.

588
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,750
He was beaming with pride to have
this thing go out with his name on it.

589
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,125
[inhales]

590
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,500
Well, it sounds like
he really put in the time.

591
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,166
[Tag exhales]

592
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,416
Because he knew it would pay off.

593
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,541
He launched his baby into the world

594
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
and he knew it would perform.

595
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,250
Not, uh...

596
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,875
drop to the bottom like a fucking stone.

597
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,083
You know?

598
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,708
[Thomas clears throat]

599
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,500
[Amelia] Oh, God.

600
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,125
It's like Greer wants me to back out.

601
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,458
[Merritt] Honestly... [whispers] Fuck her.

602
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,791
She's a snob-and-a-half.

603
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,916
You know, I bet she married Tag
for his old money name,

604
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,125
just to make her book jackets look cooler.

605
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,875
-I called her GG Dubs this morning.
-[laughs]

606
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,250
I swear she would have shit a brick

607
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,916
if one would fit
through her tight, little butthole.

608
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,250
[laughing] No! No!

609
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,250
Ugh. I don't want to think about
Greer's butthole.

610
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,291
But now I am,
and it's definitely bleached and waxed.

611
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,000
[both laughing]

612
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,000
Definitely.

613
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,875
[both giggling]

614
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,666
I see you, bitch.

615
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,541
[both chuckle]

616
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,833
All right, talk to me.

617
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,083
What's really going on?

618
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,333
[sighs]

619
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,708
Okay.

620
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Have you ever loved someone so much

621
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:22,458
you'd, like, kill to be with them?

622
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,791
I don't know
if I feel that way about Benji.

623
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,583
Okay.

624
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,458
But this isn't just because
his mom sucks, right?

625
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:40,375
-Because you're not marrying his mom.
-No, I know how lucky I am. I do.

626
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
I mean, it's Benji. He's...

627
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,083
-so kind and...
-Mmm.

628
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,000
So handsome.

629
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,875
-So rich. Oh, my God. Sorry.
-Stop it!

631
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:53,833
Don't do that.

632
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,833
-I love him, and you know I do.
-Sorry. I know you do.

633
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,583
But...

634
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,125
shouldn't I be like...

635
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,208
addicted?

636
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,375
Like...

637
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,750
when I'm with him, I <i>need</i> to touch him.

638
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,500
And when I'm not with him, I'm fantasizing

639
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,708
about the next time I get to be.

640
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:24,958
[sighs]

641
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,416
I think I know what's going on here.

642
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,500
-You do?
-Yeah, it's just cold feet.

643
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,916
[Amelia chuckles]

644
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,875
It's normal.

645
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,166
Don't worry about it.

646
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,708
Yeah. You're right.

647
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:46,625
Anyway, even if I wanted to back out,
there's no way I could now.

648
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,875
Bitch, you can do whatever you want to do.

649
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,375
And I will back you up all the way. Okay?

650
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,333
But...

651
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,041
You don't really
want to call it off, do you?

652
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:08,750
You're not only doing this
because of your mom, right?

653
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
No.

654
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,583
I don't.

[Merritt] Sorry.

663
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,458
All right. Who wants this?

Hey.

-Mmm-hmm.

Hey, um...

00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,208
Happy wedding eve.

Oh, my God.

671
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,250
-Benji!
-Do you like it?

672
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,416
I love it!

[laughs]

674
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:19,500
And I look so, like, regal or something.

675
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,583
It's not totally dry yet, so...

676
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,708
-Okay.
-[clears throat]

677
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,833
And you are regal.

678
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,083
-Yeah, right.
-You are.

679
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,250
-[Shooter] Right here.
-[Merritt laughing]

680
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,166
I'm the luckiest guy on earth
to be marrying you.

681
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,666
[indistinct chatter]

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,750
-I love it when you smell like paint.
-[chuckles softly]

[Amelia exhales]

686
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
-What?
-[sighs]

687
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,333
Nothing.

688
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,083
[both sigh]

689
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,250
-What did I do?
-Nothing.

690
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,791
[sighs] You're perfect,
and I don't deserve you.

691
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,708
[scoffs] Perfect?

692
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Okay. Uh...

693
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,166
What is this about?

694
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,250
Because...

695
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:05,833
It's fine.

696
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,375
Oh, fuck it.

697
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,833

[exhales heavily]

699
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,333
I know Greer thought
the engagement was a little fast.

700
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,291
Amelia and Benji only met last year.

701
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,375
Some donor event at the zoo.

702
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:53,416
Mrs. Amelia washes her own dishes.

703
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,791
It's rude.

704
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:58,166
I don't come into her job at the zoo
and pet the animals.

705
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,041
Miss Sacks is lovely.

706
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,833
But she's from Easton, Pennsylvania.
[chuckles]

707
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,208
Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um...

708
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,583
Monomoy's not her natural habitat.

709
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:22,833
I said it!

710
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:25,791
[Isabel] <i>She jumped feet first
into a wasp's nest.</i>

711
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,250
Someone was going to get stung.

712
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:30,958
[laughter on video]

713

Ah! Happy wedding eve!</i>

714
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:37,166
[Benji] <i>Happy wedding eve!
I love this woman to death. You get that?</i>

715
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,291
Okay, so, apparently
this knife was found near the scene.

716
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,000
Forensics are running tests.

717
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,166
Enlighten me, what kind of knife is that?

718
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,458
[Dan exhales]

719
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,833
Oyster shucker.

720
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,458
That's what you shuck an oyster with?

721
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,458
You really never seen an oyster shucker?

722
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,666
You know what, Carl?

723
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,458
I just met you, and I...
I already don't like you.

724

-[Carl chuckles]
-Like, at all.

725
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,750
I mean, even my daughter
knows how to shuck an oyster.

726
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,708
Chief, she seems a little grumpy.
You got a candy bar on you?

727
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, my God.
You know, I'm a grown-ass woman, Carl.

728
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,500
I don't need anybody
helping me with what I eat.

729
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,541
Maybe a donut.

730
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,833
Okay, you know,
I actually will have this. Thank you.

731
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,333
-That's... That's very nice of you.
-I don't need a donut.

00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,833
Oh, my God!

733
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,500
-Yeah?
-Fuck the fucking oysters.

734
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,125
This is the best donut
I've ever had in my life!

00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:39,333
-Have you talked to your dad?
-Yeah, yeah, I asked him. It's fine.

791
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:43,000
The Beresford's will only hold
the apartment until the end of the month.

792
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,750
-I know. It's fine.
-I need to get into that building.

793
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,791
-Do I need to remind you that I'm...
-Pregnant?

794
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:50,916
Oh! Are you pregnant?

795
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,208
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

796
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,166
By the end of the month.

797
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,583
God.

798
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:10,666
[Benji] So, he goes outside and his mom's
there rifling through the trash.

799
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,791
He's like, "Mom, what are you doing?
Are you smoking meth again?"

800
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,625
She goes, "No, I'm looking for my teeth."

[men laugh]

802
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,791
Hey, dude, what's with the,
uh, scissor sisters over there?

803
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,750
Have they ever rubbed nubs?

804
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,666
I mean, it doesn't mean
she doesn't love you, you know.

805
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,041
We all know she loves your money.

806
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,166
Hey, Tom. Shut up.

807
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,791
What? They're all in it for the money.

808
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,375
But at least my wife
matches the fucking wallpaper.

809
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,875
[laughs]

810
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,541
That's funny. Yeah, it's a total mystery
why Benji didn't make you the best man.

Go for a swim.

815
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,500
Cool off for a while.

816
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,333
-Yeah, maybe I'll do that.
-Yeah, do that.
