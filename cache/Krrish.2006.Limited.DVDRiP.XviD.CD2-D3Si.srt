1
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:14,584
I'm not going to the circus with you.

2
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,522
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

3
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,662
How can I help it if he refused
to climb the pole?

4
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:23,422
And the fish... instead of
coming into my hand...

5
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,932
They palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

6
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,964
Wow! Priya smile!

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,471
In India you caught the fish so easily!

8
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:41,276
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

9
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:43,578
But you're not standing by me!

10
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:47,889
I've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

11
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,184
For life? When my mother asks
you what you do?

12
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,692
What will you say?

13
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,057
I'll tell her what I do

14
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:55,565
Love you.

15
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:58,924
And... what else will you say?

16
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,834
I'll fulfill all your wishes, look after you.

17
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,370
And?

18
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,175
I'll never let a smile leave your face.

19
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:15,280
And?

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,885
Whether times good or bad
we'll always be together.

21
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,785
just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

22
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:23,489
And?

23
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:27,359
You will dream and I'll fulfill them.

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,662
And?

25
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,969
In the scorching heat of the sun,
I'll be your shade.

26
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,733
and in the cold, I'll give you warmth.

27
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,106
When the rains bother you, I'll change
the course of the clouds.

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,572
and when a storm blows...
I'll turn the winds away.

29
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,184
That's how I shall protect
you all my life...

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,326
from every danger.

31
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,589
from every trouble.

32
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,133
Now I hope your mother will agree?

111

Friend

112
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,369
Priya!

113
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,569
Are you all right?

114
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,806
But how did you get here?

115
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,175
You had fainted.

116
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,509
I had gone to get some water for you...

117
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:31,044
God! What a blaze! Come,
let's go home.

118
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,725
The most sensational news in
Singapore right now

119
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:48,098
is the circus blaze at Marina Bay
which took place last night

120
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,901
and the daredevil masked man savior who, in a
flash, rescued many victims trapped in the fire

121
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:58,376
and has become every child's hero overnight but
his identity is still shrouded in mystery.

122
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:02,581
Till yesterday, we only had a description
and a picture of the masked man.

123
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,680
Today, we've got to know his name

124
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:09,120
and also got a piece of his mask.
Let's find out how.

125
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,517
He said his name is Krrish

126
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:14,663
and this piece of the mask broke
from his forehead.

127
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,126
So his name is Krrish!

128
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,163
KRRISH!

129
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,200
But his identity is still shrouded
in mystery.

130
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:27,775
Whoever Krrish is, a bravery award
and cash reward of 25000 dollars...

131
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:29,411
has been announced in appreciation
of his courage.

132
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,740
So how are we going to identify Krrish?

133
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:36,146
The one, whose mask this piece matches with,
will be considered to be Krrish.

134
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:38,981
And he'll be the one to be rewarded.

135
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:43,250
Krrish! Krrish! After all who is this Krrish?

136
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,819
Listen carefully, our priority
at the moment is Krrish.

137
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:51,161
Only Krrish! Get that?

138
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,425
Krrish's identity...

139
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,935
Our channel should be the
first to reveal him!

140
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,471
Do you get that?

141
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:12,648
Our channel must be the first one to
unmask this masked Krrish!

142
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:17,493
Get it? Stop nodding and leave!
Go, get him! Go, go!

143
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,191
Where are the two of you going?

144
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,559
To look for Krrish.

145
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,998
Ah, forget Krrish. And look for a new job.

146
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:28,434
New job?

147
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:30,498
You both are fired.

148
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:31,503
What?

149
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,798
You better go back to India...

150
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,945
and enjoy your Krishna's flute playing.

151
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,277
Don't waste your time, Go, go!

152
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,274
Out!

153
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:45,150
Thanks to Krishna we're jobless.

154
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,954
Now what do we do?

155
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:53,693
Honey, I think Krrish is none other
than our own Krishna.

156
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,062
What?

157
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,021
Yes, Honey!

158
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,528
At the circus, I saw Krrish from
such a close distance.

159
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,836
I have a strong feeling that Krishna is Krrish.

160
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:09,045
So why didn't you tell this to
boss at the meeting?

161
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:13,545
Because I wasn't sure, I need
to confirm it first.

162
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,545
Confirm? How?

163
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:19,917
Listen, I have an idea...

164
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,420
Honey, these guys?

165
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,559
Priya! I've hired some actors.
But I'm a bit late...

166
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,818
I'll be there soon.

167
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:32,653
What?

168
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:36,864
So who are these guys?

169
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:41,135
Oh my God! Help!

170
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,487
This is now mine... bye!

171
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:15,927
I'm so sorry, Krishna. I'm so sorry.

172
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:22,275
I thought you were Krrish and
planned my own kidnapping.

173
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,847
But then, real goons turned up
instead of the hired ones.

174
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:30,885
Real goons?

175
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,459
But why didn't you hit back?

176
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,693
Why did you quietly take their beating?

177
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:46,457
I wanted to see...

178
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:53,975
whether it hurts you to see me in pain.

179
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:58,977
It does.

180
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:12,984
Where's your ring?

181
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,996
Maybe they've...

182
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:09,078
Who's he? Why's he here?

183
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:13,220
I think he's the masked man.

184
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,724
Masked man?

185
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:32,872
Get him.

186
00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:58,826
I'm sorry, sorry.

187
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:41,937
My friend Krrish!

188
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:49,210
I'll tell everyone, I'll tell my sister.

189
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:53,473
No, Kristian. Don't tell anyone.

190
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:59,246
Why? You become famous!
You'll get the reward.

191
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,059
Here, Kristian. You become Krrish.

192
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:16,562
Take it. Get the money for your sister.

193
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,538
Make her legs good again.

194
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:22,907
Take it!

195
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,079
No, it's yours. You are the hero.

196
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:40,918
Every human being who fights for a
good cause is a hero, Kristian.

197
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:44,722
You... are fighting for your sister.

198
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,597
You are a hero.

199
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,104
The biggest news of today!

200
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,075
Superhero Krrish has revealed his
identity to the media...

201
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,545
and the broken piece of the mask
fitting his mask

202
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,513
has confirmed his identity

203
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:06,279
Here today, Hero Honda is honoring
Krrish for his bravery

204
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:09,581
Well done young man.

205
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:10,349
Thank you

206
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:33,808
Not once did it occur to me that
Kristian could also be Krrish!

207
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,881
He was also there at the circus that night!

208
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:39,854
Had it struck me that night

209
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,580
I wouldn't have got a thrashing!

210
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,785
I've said sorry, haven't I?

211
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:47,322
What else do you want me to do?

212
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:50,891
Close your eyes...

213
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,262
again you...

214
00:24:58,941 --> 00:24:59,839
Now open them.

215
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:03,310
How did you get it back?

216
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:05,878
Krrish, he's my friend.

217
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:07,214
Wouldn't he do this much for me?

218
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,215
Thank you, thank you

219
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:22,521
Take it

220
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,130
Won't you put it on my finger?

221

Move from there.

Priya, you're watching TV here and there boss has
ordered to vacate Krishna's apartment.

00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,284
Hello! Are you listening?

I am & am not.

278
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:27,651
What's this?

00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,792
Remember the explosion at the circus?

00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:34,361
I had passed out, but I think the
camera was still on.

00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:38,772
Now switch off the TV and think
about Krishna! Please!

282
00:31:44,113 --> 00:31:45,205
Oh my god!

283
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:48,046
What happened?

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,717
I'll rewind and show you.

Krishna is Krrish!

Why are you girls screaming?

288
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:20,806
Where are you both going?

289
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:21,778
Mom Office! I'll see you okay.

290
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:22,450
Office?

291
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:23,515

292
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:24,549
To get our jobs back!

293
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:25,583
Ok bye!

294
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,081
Priya, your mobile.

295
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:30,955
Hello Priya?

296
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,221
No, I'm Priya's mother

297
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,594
Mother... hello.

298
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,864
When did you return from Hong Kong?

299
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,128
Hong Kong? I didn't go anywhere...
I've been right here

300
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,137
And who are you?

301
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,844
It's me, Krishna.

302
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:51,472
Krishna, who?

303
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:56,712
Priya has told you everything about me,
hasn't she?

304
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,550
No, Priya has said nothing about you.

305
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:06,918
You are Priya's mother aren't you?

306
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:09,354
Yes... I'm Priya's mother.

307
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:12,365
Where's Priya?

308
00:33:12,568 --> 00:33:14,297
Priya left for office just now.

309
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:17,902
Office...

310
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,074
Right... Thank you

311
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:30,514
Priya, do you realize? Once this
footage is telecast...

312
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,218
Our Krishna will become a
world famous celebrity!

313
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:39,250
There's something about our Krishna!

314
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,960
He fooled us so convincingly.

315
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:45,224
In India, as Kalicharan, and here, as Krrish!

316
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:48,528
Didn't I tell you Honey, the truth
always comes out?

317
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:54,604
Look Priya, the truth about Krishna
the world is about to discover...

318
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,970
...is because you lied!

319
00:33:56,178 --> 00:34:00,444
The lie that you love him brought him
here all the way from India.

320
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:04,278
And imagine! Now we're going to
create a big sensation!

321
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,653
You're right. A lie sometimes leads
to very big gains.

322
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,645
You didn't even tell me!

323
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:35,242
What could I say?

324
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:41,513
When his honesty turned my feigned
love into a genuine one...

325
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,092
I didn't even realize

326
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,125
I'm in love with Krishna, Honey

327
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,000
Krishna, Krishna

328
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:06,173
The culprit has been caught at last!

329
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:10,776
He did his best to hide his identity, you know

330
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,812
But I finally discovered who the real Krrish is!

331
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:17,523
Why did you lie to me?

332
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,354
Why did you keep me in the dark?

333
00:35:21,864 --> 00:35:24,731
Where was the need to hide behind
a mask, even with me?

334
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,733
You're asking this Priya?

335
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:34,772
Someone who has never been honest with me

336
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:39,375
Someone who kept me in the dark till today

337
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,179
I have been unmasked Priya.

338
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:51,292
What about you?

339
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:54,786
What do you mean?

340
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,796
Why did you lie to me that you loved me?

341
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:03,362
I took your lies for the truth and came here.

342
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:06,134
to ask your mother for your hand in marriage

343
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:11,743
But you lied about her too!

344
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:14,511
yes, Priya

345
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,315
I've spoken to your mother

346
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:24,086
Krishna...

347
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:27,093
I'm sorry

348
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,995
I admit, I lied to you in the beginning

349
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:33,630
But now...

350
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:38,602
I really love you Krishna

351
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:41,571
Stop it, Priya! Stop it!

352
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,072
you may have more lies to tell me

353
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,414
But I don't have the strength to take
them for the truth anymore!

354
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:53,384
Listen to me, Krishna! I've done
all this only for you

355
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,750
I wanted to see you become
a very big man

356
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,789
and that's about to happen in
just a few hours

357
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:00,257
the whole world will get to know about
your extraordinary powers and talent

358
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:01,827
that's exactly what I didn't want

359
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:05,458
Why do you think I wore the mask?

360
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:10,534
because I had promised grandma that
I'd keep my identity hidden

361
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:13,806
that I would not let anyone know
about my powers

362
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,009
and you

363
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,748
grandma was right

364
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:28,152
people in the world only use each other
for their own selfish reasons

365
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,091
She tried to stop me, but I...

366
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,626
But why does your grandmother
want to stop you?

367
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,831
Why does she always want you
in front of her eyes?

368
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:43,403
Why doesn't she want the whole
world to know of your talent?

369
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:45,168
Is she not being selfish?

370
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:46,068
Priya!

371
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:51,671
You really want to know?

372
00:37:53,382 --> 00:37:54,349
Then listen!

373
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:17,695
having lost her son, grandma
did not want to lose me

374
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:19,339
because I posses the same powers

375
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:28,610
but she still let me come here

376
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:31,817
for you

377
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:35,919
for my feelings, she gave in

378
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:42,226
But what do I tell her now?

379
00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:50,935
Krishna, listen to me... Krishna!

380
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,207
Krishna...

381
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,879
Hello Honey

382
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,782
We've got to stop the telecast
of Krishna's tape

383
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:07,580
Why?

384
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:11,249
don't ask questions now, just
stop the telecast

385
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:13,652
but the tape is with boss

386
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:17,388
My god, where's boss?

387
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:37,245
I wish to thank all my investors
in Singapore

388
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:40,716
they are the ones who really
deserve this applause

389
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,516
for having had faith in my
various projects

390
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:49,291
I'm delighted to announce that
our company, Technotronics...

391
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:53,558
has made a profit of 400 million
dollars this year

392
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,361
I therefore announce 100% dividend

393
00:39:57,572 --> 00:39:59,563
to all our shareholders

394
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:03,736
Any questions?

395
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:07,042
Yes?

396
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:13,313
Dr. Arya, congratulations on the phenomenal
success of your company

397
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:14,915
my question is

398
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:18,793
20 years ago, you tried to make a computer

399
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:20,723
that could see the future

400
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:25,163
What happened to that dream of yours?

401
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,235
20 years ago, you must have had
a lot of dreams too...

402
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,441
Did they all come true?

403
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:35,934
Pardon me?

404
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:40,014
some questions hurt

405
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,251
the media ought to understand

406
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,153
that dream died with the death of my
genius friend, Rohit Mehra

407
00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:56,963
But from what I've read and
heard of you, Dr. Arya...

408
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:59,230
you don't ever accept defeat

409
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,502
I'd have tried to win...

410
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:07,136
had my genius friend been alive

411
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,938
Any further questions?

412
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:13,546
excuse me

413
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,046
sir, I need to speak to that lady
for just one minute

414
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:20,883
Please!

415
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,858
Krishna

416
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:39,103
Anything left to say?

417
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,242
Yes... This gentleman has
something to say

418
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:53,182
Who are you?

419
00:41:54,422 --> 00:41:55,753
My name is Vikram Sinha

420
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:58,423
What do you want?

421
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:04,422
Don't go back the way you came.

422
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,196
What does that mean?

423
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,995
I mean, you came alone

424
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:10,964
don't go back alone.

425
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:20,006
Krishna, your father, Rohit Mehra,
is still alive.

426
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:31,823
What did you say?

427
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:43,862
This picture was taken when
your father worked for Dr. Arya

428
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,404
And I was the Senior Security
Officer at Technotronics.

429
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:50,204
He was younger to me in age,

430
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:52,643
and I was a junior in status.

431
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,176
And yet, we were very close friends.

432
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,252
not only because we were Indians

433
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,889
it was because of the sincerity in his smile

434
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,217
and the honesty in his eyes.

435
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:08,762
He was always smiling...

436
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:15,894
but someone cast an evil eye on him.

437
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:18,936
It's been so many years,

438
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:21,735
but that time...

439
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:24,939
seems to have frozen.

440
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,347
That day, he was working till morning...

441
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:31,875
because he had to complete his
project and go back to India.

442
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,478
Good morning, chief

443
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,181
Mr. Vikram? Welcome!

444
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,459
How are you this morning?

445
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,025
I'm doing fine, chief

446
00:43:40,562 --> 00:43:45,693
but if you keep working round the clock like this,
you're going to get insomnia

447
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:49,399
I won't have to do it after today.

448
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:52,372
Once the computer is inaugurated today...

449
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,304
I'll hand it over to Dr. Arya and return
to my family in India.

450
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,538
Don't mind, chief...

451
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:04,146
but I still can't believe that we
can see the future.

452
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:06,920
Not believing does not change
the truth, Mr. Vikram.

453
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:09,982
You will believe it, when you see it?

454
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,625
What? You mean you're going to...

455
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:13,816
Of course!

456
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,622
Come see tomorrow, today

457
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,126
and tell me how it feels to see the future.

458
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:23,368
Please hold this.

459
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,451
Retina scan, an identification of my eyes

460
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,725
These 2 identifications of mine are
the password for this computer.

461
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,699
Without which, it won't start up.

462
00:45:30,438 --> 00:45:34,966
But when you're not around, when
you've gone back to India?

463
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:37,644
I'll change the password before I leave

464
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:40,974
After that, only Dr. Arya will be able
to start the computer.

465
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:44,881
Tell me...

466
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:47,586
What would you like to see?

467
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,550
I... I don't want to see anything, chief!

468
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:52,759
But you said your wife is pregnant

469
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:58,122
Let's see whether I'm going to be an
uncle to a nephew or a niece?

470
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:03,432
Ok then... let's find out.

471
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:32,156
Nisha!

472
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:36,896
Nisha!

473
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,235
My darling baby...

474
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:46,142
Look, Nisha, your son looks just like Rohit.

475
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:53,185
Now go to your Mom. My son's
coming back to me.

476
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:59,425
Congratulations, chief! Your wife's
going to deliver a baby boy tomorrow!

477
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:02,525
But I'm going to distribute sweets
today! In fact, right now?

478
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,628
What did you say?

479
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:05,729
What happened to my Rohit?

480
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:07,168
What happened, Mom?

481
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:10,500
No! That's impossible!

482
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:12,897
My Rohit can't be dead!

483
00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:15,504
My Rohit is alive!

484
00:47:15,777 --> 00:47:16,334
No!

485
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:17,803
No!

486
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:19,777
Which means, I...

487
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:24,742
Chief, the computer's malfunctioning!
Something's wrong with it!

488
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:53,903
Dr. Arya!

489
00:47:55,416 --> 00:48:00,376
It's 6:40 there, it's 6:30 now!
This means, in just 10 minutes!

490
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:01,555
in this very room!

491
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:08,592
Look! Dr. Arya!

492
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,556
Have you heard of Shahjahan, Doctor Mathur?

493
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,632
Of course! He built the Taj Mahal.

494
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:16,530
Incomplete knowledge is always dangerous.

495
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:19,635
Shahjahan had the hands of workers
who built the Taj Mahal, chopped off!

496
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:22,139
so that there would never be another Taj Mahal.

497
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,046
Rohit Mehra is a worker for me
and I'm his Shahjehan.

498
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:29,575
You mean, you're also going to
cut off Rohit's hands?

499
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:32,685
No... his brain!

500
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:39,185
because Rohit's brain will create problems,
for himself as well as for me.

501
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:43,595
Actually, I'm going to feel very sorry about
it because Rohit is a very good boy.

502
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:47,495
Sincere, honest, intelligent...

503
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,966
They're coming here, chief. Please leave!

504
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:52,696
No, no! I'm won't let this computer
go into the wrong hands.

505
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:54,135
I'll destroy everything!

506
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:55,032
All right!

507
00:48:55,243 --> 00:48:57,143
I'll try and stop them!

508
00:49:01,816 --> 00:49:02,441
Hello!

509
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,275
Mom?

510
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,452
Rohit? I've brought Nisha to the hospital.

511
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:09,680
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

512
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,688
Come home soon, son

513
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:14,020
I'm coming, Mom! I'm coming!

514
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:19,461
Rohit... What's the matter? You sound tense?

515
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:24,065
I've been exploited, the world is very selfish!

516
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:27,867
Don't worry, I'll be back, I'll be back soon.

517
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:32,766
Rohit!

518
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,937
What have you done?

519
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:44,040
I've destroyed your dream...
I've destroyed everything!

520
00:50:46,354 --> 00:50:48,447
because I've got to know of your intentions

521
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:55,525
But those who know me also
know that I never accept defeat.

522
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,132
I'll rebuild this computer

523
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,638
using your research.

524
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:08,742
But I don't need you anymore.

525
00:51:11,779 --> 00:51:14,543
Thank you so much for everything, Rohit

526
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:15,646
Good bye

527
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:17,816
Hold it, sir!

528
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:24,253
Don't kill him, sir

529
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:33,631
If you kill Rohit... then even if you
build the computer again

530
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:36,561
you'll never be able to start it

531
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,638
You need a password to start the computer

532
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,735
and the password is Rohit himself.

533
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:45,872
What?

534
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,209
Yes, sir

535
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:49,640
I've seen it with my own eyes.

536
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:56,023
Until scans of his retina and heartbeat
are fed into the computer...

537
00:51:56,924 --> 00:51:58,653
the computer will not start.

538
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:08,901
This means, I'll have to keep you alive

539
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,331
till I don't build a new computer.

540
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:20,172
But die, you will.

541
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:22,676
For the world.

542
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:28,753
Breaking news.

543
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:30,885
Tragedy strikes!

544
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:34,318
Following a fire that broke out in
the lab of Technotronics...

545
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:39,262
The famous Indian genius Rohit Mehra
has met with a tragic death.

546
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:46,040
Let's observe a 2-minute silence,
so that Rohit Mehra's soul rests in peace.

547
00:52:57,451 --> 00:53:01,751
Ever since, I had no choice but
to work for Dr. Arya.

548
00:53:03,457 --> 00:53:05,357
I couldn't even go to the police...

549
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:13,062
because if Dr. Arya doubted me,
he would've killed me.

550
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,299
And I was the only man who could
get in touch with your family.

551
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:22,865
That's exactly why I've been looking for your
grandma and you for so many years.

552
00:53:24,312 --> 00:53:27,008
And finally, I met you today, through Priya.

553
00:54:02,483 --> 00:54:03,643
Dr. Arya

554
00:54:08,522 --> 00:54:09,648
20 years...

555
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:15,318
for 20 years, he's kept a
mother away from her son

556
00:54:16,664 --> 00:54:18,859
and a son away from his father

557
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:24,002
It's because of his lies that I lost my mother.

558
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,573
Where is my father?

559
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:36,280
Here in Singapore.

560
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:41,010
For 20 years Dr. Arya has used
machines to keep him in a state

561
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:44,747
that only his brain is alive,
his body almost dead.

562
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:52,326
Good evening, my friend Rohit Mehra

563
00:54:58,072 --> 00:55:00,040
How are you feeling today?

564
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:05,976
Are these machines taking good care of you?

565
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:07,545
Yes?

566
00:55:10,251 --> 00:55:11,183
Good!

567
00:55:12,353 --> 00:55:15,880
Tomorrow's the glorious and historic day

568
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:24,555
when my, sorry, our computer
will be inaugurated.

569
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:32,169
Yes! Ours, because nothing
was possible without you

570
00:55:32,373 --> 00:55:37,242
For so many years, you have
shown such patience and understanding

571
00:55:37,478 --> 00:55:39,639
and cooperated with me.

572
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:44,977
When the computer starts tomorrow

573
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:54,026
your utility will come to an end,
and so will your pain.

574
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,567
See you tomorrow

575
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:11,673
Breaking news!

576
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:16,183
Dr. Arya has suddenly been
reminded of the poet Kabir.

577
00:56:16,517 --> 00:56:18,041
Do today, what you must do tomorrow...

578
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:20,015
and do right now, what you must do today.

579
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:26,319
That's why, Dr. Arya has decided
to start the computer today itself.

580
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:30,426
and also end Rohit's life.

581
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:34,567
Is this where my father is kept?

582
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:41,240
Yes! But it's almost impossible
for a stranger to get there...

583
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:45,643
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island

584
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,416
So that now no one comes between
him and the computer

585
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,949
Krishna, if Dr. Arya starts the computer

586
00:56:53,587 --> 00:57:04,987
how much havoc he can wreak and
the destruction he can cause, is unimaginable

587
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:15,437
mine... yours... ours, the worlds
destiny will come in his clutches.

588
00:57:16,677 --> 00:57:19,475
That's why, Dr. Arya has to be
stopped at any cost.

589
00:57:20,614 --> 00:57:25,677
Now you have to save not only your father
but the whole mankind, Krishna.

590
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:32,617
Hello.

591
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:33,891
Krishna?

592
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:36,293
Grandma!

593
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:39,889
Krishna, are you okay?

594
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:43,193
Yes, Grandma

595
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:47,897
I don't know why I'm feeling worried.

596
00:57:48,576 --> 00:57:50,100
When are you coming back?

597
00:57:50,744 --> 00:57:52,006
Come back soon

598
00:57:53,581 --> 00:58:00,350
Your father's death anniversary is nearing,
you need to be here and fulfill the duties of a son.

599
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:06,519
I remember, Grandma. don't worry...

600
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:10,954
I'll fulfill all the duties of a son.

601
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:43,789
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE

602
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:47,729
Congratulations Sir!

603
00:58:52,406 --> 00:58:56,502
See, Rohit I've won!

604
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:04,179
Now if you want you can end your life.

605
00:59:08,055 --> 00:59:10,546
Or do you want me to help?

606
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:25,903
But what's the hurry? At least see how your
invention is going to make me God!

607
01:00:18,826 --> 01:00:28,292
Rohit, we built this computer
so that we can see our future

608
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:29,992
and change it!

609
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:38,705
I will also change my future and show you
Today itself!

610
01:00:47,621 --> 01:00:49,589
Dr. Arya's gone to look for the masked man

611
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:52,422
Masked man?

612
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:15,344
Kristian!

613
01:01:21,855 --> 01:01:22,617
Krishna

614
01:01:24,658 --> 01:01:25,989
Look Dr. Arya!

615
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:28,157
Come on, let's go!

616
01:01:43,744 --> 01:01:47,009
What had Kristian done? Why kill him?

617
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:53,079
Dr. Arya has probably started the
computer and, he must've seen...

618
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:54,413
His future!

619
01:01:56,056 --> 01:02:01,653
It will be just as Dr. Arya has seen.

620
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,805
I've changed my future!
I've changed my tomorrow!

621
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,944
There is no mask any longer...

622
01:08:26,146 --> 01:08:32,381
Henceforth the new face of God is...
Dr. Siddhant Arya!

623
01:08:46,867 --> 01:08:49,131
How is this possible?

624
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:55,739
I've killed him with my own hands.
Then... who's this?

625
01:08:57,043 --> 01:09:01,742
Its 9:15 there and it's 9 here.

626
01:09:02,949 --> 01:09:05,417
This means, he'll be here in
the next 15 minutes.

627
01:09:06,019 --> 01:09:08,988
that means he is already on the island!

628
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:26,531
Stop!

629
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:37,181
To capture him we need
planning not power.

630
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:34,430
Dr. Arya has kept very tight security
everywhere on the island.

631
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:09,308
You're good! Very good.
But I'm better

632
01:11:16,816 --> 01:11:19,876
Yes, I am better

633
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:24,390
Because I have seen the future.

634
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:35,592
But due to lack of time what I
couldn't see is what I want to know...

635
01:11:37,704 --> 01:11:39,535
Why do you want to kill me?

636
01:11:41,908 --> 01:11:45,400
And why do you want to rescue Rohit Mehra?

637
01:11:51,518 --> 01:11:52,746
Who are you?

638
01:11:54,187 --> 01:11:58,317
Come to me and give me the answer.

639
01:11:59,192 --> 01:11:59,954
come!

640
01:12:12,472 --> 01:12:15,703
I've told you, I have seen the future

641
01:12:16,242 --> 01:12:20,576
And I know who is with me...

642
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:22,445
Hello!

643
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:25,117
and who is against me

644
01:12:26,386 --> 01:12:28,650
So... please cooperate

645
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:32,411
Who are you?

646
01:13:35,255 --> 01:13:37,086
We'll get to know right now.

647
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:45,313
Who... are you?

648
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:09,969
Your son... Krishna!

649
01:17:19,245 --> 01:17:19,973
Mom.

650
01:18:57,009 --> 01:18:58,237
Thank you, Jadoo.

651
01:19:00,346 --> 01:19:01,335
Thank you
