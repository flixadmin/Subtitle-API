[yells] Help!

11
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:32,993
Freddy Meyers, you stand convicted
of seven counts of murder,

12
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:36,205
all occurring on June 2nd, 1989.

13
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:39,082
You have been sentenced to death
by a jury of your peers.

14
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,710
The State will now proceed
with your sentence.

15
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:44,313
Do you have anything to say
before your sentence is carried out?

16
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:47,048
Only...

17
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:52,721
that I love my mother.

I'm leaving before you
and your band of botherers

41
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,191
can suck me into another
world-saving sing-along.

42
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,778
Actually, I was just gonna say
we're still waiting for you to move out.

43
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,821
There's a box in the library
labeled "arcana"

44
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,257
that's been sitting there for months.

00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,033
I'd avoid touching that, if I was you.

46
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,510
Yeah. Behrad already tried to move it,

47
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,815
and now he thinks he's being haunted
by a forlorn mariner.

48
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,931
And he's right, but I can't stick around
to help the bloke,

49
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,707
I'm off to research
a more lasting solution

50
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,667
to your Encore problem.

51
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,045
[in sing-song voice]
Did someone say "Encore"?

52
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:34,508
I also said no musical numbers,
so please, don't start.

53
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,444
Listen, I might have a solution
to your problem.

54
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:38,637
I can't take you with me
on this one, squire.

55
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,723
Where I'm going, I need to walk alone.

56
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,558
With Gary.

57
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:46,770
Okay. But, look, we're on a Timeship,
and let's be honest,

58
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:50,023
we're a little past the whole, "Should
we change history?" debate, right?

59
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,485
So, what if we go back
to when the Encores were kids

60
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,488
and reform them before they break bad?

61
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,699
Ray, we're dealing with the villains
of history fresh out of hell.

62
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:02,869
- They can't just be reformed like your...
- [Nora] Ray, where are you?

63
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,414
Like your Fairy God-girlfriend.

64
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:09,251
Speaking of which, I think that
your services are required, squire.

65
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,797
Well, look who's finally off the clock.

66
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,298
Oh, no. Not again.

67
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:18,468
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
It's the same thing every time.

68
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,553
Kid gets a Fairy Godmother,
what do they wish for?

Everyone gets a damn pony."

71
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:29,521
Well, maybe next time
you should say "nay."

72
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,731
[blowing raspberry]

73
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,279
Well, right now,
it's all about what you want.

74
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:41,116
[groans] Oh, what I want is to be done
with this gig.

00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,617
[sighs]

76
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,704
I know.
But, look, at least with this job,

77
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,206
you have the opportunity
to make people's lives better.

78
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,958
How am I supposed to help kids in need

79
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,294
when these kids don't even know
what they need?

80
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:56,256
Because, trust me, no one has ever
become a better person with a pony.

81
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,217
Probably true, but, look,
I'm setting the mood.

82
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,512
Gideon, dim the lights,

83
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:07,309
and play "You're the Inspiration"
by Chicago.

84
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:11,229
And now, it's whatever you wish, Nora.

85

[snoring]

86
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:17,235
Gideon, don't play Chicago.

87
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,196
[Gideon] I wasn't going to, Dr. Palmer.

88

- [snorts]
- Oh.

89
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:28,663
You sure being here
doesn't bring back some fond memories?

90
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,334
If I had fond memories of this place,
I'd book a lobotomy.

91
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,129
Okay. Whatever you people do here,
just show me the exit.

92
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,672
I'm due for a content drop.

93
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:40,884
Oh, and also to tell Mâmân and Bâbâ
you're not really in business school.

94
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,678
But before you do that,
let's make sure you can't do that.

95
00:05:43,762 --> 00:05:45,555
- Look over here.
- Is that a camera?

96
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,890
- Wait!
- [device whirs]

97
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,683
Ugh. I don't want my picture with him.

98
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,269
[whispers] You can't wipe her memory.

99
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,688
All right? There's a timeline
where she was here.

100
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,972
Okay, so maybe her being here,

101
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,234
she'll remember what we did
and who she was.

102
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:58,818
[whispers] Look, I know Zari,

103
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:01,947
and there's no way she was
ever anyone but her.

104
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,698
Hey, what's with the Wi-Fi?

105
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,784
I need to clap back
at Blue Ivy on Cat-Chat.

106
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,744
[cat meowing on Zari's phone]

107
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,931
Cat-Chat's the chat app
that lets you clap back...

108
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,122
I didn't say tell me.

109
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,584
[Gideon] Mr. Tarazi and Mr. Heywood,
you're needed on the bridge.

110
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,045
Look, no one wants you out of here
more than I do,

111
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,172
but I need you to stay put
until we finish this job.

112
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,423
[door opens]

113
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,554
Wait. Wait... Are you keep...

114
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:26,888
Are you taking me prisoner?

115
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:30,100
- [door locks]
- [inaudible]

116
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:32,310
I have a sneaker drop,

117
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:35,122
and I'm supposed to be releasing
a new fragrance for Dragonesque today.

118
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,107
We've been working on this launch
for months.

119
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,692
This is high stakes!

120
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,905
[Gideon] A serial killer has been freed
from hell and is on the loose in 2004.

121
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,324
And somehow the scariest thing
about this mission

122
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:48,702
is going back to the early 2000s.

123
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:51,180
[Gideon] A coroner was found dead
while transporting the body

124
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,247
of a famed serial killer.

125
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:55,542
[gasps] Oh, my God, it's Freddy Meyers,
the Prom Night Slasher.

126
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,005
Come on, guys. I ranked him number five
killer of all time on <i>StabCast.</i>

127
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,758
- My podcast about serial killers. Babe?
- Oh.

128
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,302
[Gideon] As I was going to say,

129
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,862
Freddy killed seven
of his peers before...

130
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,513
At his high school prom in 1989,

131
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,141
he used a kitchen knife,
and he wore a creepy mask.

132
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,561
I actually did a whole series on it,
so none of you open my e-mails, clearly.

133
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:15,663
[Gideon] And following the murders...

134
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:19,065
He spent 15 years on death row
before he was executed in 2004.

135
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,192
[Gideon] Which is when
the timeline changed,

136
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:24,171
starting with the death of the coroner
and the disappearance of Freddy's body.

137
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,339
I don't even wanna think about

138
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,365
what a serial killer would do
with his second act.

139
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,450
Tiffany.

140
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,201
She was the final girl.

141
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:34,748
[both] The one target
that survived Freddy's attack!

142
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:38,752
It's informative and entertaining.
It's good.

143
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,211
See? Thank you.

144
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:43,381
Guys, check this out.
The Central City High class of '89

145
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:45,675
is planning to memorialize
their fallen peers

146
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,595
at their 15-year reunion
this Friday night.

147
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,265
We have to go. That's where
Freddy will be to finish the job.

148
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,727
Well then, babe,
grab your autograph book...

149
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,687
because we're gonna go catch
a serial killer.

150
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,856
Gideon, take us to 2004.

151
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:03,777
And order one of these mattresses
using promo code "laceration."

an eye out for a crazy masked killer.</i>

153
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,998
The only thing killing it out here
is my wardrobe.

154
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,168
Can't believe I'm here. Seriously.

155
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,003
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [gasps]

156
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,172
This is the lobby
where he stalked his victims.

157
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:29,386
You guys, he made his first kill
in this cafeteria. [gasps]

158
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,346
- Babe.
- What? What?

159
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:35,517
Babe, that's the trophy that Tiffany
fashioned into a makeshift weapon.

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,870
Why didn't you tell me we were
coming back to my old school?

161
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:40,146
- You went to school here?
- What?

162
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,691
Mick, this is why you need
to come to team meetings.

163
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:44,359
Do you remember anything about Freddy?

164
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,986
- Yeah. He was... He was a loser.
- Oh, come on.

165
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,613
Frigging Mick Rory!

166
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,032
Ali, remember?

167
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,118
Is that you, or...

168
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,327
No.

169
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:58,748
Are you sure? 'Cause you look, like,
exactly like Mick... Mick Rory.

170
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,459
No. My name is Dick.

171
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,630
I'm telling you, Dick,
team meetings work wonders.

172
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,006
It's her.

173
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:10,885
It's Tiffany.

174
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,141
Tiffany Harper. It's really you.

175
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,227
- Who are you?
- I'm, uh...

176
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,604
I'm Lisa, and this is Kelly,

177
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,815
and you wouldn't remember us
'cause we were losers.

178
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,859
Total zeroes.

179
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,068
I don't.

180
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,279
- Isn't time weird?
- So weird.

181
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,948
- Well, see you inside.
- Thank you.

182
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,325
And... Go, Cavaliers!

183
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,203
- Okay. Go. Keep going.
- Oh, my God!

184
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,705
- [rock music playing]
- Hey, hey!

185
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,349
Hope you're enjoying your reunion
out there.

186
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:43,168
Keep on dancing, class of '89.

187
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:45,587
[sighs] No sign of Freddy.

188
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,214
But I got eyes on crudités.

189
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,049
Ooh. Save me some raw broccoli.

190
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,676
[sighs]

191
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,934
[sighs]

192
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,078
I never thought I'd say this,

193
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,563
but I think I've lost
my appetite for broccoli.

194
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,232
[Nate] Guys, Freddy's on the scene.

195
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,318
And he's got his first victim.

196
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,821
- We're ready for him.
- [host] Uh, hello. Hello, everyone.

197
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,490
Welcome back.

198
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:16,951
It means so much
to see all of you here tonight.

199
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:21,331
And here to unveil our memorial
to our fallen peers

200
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:24,501
is our very own survivor,
Tiffany Harper.

201
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,544
[applause]

202
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,379
Uh...

203
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,424
Has anyone seen Tiffany?

204
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:32,967
Something's wrong.

205
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,513
[crowd gasps]

206
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:45,438
Of course she makes
a dramatic entrance. [chuckles]

207
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,900
We didn't cover this
in rehearsal, Tiffany.

208
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,321
All right, that's it.
I'm unveiling it myself.

209
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,825
[audience screaming]

210
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,538
All right, everybody. Just stay calm.

211
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,957
Look, he's here. We need backup.

212
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,707
That's him.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,396
Guys, watch out. You're stuck in
a school with the Prom Night Slasher.

214
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,623
[Gary] Master, I'm sorry I'm so late.

215
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:49,085
I tried a teleportation spell
to get here ASAP,

216
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,795
and now I'm stuck walking backwards.

217
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,255
[recites incantation]

218
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,926
Damn it, Gary. Pull yourself together,
will you? We've got work to do.

219
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:00,179
And the answers we need
lie behind this door.

220
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,347
What is this place?

221
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,516
Can't say I've ever had anything
as comfy as a home,

222
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,934
but I lived here once.

223
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,687
Not a soul has stepped foot inside
since I left.

224
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,029
What the bloody hell?

225
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,572
[snoring]

226
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:18,822
Oi!

227
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,491
What are you doing in my house?

228
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,453
- Hey, go on. Get off my stairs.
- [groans]

229
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,415
All right. Who's responsible for this?

230
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,918
And I thought I was the one
with the magic touch.

231
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,381
All right. Everybody out.

232
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,384
You wanna party,
you do it somewhere else, all right?

233
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,223
How did you even
find this place, Charlie?

234
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,187
You told me about it
when you were wasted once.

235
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,666
[Constantine] You found your way here.

236
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,983
You can find your way out.

237
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,737
What is with him, huh?

238
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,282
- What are you doing here?
- Do the Constantine trick again.

239
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,703
All right, everyone. Stay sharp.
The killer could be anywhere.

240
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,997
[sighs] We gotta get everyone
out of here.

241
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:10,792
[all scream]

242
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,043
Thanks for the heart attack!

243
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,587
Sorry. Swiss Army knife.
Usually solves a jam in a jiff,

244
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,464
but these doors
are telekinetically sealed.

245
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,465
No way in or out.

246
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,066
This place always smelled
like a prison.

247
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,135
Telekinesis. It makes perfect sense.

248
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,929
Killers often act
out of feeling powerless,

249
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:25,014
and now he has the ultimate power.

250
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:26,825
- I need to adjust my rankings.
- [Mick] Yeah.

251
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,435
And we need to save Ali.
I mean, the class of '89.

252
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,522
All right. Immortal killer.
How do we stop him?

253
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,400
We can't from in here,
but maybe you guys can.

254
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,986
Look, Ray, it's time to put
your crazy plan to the test.

255
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,821
You gotta go back and fix Freddy.

256
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,285
[school bell rings]

257
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,581
All right. Let's find our future Encore.

258
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,295
Freddy. Hey, Freddy!
Heard you couldn't find a prom date.

259
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,172
Guess your mom turned you down.

260
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,799
[bullies laugh]

261
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:00,882
Loser.

262
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,387
- Loser.
- Nice job, butterfingers.

263
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,847
Good one, Brad. Yeah.

264
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:08,015
Losers.

265
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,769
- Brad's such a jerk.
- Oh, it's okay. You don't have to...

266
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:13,080
It's all right. I got it. Thank you.

267
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,732
Actually, I wanted to ask you something.

268
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,650
Turns out I don't have a date
to prom tonight,

269
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,610
and I was thinking...

270
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:20,778
Would you go with me?

271
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,073
What? Me... Me, go with you to prom?

272
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:27,035
Exactly. Meet me in front of school
at 8:00. Don't be late.

273
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:30,871
[clears throat]

274
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,457
<i>Oy vey</i>. This is bad.

275
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,879
Why would the most popular girl need
a last-minute date, let alone ask him?

276
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,923
She's working with those bullies.
This could be what sets him off.

277
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,386
Okay. We gotta talk this kid
out of his dream date.

278
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,640
Let's rap, Freddy.

279
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:51,350
Who... who are you guys?

280
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,936
New teachers. Cool new teachers.

281
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,273
And judging by your test scores here,

282
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,609
maybe you should skip the prom
and hit the books.

283
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,611
Turn this A into an A-plus.

284
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,697
Or maybe go to the movies.
1989 is a great movie summer.

285
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,575
<i>- Last Crusade, Ghostbusters Il...</i>
- Yeah. I gotta go, so...

286
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,914
Hey, no running in the hallway.

287
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,374
We're not just your teachers,
we're your pals.

288
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,803
Picture a dark hallway.
Feels like the killer's there with you.

289
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,388
Shafts of moonlight claw at the floor.

Come out here, Freddy.
We know you're there.

294
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,524
Yeah. Come on out.

295
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,527
There are gaps in your psychological
profile that you need to answer for.

Babe.

297
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,489
- And we're gonna send you back to hell.
- Yeah!

298
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:53,746
Did you find a way out?

299
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:57,208
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
Get back in the gym.

Freddy ran off on us.

We need his address.

I can hear them.
Their... their voices.

314
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,339
Fairy Godmothers
have sort of a special radar

315
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:46,883
that tunes in to kids' wishes,

316
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:50,678
and prom night is
a minefield of teenage need,

317
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,723
so when it locks on
to the kid with the deepest need,

318
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,474
I just go straight to...

319
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:59,729
No, no, no, no, no. It's happening.

320
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,320
Where the hell did you come from, huh?

321
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:10,281
- Oh, Freddy, uh...
- Huh?

322
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,409
I am your Fairy Godmother.

323
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,244
So...

324
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,166
Please don't kill me?

325
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,216
You're a Fairy Godmother?

326
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,675
- My Fairy Godmother?
- Uh-huh.

327
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,759
Prove it.

328
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,083
You think I'd be wearing this
if I really had the choice?

329
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,099
- Huh?
- So, anything I ask for...

330
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:38,642
you have to do it.

331
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,062
So, you should really think
about what you want,

332
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,980
especially the consequences.

333
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,149
I already know what I want.

334
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,902
Prom's tonight, and...

335
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,737
- [knock at door]
- [Cathy] Freddy, honey.

336
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,238
- Hide.
- [exclaims]

337
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,205
Hey, Freddy.
You ready, Freddy, for movie night?

338
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,284
I got the Jiffy Pop going.

339
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:58,328
Actually, Mom...

340
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,556
[whispers] Ray, I'm with Freddy.

341
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,165
Nora. Good! That... That's great.

342
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:03,960
How is that great?
I'm a serial killer's Fairy Godmother.

343
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:06,712
This is perfect. Old Freddy didn't have
a Fairy Godmother.

344
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:10,508
So, if you give him the prom
every kid dreams of,

345
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,676
maybe he won't hurt anyone.

346
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,553
Except this kid's dream
is for everyone to be dead.

347
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:15,888
[Freddy]...gonna go to prom.

348
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,848
Hmm. Prom.

349
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,559
Wow, Freddy.

350
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:25,022
Uh, do you need a ride?
Or I could help you with your tie...

351
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,626
You know what, I got it, but...
Love you. Okay, I just gotta go.

352
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,608
Okay.

353
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,777
[door closes]

354
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:31,695
Now...

355
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,614
Back to my wish.

356
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,329
I'm gonna make it so those kids
never make fun of me again,

357
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,371
because I wish for...

358
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:42,415
Uh...

359
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:43,873
A suit.

360
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,750
A suit?

361
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,188
Yeah. If I'm gonna take Tiffany,
I gotta look good.

362
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,881
So, I want a cool suit. Can you do that?

363
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,134
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Okay.

364
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,217
- Ready?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,559
Check it out.

366
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,811
Okay.

367
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:05,896
Okay.

368
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,606
Now I gotta show up in style.

369
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,609
- I want a pony.
- Ugh. Seriously, kid?

370
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,335
[whooshing]

371
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Hey, Freddy.

372
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,175
- Hey, Tiffany.
- Wow. Cool suit.

373
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,469
Thanks. Here.

374
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,848
- Thank you.
- Should we, um...

375
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,391
- Yes.
- Okay.

376
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:49,440
Looks like your plan just might work.

377
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,567
Well, only thanks to you.

378
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,650
Hey, Palmer.

379
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,071
Will you go to prom with me?

380
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,405
Oh, shucks.

381
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:00,784
All right.

382
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,584
[grunts, gasps]

383
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,924
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Cool it.

384
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,177
- [device trills]
- Huh.

385
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,805
I knew it. You stole our family's totem.

386
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,098
It's not like that. I...

387
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:23,849
I needed to take it.

388
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,703
You could've just asked for it.
Mâmân and Bâbâ would've given it to you.

389
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,895
What's that supposed to mean?

390
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,438
Oh, you really don't know?

391
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,691
You're never around,
you don't do any work,

392
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:35,277
and they still treat you
like you're some kind of hero.

393
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,989
If you only knew what I've done,
what I've survived,

394
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,825
without getting any credit...

395
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,761
Not that you'd understand,
'cause you only care about yourself.

396
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:43,994
Whatever. Don't tell me.

397
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,681
But wait till they see you've turned it
into a stupid stoner bracelet.

398
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,958
- Hey!
- "What up, Z-listers?

399

Turns out even a sacred totem

00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,170
couldn't reverse
the sucking void that is my soul."

401
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:54,713
Hey, screw you.

402
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:55,965
I'm not a void.

403
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,508
I'm a business.

404
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,554
Not like it works here anyway.

405
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,610
[man] Everybody stay calm.
Once the power's back, we'll get help.

I'm freaked out.

Where do you think you're going?

408
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,293
I'm gonna find a way out of the school.

409
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:35,045
Look at them,
just waiting to be picked off.

410
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,815
Never fit in with them when I went here,

411
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,599
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna die with them.

412
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,468
I like the way you think.

413
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,120
There's an old vent in the wood shop
I used to sneak out of.

414
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,473
I knew it.

Come on.
Let's get the hell out of this school.

417
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,566
You have a husband? Boyfriend?

Girlfriend?

419
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,360
Nah.

420
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:59,724
No one's waiting at home for me.

421
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,448
Still haven't quite
gotten that together.

422
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:03,531
Hmm.

423
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,116
And you?

Uh, it's behind here.

Hey.

426
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,460
You ever wonder where we'd be if...

427
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,879
you know,
that prom had gone differently?

428
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:17,963

You'd better be fixing this in '89.

So, this is prom.

I know it's lame, but...

434
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:02,091
No, no, no. Actually, I think I kind of
get the whole nostalgia thing for once.

for the next one.

and get on the dance floor.

You know, you're a really good dancer.

Thanks. I...
I watch a lot of music videos.

442

Aw. They look so happy.

Yeah. But they don't.

So, that's the prank.

00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:40,981
She leads him to the center
of the dance floor,

446

don't know how that ended.

We got to keep him
from walking in the drop zone.

to get yourself killed?

He killed Ali. He's gonna pay.

She wasn't just some girl, was she?

wrote letters to one another.</i>

<i>I was gonna break out
and take her to the stupid dance...</i>

What? I was young, stupid.

484
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,374
Mick, look, I'm sorry, okay?
But if this plan works,

485
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,835
then Freddy never becomes an Encore.

486
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,170
Maybe everything that happened
can be undone.

- You don't wanna be alone right now.

How would you know that?
How would you know what I want?

I've spent years
wanting these kids to be my friend,

493
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,260
and I couldn't even make it happen
with a Fairy Godmother!

00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,778
I cannot wait to be done

get what they deserve.

- No, you don't!

Look, I get it.
I have given in to my demons,

that is a magic stronger than any wish.

Being truly okay with myself...

Let me do this, Freddy.

634
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:20,971
[Agent Sharpe] I can't move.

635
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,815
[both straining]

636
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,491
You don't need them, you need me.

637
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,952
We can get away with this together.

638
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,286
No! No.

639
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,707
I know who I am now,
and I'm not gonna lock myself away.

640
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,503
Then this is for your own good.

641
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,176
[groans]

642
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,851
- They did it.
- [gasps]

643
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,271
Behrad?

644
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,692
Sorry. You okay?

645
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,236
I totally get why you stole that.

646
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,195
Fair enough.

647
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,534
Wow, this was... a lot.

648
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,454
- [siren wails]
- [gasps]

649
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,338
Ma'am, you were in the limo,
is that right?

650
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:31,631
- Yes.
- Thanks.

651
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:32,882
I'll be back.

652
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,896
I know she needs help, but...

653
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:52,360
She was all I had,
and they took her away. [sniffs]

654
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,696
Mmm-hmm.

655
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:56,823
So, what do I do?

656
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,325
You survive.

657
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:03,621
Freddy, my upbringing
was only dysfunction.

658
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,709
But dysfunction doesn't get to choose
who you are.

659
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,128
You do.

660
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,716
- You hear me?
- Yeah. Okay.

661
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:19,095
We should head back
and check on the team,

662
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:20,722
make sure everything's back to normal.

663
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:27,145
I know... you're gonna be okay, kid.

664
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,747
Dr. Gideon treating you right?

665
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,708
Pretty cool, huh?

666
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,878
So, this is what you do,
travel around time

667
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,130
and save people using wind? That's...

668
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,176
Well, I wouldn't say "cool,"
exactly, but...

669
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,096
no wonder you're the favorite.

670
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:02,638
The favorite?

671
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,726
Mâmân and Bâbâ only treat me how they do
'cause they're worried about me.

672
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,105
I mean, I've been in business school
for five years.

673
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:12,899
You were a self-made millionaire
by the age of 19.

674
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:15,068
You're right, I am very impressive.

675
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,487
Like, how did you jailbreak
your way out of here anyway?

676
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:20,198
I was poking around
your weird little screens,

677
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,784
and suddenly
I knew how to hack my way out.

678
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:24,494
Right.

679
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,497
Yeah, time travel
always has these weird side effects.

680
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:29,833
Huh.

681
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,627
Well, hopefully it wears off

682
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,171
because I was thinking of
sticking around for a while.

683
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:36,255
Huh.

684
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,049
I weirdly wouldn't hate that.

685
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:41,469
[Sara] <i>Hey, guys, we're still in 2004.
Where the hell are you?</i>

686
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:42,553
You coming?

687
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:48,768
[upbeat dance music playing]

688
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,270
How about this for a reunion?

689
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:53,815
[all cheering]

690
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,987
And, uh, what's your sister doing here?

691
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,990
Probably Cat-Chatting. No judgment here.

692
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,283
- Yes.
- Wait.

693
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:05,117
Where's Mick?

694
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,000
Mick?

695
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,130
- [pop song playing]
- Mick Rory?

696
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:19,674
Ali.

697
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Hey, Freddy.

698
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,349
Hey, Tiffany. Congrats.

699
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,564
Nora, may I have this dance?

700
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,400
Ah, but of course.

701
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,658
I cannot believe I got to get
an exclusive scoop for <i>StabCast,</i>

702
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,202
and I got to be the final girl.

703
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:49,704
Well, technically, I never died, so...

704
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,873
Technically, you've died
more than three times,

705
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,708
so just give me this one, babe.

706
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,795
- You are my final girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

707
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:00,964
Hey, guys.

708
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:01,966
Photo booth.

709
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,885
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

710
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,220
[music continues]

711
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,606
- [record scratches, song stops]
- Wait. Where's Mick?

712
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,652
[song resumes]

713
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,738
[both moaning]

714
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:32,455
Wow, Mick.

715
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:35,624
That's my gun.

716
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:50,223
[sighs] I thought I told you
to piss off.

717
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,726
Garyjust filled me in
on that business with Astra.

718
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,813
So, why are you drowning your sorrows
instead of doing something about it?

719
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,856
What happened here, John?

720
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,698
Oh, I used to run with a bunch
back in the day.

721
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,325
Became known as "the Newcastle Crew,"

722
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,452
spent most of our misbegotten youth
in this place.

723
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,125
One of them was a powerful witch.

724
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,752
I'm back here to consult with her.

725
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,046
She's through there.

726
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,219
So, what are you waiting for?

727
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,530
Come on. Get off your arse
and go and do it.

728
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,394
Because it's not that easy,
all right, Charlie?

729
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:34,142
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

730
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:38,146
Her spirit is waiting
on the other side of that door, and...

731
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,231
none too happy with me.

732
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:44,611
There are things in my past
that I haven't told anyone.

733
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,531
So, I get the whole
wanting to do it on your own.

734
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:53,453
But if there was some door that I could
walk through to solve all my problems...

735
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,664
I sure as hell would take that chance.

736
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,302
I call upon Hecate,

737
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,555
lady of keys and guardian of crossroads.

738
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,478
Sever this seal.

739
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,485
By my blood, be open.

740
00:41:37,747 --> 00:41:38,998
Don't look back, John-o.

741
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,375
You got this.

742
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,877
Let's hope you're right, love.

743
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:54,472
[locks thudding]

744
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,352
[theme music playing]
