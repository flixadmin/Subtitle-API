- ( horse neighs )

00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,341
Man:
<i>GOTTA BE READY</i>
<i>BEFORE NIGHTFALL.</i>

7
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,845
Man £2:
OKAY, KEEP MOVING.

8
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,559
Man:
<i>PUT A WATCH</i>
<i>ON THE RIDGE</i>

9
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,978
<i>AND THE TREE LINES.</i>

10
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,523
Man £3:<i> BOY.</i>

11
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,067
LOVELY BOY.

12
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,777
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,404
A MAN HAS A THIRST.

14
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,699
A MAN DOES NOT DRINK
FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT.

15
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,784
A BOY COULD
MAKE A FRIEND.

16
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,078
- I HAVE FRIENDS.
- ( clangs )

17
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,789
GIVE US BEER
BEFORE I SKIN YOU.

18
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,875
A MAN DOES NOT CHOOSE
HIS COMPANIONS.

19
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,793
THESE TWO, THEY HAVE
NO COURTESY.

20
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,212
A MAN MUST ASK
FORGIVENESS.

21
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,426
YOU'RE CALLED ARRY?

22
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,890
THIS MAN HAS THE HONOR
TO BE JAQEN H'GHAR,

23
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,600
ONCE OF THE FREE CITY OF--

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,184
BEER, YOU LITTLE SHIT.

25
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,770
GET US BEER!

26
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,480
YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED NICELY.

27
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,732
AAH!

28
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,363
COME CLOSER
AND I'LL SHOVE
THAT STICK

29
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,199
UP YOUR BUNGHOLE
AND FUCK YOU BLOODY.

30
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,785
A BOY HAS MORE COURAGE
THAN SENSE.

31
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,370
COME HERE!

32
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,080
YOREN SAID NONE OF US
WERE TO GO NEAR THOSE THREE.

33
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,041
- COME HERE!
- THEY DON'T SCARE ME.

34
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,209
HMM?
THEN YOU'RE STUPID.

35
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,086
THEY SCARE ME.

36
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,088
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,636
WHAT ARE GOLD CLOAKS
DOING SO FAR FROM
KING'S LANDING?

38
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,310
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ME.

39
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,146
YOU IN COMMAND HERE?

40
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,191
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM HOME.

41
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,151
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

42
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,028
AYE, YOU DID.

43
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,239
YOU ASKED
WITHOUT MANNERS

44
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,825
AND I CHOSE NOT TO ANSWER.

45
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,828
I HAVE A ROYAL WARRANT

46
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,666
FOR ONE OF THESE GUTTER RATS
YOU'RE TRANSPORTING.

47
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,004
WELL, THE THING IS...

48
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,257
THESE GUTTER RATS BELONG
TO THE NIGHT'S WATCH.

49
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,094
<i>NOW, THAT PUTS THEM</i>
<i>BEYOND THE REACH OF</i>
<i>KINGS AND QUEENS.</i>

50
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,012
DOES IT?

51
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>IT'S A FUNNY THING--</i>

52
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,684
PEOPLE WORRY SO MUCH
ABOUT THEIR THROATS

53
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,937
THAT THEY FORGET
ABOUT WHAT'S DOWN LOW.

54
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,233
NOW I SHARPENED THIS BLADE
BEFORE BREAKFAST.

55
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,737
I COULD SHAVE
A SPIDER'S ARSE
IF I WANTED TO

56
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,700
OR I COULD NICK
THIS ARTERY IN YOUR LEG.

57
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,369
AND ONCE IT'S NICKED,
THERE'S NO ONE AROUND HERE

58
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,539
WHO KNOWS
HOW TO UNNICK IT.

59
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,208
WE'LL JUST KEEP THAT.

60
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,338
GOOD STEEL IS ALWAYS
NEEDED ON THE WALL.

61
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,132
SEEMS YOU HAVE
A CHOICE--

62
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,219
YOU CAN DIE HERE
AT THIS CROSSROADS
A LONG WAY FROM HOME,

63
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,097
OR YOU CAN GO
BACK TO YOUR CITY
AND TELL YOUR MASTERS

64
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,183
YOU DIDN'T FIND
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,941
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A BOY NAMED GENDRY.

66
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>HE CARRIES</i>
<i>A BULL'S HEAD HELMET.</i>

67
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,574
<i>ANYONE TURNING HIM OVER</i>
<i>WILL EARN THE KING'S REWARD.</i>

68
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,702
WE'LL BE BACK
WITH MORE MEN

69
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,496
AND I'LL BE TAKING
YOUR HEAD HOME ALONG
WITH THAT BASTARD BOY.

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,248
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

71
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,047
( men murmuring )

72
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,766
- ( whistling )
-<i> ( distant seagulls</i>
<i>screeching )</i>

73
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>( bells pealing )</i>

74
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,236
<i>( Shae laughing )</i>

75
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,117
MY LORD.

76
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,328
YOU MAKE ME WAIT
A LONG TIME,

77
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,455
BUT YOUR FRIEND
KEEPS ME COMPANY.

78
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,458
WE WERE JUST SPEAKING
OF YOUR BRAVERY

79
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,961
IN THE VICTORY AGAINST
THE STARK AUXILIARY FORCES.

80
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,340
IT WAS QUITE A BATTLE.

81
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,968
I HEARD YOU SUFFERED
A TERRIBLE HEAD WOUND.

82
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,971
THE NORTHERNERS
ARE SUCH FEARSOME WARRIORS.

83
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,557
AND I TELL HIM
THE STORY OF HOW WE MEET.

84
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,643
TO FIND SO LOVELY
A CREATURE

85
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,520
WORKING IN YOUR
FATHER'S KITCHENS--

86
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,772
IT ALMOST BEGGARS BELIEF.

87
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,900
STRANGE THINGS DO HAPPEN.

88
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,653
YOU SHOULD TASTE
HER FISH PIE.

89
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,030
I DON'T THINK LORD VARYS
LIKES FISH PIE.

90
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,033
- HOW CAN YOU TELL?
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL.

91
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,327
Tyrion:
<i>MEN LIKE LORD VARYS</i>
<i>AND I CAN'T LET</i>

92
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,371
OUR DISADVANTAGES
GET THE BEST OF US.

93
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,290
WE'LL MAKE A FISHERMAN
OF HIM YET.

94
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,376
I AM GLAD
YOUR NEW FRIEND

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,504
WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPANY YOU
TO THE CAPITAL.

96
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,716
FRIENDS ARE SUCH
AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE.

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,177
UNFORTUNATE THAT YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T WANT HER TO COME.

98
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,596
<i>BUT REST EASY, MY LORD.</i>

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,683
I AM VERY GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS

100
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,935
FOR MY GOOD FRIENDS.

101
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,312
YOUR DISCRETION
IS LEGENDARY...

102
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,814
WHERE YOUR FRIENDS
ARE CONCERNED.

103
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,233
HOW UNSPEAKABLE OF ME
TO GO ON AND ON

104
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,652
WHEN ALL YOU WANT
TO DO IS REST.

105
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,737
I WILL LEAVE YOU.

106
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,866
WELCOME TO
KING'S LANDING,
MY DEAR.

107
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,327
THIS CITY
IS MADE BRIGHTER
BY YOUR PRESENCE.

108
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,746
WE HAVE A COUNCIL MEETING,
MY LORD.

109
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,711
I DON'T LIKE THREATS.

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,130
- WHO THREATENED YOU?
- I'M NOT NED STARK.

111
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,382
I UNDERSTAND THE WAY
THIS GAME IS PLAYED.

112
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,009
NED STARK
WAS A MAN OF HONOR.

113
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,760
AND I AM NOT.

114
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,889
THREATEN ME AGAIN
AND I'LL HAVE YOU
THROWN INTO THE SEA.

115
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,311
YOU MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED
IN THE RESULTS.

116
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,439
STORMS COME AND GO,

117
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,608
THE BIG FISH EAT
THE LITTLE FISH,

118
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,861
AND I KEEP ON PADDLING.

119
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,405
COME, MY LORD.

120
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,908
WE SHOULDN'T KEEP
THE QUEEN WAITING.

121
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,207
Cersei:
<i>"FROM THIS TIME</i>
<i>UNTIL THE END OF TIME,</i>

122
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,042
<i>WE ARE NOT PART</i>
<i>OF YOUR REALM,</i>

123
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,921
BUT A FREE AND INDEPENDENT
KINGDOM OF THE NORTH."

124
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,552
HE HAS MORE SPIRIT
THAN HIS FATHER,
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

125
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,680
YOU'VE PERFECTED THE ART
OF TEARING UP PAPERS.

126
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,433
WE CAN GIVE HIM
HIS FATHER'S BONES
BACK AT LEAST

127
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:39,060
AS A GESTURE
OF GOOD FAITH.

128
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,145
YOU'LL GIVE THE STARKS
OUR REPLY, COUSIN?

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,357
I WILL, YOUR GRACE.

130
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,858
DID YOU SEE MY BROTHER

131
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,235
WHEN YOU WERE
THE STARKS' GUEST?

132
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,278
Alton:
<i>I DID.</i>

133
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,573
<i>THEY HAVE NOT BROKEN</i>
<i>HIS SPIRIT, YOUR GRACE.</i>

134
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,368
IF YOU SPEAK WITH HIM,

135
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,454
TELL HIM HE'S NOT
BEEN FORGOTTEN.

136
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,831
- Alton: I WILL, YOUR GRACE.
- SAFE TRAVELS, COUSIN.

137
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,755
YOU HAVE A DEFT HAND
WITH DIPLOMACY.

138
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,051
- IF THAT'S EVERYTHING...
- A-- A RAVEN FLEW IN
THIS MORNING

139
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,845
FROM CASTLE BLACK.

140
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,639
TROUBLE WITH
THE WILDLINGS.

141
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,016
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
CALLED "WILDLINGS."

142
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,560
SOMEWHAT LESS WILD
THESE DAYS.

143
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
SEEMS THEY'VE STOPPED
KILLING EACH OTHER

144
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,774
AND STARTED FOLLOWING
THIS KING-BEYOND-THE-WALL.

145
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,360
ANOTHER KING?
HOW MANY IS THAT NOW, FIVE?

146
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,237
( laughs )
I'VE LOST COUNT.

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,074
THE LORD COMMANDER ASKS
THAT WE SEND MORE MEN
TO MAN THE WALL.

148
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,826
PERHAPS HE'S FORGOTTEN
WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR.

149
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,786
WE HAVE NO MEN TO SPARE.

150
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,454
"THE COLD WINDS
ARE RISING

151
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,165
AND THE DEAD RISE
WITH THEM."

152
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,877
THE NORTHERNERS ARE
A SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE.

153
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,838
ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDER,
ONE OF THESE DEAD MEN

154
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,007
ATTACKED HIM
IN HIS CHAMBERS.

155
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,883
MORMONT DOESN'T LIE.

156
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,803
Varys:
<i>HOW DO YOU KILL</i>
<i>A DEAD MAN?</i>

157
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,765
APPARENTLY YOU BURN HIM.

158
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,475
ONE TRIP TO THE WALL
AND YOU COME BACK

159
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,937
BELIEVING IN GRUMPKINS
AND SNARKS.

160
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,482
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I BELIEVE,

161
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,526
BUT HERE'S
A FACT FOR YOU--

162
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>THE NIGHT'S WATCH</i>
<i>IS THE ONLY THING</i>

163
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,905
THAT SEPARATES US FROM
WHAT LIES BEYOND THE WALL.

164
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,491
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
THAT THE BRAVE MEN

165
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,161
OF THE NIGHT'S WATCH
WILL PROTECT US ALL.

166
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,414
Dolorous Edd:
<i>AND I SAID,</i>

167
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,041
"IF THE GODS WANTED US
TO HAVE DIGNITY,

168
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,918
THEY WOULDN'T MAKE US
FART WHEN WE DIED."

169
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,630
Grenn:
WE FART WHEN WE DIE?

170
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,758
Dolorous Edd:
MY BLESSED MOTHER--

171
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,676
I WAS HOLDING HER HAND
WHEN SHE LEFT THIS WORLD.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,430
SHE FARTED SO HARD,
THE WHOLE BED SHOOK.

173
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,561
( blowing raspberry )

174
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,568
SEEMS A BIT GREEDY
FOR ONE MAN TO HAVE
SO MANY WIVES.

175
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,945
WOULDN'T TWO OR THREE
BE ENOUGH FOR HIM?

176
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,865
WE WERE HAVING
A SERIOUS DISCUSSION.

177
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,243
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

178
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,581
NOTHING LIKE THE SIGHT
OF A WOMAN WALKING AWAY.

179
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,459
I PREFER WATCHING THEM
COME TOWARDS ME.

180
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,919
I'M SURE
THAT'S NICE, TOO.

181
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,172
YEAH, WELL, THERE WAS
A MILKMAID NAMED VIOLET

182
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,841
ON THE NEXT FARM OVER
FROM WHERE I GREW UP.

183
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,886
<i>WE WERE WRESTLING TOGETHER</i>
<i>FROM THE TIME WE WERE</i>
<i>SIX YEARS OLD.</i>

184
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:23,933
AND THEN WE GOT OLDER
AND THE WRESTLING, UH...

185
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,061
CHANGED.

186
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,813
Sam:
YOU WERE WITH HER?

187
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,649
HOW MANY TIMES?

188
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,026
WELL, AS MANY TIMES
AS I COULD.

189
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,865
I WISH I GREW UP
ON A FARM.

190
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,283
WE NEED MORE POTATOES.

191
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,744
GET ANOTHER SACK
FROM THE SLEDGE.

192
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,125
GET THE TURNIPS, TOO.

193
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,922
<i>( dog barking )</i>

194
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,675
<i>( woman screams )</i>

195
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,140
NO. GHOST, NO.

196
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,642
<i>NO!</i>

197
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,311
GHOST, AWAY.
SHOO, SHOO!

198
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,984
YOU ALL RIGHT?

199
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,028
- DID HE FRIGHTEN YOU?
- YOU-- YOU SHOULDN'T
TOUCH ME.

200
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,532
OH. OH, RIGHT.

201
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,242
I'M SORRY.

202
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,995
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WEREN'T HURT.

203
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,420
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

204
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,474
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

205
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,350
THIS IS GILLY.

206
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,228
SHE'S ONE
OF CRASTER'S...
DAUGHTERS.

207
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,980
HELLO, GILLY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

208
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,982
SAM SAID
YOU COULD HELP.

209
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,485
- I'M SORRY, BUT SAM KNOWS
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED--
- SHE'S PREGNANT.

210
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,037
WE HAVE TO TAKE HER
WITH US WHEN WE LEAVE.

211
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,747
WHAT?

212
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,707
- WHAT WOULD THAT--
- Sam: I KNOW IT SOUNDS
A BIT MAD.

213
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,709
NO, IT DOESN'T
SOUND A BIT MAD,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

214
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,878
- THE LORD COMMANDER
ORDERED US TO--
- WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT.

215
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,422
- SAM, WE CAN'T TAKE--
- PLEASE, SER, PLEASE.

216
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,508
I CAN STILL RUN
IF I HAVE TO.

217
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,052
- IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.
- I'M GOING TO HAVE A BABY.

218
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,513
IF IT'S A BOY...

219
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,598
IF IT'S A BOY, WHAT?

220
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,230
YOU WANT US TO RISK
OUR LIVES FOR YOU

221
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
AND YOU WON'T EVEN
TELL US WHY?

222
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,907
- WHY'D YOU DO THAT?
- DO WHAT? ASK HER A QUESTION?

223
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,825
- YOU WERE CRUEL.
- CRUEL?

224
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,786
SAM, ARE YOU
IN SUCH A HURRY
TO LOSE A HAND?

225
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,080
- I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.
- NO, YOU JUST WANT
TO STEAL HER.

226
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,915
WHAT DO YOU THINK
CRASTER CUTS OFF FOR THAT?

227
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,917
I CAN'T STEAL HER.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,253
SHE'S A PERSON,
NOT A GOAT.

229
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,970
WE'RE HEADING
DEEPER AND DEEPER
INTO WILDLING TERRITORY.

230
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,764
WE CAN'T TAKE A GIRL WITH US.
MORMONT WOULDN'T HAVE IT.

231
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,767
AND EVEN IF HE WOULD,
WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH HER?

232
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,644
WHO'S GOING TO
DELIVER A BABY, YOU?

233
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,522
I COULD TRY.

234
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,567
WHAT?
I'VE READ ABOUT IT.

235
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,194
A BIT.

236
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,948
I'M SORRY, SAM.

237
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
WE CAN'T HELP HER.

238
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,838
( sighs )

239
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,803
<i>( insects chittering,</i>
<i>buzzing )</i>

240
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,539
( sighs )

241
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,751
<i>( hoofbeats approaching )</i>

242
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,967
- KHALEESI.
-<i> ( horse neighs )</i>

243
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,228
( breathing heavily )

244
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,157
( flies buzzing )

245
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,014
- YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS.
- HE IS BLOOD OF MY BLOOD.

246
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,978
- WHO DID THIS?
- KHAL PONO, PERHAPS.

247
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,439
<i>KHAL JHAQO.</i>

248
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,567
THEY DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF A WOMAN
LEADING A KHALASAR.

249
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,737
THEY WILL LIKE IT FAR LESS
WHEN I AM DONE WITH THEM.

250
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,706
( weeping )

251
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,960
( speaking Dothraki )

252
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,832
( sobbing )

253
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,467
( Irri wailing )

254
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,886
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

255
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,998
IS IT AS YOU REMEMBER,
MY LORD?

256
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,125
IT LOOKS SMALLER.

257
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,086
EVERYTHING LOOKS BIGGER
WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD.

258
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,962
I REMEMBER
MY FATHER'S CABIN

259
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,756
FELT LIKE A PALACE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

260
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,384
NOW LOOK AT IT.
( giggles )

261
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,678
THEY'LL BE WAITING
FOR ME ON THE DOCKS.

262
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,347
WHO WILL?

263
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,182
<i>ANYONE WHO MATTERS.</i>

264
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,518
THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR THEM.

265
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,021
THEY HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TO GET
EXCITED ABOUT SINCE I LEFT.

266
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,023
IT'S A HARD PLACE,
THE IRON ISLANDS.

267
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,691
<i>ALWAYS HAS BEEN.</i>

268
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,985
IT'S COLD AND IT'S WET.

269
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,695
OH, I LOVE
THE COLD AND WET.

270
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,406
THEY SAY HARD PLACES
BREED HARD MEN.

271
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,702
AND HARD MEN
RULE THE WORLD.

272
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,083
THEN YOU'LL BE KING
BEFORE LONG.

273
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,879
TRY SMILING WITH
YOUR LIPS CLOSED.

274
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,923
BETTER.

275
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,220
MY FATHER DOESN'T TRUST
YOU IRON ISLANDERS.

276
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,305
I DON'T BLAME HIM.

277
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,475
<i>HE SAYS THAT YOU'RE ALL</i>
<i>REAVERS AND RAPERS</i>

278
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,269
AND THAT NO MATTER
HOW MANY WOMEN YOU HAVE,

279
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,271
- YOU'LL NEVER BE SAT-- UH!
- ( grunts )

280
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,566
- QUIT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.
- ( moans )

281
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,402
BUT HE'S RIGHT
ABOUT US.

282
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,030
OUR WIVES
FROM THE IRON ISLANDS,
THEY'RE FOR BREEDING.

283
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,533
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR US.

284
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,910
THAT'S WHY
WE TAKE SALT WIVES--

285
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,704
THE WOMEN WE CAPTURE.

286
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,247
CAPTURE ME.

287
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,332
TAKE ME WITH YOU
WHEN YOU GO ASHORE.

288
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,461
- MAKE ME YOUR SALT WIFE.
- YOUR PLACE IS ON THIS SHIP.

289
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,672
NOT AFTER YOU LEAVE.

290
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,133
FATHER WILL PUNISH ME.

291
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,593
HE'LL CALL ME A WHORE.

292
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,305
I HAVEN'T PAID YOU.

293
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,645
( both grunting )

294
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,777
( moaning )
OH, YEAH.

295
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,619
( jewelry jangling )

296
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>( door opens )</i>

297
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,956
- Man:<i> I PAID GOOD MONEY...</i>
<i>- ( door slams )</i>

298
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,631
<i>( man grumbling )</i>

299
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,843
- I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND FOR THIS.
-<i> ( woman crying )</i>

300
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,637
I BARELY TOUCHED HER.

301
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
NOW, YOU CHARGE TWICE AS MUCH
AS EVERY OTHER BROTHEL

302
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,641
AND THIS IS
WHAT I GET-- CRYING.

303
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,935
ONE MOMENT, MY FRIEND.
A MOMENT.

304
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,687
( snaps fingers )

305
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,572
PLEASE ACCEPT
MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES.

306
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,033
AREMCA WILL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF YOU.

307
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>( crying continues )</i>

308
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,942
- I'M SORRY, MY LORD.
- SHH, SHH.

309
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,028
DID HE HURT YOU?

310
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,282
NO, MY LORD.

311
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,119
( sniffles )
IT'S MHAEGEN.

312
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,329
WHO?

313
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,166
SHE WORKS FOR YOU.

314
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,712
SHE'S THE ONE--
THE GOLD CLOAKS,

315
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,214
- THEY KILLED HER BABY.
- AH, YES.

316
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,842
THAT WAS...

317
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,011
POORLY HANDLED.

318
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,681
SOMETIMES THOSE
WITH THE MOST POWER

319
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,559
HAVE THE LEAST GRACE.

320
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,146
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

321
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,189
I CAN'T SLEEP.

322
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,861
THAT POOR LITTLE BABY.

323
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,739
YOU KNOW, YOU REMIND ME
OF ANOTHER GIRL,

324
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,574
A LOVELY THING
I ONCE ACQUIRED

325
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,702
FROM A LYSENE
PLEASURE HOUSE--

326
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,913
BEAUTIFUL, LIKE YOURSELF,

327
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,625
AND INTELLIGENT,
LIKE YOURSELF.

328
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,420
BUT SHE WASN'T HAPPY.

329
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,674
SHE CRIED OFTEN.

330
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,845
I ASKED HER WHY,
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE

331
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,973
THE KIND OF RAPPORT
THAT YOU AND I HAVE.

332
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,980
YES, IT WAS QUITE SAD.

333
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,358
GIRLS FROM THE LYSENE
PLEASURE HOUSES ARE EXPENSIVE,

334
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,444
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

335
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,281
AND THIS ONE WASN'T
MAKING ME ANY MONEY.

336
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,246
I HATE BAD INVESTMENTS.

337
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,083
REALLY, I-- I DO.

338
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,293
THEY HAUNT ME.

339
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,675
I HAD NO IDEA
HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY,

340
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,804
NO IDEA HOW
TO MITIGATE MY LOSSES.

341
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,432
A VERY WEALTHY PATRON,
HE OFFERED ME

342
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,892
A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF MONEY

343
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,939
TO LET HIM TRANSFORM
THIS LOVELY, SAD GIRL.

344
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,692
TO USE HER
IN WAYS THAT...

345
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,612
WOULD NEVER OCCUR
TO MOST MEN.

346
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,866
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
OCCURS TO MOST MEN.

347
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:37,958
I WOULD NOT SAY
HE SUCCEEDED IN
MAKING HER HAPPY,

348
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,754
BUT MY LOSSES WERE
DEFINITELY MITIGATED.

349
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,722
TAKE TONIGHT OFF
TO MOURN MHAEGEN'S CHILD.

350
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,017
<i>I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.</i>

351
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,937
AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY?

352
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,192
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

353
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,202
-<i> ( distant hoofbeats )</i>
<i>- ( people chattering )</i>

354
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,954
( crying )

355
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,832
Tyrion:
<i>MORE WINE?</i>

356
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,709
- Janos: DAMN IT, BOY!
- APOLOGIES, MY LORD.

357
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,629
LEAVE US, PODRICK.
I BELIEVE WE KNOW
HOW TO POUR OUR OWN WINE.

358
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,340
THAT'S YOUR NEW SQUIRE?

359
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,426
I COULD'VE FOUND YOU
A PROPER LAD.

360
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,220
MYSELF, I PREFER
THE IMPROPER ONES.

361
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,223
MM, THAT'S A GOOD RED.
DORNISH?

362
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,725
YOU KNOW YOUR WINES,
MY LORD.

363
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,226
THAT I DO.

364
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,104
( sighs )
A FINE DINNER, MY LORD.

365
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,981
CALL ME TYRION, PLEASE.

366
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,900
I'M SURE YOU'RE GETTING
USED TO FINE DINNERS,

367
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,526
NOW THAT YOU'RE A LORD.

368
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,445
MAYBE I'LL HIRE
THIS COOK OF YOURS.

369
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,322
WARS HAVE BEEN
STARTED FOR LESS.

370
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,324
( both laugh )

371
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,535
I HEARD THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE
IN LITTLEFINGER'S BROTHEL
THE OTHER NIGHT.

372
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,662
MM, NASTY BUSINESS.

373
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
- HAD TO BE DONE.
- YES, OF COURSE.

374
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,958
THE CITY WATCH
MUST KEEP THE PEACE,

375
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,921
ONLY I HADN'T REALIZED
PEACE DEPENDED ON
KILLING BABIES.

376
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,424
- ORDERS ARE ORDERS.
- QUITE RIGHT.

377
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,760
ESPECIALLY
THE QUEEN'S ORDERS.

378
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,511
I NEVER SAID THEY WERE
THE QUEEN'S ORDERS.

379
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,974
NO, BUT WHO ELSE
WOULD WANT TO MURDER
KING ROBERT'S BASTARDS?

380
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,559
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A JEALOUS WOMAN.

381
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,770
YOU KNOW YOUR SISTER
BETTER THAN I DO.

382
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,730
YOU'VE HEARD THE AWFUL RUMORS
ABOUT MY BROTHER AND SISTER?

383
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,482
I DON'T LISTEN TO FILTH.

384
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,735
THAT'S GOOD OF YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE HEARD THEM.

385
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,696
I SUPPOSE PEOPLE
WHO DO BELIEVE THAT FILTH
CONSIDER ROBERT'S BASTARDS

386
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,324
TO BE BETTER
CLAIMANTS TO THE THRONE
THAN CERSEI'S CHILDREN.

387
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,368
JOFFREY IS MY KING.
THE REST DOESN'T INTEREST ME.

388
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,829
I APPRECIATE
YOUR LOYALTY.

389
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,917
TELL ME, WHEN YOUR MEN
SLAUGHTERED NED STARK'S MEN

390
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,671
IN THE THRONE ROOM,
DID YOU GIVE THE ORDER?

391
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,881
I DID.

392
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,508
AND I WOULD AGAIN.

393
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,260
THE MAN WAS A TRAITOR.

394
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,345
HE TRIED TO BUY
MY LOYALTY.

395
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,472
THE FOOL.

396
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,808
HE HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE ALREADY BOUGHT.

397
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,018
ARE YOU DRUNK?

398
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,312
I'LL NOT HAVE MY HONOR
QUESTIONED BY AN IMP!

399
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,316
I'M NOT QUESTIONING
YOUR HONOR, LORD JANOS.

400
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,026
I'M DENYING ITS EXISTENCE.

401
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,321
IF YOU THINK I'LL STAND HERE
AND TAKE THIS FROM YOU, DWARF--

402
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,907
DWARF? MM, YOU SHOULD
HAVE STOPPED AT IMP.

403
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,618
AND, YES,
YOU WILL STAND HERE
AND TAKE IT FROM ME,

404
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,121
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE IT
FROM MY FRIEND HERE.

405
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,165
I INTEND TO SERVE
AS HAND OF THE KING

406
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,792
UNTIL MY FATHER
RETURNS FROM THE WAR.

407
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,919
AND SEEING AS YOU BETRAYED
THE LAST HAND OF THE KING,

408
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,006
WELL, I JUST WOULDN'T
FEEL SAFE WITH YOU
LURKING ABOUT.

409
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,299
WHAT ARE YOU T--

410
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,217
MY FRIENDS AT COURT
WILL NOT ALLOW THIS!

411
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,469
- THE QUEEN HERSELF
HAS GRANTED--
- THE<i> QUEEN REGENT.</i>

412
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,306
AND YOU'RE A FOOL TO BELIEVE
SHE IS YOUR FRIEND.

413
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,558
WE SHALL HEAR WHAT JOFFREY
HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS.

414
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,686
- NO, WE SHAN'T.
-<i> ( footsteps approach )</i>

415
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,356
<i>( doors open )</i>

416
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,653
THERE'S A SHIP LEAVING
FOR EASTWATCH-BY-THE-SEA
TONIGHT.

417
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:57,198
FROM THERE I'M AFRAID
IT'S RATHER A LONG WALK
TO CASTLE BLACK.

418
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,326
<i>I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE WALL.</i>

419
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,495
I FOUND IT
SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL...

420
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,291
IN A BRUTAL, HORRIBLY
UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF WAY.

421
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,876
THE LADS WILL ESCORT YOU.

422
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,794
THE STREETS AREN'T SAFE
AT NIGHT, MY LORD.

423
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,255
THESE MEN ARE
UNDER MY COMMAND!

424
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,424
I COMMAND YOU TO ARREST
THIS CUTTHROAT.

425
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,384
HIS NAME IS BRONN

426
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,720
AND HE IS THE NEW
COMMANDER OF THE CITY WATCH.

427
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,388
BOYS.

428
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,934
( Janos grunting )
I HAVE FRIENDS AT COURT,

429
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,312
POWERFUL FRIENDS!

430
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,023
THE KING HIMSELF
MADE ME A LORD!

431
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,280
TO THE NEW COMMANDER.

432
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,207
IF I TOLD YOU TO MURDER
AN INFANT GIRL, SAY,

433
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,502
STILL AT HER
MOTHER'S BREAST,

434
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,671
WOULD YOU DO IT
WITHOUT QUESTION?

435
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,759
WITHOUT QUESTION? NO.

436
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,095
I'D ASK, "HOW MUCH?"

437
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,141
( chatter )

438
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,688
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

439
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,823
IF THEY COME BACK,
I SAY WE YIELD.

440
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,408
GENDRY'S THE ONE
THEY WANT.

441
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,326
DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.

442
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,036
I AIN'T AFRAID
OF NO BATTLES.

443
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,455
IF YOU GOT WITHIN
A MILE OF A BATTLE,
YOU'D FILL YOUR PANTS.

444
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,165
I'VE SEEN
LOTS OF BATTLES.

445
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,792
- I SAW--
- LIAR.

446
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,044
I SAW A MAN
KILL ANOTHER MAN

447
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,296
JUST OUTSIDE A TAVERN
IN FLEA BOTTOM.

448
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,882
STABBED HIM
RIGHT IN THE NECK.

449
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,677
TWO MEN FIGHTING
ISN'T A BATTLE.

450
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,680
- THEY HAD ARMOR ON.
- SO?

451
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,015
SO, IF THEY'VE
GOT ARMOR ON,
IT'S A BATTLE.

452
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,809
NO, IT ISN'T.

453
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,478
WHAT DOES A DYER'S APPRENTICE
KNOW ABOUT BATTLES ANYWAY?

454
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,772
GENDRY'S AN ARMORER'S
APPRENTICE.

455
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,733
HOT PIE, TELL GENDRY
WHAT MAKES A FIGHT
INTO A BATTLE.

456
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,155
IT'S, UM, WHEN
THEY'VE GOT ARMOR ON.

457
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,907
Gendry:
<i>WHO TOLD YOU THAT?</i>

458
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,409
A KNIGHT.

459
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,203
HOW'D YOU KNOW
HE WAS A KNIGHT?

460
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,708
WELL, IT WAS 'CAUSE
HE GOT ARMOR ON.

461
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,918
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A KNIGHT
TO HAVE ARMOR.

462
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,503
ANY IDIOT
CAN BUY ARMOR.

463
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,338
Hot Pie:
<i>HOW DO YOU KNOW?</i>

464
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,632
'CAUSE I SOLD ARMOR.

465
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,771
WHAT DO THE GOLD CLOAKS
WANT WITH YOU?

466
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,691
- NO IDEA.
-<i> YOU'RE A LIAR.</i>

467
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,985
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
INSULT PEOPLE THAT ARE
BIGGER THAN YOU.

468
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,571
THEN I WOULDN'T GET
TO INSULT ANYONE.

469
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,073
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANY OF THEM WANT.

470
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,867
NO GOOD'S EVER COME
OF THEIR QUESTIONS.

471
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,161
NO GOOD'S<i> EVER</i> COME?

472
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,038
WHO ASKED QUESTIONS
BEFORE?

473
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,374
HOW CAN SOMEONE
SO SMALL BE SUCH
A HUGE PAIN IN MY ASS?

474
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,668
WHO ASKED QUESTIONS?

475
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,005
THE HAND OF THE KING.

476
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,382
HANDS OF THE KING.

477
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,594
LORD ARRYN CAME FIRST
A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HE DIED,

478
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:09,057
AND THEN LORD STARK CAME
A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HE DIED.

479
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,100
LORD STARK?

480
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:16,231
SEE? ASKING ME
QUESTIONS IS BAD LUCK.

481
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,400
YOU'LL PROBABLY
BE DEAD SOON.

482
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,570
- WHAT DID THEY ASK ABOUT?
- MY MOM.

483
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,406
- WHO'S YOUR MOM?
- JUST MY MOM--

484
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,325
WORKED IN A TAVERN,
DIED WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

485
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,244
AND WHO WAS YOUR FATHER?

486
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,205
COULD'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE
GOLD-HATTED BASTARDS,
FOR ALL I KNOW.

487
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,332
WHAT ABOUT YOU ANYWAY?

488
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,627
YOU THOUGHT
THEY WERE AFTER YOU.

489
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,379
WHY?

490
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,882
DID YOU KILL SOMEONE
OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE A GIRL?

491
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,926
- I'M NOT A GIRL.
- YES, YOU ARE.

492
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,762
- DO YOU THINK I'M AS STUPID
AS THE REST OF THEM?
- STUPIDER.

493
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,806
THE NIGHT'S WATCH
DOESN'T TAKE GIRLS,
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

494
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,517
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT YOU'RE STILL A GIRL.
- I AM NOT!

495
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,602
YEAH? WELL,
PULL YOUR COCK OUT
AND TAKE A PISS, THEN.

496
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,606
I DON'T NEED
TO TAKE A PISS.

497
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,656
LOMMY AND HOT PIE
CAN'T KNOW.

498
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,157
NO ONE CAN KNOW.

499
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,036
WELL, THEY WON'T,
NOT FROM ME.

500
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,500
MY NAME'S NOT ARRY.

501
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,211
IT'S ARYA...
OF HOUSE STARK.

502
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,174
YOREN IS TAKING ME HOME
TO WINTERFELL.

503
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,428
HE WAS YOUR FATHER--
THE HAND, THE TRAITOR.

504
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,555
HE WAS NEVER A TRAITOR.

505
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,515
JOFFREY IS A LIAR.

506
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,101
SO YOU'RE A HIGHBORN, THEN.
YOU'RE A LADY.

507
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,020
NO. I MEAN, YES.

508
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,313
MY MOTHER WAS A LADY
AND MY SISTER--

509
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,939
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE
A LORD'S DAUGHTER

510
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,983
AND YOU LIVED
IN A CASTLE AND YOU--

511
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,861
LOOK, ALL THAT ABOUT COCKS,
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAID--

512
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,113
AND I'VE BEEN PISSING
IN FRONT OF YOU
AND EVERYTHING.

513
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,824
I-- I SHOULD BE
CALLING YOU "MY LADY."

514
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:52,994
- DO NOT CALL ME "MY LADY."
- AS MY LADY COMMANDS.

515
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,787
WELL, THAT WAS UNLADYLIKE.

516
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,165
OH!

517
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,584
( laughs )

518
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

519
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,838
( chatter )

520
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,302
<i>( hammers banging )</i>

521
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,444
WHAT'S SHE CARRYING?

522
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,197
MYRISH ORANGES,

523
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,200
WINE FROM THE ARBOR...

524
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,787
AND THE HEIR TO PYKE
AND THE IRON ISLANDS.

525
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,084
THE ONLY LIVING SON
OF BALON GREYJOY.

526
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,339
ME.

527
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,301
I DON'T LIKE WINE.

528
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,345
WOMAN'S DRINK.

529
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,599
I NEED TO GET TO PYKE.

530
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,569
I'LL FIND YOU A HORSE.

531
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,250
I'M HEADING THAT WAY.
I CAN TAKE YOU THERE.

532
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,794
I BET YOU CAN.

533
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,754
HAVE YOU BEEN
AT SEA LONG?

534
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,257
OR WERE THERE JUST NO WOMEN
WHERE YOU CAME FROM?

535
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,592
- NONE LIKE YOU.
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M LIKE.

536
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,470
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LIKE.

537
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,390
MAYBE YOU NEED
SOMEONE TO TEACH YOU.

538
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,767
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

539
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,979
YOU THINK I OFFER FREE RIDES
TO EVERY MAN IN JEWELRY,

540
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,232
LORD GREYJOY?

541
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,778
HAVE MY THINGS SENT UP
TO THE CASTLE.

542
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,505
YOU SHOULD GIVE ME
THE REINS.

543
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,591
I'M A BETTER RIDER
THAN YOU.

544
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,634
I'VE BEEN ON HORSEBACK
FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS.

545
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,136
NINE YEARS?

546
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,513
DO YOU STILL KNOW
YOUR WAY AROUND A SHIP?

547
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,640
HAVE THESE HANDS
EVER TOUCHED A ROPE?

548
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,226
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT MY HANDS.

549
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,980
THE SEA IS IN MY BLOOD.

550
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,609
YOUR BLOOD WILL BE
IN THE SEA IF I DON'T
WATCH WHERE I'M GOING.

551
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,612
I HAVE A PROPOSAL
FOR MY FATHER,

552
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,323
ONE THAT WILL
MAKE HIM KING AGAIN,

553
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,575
AND ME AFTER HIM.

554
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,205
YOU MAY GET TO STAY
IN A CASTLE TONIGHT
IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

555
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,457
IS THAT AN OFFER
FROM MY FUTURE KING?

556
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,918
AN ORDER FROM
YOUR FUTURE KING.

557
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,923
YOU CAN TELL
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN
ABOUT THIS NIGHT.

558
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,009
Woman:
I DON'T IMAGINE IT WILL BE
A STORY FIT FOR CHILDREN.

559
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,810
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

560
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,399
Theon: FATHER.

561
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,569
NINE YEARS, IS IT?

562
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,655
THEY TOOK
A FRIGHTENED BOY.

563
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,658
<i>WHAT HAVE</i>
<i>THEY GIVEN BACK?</i>

564
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,702
A MAN.

565
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:26,040
- YOUR BLOOD AND YOUR HEIR.
-<i> WE SHALL SEE.</i>

566
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,751
STARK HAD YOU
LONGER THAN I DID.

567
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,170
<i>LORD STARK IS GONE.</i>

568
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,634
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

569
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,764
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

570
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,975
I'VE BROUGHT YOU
A PROPOSAL FROM ROBB STARK.

571
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,061
WHO GAVE YOU
THOSE CLOTHES?

572
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:50,731
WAS IT NED STARK'S PLEASURE
TO MAKE YOU HIS DAUGHTER?

573
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,568
IF MY CLOTHES OFFEND YOU,
I WILL CHANGE THEM.

574
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,319
YOU WILL.

575
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,739
THAT BAUBLE
'ROUND YOUR NECK--

576
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,076
DID YOU PAY THE IRON PRICE
FOR IT OR THE GOLD?

577
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,579
<i>I ASKED A QUESTION.</i>

578
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,164
<i>DID YOU PULL IT FROM THE NECK</i>
<i>OF A CORPSE YOU MADE</i>

579
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,711
OR DID YOU BUY IT
TO MATCH YOUR FINE CLOTHES?

580
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,174
IRON OR GOLD?

581
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,637
GOLD.

582
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,603
I'LL NOT HAVE MY SON
DRESSED AS A WHORE.

583
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,146
<i>( necklace clinks )</i>

584
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,858
MY FEARS HAVE COME TRUE--

585
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,277
THE STARKS
HAVE MADE YOU THEIRS.

586
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,530
- MY BLOOD IS SALT AND IRON.
- YET THE STARK BOY
SENDS YOU TO ME

587
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,992
LIKE A TRAINED RAVEN
CLUTCHING HIS MESSAGE.

588
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,952
THE OFFER HE MAKES
IS ONE I PROPOSED.

589
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,455
- HE HEEDS YOUR COUNSEL?
- I'VE LIVED WITH HIM,

590
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,040
HUNTED WITH HIM,
FOUGHT AT HIS SIDE.

591
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,791
HE THINKS OF ME
AS A BROTHER.

592
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,419
NO, NOT HERE,
NOT IN MY HEARING.

593
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,963
YOU WILL NOT
NAME HIM BROTHER,

594
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,009
THIS SON OF THE MAN WHO PUT
YOUR TRUE BROTHERS TO THE SWORD.

595
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,803
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
YOUR OWN BLOOD?

596
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,805
I FORGET NOTHING.

597
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,767
I REMEMBER MY BROTHERS.

598
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,770
AND I REMEMBER
WHEN MY FATHER
WAS A KING.

599
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,663
I SEE.

600
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,165
I DESTROY ROBB STARK'S
ENEMIES FOR HIM

601
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:34,669
AND HE WILL MAKE ME
KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS
ONCE AGAIN.

602
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,547
- I WILL LEAD
THE ATTACK MYSELF.
- OH, YOU WILL?

603
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,133
I'M YOUR SON,
YOUR ONLY LIVING HEIR.

604
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,678
- WHO ELSE?
-<i> ( door opens )</i>

605
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,848
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

606
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,143
HOW DID YOU GET
PAST THE GUARDS?

607
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,604
ANYTHING WITH A COCK
IS EASY TO FOOL.

608
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,440
MY DEAR.

609
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,195
YARA?

610
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,073
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU,
BROTHER.

611
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,952
THIS IS A HOMECOMING I'LL TELL
MY GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT.

612
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,706
SHE CAN'T LEAD AN ATTACK!

613
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,001
- Balon: AND WHY NOT?
- YOU'RE A WOMAN!

614
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,379
- YOU'RE THE ONE IN SKIRTS.
- THIS ISN'T WINTERFELL, BOY.

615
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,840
YOUR SISTER TOOK OVER COMMAND
OF YOUR ELDEST BROTHER'S SHIP

616
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,718
AFTER YOUR NEW FATHER
KILLED HIM.

617
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,596
All:
WHAT'S DEAD MAY NEVER DIE.

618
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,473
THE ONLY NIGHTS SHE'S SPENT
OFF THESE ISLANDS

619
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,726
HAVE BEEN SPENT
ON THE SEA.

620
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,437
<i>SHE'S COMMANDED MEN.</i>

621
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,480
<i>SHE'S KILLED MEN.</i>

622
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,607
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.

623
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,821
NO MAN GIVES ME
A CROWN.

624
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,116
I PAY THE IRON PRICE.

625
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,076
I WILL TAKE MY CROWN,

626
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,413
FOR THAT IS WHO I AM.

627
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,707
THAT IS WHO
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

628
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,589
YOU WON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THE LANNISTERS
ON YOUR OWN.

629
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,550
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THE LANNISTERS?

630
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,642
Davos:
<i>YOU'LL HAVE YOUR GOLD</i>

631
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,227
<i>WHEN WE TAKE THE TREASURY</i>
<i>AT KING'S LANDING.</i>

632
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,979
Salladhor:
ALL THESE KINGS
FIGHTING FOR THE THRONE,

633
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,899
AND THIS STANNIS
HAS THE SMALLEST ARMY.

634
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,984
WHY WOULD I BET ON THE MAN
WITH THE WORST CHANCE?

635
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,321
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A SMART GAMBLER.

636
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,282
STANNIS HAS PROVED
HIMSELF IN WAR TWICE.

637
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:31,494
HIS BABY BROTHER
HAS NEVER SET FOOT
ON A BATTLEFIELD.

638
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,454
NEITHER HAS
THE FALSE KING JOFFREY.

639
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,539
AND YET THEY BOTH
HAVE LARGER ARMIES.

640
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,500
STANNIS HAS JUST
BEGUN THE FIGHT.

641
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,045
HIS BANNERMEN
WILL RALLY TO HIS CAUSE.

642
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,756
THERE'S NO MAN
IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS

643
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,299
MORE HONORABLE
THAN STANNIS BARATHEON

644
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,801
OR MORE WORTHY
OF LOYALTY.

645
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,469
WHAT IS THE WORLD
COMING TO

646
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,055
WHEN SMUGGLERS MUST VOUCH
FOR THE HONOR OF KINGS?

647
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,432
- MIND YOUR WORDS, PIRATE.
- MATTHOS.

648
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,017
YOU THINK I'M INSULTED?

649
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,145
I<i> AM</i> A PIRATE.
I'M AN EXCELLENT PIRATE.

650
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,815
<i>I DON'T SAIL</i>
<i>FOR PROMISES.</i>

651
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,316
OF COURSE YOU DO.

652
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,902
EVERY TIME YOU LEAVE HARBOR,
YOU'RE LEAVING ON A PROMISE--

653
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,445
A PROMISE THAT
SOMEWHERE ON THE SEA,

654
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,906
SOMEBODY'S GOT SOME GOLD
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HIM.

655
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,575
- THAT'S A PROMISE
THAT ALWAYS COMES TRUE.
- AS IS MINE.

656
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,953
YOU'RE NOT A YOUNG MAN,
SALLADHOR.

657
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,746
AND CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG--

658
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,414
MOST PIRATES
DON'T GROW OLD.

659
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,708
ONLY THE CLEVER ONES.

660
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,461
YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR LAST FEW YEARS
ON THE SEA

661
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,672
STEALING FROM
PENTOSHI CHEESEMONGERS

662
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,006
AND MEEREENESE
SILK MERCHANTS?

663
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,050
THEN GO.
THEY'RE OUT THERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

664
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,885
THAT'S EASY.

665
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,722
WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU
IS HARD.

666
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,560
COME WITH ME AND PLUNDER
THE GREATEST CITY IN WESTEROS.

667
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,396
YOU'LL BE THE RICHEST MAN
IN LYS AND THE MOST FAMOUS.

668
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,400
THEY'LL BE SINGING SONGS
ABOUT YOU AS LONG AS MEN
HAVE VOICES TO SING.

669
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,571
"SALLADHOR SAAN"
IS A GOOD NAME FOR SONGS.

670
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:52,158
- IT IS.
-<i> ONE THING--</i>
<i>I WANT THE QUEEN.</i>

671
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,910
- THE QUEEN?
- CERSEI-- I WANT HER.

672
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,454
I'LL SAIL WITH YOUR FLEET,
ALL 30 OF MY SHIPS.

673
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,915
AND IF WE DON'T
DROWN AT THE BOTTOM
OF BLACKWATER BAY,

674
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,294
I WILL FUCK THIS BLONDE QUEEN
AND I'LL FUCK HER WELL.

675
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,254
THIS WAR
ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

676
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,382
WE'RE NOT ATTACKING
KING'S LANDING SO THAT
YOU CAN RAPE THE QUEEN.

677
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:11,260
I'M NOT GOING TO RAPE HER.
I'M GOING TO FUCK HER.

678
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,512
AS IF SHE WOULD
JUST LET YOU.

679
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,181
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW PERSUASIVE I AM.

680
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,474
I'VE NEVER TRIED
TO FUCK YOU.

681
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,147
STANNIS IS THE RIGHTFUL KING
AND THE LORD OF LIGHT,

682
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,648
- THE ONE TRUE GOD--
- ( groans )

683
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,483
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER
THE WORLD, MY BOY,

684
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,069
AND EVERYWHERE I GO,
PEOPLE TELL ME ABOUT
THE TRUE GODS.

685
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,197
THEY ALL THINK
THEY FOUND THE RIGHT ONE.

686
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,491
THE ONE TRUE GOD
IS WHAT'S BETWEEN
A WOMAN'S LEGS,

687
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,828
AND BETTER YET,
A QUEEN'S LEGS.

688
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,206
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
A TRUE BELIEVER FOR A SON.

689
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,749
EH, HE'S YOUNG YET.

690
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,878
I PROMISE YOU THE GOLD.
I PROMISE YOU THE GLORY.

691
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,755
I CANNOT PROMISE YOU
THE QUEEN.

692
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,135
YOU BELIEVE
YOUR KING CAN WIN?

693
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,346
HE IS THE ONE TRUE KING.

694
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,264
YOU WESTEROSI
ARE FUNNY PEOPLE.

695
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,516
A MAN CHOPS OFF
YOUR FINGERS AND YOU
FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

696
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,436
( laughs )

697
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,939
I'LL SAIL WITH YOU,
DAVOS SEAWORTH.

698
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,609
YOU'RE THE MOST HONEST
SMUGGLER I EVER MET.

699
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,945
MAKE ME RICH.

700
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,323
GET ME TO THE GATES
OF KING'S LANDING
AND I WILL.

701
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,628
Matthos:
<i>WHEN WILL THE KING</i>
<i>HAVE US SAIL?</i>

702
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,172
AS SOON AS HIS GOD
WILLS IT.

703
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,800
HE'S MY GOD, TOO,
AND YOURS,

704
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,552
BUT YOU ARE
TOO BLIND TO SEE.

705
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,306
- LET ME TEACH YOU HOW TO READ.
- OH, YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.

706
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,975
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE LETTERS.

707
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,310
THE HOLY BOOKS ARE
MUCH MORE PERSUASIVE
THAN I CAN BE.

708
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
I WISH I HAD
A GOD, TRULY.

709
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,606
I'M NOT MOCKING YOU,
BUT I'VE SEEN MEN PRAY
TO EVERY GOD THERE IS--

710
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,150
PRAY FOR WIND,
PRAY FOR RAIN,
PRAY FOR HOME.

711
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,945
- NONE OF IT WORKS.
- BUT YOU ALWAYS CAME HOME.

712
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,907
- I WASN'T PRAYING.
- NO, BUT I WAS.

713
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,119
EVERY NIGHT
THAT YOU WERE AT SEA,

714
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,330
I LIT A CANDLE
AND I PRAYED FOR YOU.

715
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,083
YOU WANT ME
TO HAVE A GOD?

716
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,169
FINE. KING STANNIS
IS MY GOD.

717
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,547
HE RAISED ME UP
AND BLESSED ME
WITH HIS TRUST.

718
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,300
HE GAVE YOU A FUTURE
I COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED.

719
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,385
YOU KNOW HOW TO READ.
YOU'LL BE A KNIGHT SOMEDAY.

720
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,555
YOU THINK A FIRE GOD
COMMANDED ALL THAT?

721
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,058
IT WAS STANNIS,
ONLY STANNIS.

722
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,978
STANNIS IS MY KING,
BUT HE'S ONLY A MAN.

723
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,939
DON'T TELL HIM THAT.
( laughs )

724
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,901
Cersei:
LORD JANOS SLYNT WAS
COMMANDER OF THE CITY WATCH.

725
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,403
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO EXILE HIM.

726
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,280
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT.
I AM THE KING'S HAND.

727
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,699
YOU'RE SERVING
AS THE KING'S HAND
TILL FATHER GETS HERE.

728
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,367
I AM QUEEN REGENT.

729
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,036
LISTEN TO ME,
QUEEN REGENT.

730
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,496
YOU'RE LOSING THE PEOPLE.

731
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,540
- DO YOU HEAR ME?
- ( laughs ) THE PEOPLE.

732
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,208
YOU THINK I CARE?

733
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,044
YOU MIGHT
FIND IT DIFFICULT

734
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,921
TO RULE OVER MILLIONS
WHO WANT YOU DEAD.

735
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,798
HALF THE CITY WILL STARVE
WHEN WINTER COMES.

736
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,550
THE OTHER HALF WILL PLOT
TO OVERTHROW YOU.

737
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,386
<i>AND YOUR GOLD-PLATED THUGS</i>
<i>JUST GAVE THEM</i>

738
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,388
THEIR RALLYING CRY--

739
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,974
"THE QUEEN
SLAUGHTERS BABIES."

740
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:10,105
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
THE DECENCY TO DENY IT.

741
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,743
IT WASN'T YOU WHO GAVE
THE ORDER, WAS IT?

742
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,870
<i>JOFFREY DIDN'T</i>
<i>EVEN TELL YOU.</i>

743
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,124
DID HE TELL YOU?

744
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,584
I IMAGINE THAT
WOULD BE EVEN WORSE.

745
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,462
HE DID WHAT NEEDED
TO BE DONE.

746
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,548
YOU WANT TO BE
HAND OF THE KING?
YOU WANT TO RULE?

747
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,468
THIS IS WHAT RULING IS--
LYING ON A BED OF WEEDS,

748
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,804
RIPPING THEM OUT
BY THE ROOT, ONE BY ONE,

749
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,680
BEFORE THEY STRANGLE YOU
IN YOUR SLEEP.

750
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,058
I'M NO KING,
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE
TO RULING THAN THAT.

751
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,102
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK!

752
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,603
YOU'VE NEVER
TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY.

753
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:52,022
YOU HAVEN'T,
JAIME HASN'T.

754
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,528
IT'S ALL FALLEN ON ME.

755
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,285
AS HAS JAIME REPEATEDLY,
ACCORDING TO STANNIS BARATHEON.

756
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,168
YOU'RE FUNNY.

757
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,715
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN FUNNY...

758
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,467
<i>BUT NONE OF YOUR JOKES</i>
<i>WILL EVER MATCH</i>

759
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,428
THE FIRST ONE, WILL THEY?

760
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,515
YOU REMEMBER?

761
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,434
BACK WHEN YOU RIPPED
MY MOTHER OPEN

762
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,103
ON YOUR WAY OUT OF HER
AND SHE BLED TO DEATH?

763
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,441
SHE WAS MY MOTHER, TOO.

764
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,693
MOTHER GONE...

765
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,321
FOR THE SAKE OF YOU.

766
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,119
<i>THERE'S NO BIGGER JOKE</i>
<i>IN THE WORLD THAN THAT.</i>

767
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,722
<i>( waves crashing,</i>
<i>seagulls screeching )</i>

768
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,348
<i>( door opens )</i>

769
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,643
- YOUR GRACE.
- YOUR GRACE.

770
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,562
Stannis:
HOW DID YOU FARE
WITH YOUR PIRATE?

771
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,274
SALLADHOR SAAN WILL JOIN
OUR FLEET-- 30 SHIPS.

772
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,193
HIS MEN KNOW
HOW TO FIGHT.

773
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,529
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
PIRATES PREFER FIGHTING
UNARMED MEN.

774
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,406
IT DOES SEEM
THE WISER CHOICE.

775
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,700
THERE WON'T BE
A CHOICE THIS TIME.

776
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,620
DO YOU TRUST HIM?

777
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
SALLADHOR SAAN
IS AN OLD FRIEND.

778
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,373
I'VE KNOWN HIM 30 YEARS.

779
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,834
I'VE NEVER TRUSTED HIM,

780
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,838
BUT ONCE HE GETS
THE SMELL OF GOLD,
HE NEVER STOPS.

781
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,175
WELL, IF HE DOES HIS JOB,
HE'LL HAVE HIS SHARE.

782
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,805
LEAVE US.

783
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,480
AT ONCE, YOUR GRACE.

784
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,031
THE LORD OF LIGHT
SHINES THROUGH YOU,
YOUNG WARRIOR.

785
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,867
( whispering )

786
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,413
COME.

787
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,127
<i>( doors close )</i>

788
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,838
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

789
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,175
I TOLD HIM DEATH BY FIRE
IS THE PUREST DEATH.

790
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,470
- WHY?
-<i> BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.</i>

791
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,139
YOU'RE TROUBLED, MY KING.

792
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,433
YEAH.

793
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,061
THESE ARMIES ARE TOYS
FOR THE LORD OF LIGHT.

794
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,147
TELL YOUR LORD
TO BURN THEM, THEN.

795
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,649
I TELL HIM NOTHING.

796
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:45,487
I PRAY FOR HIS COMMANDS
AND I OBEY.

797
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,491
MY LITTLE BROTHER HAS
100,000 MEN ACCORDING
TO THE SCOUTS,

798
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,661
MEN WHOSE ALLEGIANCE
RIGHTLY BELONGS TO ME.

799
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,621
<i>YOU MUST HAVE FAITH.</i>

800
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,790
FAITH?

801
00:47:56,873 --> 00:48:00,419
<i>IN A REAL WAR, THE SIDE</i>
<i>WITH THE GREATER NUMBER WINS</i>

802
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,379
NINE TIMES OUT OF 10.

803
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,964
THEN WE MUST BE
THE 10TH.

804
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,302
I CANNOT DEFEAT
MY BROTHER IN THE FIELD.

805
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:13,056
AND I CAN'T TAKE KING'S LANDING
WITHOUT THE MEN HE'S STOLEN.

806
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,186
I HAVE SEEN THE PATH
TO VICTORY IN THE FLAMES.

807
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,648
BUT FIRST,
YOU MUST GIVE YOURSELF
TO THE LORD OF LIGHT.

808
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,027
I'VE SAID THE WORDS,
DAMN YOU.

809
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,490
I BURNT THE IDOLS.

810
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,581
YOU MUST GIVE
ALL OF YOURSELF.

811
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,504
I HAVE A WIFE.

812
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,758
I TOOK A VOW.

813
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,180
SHE'S SICKLY, WEAK...

814
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,309
SHUT AWAY IN A TOWER.

815
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,353
SHE DISGUSTS YOU.

816
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,984
AND SHE'S GIVEN
YOU NOTHING--

817
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:10,781
NO SONS,
ONLY STILLBORNS,

818
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,866
ONLY DEATH.

819
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,168
I WILL GIVE YOU
A SON, MY KING.

820
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,339
