1
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,568
Okay. Let's see where we are.

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,823
We could move this, get
rid of that, kill that.

3
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,491
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her.
We can get rid of that.

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,993
That's done.
Okay, we could start with this.

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,204
I know it's a hard-hitting piece,
but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,581
We need traffic, traffic, traffic.
What do you got?

7
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,293
- How about this?
- It's perfect.

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,791
Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

9
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,801
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

10
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,216
I'm fucking with you people.
This isn't a porn site.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,968
What are we, nerds trying
to look at boobies?

12
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,841
Come on, Keep looking.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,343
Shit! Hello?

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,929
Hey! Baby, where are you?
Are you still at work?

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,348
No! Not even close.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,932
Just so you know,
the movie starts in 10 minutes.

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,813
- I know! Give me your pants.
- What?

18
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,527
- I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on.
- No.

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,484
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,032
Please try not to be late.
I really hate missing the beginning.

21
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,279
I know. I know.

22
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,779
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.

23
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm almost there!

24
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,287
- How far away?
- I think I see you!

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,003
- Where are you? I'm here.
- So am I.

26
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,921
So many people. What are you wearing?

27
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,466
I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theater,

28
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,294
because I'm the only person
outside the theater!

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,508
I love that outfit.
You look so sexy in that.

30
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,131
You know that I love this movie.

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,969
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman
can fall in love,

32
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:34,891
then anyone can.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,143
I know this means a lot to you,
which means it means a lot to me.

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,644
Well, apparently it doesn't.

35
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,067
I'm looking at you right now.
I can see you!

36
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,481
Jamie!

37
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,232
Hey!

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,526
- Hey.
- You made it.

39
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,399
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hi.

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,985
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

41
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,412
I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

42
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,494
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

43
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,830
Yes, I'm full aware of our allergies.
Y.

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,838
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.

45
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,665
We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.

46
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,716
Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

47
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,210
It was fucking Your Body ls a Wonderland!

48
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,181
Well, the good news is,
he has so many good ones.

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,975
Here's an idea: next time, instead
of being late, just shit on my face.

50
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,725
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing Your Body ls a Wonderland.

51
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,971
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.

52
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,274
Julia Roberts is about to put on
her really tall boots.

53
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,397
We need to talk.

54
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,698
I think we should take a break.

55
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,118
I just feel like
we should chill for a while, you know?

56
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,991
- You're doing this?
- You're breaking up with me?

57
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,413
You said I was your soul mate.

58
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,743
I did? When?

59
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,333
When we were at that bed and breakfast
having sex.

60
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,910
- But, you know, that doesn't...
- That doesn't what?

61
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,206
- Count.
- I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

62
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,625
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

63
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,926
and a little more
about the girl that you're dating.

64
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,430
'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

65
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,015
that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

66
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,935
I never said "go up." Okay?

67
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,431
I just said lightly around...
It's like a little button.

68
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,432
You know what? Not your issue any more.

69
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,683
Is this why you were late?

70
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,269
You were worried
about how to break up with me?

71
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,738
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to decide what to wear.

72
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,069
- So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie.
- Yeah.

73
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,905
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

74
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,819
Don't lash out, okay?

75
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,620
- You're better than that.
- I'm really not.

76
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,410
I just think
we're heading in different directions.

77
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,912
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert
and me not.

78
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,419
Thank you for doing this
before the concert, by the way.

79
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,496
Best breakup ever.

80
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,757
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!

81
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,167
Let me just ask you a quick question.

82
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,255
And just know that I am not at all
crushed by this breakup.

83
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,260
So, be honest. Why?

84
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,636
- Wait, is this a trick?
- No.

85
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,600
Just pure anthropological research.

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,682
Okay. You want someone
to sweep you off your feet,

87
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,560
but you're more interested
in getting swept off your feet

88
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,856
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.

89
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,150
You seem like you've got
it totally together,

90
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,111
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

91
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,656
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes...

92
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,867
Thank you. That's enough.

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,410
It is not you at all.

94
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,614
Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

95
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,492
It's not. It's me.
I don't like you any more.

96
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,994
This is my fault.
You deserve better than me.

97
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,336
You're a great guy.

98
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,754
A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,879
I didn't.

100
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,210
I really want to stay friends.

101
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,795
- Let's stay friends.
- Sure.

102
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,050
Totally.

103
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,178
John Mayer.

104
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,510
John fucking Mayer!

105
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,477
Come here, you.

106
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,147
You're gonna get through this.

107
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:31,322
Why do relationships always start off so
fun and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?

108
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,651
I really have to stop buying into this
bullshit Hollywood clichÃ© of true love.

109
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,537
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!

110
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,828
I'm just gonna work and fuck.
Like George Clooney.

111
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,665
I'm just gonna
shut myself down emotionally.

112
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,002
Like George Clooney.

113
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,554
Hello.

114
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,180
Seat up, please, sir.

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
Is that the Hudson River?

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,893
No. It's the East River.

117
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,027
So we won't be landing on it, then,
like that flight,

118
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,272
you know, with that captain
they keep giving medals to?

119
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,945
That pilot was a hero.

120
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,535
Asshole.

121
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,864
Plane actually did a lot of the work.

122
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,876
I think I found the perfect guy
to fill that job at GQ.

123
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,208
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.

124
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,458
No, he's not sold on the job yet,
but I'll get him there. I always do.

125
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,801
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.

126
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,588
He's from LA.
I figured he's into all that bullshit.

127
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,969
Hey, sir, what's that
tall building over there?

128
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,891
Empire State Building.

129
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,435
No, no, no, no. No. The other one.

130
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,352
The really, really tall one
with the antenna on top of it, the windows.

131
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,932
That is Empire State Building.

132
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,606
Oh, yeah. You're right. King Kong.

133
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,773
Hey...

134
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,073
Oh, hey! Are you done with this?
All met up?

135
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,745
Great. Welcome to New York,
Ms. Penderghast.

136
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,285
Yeah.

137
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,128
Oh, no. Excuse me. Sorry.

138
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,428
Okay.

139
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,803
- Can you hand me my bag?
- Sure. Which one?

140
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,019
- The one with the straps.
- Okay.

141
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,187
There.

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,932
Okay.

143
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,105
- Thank you.
- Welcome to New York, sir.

144
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,489
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,284
That's me.
Which one, the blue or the yellow?

146
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,450
No. The makeshift sign made
out of lipstick, that's me.

147
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,998
- You're Dylan Harper.
- I am.

148
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,374
I'm Jamie Rellis.

149
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,207
- You're picking me up from the airport.
- Hi. Yes, I am.

150
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,587
You always pick people up like this?

151
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah, you know,
I like to keep things interesting.

152
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,175
- Welcome to New York.
- Thank you.

153
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,883
You're not exactly what comes to mind
when you think headhunter.

154
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,182
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter."
Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

155
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,802
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

156
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,561
Here, here, here, I'll take it.

157
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,523
You're really gonna carry my bag?
You're that girl?

158
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,727
No. I'm gonna change your life.
I'm that girl.

159
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,062
My life is already pretty great.

160
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,490
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

161
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,326
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

162
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,325
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

163
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,533
Yeah, a lot of people
would say longer than that.

164
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,539
It's a huge opportunity Dylan.

165
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,584
Art director of GQ magazine.
This is the big leagues.

166
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,836
I mean, no offense to your little blog
on the Internet.

167
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,921
Which got six million hits last month.

168
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,921
I could put up a video of me mixing
cake batter with my boobs

169
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,547
and it will get eight million hits.

170
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,676
It's been done. Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.

171
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,176
Really?

172
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,642
Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

173
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,519
but this is GQ.

174
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,441
New York's so crowded.

175
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,566
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

176
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,782
- I like my open spaces.
- What are you, a gazelle?

177
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,075
Come on,
what's really worrying you about this?

178
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,202
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy
who took something legendary

179
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

180
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,087
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

181
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,254
Be the guy
who made the bed legendary again.

182
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,591
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

183
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:28,805
I'm sorry, not coffee.
Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.

184
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,927
Really hot in New York.

185
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,558
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

186
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
Yeah, it gets hot in LA,
but it's the humidity.

187
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,396
In LA, if it's 90 degrees,
it feels like 90 degrees. But...

188
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,936
- Right.
- If it's hot in New York,

189
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,900
it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees.

190
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,152
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

191
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,983
but lucky for me, we are here.

192
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,490
So, good luck.

193
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,119
Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

194
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,411
Just do me a favor?
Act like you do so that I look good.

195
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,791
- I can do that.
- Okay. Go get 'em.

196
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,255
This is great, by the way.

197
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,350
Watch it!

198
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,937
- Hey!
- You're still here?

199
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,490
Yeah. Well, it's my job.

200
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,654
Nice.

201
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,278
So, tell me, how'd it go?

202
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,239
They bought it.
You're safe for a little while longer.

203
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,620
Well, thank you. I owe you one.

204
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,000
This is from you.

205
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,502
It's your offer.

206
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,126
- Wait, I got it?
- They called about five minutes ago.

207
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,297
Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.

208
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,137
Why didn't you just tell me
instead of texting me?

209
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,642
'Cause it's more dramatic.

210
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,976
Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed.

211
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,478
I've seen your work. It's amazing.

212
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,358
It's a huge move.

213
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,646
Would you uproot your entire
life for a job? Be honest.

214
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,985
Well, no. For a job, probably not.

215
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,986
But for New York? Yeah, I would.

216
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,370
Which is why I'm not gonna
try to sell you on the job,

217
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,739
I'm gonna sell you on New York.

218
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,160
It's New York!

219
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,537
I've seen Seinfeld.

220
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,747
Not the bullshit tourist version.

221
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,956
Puppy dog eyes. Nice touch.

222
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,507
Yes! Come on.

223
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,009
Let me buy you a drink.

224
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,551
What's wrong?

225
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,594
What are you waiting for?

226
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,807
The light to change.

227
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,510
You LA folk are so cute.

228
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,936
Come on.

229
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,142
Come on, it's fine.

230
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,268
- See?
- Yep.

231
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,439
I'm gonna die.

232
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,520
Here we have Brooklyn Bridge,
downtown Manhattan,

233
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,863
and right in front of us, an outdoor bar.

234
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,576
Alcohol. Now we're talking.

235
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,206
You know, I like you.

236
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,082
I'll give you your choice of closes.

237
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,461
- What?
- How I close you on this job.

238
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,085
- Okay.
- So we got the flattery close.

239
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,797
Dylan, you are so good at what you do.

240
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,219
The take-it-or-leave-it close.

241
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,214
Man, I don't care if you take it.
I get paid regardless.

242
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,806
The sympathy close.

243
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,349
You see, my kidneys are failing...

244
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,974
Why do women think the only way
to get a man to do what they want

245
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,224
is to manipulate him?

246
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,233
History. Personal experience.
Romantic comedies.

247
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,561
Come on, you're here for a reason,
whether you want to admit it or not.

248
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,823
Yeah, to explore an option.
Who wouldn't want to know their options?

249
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,403
Someone who's in the perfect situation.

250
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,734
Are you in the perfect situation?

251
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,911
Job? Absolutely.

252
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,242
Everything else? None of your business.

253
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,543
Shaun!

254
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:43,912
- Jamie!
- Hey!

255
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,664
- Hey, what's up, baby?
- What are you doing here?

256
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,839
- Shaun White?
- You look great.

257
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,088
- You been working out?
- Nope. Just been eating a lot.

258
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,467
- Okay.
- Yeah.

259
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,677
- You want a drink?
- Yeah!

260
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,925
- Let me get you a drink. Yeah?
- Okay.

261
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,431
- Careful! Careful.
- Sorry.

262
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,472
Hey, bro, that was like
a double McTwist 1260.

263
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,476
- Yeah, like the trick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dylan.

264
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,144
Jamie, you want to get this guy
out of my face

265
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,608
before I break his fucking skull?

266
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,812
Sorry, bro. No disrespect. I'm a huge fan.

267
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,316
You don't fucking know me, man!
Don't talk to me like you know me!

268
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,114
What, you think I'm all chill
'cause I snowboard and shit?

269
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,779
One more word,
I'll fuck you up like dynamite!

270
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,660
Dynamite?

271
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,621
I'm just playing, bro.

272
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,627
Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.

273
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,130
- It's all good, man.
- All good.

274
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,796
I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,592
I'll see you later.

276
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,760
- Good to see you.
- Bye, honey.

277
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,849
Shaun White seems really great. Nice dude.

278
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,806
- How do you know him again?
- I took his virginity.

279
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,391
So you guys have known
each other for a while?

280
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,973
No, it was like eight months ago.

281
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,854
Wow.

282
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,189
So does the carpet match the drapes?

283
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,022
It's hardwood floors,
if you know what I mean.

284
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,274
My God! Terrible visual.

285
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,985
Totally kidding, by the way.
Just an old friend of mine.

286
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,159
You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.

287
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,456
His hair had nice body.

288
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,455
Can I get two gyro number sixes,
extra sauce?

289
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,038
- What are you looking for?
- The cops.

290
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,706
- Come on.
- The cops?

291
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,003
Yep...

292
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,001
Come on!

293
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,843
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

294
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,821
Well, here's your open space.

295
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,365
Run, gazelle. Run!

296
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,198
- Wow. This is unbelievable.
- I know.

297
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,703
Okay, this was not on Seinfeld.

298
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,881
Come on,
what's your dad think about all this?

299
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,419
About what?

300
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,669
Well, he must have an opinion.

301
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,847
He used to write for the LA Times
for 23 years.

302
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,341
Somebody did their homework.

303
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,679
I have this thing at work.
It's called Google.

304
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,935
Come on, what's he think about the job?

305
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,190
Actually, I didn't ask him.

306
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,230
Well, then you must know what he'd say.

307
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,362
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that
he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.

308
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,914
Sounds like a really great man.

309
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah, he is.

310
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,878
Hey, do you want to
see something really cool?

311
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,464
I always want to see something really cool.
What...

312
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:34,962
Come on.

313
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,589
Okay.

314
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,261
Only place in the city
you can actually see the stars.

315
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,433
- Wow.
- Yeah.

316
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,769
- It's pretty awesome.
- I know.

317
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,147
I like to come up here to think.

318
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,107
Just when it gets a little too much
for me down there, it's like...

319
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,485
It's like my New York version
of a mountaintop.

320
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,155
Best part, no cell reception.

321
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,819
You take all your recruits up here?

322
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,282
Actually, never really
taken anyone up here.

323
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,459
- Really?
- Yeah.

324
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,081
Thanks.

325
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,413
If you tell anyone about this,
I will rip your ears off

326
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,248
and staple them to your neck.

327
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,176
Everyone in this city seems really violent.

328
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,801
Come on, let's go. One last stop.

329
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,509
- We're just getting comfortable.
- I know you are. Come on, buddy.

330
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,977
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.

331
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,730
- Come on, come on.
- You're showing me Times Square.

332
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,183
- This is not touristy at all!
- Would you shush? Come on.

333
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,605
Do we have to power-walk
everywhere we go?

334
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,982
Yes.

335
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,900
So everybody just kind of walks
wherever they want, then.

336
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,030
How 'bout right here?

337
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,702
- What do you mean?
- We're here.

338
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,168
Oh, my God, it's 1988.

339
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,499
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.

340
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,731
- What is this?
- It's a flash mob.

341
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,318
- Like on Oprah!
- Exactly.

342
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,031
Should we get out of the way?

343
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,246
No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.

344
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,246
- It's pretty damn cool.
- Right?

345
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,377
It's kind of rad.

346
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,376
Do these people get paid for this?

347
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,259
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.

348
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,178
It's nice to feel
like you're a part of something.

349
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,225
New York can be a little
bit lonely at times.

350
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,012
And you're trying to sell me on it.

351
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,390
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.

352
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,730
- Be careful!
- Oh, my God.

353
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,572
- Come down.
- Okay.

354
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,408
- Shit. Get back down.
- Okay.

355
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,882
- I'm in.
- What?

356
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,381
- You sold me.
- Really?

357
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,137
- I'll take the job.
- Oh, my God!

358
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,809
- What, are you surprised?
- No! No. Oh, you are gonna crush it!

359
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,603
Amazing.

360
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,277
- You can all go home now! Thank you!
- Very funny.

361
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,441
Come on.

362
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,277
Congratulations, sell-out!

363
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
Thank you, thank you.

364
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,160
All I'm saying is,
it wasn't so much the pilot's skill

365
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,247
that landed that plane on the river
as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.

366
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,744
Are you saying
that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?

367
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,121
No, no.

368
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,956
There were just other factors.

369
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,962
Are you not an American?

370
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,306
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit
out of my car or what?

371
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,932
I... Yeah.

372
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,149
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.

373
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Fuck.

374
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,470
So, all I ask is that you give me
a little bit of time to gain your trust.

375
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,176
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack
in experience I make up for in cliches.

376
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,844
So, my door is always open.

377
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,353
But seriously, my door is always open.

378
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,238
My first order of business, lighter doors.

379
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,700
- Okay. Thanks, guys.
- Welcome, Dylan.

380
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,238
Hey, man. Tommy Bollinger, sports editor.

381
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,036
Tommy, I've read your articles.
Love your writing.

382
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,791
Just trying to keep it realsies.

383
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,086
Listen, I'd love to take you out one night
and troll for cock.

384
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,589
- What?
- You got some pretty boys out there in LA,

385
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,380
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.

386
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,552
We can tear this shit up.

387
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,217
I'm not gay, Tommy.

388
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,010
Really? I just assumed,
art director and, you know...

389
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,428
Hey. No skin, more pipe for me.

390
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,271
By the way,
doing a piece on racism in hockey.

391
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,517
Love to get your concepts on the font.

392
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,445
I'm thinking Helvetica
but I could be persuaded to Courier New.

393
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,781
But what the fuck do I know?
I'm just the sports editor.

394
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,909
- You sure you're not gay?
- Yep.

395
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,236
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

396
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,034
All right.

397
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

398
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,711
I'd knock, but you don't have a door.

399
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,163
- I don't.
- No.

400
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,418
Hey, check this out.

401
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,924
Dunkin-My- Tits-Hynes. Com.

402
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,261
- Yeah, it really does exist.
- I told you, but not that. This.

403
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,423
Awesome.

404
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,266
But it'd be even more awesome
if this happened.

405
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,265
Wait for it.

406
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,184
Nice!

407
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,391
I got in touch with a guy
who puts flash mobs together.

408
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,817
We're thinking about using them
for guerrilla advertising.

409
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,271
Taking something so pure
and commercializing it?

410
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,064
Knew I found the right guy.

411
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,275
- Here I am.
- Okay. Here's your contract.

412
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,946
Sign it and I will be out of here.

413
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,948
Okay.

414
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,955
A whole year?

415
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,914
Why do I get the feeling this is the first
real commitment you've ever made?

416
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,416
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.

417
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,667
And, fuck, do I regret that one.

418
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,299
Do me a favor. Don't quit or get
fired before the year's up,

419
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,838
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.

420
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,336
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?

421
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,138
- What's the point of this contract?
- Just sign the damn thing.

422
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,469
Okay.

423
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,140
Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper.

424
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,478
Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch.
Do you know a place?

425
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,818
Are you asking me out?

426
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,446
Whoa, I'm not asking you out.

427
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,693
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.

428
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,441
I mean, I'm the only friend you have
in New York.

429
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,777
- You don't wanna complicate that.
- I know. I'm not asking you out.

430
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,862
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around,

431
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,160
- get into some erotic humiliation fantasy.
- Erotic?

432
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,626
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly,
and we'd never speak to each other again.

433
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,328
I'm not fucking asking you out!
I swear to God!

434
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,706
Okay. You don't like me like that.

435
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,999
You don't have to be so mean about it.

436
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,965
I'm sorry. I didn't...

437
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,514
God, you're such a girl.
Come on, it's my treat.

438
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,676
So was it an easy move?

439
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,685
- It was tough leaving my dad.
- Yeah.

440
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,146
My sister gave me some shit.

441
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,390
But timing was right.

442
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,276
Timing was really right.

443
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,571
- Is that your sister?
- No. My ex.

444
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,860
She's great. Loves John Mayer.

445
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,200
Wants us to stay friends.

446
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,410
She's also convinced she can cure me
of my emotional unavailability.

447
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,042
- You're emotionally unavailable?
- Oh, yeah.

448
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,705
Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged.
I haven't seen you at the meetings.

449
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,173
I'm done with the relationship thing.

450
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,468
Girl, you are preaching
to the congregation.

451
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,590
- Choir.
- What?

452
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,380
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed
to preach to the congregation.

453
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,428
- That's the expression.
- Did you understand what I was saying?

454
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,596
Then don't be a dick about it.

455
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,436
Oh, my God. Do you mind?

456
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,351
- Please.
- Great.

457
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,105
Hello. You've reached
Dylan Harper's cell phone.

458
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,977
He's emotionally unavailable,
but if you'd like...

459
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,062
- John fucking Mayer!
- Hello?

460
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,527
Wow. Hello?
You really do have shitty cell service.

461
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,735
- Right?
- Yeah.

462
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,618
I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.

463
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,083
Why don't you come,
and you can meet some new people?

464
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,704
I'm gonna have to check my schedule.
I'm really busy.

465
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,289
I work at GQ now.
It's not some little blog on the Internet.

466
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,797
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,303
- You made it.
- Sorry I'm late.

468
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,094
No, no. Please, come in, come in.
Thank you.

469
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,095
Hey, everybody! Hey!

470
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,269
This here is Dylan. He's from LA.

471
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,890
He's the reason I can afford all this beer.

472
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,773
Okay, all right.

473
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,448
Am I an animal?

474
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,942
Yeah.

475
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,073
Fuck, I'm pretty good at this.

476
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,307
Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street
artist I got into about five years ago.

477
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,645
- His postmodern interpretation...
- This shit is amazing.

478
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,816
I know, right?

479
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,445
You will be able to find the perfect candidate
to fill the position at your company.

480
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,154
Okay, here we go.

481
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,500
First up is Joey Morena,
who's fluent in Vietnamese

482
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,665
and has had 10 years of experience
in the culinary field.

483
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,137
I can't do this any more.

484
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,174
No, I think we both need to go get happy.

485
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,639
It's not adding up to a hundred any more.

486
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,810
Yeah.

487
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,729
Looks like New York's
all out of blueberries.

488
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,230
Goodbye, Flapjack.

489
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,019
Taxi! Taxicab!

490
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,311
Flapjack.

491
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,864
Why do all these movies
have such bad music?

492
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,700
It's so that you know how to feel
every single second.

493
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,905
"I'm heartbroken."

494
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
"I'm getting married
to the man of my dreams."

495
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,661
"I'm sneaking through an office."

496
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,006
Madison, wait!

497
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,426
Madison!

498
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,420
Madison, wait!

499
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,593
Bryce.

500
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,391
How did you know
I was at Grand Central Station?

501
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,352
You're not. You're in Los Angeles,
where this movie was shot.

502
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,226
I know you better than you know yourself.

503
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,191
And your crazy friend Susie
across the hall told me.

504
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,943
Susie.

505
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,196
Why are you here?

506
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,613
To tel/ you that

507
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,609
I love that sunsets make you cry

508
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,078
and I don't care that you failed
your real estate exam,

509
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,619
and I'm glad that you
have a five-date rule.

510
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,784
And that I love you.

511
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,957
Not as much as I love you.

512
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,587
Now boarding, track 5, love.

513
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,427
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.

514
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,551
You know, I'd never have to worry
about my hair,

515
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,389
or having to go to the bathroom.

516
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,976
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,

517
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,433
some guy would chase me down the street,
pour his heart out,

518
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,643
and we'd kiss.

519
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,816
Happily ever after.

520
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,607
I mean, a horse and carriage?

521
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,774
Come on, that is awesome.

522
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,367
Not as awesome as this
ambiguously upbeat pop song

523
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,069
that has nothing to do with the plot

524
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,908
they put in at the end to try to convince you
that you had a great time at this shitty movie.

525
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,953
You know, why don't they ever make a movie
about what happens after the big kiss?

526
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,250
They do. It's called porn.

527
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,250
God, I miss sex.

528
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,628
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it.
It's like...

529
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,639
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.

530
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,800
Why does it always gotta
come with complications?

531
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,802
- And emotions.
- And guilt.

532
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
Guilt.

533
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,681
- It's women's fault.
- What?

534
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,522
You heard me. "Hold me.
Let's spend the rest of our lives together."

535
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,020
Oh, please, you are no better.

536
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,983
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now.
Say my name. Yeah..."

537
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,693
"I'm done. How was I?"

538
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:51,819
Who have you been with?

539
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,825
Why can't it not be like that?

540
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,368
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.

541
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,046
Two people should be able to have sex
like they're playing tennis.

542
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,960
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to
go away for the weekend

543
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,336
after they play tennis.

544
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,711
It's just a game.
You shake hands, get on with your shit.

545
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,174
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

546
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,890
Do you want more beer?

547
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,014
Okay.

548
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,817
- Jamie!
- Yeah?

549
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,112
- Let's play tennis.
- What?

550
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,564
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.

551
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,906
Get the hell out of here.

552
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,694
Don't laugh. This could be great.

553
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,407
This could take all the
weirdness out of it.

554
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,951
Well, we talked about this.
I don't like you like that.

555
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,579
I don't like you like that either.
That's why it's perfect.

556
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,499
I don't even know if I find you attractive.

557
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,704
That's cute.

558
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,422
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.

559
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,167
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?

560
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,672
- That's cute.
- No, no, no.

561
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,220
Before you got to know
my awesome personality.

562
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,380
Strictly physical.

563
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,678
First time you saw me.

564
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,223
- This is just two people talking?
- Yeah.

565
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,724
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.

566
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,395
I liked your eyes. I didn't think
I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.

567
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,529
Your lips. Yeah.
I thought you might be a good kisser.

568
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,031
I am.

569
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,904
- Your breasts.
- What about them?

570
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,326
- They intrigued me.
- Really?

571
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,703
- Yeah.
- I think they're so tiny.

572
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,747
- They're still breasts.
- Thanks.

573
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,454
- I liked your hands.
- Mouth.

574
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,834
- Butt.
- Voice.

575
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:27,961
- Chest.
- Eyes.

576
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,628
- You said that.
- I meant it.

577
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,760
You swear you don't want anything more
from me other than sex?

578
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,599
You swear you don't want anything
more from me?

579
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,266
I know how you girls get.
Tick-took, tick-took.

580
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,433
Stop it.

581
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,443
- What are you doing?
- I'm pulling up my Bible app.

582
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,400
- You have a Bible app?
- Yes. I am a good girl.

583
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,776
- Hand on the iPad.
- Okay.

584
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,277
Wait, no.

585
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,612
Why can't they figure this out?

586
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,112
No... This thing thinks
I'm you and you're me.

587
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,705
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.

588
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,123
- It's actually making me dizzy.
- Hold on.

589
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,666
There we go.

590
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,456
No relationship.

591
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,003
No emotions.

592
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,751
Just sex.

593
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,462
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

594
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,927
- Swear.
- Swear.

595
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,307
Okay.

596
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,318
So I guess we should just start.

597
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,817
Okay.

598
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,982
I'll serve.

599
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,405
That's really...
That's enough of the tennis.

600
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,576
Let's go to the bedroom.

601
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,654
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

602
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,122
The bedroom has better light.

603
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,913
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

604
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,994
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

605
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,167
You have nothing to be insecure about.

606
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,209
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

607
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,301
and you need to just lock that down.

608
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,640
- Your ass is a little bony.
- Much better.

609
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,684
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

610
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,805
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

611
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,436
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

612
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,983
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

613
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,275
I wouldn't have shaved
my legs this morning.

614
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,523
Okie-dokie.

615
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,153
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

616
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,155
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

617
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,577
Great.

618
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,995
I can work with that.

619
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,916
Should be fine.

620
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,250
I can't believe I'm doing this.

621
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,301
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.

622
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,923
I don't know, are we
getting too old for this?

623
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,597
- Sex?
- No, casual sex.

624
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,433
It just, I don't know,
feels a little collegey.

625
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,560
- I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
- Okay.

626
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,475
- That's not Third Eye Blind.
- I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

627
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,605
Nope.

628
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,573
- What's wrong?
- We're just doing this once.

629
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,862
- I totally agree.
- Okay.

630
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,158
- Great.
- Great.

631
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,451
Little faster.

632
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,571
- More circular.
- Watch my chin.

633
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,080
- Touch my ears.
- Okay.

634
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,959
Kiss my neck.

635
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,628
- Say my name.
- Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

636
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
Not my full name.

637
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,088
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

638
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,253
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

639
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,251
Oh, my God, you're really...

640
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:24,593
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,
J, K, L, M, N, O, P...

641
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,060
- Dylan, I...
- Relax.

642
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,308
Just a friend going down on another friend.

643
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,147
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

644
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,441
What, what?

645
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,697
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

646
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,149
- I'm good at this.
- Says who?

647
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,616
Every girl I've been with.

648
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,111
Well, they're either lying
or their vaginas are made out of burlap.

649
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,120
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

650
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,948
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

651
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,244
- A little to the right.
- Okay.

652
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,079
- A little bit more to the left.
- Roger that.

653
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,630
- Now go down.
- Here we go.

654
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,258
- A little more... Whoa, too far!
- Sorry.

655
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,257
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!

656
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,842
When women start to scream,
it could be misconstrued.

657
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,435
Just keep going!

658
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,025
Yeah, you know it.

659
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,823
Well, let me tell you how I like it.

660
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
See, most girls think
you should start off soft,

661
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,292
but if you just get in,
really go for it, ..

662
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,507
Yeah, you know it.

663
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,954
- Let's go with Obama.
- No, no, no, no!

664
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,873
It's too easy, too predictable.
Go with Shaun.

665
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,871
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

666
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,873
- I hear he's kind of a jerk.
- No, he's not.

667
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,087
You're just threatened by him

668
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,631
because he's the greatest snow
sport athlete in the universe

669
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,678
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

670
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,927
Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

671
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,095
Okay, thanks.

672
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,514
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

673
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,180
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.

674
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,605
He's got ears like an elephant.

675
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,895
That's not the part of
an elephant you want.

676
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,063
- Hi!
- Hi.

677
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,277
Sorry to just show up like this.

678
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,569
No, no, no, it's fine.

679
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,409
So...

680
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,246
- Wanna take a walk?
- Love to.

681
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,627
Great. Okay.

682
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,713
Okay, so about what happened, I...

683
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,672
- It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
- Exactly. No, no, exactly.

684
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,006
I mean, it is so not me.

685
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,091
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

686
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,762
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

687
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,106
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but...

688
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,100
Really?

689
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,149
Look, to think that you and I
could just have sex

690
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,443
and without it compromising anything
was just so...

691
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,903
- Misguided.
- Exactly.

692
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,492
I was gonna call you this morning.

693
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,781
But you didn't.

694
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,945
But I didn't.

695
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,285
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really...

696
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,703
I just don't want it to.

697
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,829
It's not going to.

698
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,829
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really...

699
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,752
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

700
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,292
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

701
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,097
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that
every time you curse, you blink.

702
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,642
- Like your body's rejecting the word.
- It does not.

703
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,801
- Fuck you.
- Blinked.

704
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,644
- No, I didn't fucking blink.
- Blinked again.

705
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,430
- Shit.
- Ah, didn't blink.

706
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,106
"Shit" you're okay with.

707
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,188
- It was stupid.
- Yes.

708
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,188
- We're friends, let's stay friends.
- Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

709
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,438
Me neither.

710
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,647
- Great.
- Fantastic.

711
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,612
Portrait for the lovely couple?

712
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,785
- What the hell are we doing?
- I don't know.

713
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,335
- Rub my hair.
- Kiss my neck.

714
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,506
- Watch my nipple.
- All right, all right.

715
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,010
- I didn't know you had a tattoo.
- Yeah.

716
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,465
Why didn't I notice that before?

717
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050
Because we were drunk.

718
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,143
- Was it your dog?
- No. Never had one.

719
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,394
But everyone else did.

720
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,184
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

721
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,978
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

722
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,980
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

723
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,652
of the most conventional thing
you could think of.

724
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,354
It was super awesome back then.

725
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,654
- Check it.
- Okay.

726
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,107
- A lightning bolt?
- Eighteen.

727
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,407
- Wanted superpowers.
- Yeah.

728
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,236
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

729
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,955
- Were you also gay back then?
- Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

730
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,828
- Okay.
- Are you sure about this?

731
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,954
- Are you?
- No.

732
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,205
Me neither.

733
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,883
- How was your day?
- It was okay.

734
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,218
- I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.
- How was that?

735
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,053
It wasn't that good. How was your day?

736
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,548
Still trying to figure out that
subway system. It is tricky.

737
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,886
And it's out of here!

738
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,898
- My butt.
- What?

739
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,565
- Oh, my butt.
- Really?

740
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:31,823
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping.
Can you grab a pillow?

741
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,115
Okay, yeah, yeah.

742
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,240
- So, no butt?
- No.

743
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,208
- Really? Already?
- Just kidding.

744
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,420
- Do you like this position?
- Yeah, it's all right.

745
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,262
I gotta be honest, I feel
a little emasculated.

746
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,138
A naked girl is lying on top of you
and you feel emasculated?

747
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,687
- Little bit.
- You do know what that word means, right?

748
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,810
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.

749
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,104
Okay, all right, you big baby.

750
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,394
- Chinese fire drill.
- Okay. Go!

751
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,776
Okay.

752
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,076
- Do you feel manly now?
- I do.

753
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,494
Okay. Put it in.

754
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,947
That's not funny.

755
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,783
- It's kind of funny.
- It's kind of funny.

756
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,459
- Hold on.
- What's wrong?

757
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,581
I have to go to the bathroom.

758
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,008
- What? Now?
- Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.

759
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,350
What's going on in there?

760
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,098
Do you know how hard it is
to pee with a hard-on?

761
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,228
No, actually.

762
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,605
It's like two lanes of traffic
merging into one. It takes time.

763
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,776
- Are you pooping?
- No.

764
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,987
- Why are you sitting down?
- It's easier to control.

765
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,994
- You want a mess in here?
- No. No, no. Sorry.

766
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,175
Yeah.

767
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,010
Yup...

768
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,226
What? Did I leak?

769
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,345
Did you wash your hands?

770
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,892
Oh, come on, dude.

771
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,640
I know we're just friends,
but I'm still a lady.

772
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,360
Now get back in there, wash your hands
and then bring that fine ass back here.

773
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,026
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'm not gonna come back.

774
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,572
- My hammies are killing me.
- Have a banana, they're in the fridge.

775
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,074
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?

776
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,538
- It dries them out.
- It doesn't. They have a peel.

777
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,161
It's not armor. Air still gets in.

778
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,496
Do you want a banana or not?

779
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,080
Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.

780
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,879
At least I have food in the house.

781
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,840
All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.

782
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,171
I like to drink my yogurt.
It's a timesaver.

783
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,724
Well, then you think you could use
that time to shave your stubble.

784
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,309
Your whiskers are like knives.

785
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:08,059
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend,
I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

786
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,565
And because you're just my buddy,
I can tell you

787
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,404
that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

788
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,492
Hey, hey. Hey...

789
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,115
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

790
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,120
My eyes are covered.
I don't know what you're doing.

791
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,914
I can't see you putting on
your black underpants.

792
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,002
Jamie, baby, I missed you.

793
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,421
On, baby.

794
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,924
Did your boobs get bigger?
Mom, I'm over here.

795
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,051
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.

796
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,973
- What are you doing here?
- Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.

797
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,601
L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
"Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."

798
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,970
Victor, her fiancÃ©.

799
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,471
Ex-fiancÃ©.

800
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,644
- What happened?
- Nothing. He was just blah.

801
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,607
I mean, nice, but it was
like talking to dirt.

802
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,444
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna..."
I'm Lorna.

803
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,281
- Dylan.
- I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss."

804
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,366
- "Just because you're 39..."
- Forty-eight.

805
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,070
"...It doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

806
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,030
So I caught the first plane off the island.

807
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,787
- Cleveland's not an island.
- Oh, baby, it is.

808
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,744
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.

809
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,250
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.

810
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,207
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

811
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,167
- That's right, we're just friends.
- I love it.

812
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,670
It's like the '70s in here.

813
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,635
That was a better time. Just sex.

814
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,805
A little grass, a little glue...
Not during pregnancy.

815
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,599
Well, not during the final trimester.

816
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,180
But no complications. It's great!

817
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,854
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess,
what this is.

818
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,314
That's exactly what this is.

819
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,278
So my daughter is just your slampiece?

820
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,322
No, no. "Slampiece"?

821
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

822
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,113
Have fun. I think this is great.

823
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,820
The only thing is, it
takes you off the market.

824
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,954
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

825
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,783
is to buy the produce,
which you already got.

826
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,997
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

827
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,998
I'm starving. You got any gin?

828
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,959
It's in the kitchen.

829
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,507
You gotta go.

830
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,306
- Is she wearing Axe body spray?
- I don't know. Come on.

831
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,679
Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

832
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
- That is terrible, Mother.
- Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.

833
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,181
What? You said that he was Greek.

834
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,815
- Potato, potato...
- Get your shoes.

835
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,439
- Okay. All right.
- Well, not... Just go, just go.

836
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,065
I'll just put these on on the bike?

837
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,233
- Yeah.
- Okay.

838
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,901
It was nice to have met you...

839
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,615
- Hey.
- And your pants are coming off.

840
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,739
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!

841
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,029
Back, back!

842
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,919
That's what I'm talking about!

843
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,206
We're kicking every gay ass out here!

844
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,758
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

845
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,376
Hold it. Any of you gay?

846
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,045
- Not even you?
- Come on, man.

847
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,263
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

848
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,098
I might be able to let you see some reason.

849
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,015
Look at you in the house!

850
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,224
Come on, baby!

851
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,852
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.

852
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,609
Who's that, that headhunter?

853
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,198
What, you guys going out now?

854
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,901
No, no, no, we're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

855
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,994
- What do you mean?
- Sleeping together.

856
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,366
But it's just sex.

857
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,073
That never works, bro.

858
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,918
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

859
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,168
Jamie's different.

860
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,838
Does she have a penis
where most girls have a vagina?

861
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,586
- No penis.
- Then she's no different.

862
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,292
What do you know about women, anyway?

863
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,091
Dude, I've turned down more tail
than you'll ever have.

864
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,303
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

865
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,259
But the offers still keep rolling
in, naturally. Look at me.

866
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:38,640
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful,
majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.

867
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,736
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

868
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,572
And if I had a choice,
I would be with women to my dying day.

869
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,821
But me likes cock so I'm
strict-aly dick-aly.

870
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,246
So it's always just about sex, then?

871
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,666
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

872
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,288
You know what I discovered?

873
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,045
It's not who you want to spend
Friday night with,

874
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,589
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

875
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,756
Feel me, Felix?

876
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,177
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

877
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,096
It's okay, you don't get it.

878
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,511
It's no big deal. But you will.

879
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,099
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

880
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

881
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,860
- Like a fish...
- Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

882
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
Yeah, you don't.

883
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,356
Nice work on that new online site,
by the way.

884
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
What was the font on that headline?

885
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,700
It was Times Roman.

886
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,116
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

887
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,707
You have a boat?

888
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,169
I live in Jersey.
And I ain't taking no ferry.

889
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,709
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.

890
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
- Hey.
- Yeah.

891
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,445
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

892
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,196
Kudos, baby, kudos.

893
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,036
It's not that big of a deal.

894
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,161
It's just surprising. I always thought
you were a true-love kind of girl.

895
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,539
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

896
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,545
That's what I thought back in '78.

897
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,672
And every year since.

898
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,258
I'm just... I'm flattered, actually.

899
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,343
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

900
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,009
It's just surprising.

901
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,225
- There, done. It's... There we go.
- Okay.

902
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

903
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,728
- Yeah!
- Really?

904
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,234
- Yeah.
- Okay.

905
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,196
Hey, my friend gave me his house
in Montauk for July 4th.

906
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,195
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

907
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,073
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie.

908
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,410
When was the last time
we spent a full weekend together?

909
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

910
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,792
- Demitri.
- Bill.

911
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,253
He reminded me a lot of your father.

912
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,923
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

913
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,883
- My father was Russian?
- I don't remember.

914
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
But what I do remember is we drank
a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

915
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,757
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game
is getting really old.

916
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,601
I know I haven't been
the best mother in the world...

917
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,064
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

918
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,393
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

919
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,070
Come on. Come on.

920
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,323
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

921
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
- Mom...
- I was trying to bond!

922
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
It was either this or sniff glue.

923
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,251
- Sorry about my mom.
- I thought she was funny.

924
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,133
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

925
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,803
and she's hilarious
when she needs a place to stay.

926
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

927
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen, I think we should stop this.

928
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,448
Yeah?

929
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,195
I kind of think you're right.

930
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
Right?

931
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:24,033
Every new beginning
comes from some other beginning's end.

932
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,916
That actually makes sense right here.

933
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,960
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind
could be so prophetic?

934
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,161
Not Third Eye Blind.

935
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,005
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

936
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

937
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,499
- Yes.
- Okay.

938
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,301
- You're buying.
- What?

939
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,637
Okay.

940
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
- Pants.
- Shirt.

941
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,847
So this is the end of this?

942
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
- I guess so. But it's good.
- Yeah.

943
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
- And we did it.
- With no bullshit.

944
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,560
- Shirt.
- Sweater.

945
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,316
We managed to actually stay friends.

946
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,810
- Yup.
- Yeah.

947
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,029
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

948
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,193
No, I don't have a type.

949
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,579
- It's more about what's inside.
- Oh, please!

950
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,414
Okay, what about her?

951
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,038
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

952
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,206
And she's reading a book.

953
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,333
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

954
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,669
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- What?

955
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
What do you mean, "What?"
We said we wanted to date again.

956
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,715
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Now?

957
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,337
Here, in front of all of these people?

958
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

959
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,393
Excuse me. I'm Dylan. Nice to meet you.

960
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,015
The Notebook.

961
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,564
Nice meeting you.

962
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,825
- Well?
- We talked. We laughed.

963
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,030
Yeah.

964
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,411
- She's Belgian.
- Explains the reading.

965
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,163
I showed her where the balcony was,

966
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,916
because that's where
she is meeting up with her husband.

967
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,086
Anniversary trip to New York.

968
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,378
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

969
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,550
Shut up.

970
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,432
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

971
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,268
Fine. I'll go next.

972
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,938
- See if I still have game.
- Okay.

973
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

974
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,024
- Yes.
- Right here. Eleven o'clock.

975
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,860
- Iced coffee.
- Handsome, but doesn't know it.

976
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,444
Staring at a tree, which means
he's actually in the park for nature

977
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,116
and not to watch women sunbathe.

978
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,867
- Or he's retarded.
- Don't care.

979
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,069
I'm going in.

980
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,377
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

981
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,961
- Hi.
- Hello.

982
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,751
I'm Jamie.

983
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,626
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

984
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,629
Hi.

985
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,136
Okay.

986
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God!

987
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,894
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

988
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,817
And I have a date this Saturday.

989
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,319
- Nice.
- Thank you.

990
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,947
Why'd you wave to me?

991
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,408
I told him you were my gay best friend,

992
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,239
so he wants to set you up with his brother.

993
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,792
College, med school,
and I haven't slept since.

994
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,206
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.

995
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,542
Well, me and God.

996
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,844
- What?
- I'm kidding.

997
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,673
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

998
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,845
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

999
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,676
- Cancer doctors?
- No, assholes.

1000
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,390
Yeah.

1001
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,683
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.

1002
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,351
Although, I gotta warn you,
lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.

1003
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,477
- Really?
- Yeah.

1004
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,484
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.

1005
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,404
While they're doing this,
a little bit of that.

1006
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,027
Hey.

1007
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,700
Thank you.

1008
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,581
When can I see you again?

1009
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
Right now.

1010
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
- I'm just kidding.
- Okay.

1011
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,379
Can you imagine
someone who would actually say that?

1012
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,711
I played the tuba in high school.

1013
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
World's stupidest instrument.

1014
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,097
Especially when you move eight times.

1015
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,886
- Why'd you move?
- My mom really likes to break up with guys,

1016
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,429
and she was really good at it.

1017
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,848
- Was your dad one of them?
- No, no, he was long before that.

1018
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,561
I actually never knew my dad.

1019
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,268
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1020
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,573
All right, look, I think I should
probably tell you something.

1021
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,199
Please don't tell me you're a dude.

1022
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,527
Because that'll be like the third time
since I moved here,

1023
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,237
and I don't think I can handle that.

1024
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,576
I have a five-date rule.

1025
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,079
- You know, like, five dates before we...
- Yeah.

1026
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,957
I saw it in a movie.
I thought I'd give it a try.

1027
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,293
You're worth waiting for.

1028
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,257
I'm sure that was the line
in the movie you saw.

1029
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,086
That's awesome.

1030
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,052
This four-year-old that I've been
working on for the last couple months,

1031
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,303
he's gonna be fine.

1032
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,762
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1033
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,219
How is a guy like you single?

1034
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,306
I've just been waiting for someone
to come up to me in the park

1035
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,941
and compliment me for looking at the trees
and not the sunbathers.

1036
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,435
I meant it. It was impressive.

1037
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,562
Actually, if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you,

1038
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,363
I was sleeping standing up.

1039
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,567
I worked 36 hours straight.
I don't even know how I got to the park.

1040
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,827
How is a girl like you single?

1041
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,905
I have issues.

1042
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,661
One might even call me damaged.

1043
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,493
Actually, one did call me damaged.

1044
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,743
Get out of here. Damaged how?

1045
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,669
I kind of believe in true love.

1046
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,923
That there might be
a Prince Charming out there for me.

1047
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:35,226
Listen, I know this is probably a no
because all you do is work like a dull boy,

1048
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,645
but would you like to come get a beer?

1049
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,762
I'm good.

1050
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,598
No, it's not a gay bar.

1051
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,652
And there'll be just as many hot girls
as hot guys.

1052
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,031
You know what? I will come out.

1053
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,942
All right. Let's find you a lady.

1054
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,111
You're still not gay, right?

1055
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,491
- Nope.
- Okay.

1056
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,000
- What?
- Do you know what today is?

1057
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,336
- Date number five.
- I wasn't even counting.

1058
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,640
- Wanna go in the bedroom?
- No. Here's fine.

1059
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,190
I am so glad I met you tonight.

1060
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,229
Me, too.

1061
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,031
What are you thinking?

1062
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,155
Just how great you are.

1063
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,168
Annie, hey.

1064
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,591
Who the fuck is Annie?

1065
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,925
My sister.

1066
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,045
Better be. I'll cut her.

1067
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,719
Of course I'm coming.

1068
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,225
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off,
so I'll be there for three days.

1069
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,524
Yeah. How's Dad?

1070
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,401
Any worse?

1071
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,866
All right, tell him I said hi.

1072
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,239
Bye, Banannie.

1073
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,253
I want you to meet my parents.

1074
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,793
No, you... Really?

1075
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,593
God!

1076
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,993
Hey. Hold on, hold on.

1077
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,238
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.

1078
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,120
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.

1079
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,458
Shit. Shit. Just hold Oh.

1080
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,751
- Oh, sorry.
- Hold on.

1081
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,423
I was out pretty late last night.

1082
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,673
When I got in, you and your girlfriend
were on the couch

1083
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,340
so I just crashed in your bed.

1084
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,135
- He's not a girl.
- He smells like a girl.

1085
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,516
- You smelled him?
- I wanna buy marshmallows.

1086
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,226
- What did you say?
- For Montauk this weekend.

1087
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,101
I wanna do a campfire,
like when you were little.

1088
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,272
Okay.

1089
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,317
- And then we're gonna look for sticks.
- I hear you. Sticks.

1090
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,313
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna...

1091
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,447
Just hold on a second.

1092
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,612
Okay.

1093
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,865
Okay.

1094
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,083
What's up?

1095
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,127
Do you think guys care more
about global warming

1096
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,626
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?

1097
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,831
We/I, that depends.

1098
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,630
Do you have a hot model in a bikini
standing on an icecap?

1099
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,427
No. Ski slope.

1100
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,471
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.

1101
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,177
Yeah, me, too.

1102
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,514
How's your boy Parker?
Still staring at trees?

1103
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,888
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

1104
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,231
but this time it's
actually in my apartment.

1105
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,726
- It's the fifth date already?
- Maybe. Thank you.

1106
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,569
Did you guys "fifth-date""?

1107
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,361
- How dare you! A lady never tells.
- I know. That's why I'm asking you.

1108
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,746
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great
trip in LA and call me when you land.

1109
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,198
Okay.

1110
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,745
Parker.

1111
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,705
Hey.

1112
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,838
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

1113
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,041
- I gotta get going.
- What?

1114
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,418
I thought you weren't on call today.

1115
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,843
I'm not, but I got that thing...
I got stuff.

1116
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,548
This... They just called me.

1117
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,518
- Really?
- Yeah.

1118
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,897
The sneak-out.
How incredibly clichÃ© of you.

1119
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,390
I just...

1120
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,268
I don't think I can be
your Prince Charming.

1121
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,237
God, you totally didn't get
anything that I was saying, did you?

1122
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,699
- No, no, no. I think you're great.
- Yeah, you, too.

1123
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,697
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

1124
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,778
- Really?
- No, go fuck yourself.
