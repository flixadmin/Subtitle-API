And I brought help.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000

Time for domination.

Such an insolent boy. How is he moving?

Good question.

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000

It was a fairly simple task
to revive them,

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
given my magic combined
with the power of the Imperial Sword.

keep getting tougher and tougher.

348
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The kids have greatly improved though.

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Maybe. They've still got plenty to learn.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It’ll be awhile before they can
hold their own without holding me back.

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
[groaning]

352
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
[sighs] My apologies
for not being able to contain them.

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Please. You’re doing the best you can.

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks to you, I had time
to send my guys out on an errand.

355
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
[Conrad] You’re wasting energy
trying to oppose me.

356
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When the Imperial Sword’s magic
is activated,

357
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the Clover Kingdom will be gone.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
[Yami] Haven’t you had
any better ideas in the last ten years?

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So the Imperial Sword? That's the one
that can absorb magic power.

360
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Stores it 'til the wielder’s
ready to release it, right?

361
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

362
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
[Julius] Certainly. If he unleashes
all the stored-up magic at once.

363
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He’s already collected power
from every person who was at this stadium.

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The blade must be humming with it.

365
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And with his magic,

366
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
he can misuse the sword's ability
to no end, bringing ruin to our kingdom.

367
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
"Misuse"?

368
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm using the sword
to save this broken world.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'd say it's the perfect use, myself.

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
[dramatic music playing]

371
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm here now, Wizard King.

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We successfully evacuated
everyone in the audience.

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Now we can safely defeat <i>them</i>.

374
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Fuegoleon and Nozel.
I do hope you’ve gotten stronger.

375
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
[scoffs] I never expected
I’d be in a situation

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
where I’d have to fight
this monster again.

377
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ah, I almost forgot
how Nozel got so spooked the last time

378
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that he cried and crapped his pants.

379
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Another word
and I’ll drown you in mercury.

380
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So who're the friends
he brought along this time? They’re new.

381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
[Fuegoleon] The woman is capable
of producing magic soldiers.

382
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
My grandfather’s journal
spoke of this power.

383
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I remember it well because my sister
found it captivating.

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
-[Kaiser] Not good.
-[Nozel] They’re figures from the past.

385
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Leaders who died long ago.

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
[Yami] Wait. You're tellin' me some actual
Wizard Kings have come back to life?!

387
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
In that case, I bet I could make a killing
selling their autographs.

388
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
[girl] Former Wizard Kings
have been revived?!

389
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I’m awake for a change,
but this feels like a dream.

390
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It’s way too crazy!

391
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
[chuckling] This is filling
my brush with inspiration.

392
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Then again, maybe now’s not the time
to be painting.

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
[music ends]

394
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You’ve managed to gather
a formidable force, but this ends here.

395
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
[grunts]

396
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
[church organ music playing]

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
[gasping nervously]

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
[Conrad] There are countless points
across the land where veins of mana

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
intersect and interact with each other.

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This location happens to be one of them.

401
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ten years ago, I altered the arena

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and turned it into a weapon
of my own design.

403
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But you people interrupted me
before I could activate it.

404
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
[music becomes solemn]

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
[groaning]

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
[groaning softly]

407
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
[both groan]

408
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
[Conrad] Festival Stadium.

409
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Also known as Triumph, my flying fortress.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There’s no way for you to escape now.

411
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Julius, it’s time I make up for the years
you stole when you sealed me away.

412
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
[music fades out]

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
[all gasping softly]

414
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
[Finral] We made it.
Welcome to Branch Zero.

415
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
[wind howling]

416
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey!

417
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's up?
This is Asta from the Black Bulls!

418
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The Wizard King sent me!

419
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
-Let's get these doors open!
-It’s not gonna work.

420
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This lab is a well-kept secret.

421
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Only a handful of nobles
even know it exists.

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magical power.

423
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
[gasping]

424
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And you are?

425
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Ah, you must be the Black Bulls.

426
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm branch coordinator Millie Maxwell.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

427
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Come. This way.

428
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
-Right!
-We've been briefed.

429
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's quite the situation.

430
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm going to let
someone else take it from here.

431
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
[gasps softly, gulps]

432
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
[Millie] She’ll be happy
to show you around.

433
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
[Asta] Nero!

434
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
[Nero] The magic tool Julius needs
is down below.

435
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Stored in the depths
of this facility for safe keeping.

436
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Sally is making some adjustments to it.

437
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This could be my greatest experiment!

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
[chuckles] So Sally's here too.

439
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Nero, you’ve been observing
the Clover Kingdom for centuries, right?

440
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
At least 500 years if I'm not mistaken.

441
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So does that mean you recognize
the people who attacked the stadium?

442
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
[Nero] I don’t know the details,
but I can confirm a few things for you.

443
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
-The mastermind is Conrad Leto.
-Huh?

444
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
[Nero] I assume
you’ve at least heard his name before.

445
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Conrad was the--

446
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
-Wait, you don’t mean…
-[Asta] Uh-huh.

447
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
[Nero] Yes.

448
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He was once a Magic Knight
of the Clover Kingdom.

449
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And Julius Novachrono’s predecessor.

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The previous Wizard King.

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
-[gasps]
-Hold on.

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Didn't that guy get sick?
He's been dead for almost ten years.

453
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I’ll explain what I can. Get on.

454
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Conrad Leto was the 27th Wizard King.

455
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Even before he was chosen for this role,

456
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
he was known as one of
the most powerful men in the kingdom.

457
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
<i>He quickly became</i>
<i>a captain in the Magic Knights.</i>

458
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>And, as you might expect,</i>
<i>his squad was praised for their successes.</i>

459
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>The citizens of the land trusted him.</i>

460
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>And given his abilities</i>
<i>and the respect he garnered,</i>

461
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
<i>it was no surprise</i>
<i>he was named the Wizard King.</i>

462
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
<i>However, something changed inside him.</i>

463
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>He rebelled against the kingdom and,</i>
<i>as a result, was stripped of his title.</i>

464
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
[Noelle] <i>What do you mean, "he rebelled"?</i>

465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
[Nero] <i>He tried to destroy the nation.</i>

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
No way! The Wizard King’s job
is to protect peace!

467
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Why would he try
to do something so terrible?

468
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
[Nero] I have no idea.

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What we do know is this.

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
<i>His plan relied</i>
<i>on the Imperial Sword, Elsdocia.</i>

471
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
<i>A magic item that belonged</i>
<i>to Lord Lumiere, the first Wizard King.</i>

472
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
<i>When Julius and the others</i>
<i>learned of this plot,</i>

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
<i>they stopped Conrad by sealing him.</i>

474
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
[Finral] Intense.

475
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
[Nero] They then announced
that he died of an illness,

476
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
so the kingdom wouldn't panic.

477
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Keep in mind
that Julius couldn't defeat him,

478
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
even with the help
of the most elite Magic Knights.

479
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
As such, he had no choice
but to use his Time Magic on Conrad

480
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to keep him locked away and out of sight
so he couldn’t harm anybody.

481
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
[Noelle] I get it, he's incredibly strong.
What magic does he use?

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
[Nero] Key Magic.

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It grants him the ability to create keys

484
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that can open or close rifts
out of thin air.

485
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The magic space behind these doors
is able to absorb whatever Conrad wishes.

486
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Tools, grimoires…

487
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Magic itself.

488
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Seriously?

489
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Wait, wait. You mean…

490
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Correct.

491
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He has the ability
to steal a person’s magic.

492
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And after, he can use it
however he pleases.

493
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
[elevator thuds]

494
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Sealing Magic: Release!

495
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
[suspenseful music playing]

496
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
[chuckles nervously]
So how far down are we going?

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Their security is extreme.

498
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes. Patience. We're almost there.

499
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
[music becomes quirky]

500
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
[Nero] This is the innermost part
of Branch Zero.

501
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Here we store and research

502
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the most important
magic tools in our catalog.

503
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I get the feeling we were asked
to bring back something pretty rare, huh?

504
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
[Nero] Indeed. It's something
Prince Lumiere was developing

505
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to control the power
of the Imperial Sword.

506
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You could think of it
as a sheath for Elsdocia.

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It’s still a prototype, but with any luck,
we can use it to seal Conrad again.

508
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
-[Finral gasps]
-He's here?

509
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
[Conrad] When I heard you were
after something Lumiere worked on,

510
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
my interest was piqued.

511
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But this is a useless trinket.

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
-No, don't!
-Sally!

513
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
[groans]

514
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
[Asta] Demon Slayer!

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
-[exclaims indistinctly]
-[groans]

516
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
-[Finral] No!
-Oh?

517
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
[groans, grunts]

518
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
[groans]

519
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
[yelps]

520
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
[groans]

521
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
-Finral?!
-[groaning]

522
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
[groans]

523
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I know you.

524
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
[Asta groans]

525
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
[Nero] How did you find us?

526
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
[scoffs] Secré Swallowtail.

527
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yet another Mage
from the Black Bulls Squad.

528
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Your fellow members are Asta,
Noelle Silva, and Finral Roulacase.

529
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Memory Exchange Magic makes it easy
to see what other people have experienced.

530
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Invading a person's privacy
is a bit distasteful,

531
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
but it allowed me to locate this place.

532
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
[Noelle] <i>Marx’s magic!</i>

533
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
[Conrad] Shall I show you
what's happening?

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
[all gasp]

535
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
[dramatic music playing]

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
[woman] Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
surrender immediately,

538
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and offer your magical power as a tribute.
Resistance is futile.

539
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My Legion Magic soldiers

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
will keep on fighting
until their last bit of energy is spent!

541
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
[Conrad] <i>One of the former</i>
<i>Wizard Kings, Princia.</i>

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
<i>The Imperial Sword is supplying her</i>
<i>with the magical power it has stored</i>

543
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
<i>meaning she essentially has no limits.</i>

544
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
<i>The Magic Knights</i>
<i>have been completely wiped out.</i>

545
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
<i>And we’ve taken control of every citizen</i>
<i>and strategic facility in the kingdom.</i>

546
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
-[music stops]
-It can't be.

547
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Impressive, no?

548
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So many. So fast.

549
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't imagine that you're being invaded
by a paltry swarm of magic soldiers.

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Princia can summon armies comparable
to those of even the strongest nations.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
As for those powerful mages
who helped you escape…

552
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
-[solemn tone plays]
-Captain Yami!

553
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
[solemn tone plays]

554
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
[Conrad] They're resting now, fast asleep.
They’ll resist no more.

555
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
All those people at the stadium.

556
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
[Noelle] Nozel. Brother?

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's right.
You're the youngest Silva daughter.

558
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Progeny of Acier Silva,

559
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the renowned Steel War Princess.

560
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What a pathetic turn of events
for your brother to fall

561
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
before his little sister.

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
To think that such a coward

563
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
was allowed to be a captain
of the Magic Knights!

564
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
[scoffs, shouts] Sea Dragon’s Roar!

565
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
[dramatic music playing]

566
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
-[loud crash]
-[Noelle shrieks]

567
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
-Noelle! Dammit, I'm coming!
-[stone crumbling]

568
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You’ve much yet to learn,

569
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
but the purity
of your magic is impressive.

570
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I believe I’ll take it.

571
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
[Noelle gasps]

572
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
[smugly] Hmm. The profound difference
in our abilities

573
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
makes this such an easy task.

574
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
[music subsides]

575
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
[weakly] I can feel my magic flowing out.

576
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
[voice quavers, sobs]

577
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Bastard. What did you do to her?

578
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Perhaps it's better to show you.

579
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
<i>Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!</i>

580
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
[Asta grunts]

581
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's true, he stole Noelle's magic.

582
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
-Give it back!
-[dramatic music playing]

583
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
[groans]

584
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You're gonna wish you'd stayed sealed!

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Fascinating. So this is Anti-Magic
in action, is it?

586
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
[Asta grunts]

587
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
[Conrad] Hmm.

588
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
[grunting, groaning]

589
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Uh!

590
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
[groaning]

591
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
[yells with effort]

592
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
[music intensifies]

593
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
[groans]

594
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
-[groans]
-[music subsides]

595
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Demon Destroyer!

596
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
[grunts]

597
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What a wonderful power you possess!

598
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It can nullify not only magic

599
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
but also any phenomena
that is derived from magic.

600
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I’d like to take this ability as well,

601
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
but perhaps I’ll refrain
for the time being.

602
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I wouldn’t want it
to affect anything I have stored.

603
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let’s have a little chat.

604
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
After all, you and I
are walking a similar path.

605
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You really are nuts.
I am nothing like you!

606
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
[Conrad] The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia
is a magic tool

607
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that was developed
by Lumiere a long time ago.

608
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It happens to be perfectly compatible
with my Key Magic.

609
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
<i>The sword was created</i>
<i>to preserve exceptional magic</i>

610
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>of great mages and heroes</i>
<i>as a legacy for future generations.</i>

611
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
<i>You see, it has not only</i>
<i>the power and wisdom</i>

612
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
<i>of every Wizard King stored inside it</i>
<i>but a piece of their souls as well.</i>

613
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>Are you starting to understand?</i>

614
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
<i>This weapon can absorb,</i>
<i>stockpile, and unleash</i>

615
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
<i>an absurd amount</i>
<i>of magical power all at once.</i>

616
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>With it, I will combine</i>
<i>the generations of Wizard Kings' magic</i>

617
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>with the various types of magic I stole</i>
<i>and create a Gargantuan Compound Magic!</i>

618
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
<i>Once that power is in my hands,</i>

619
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>I'll drive it into one of the mana veins</i>
<i>pulsing throughout this land.</i>

620
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
<i>Disaster will be magnificent!</i>

621
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
<i>The foundation of the continent</i>
<i>will be destroyed</i>,

622
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
<i>and every single citizen will perish.</i>

623
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But don't you worry yourself,

624
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the Imperial Sword
can also store the souls of the departed.

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I will select the worthy

626
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and bring back only those who deserve
to inherit the world that I have created!

627
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know people loathed me
because of my magic,

628
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I’ve seen it in their memories.

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Trust me when I say
I know what you must feel.

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Those with magical power
own everything in this society,

631
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and those without it die in the squalor.

632
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Isn’t this world unbearable, Asta?

633
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Shouldn’t we destroy it and start anew?

634
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Join me, and we’ll shape
a new reality together.

635
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
One where people have esteem
for their fellow man.

636
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
-Where they can't help but smile.
-[growls]

637
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Everyone should respect each other
and get along great and laugh together.

638
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
One day, when I become the Wizard King,
I’ll create that world.

639
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Shut up!

640
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
-That's bullshit!
-[metal music playing]

641
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The Wizard King
is supposed to protect his people!

642
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
To make sure
everyone in the nation is safe and happy.

643
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I will not let you destroy this world!

644
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It’s not something
a real king would ever do!

645
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You cannot stop me.

646
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The dregs of this society
are forced to lead lives devoid of worth.

647
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You’ve seen it.

648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But I can give meaning to their existence.

649
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
[angrily] Why can't you see that?

650
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Every single thing you've said is crazy.

651
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't understand any of it at all!

652
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You don't realize
how broken this civilization is.

653
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What a pity.

654
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I said, "Shut up!"
How can anyone be so selfish? [yells]

655
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
[music abruptly fades out]

656
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
-Why can’t you understand?!
-[dramatic music playing]

657
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I know the things you’ve experienced.

658
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The inequality. The betrayal.
The country is against you.

659
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
[groaning]

660
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You must choose, Asta.

661
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You can walk this path with me…

662
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
[grunts]

663
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
…or disappear forever.

664
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
[music intensifies]

665
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
[Astor screams]

666
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
[jingling getting closer]

667
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
[gasping shakily]

668
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
[Conrad] Give up this fight already.

669
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
We <i>are </i>alike.
Accept that, and stand at my side.

670
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The fusion of magic
will be completed by dawn tomorrow.

671
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That’s your deadline. Your last chance.

672
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
[breathing shakily]
You have to give Noelle

673
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
her magic back

674
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
-That’s your concern?
-[Asta gasping shakily]

675
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
[Conrad] Know that
I will truly regret your death.

676
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
[breathing shakily] I'll fight.

677
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I will not back down.

678
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's because my magic is

679
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
'never giving up.'

680
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
[gasps, breathes shakily]

681
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
[gasps]

682
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
That’s the last of my power.

683
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
-[Sally gasps shakily]
-Uh… Hm. What now?

684
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We’re not done. We'll try whatever we can.

685
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yuno? When'd you get here?

686
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And Millie too?

687
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He made it very clear that
he wouldn’t leave until he’d helped you.

688
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
-Drink up, Sally.
-Okay!

689
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
[gags, gulping]

690
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There's no plan.
We’ll just have to play this one by ear.

691
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
That sounds like a fun time!
Like we’re experimenting.

692
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No. Not fun.

693
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I truly loathe improvisation.

694
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
-[menacing music playing]
-[clank]

695
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
[grunts]

696
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
[roars]

697
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
[music fades out]

698
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
[panting shakily]

699
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
-[moans shakily]
-[footsteps approaching]

700
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
[groans]

701
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
[weakly] Yu… no. [groans]

702
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
-[laser whooshes]
-[grunts]

703
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Never thought I’d be using this
in such a way, but here we are.

704
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Come on, quickly! Let’s try to activate it
with the magic we have!

705
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
This will not work.

706
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
[Nero] Maybe not,

707
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but thanks to their help,
we have a chance!

708
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

709
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
[gasps, groans]

710
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
-[grunts]
-He's too strong!

711
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
[gasps] We will retreat for now!

712
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
[footsteps slowly approaching]

713
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
[tense music playing]

714
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Jester, what’s the status
of the magic fusion?

715
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey you. We’re at about 20% complete.

716
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Generally speaking, we're golden.

717
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>It should be finished by dawn,</i>
<i>right on schedule.</i>

718
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That’s good to hear.

719
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And I want to thank you

720
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
for fighting the good fight with me.

721
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It’s finally happening!
A brand-new nation!

722
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No one will ever cry
or have joy taken from them again.

723
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We’ll triumph.

724
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
These poor lost souls
will be saved and born again.

725
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What I seek
is a society free from oppression,

726
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
where no one
seeks to lord over another individual.

727
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
<i>I trust that you can achieve that</i>
<i>as part of your plan, Conrad?</i>

728
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
[Conrad] Yes.

729
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
How about the mana veins?

730
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
[Jester] <i>Don’t worry,</i>
<i>I managed to find the perfect one.</i>

731
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
<i>It's at a village called Hage</i>
<i>in the Forsaken Realm</i>,

732
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>where a demon skeleton rests.</i>

733
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
[Conrad sighs]

734
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
-[wind softly whistling]
-[restrained classical music playing]

735
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
[Conrad] On its own,
my Key Magic is practically useless.

736
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I have to borrow power from other mages.

737
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Kinda goes hand in hand with the future
I'm fighting for, like it's my destiny.

738
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
One day soon,
I’m going to change this whole country.

739
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
[chuckles]

740
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I like to think that my real magic

741
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
is 'never giving up.'

742
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
[music fades out]

743
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
[tense music fades in]

744
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I told you that we were alike.

745
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
[music abruptly fades out]

746
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
[wind softly whistling]

747
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
[breathing shakily]

748
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
[Noelle weakly] Where am I?

749
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
[gasps] Noelle!

750
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I’m so happy you're awake!

751
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I’m sorry. I healed you as best I could.

752
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Mimosa…

753
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I’m glad you made it out. [grunts]

754
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
[gasping softly]

755
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
[footsteps approaching]

756
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We should be safe here.
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

757
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It's still under construction,
so only a few members know about it.

758
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They tried to capture everyone
at the arena to steal our magic,

759
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>but the captains stopped them.</i>

760
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
<i>They bought us time to escape.</i>

761
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Take care of the kid, you hear me?

762
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
[Mimosa] I don’t know
what happened to them afterwards,

763
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but they’re not here yet, so, you know…

764
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
-[loud clanging]
-[all gasp softly]

765
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
[man 1] Hey, are you okay?

766
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
-Asta’s up? Excuse me!
-[footsteps retreating]

767
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
[Mimosa] Asta, please! You need to rest
until your body's fully healed!

768
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
[Asta shakily] Conrad… must be stopped.

769
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
He’s gonna destroy the kingdom
and everybody in it.

770
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
If we don’t do something,
the world ends tomorrow at dawn!

771
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
[man 2] Dawn?!

772
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
How are we supposed to fight such enemies?

773
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
[woman 1] Is it really
a former Wizard King?

774
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
[man 3] There's no way
we can do anything ourselves.

775
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
-We’re not strong enough--
-Come on! [grunts]

776
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
[woman 2] We could just hide--

777
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
-[man 2] We can't hide forever.
-Hey! Listen!

778
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
There’s nothing we can do
with these numbers.

779
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It probably won’t be long
before they find us here,

780
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so we should pack and run while we can.
We’ll move out and settle somewhere else.

781
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.
We’ll be safe there.

782
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This isn’t a fight
we’re going to be able to win!

783
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
[man 4] Not a bad idea
to ask other nations for help.

784
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
[man 5] We’re talking about
a massive undertaking.

785
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It’d be difficult
to move the injured safely.

786
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
[man 6] If this Conrad’s
really a former Wizard King,

787
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
do we have any choice <i>but </i>to flee?

788
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
[man 7] And Lord Julius gone…

789
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
[man 8] Why get hurt fighting
when we know we’ll fail?

790
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
[chatter stops]

791
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
[Asta] What the crap
are you talkin' about?!

792
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
-Running away? No!
-[poignant music playing]

793
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
[Asta] We have to do something.

794
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We have to at least try!

795
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom, aren’t we?

796
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Not cowards!

797
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
[all gasping]

798
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
[Asta] We've been able
to live happily and peacefully

799
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
thanks to the Wizard King
and the past mages

800
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
who looked out for us our entire lives.

801
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They protected us
before we joined our squads,

802
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
when we were kids,
heck, before we were even born!

803
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
They fought for us no matter the odds
and never backed down!

804
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And the Wizard King led the way!

805
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Making sure that the country was safe!
That we could live our lives!

806
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's thanks to the sacrifices they made
that the Clover Kingdom exists now!

807
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Without them and their passion,
we wouldn’t be who we are today!

808
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
[softly] Asta…

809
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
[Asta] I won't turn my back
on this country.

810
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's my turn to look after

811
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
everything the Wizard King
and the captains have protected.

812
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
To take a stand!

813
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But it’s not just me. It’s your turn too!
This is our chance to make a difference!

814
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'll heal up using my fighting spirit!

815
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And I’ll face Conrad again
and kick his butt for real this time!

816
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
[groans]

817
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
[chuckles softly]

818
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We can stop him if we work together.

819
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We may not be strong enough
to win against him by ourselves,

820
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but if we join forces,
we'll turn into something unstoppable.

821
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Isn’t that the point
of being Magic Knights?

822
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Why we’re here in the first place?

823
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If all of us join together
and pool our power,

824
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
there's no enemy anywhere
who could stop us!

825
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I’m not forcing anyone to come with me.

826
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Sekke made a good point.
You can still escape.

827
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Hide out in the Heart Kingdom
or somewhere.

828
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But please, stay!

829
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Some of you have to be willing
to lend me your strength in this fight!

830
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
[feet clatter]

831
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Sounds good. But it's not much of a plan.

832
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, I suppose that’s to be expected
from a reckless fool.

833
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So I’ll lend a hand.

834
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
[sweeping music playing]

835
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I’m not gonna let you do this alone.

836
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Not a chance.

837
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
[music fades out]

838
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
-[heroic music playing]
-[chuckles breathily]

839
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
King Julius isn’t here to lead the way.

840
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And we can’t rely on our captains either.

841
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But that shouldn't make a difference
to any of you.

842
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We’ll battle on their behalf.

843
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Now’s our chance
to prove that we have what it takes

844
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
with everything on the line!

845
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I’ll say it again.

846
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Look around. You’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom.

847
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We’ll fight as one.
Save the whole country.

848
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And surpass all our limits!

849
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
[all] Yeah!

850
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
[woman distant]
So! What are we gonna do first?

851
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
[Asta] I’m gonna figure that out,
right now!

852
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
[woman] You’re what?!

853
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
[Sekke sighs] <i>I can’t take this anymore.</i>

854
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
<i>They’re gonna get themselves killed.</i>
<i>But not me. I’m escaping.</i>

855
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Wha-ha?

856
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Ha-ha!

857
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
[footsteps approaching]

858
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
[woman] What’s all this shouting?

859
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
[laughing maniacally]

860
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Now’s not the time for empty words,
you hot-headed imbecile!

861
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
[groans]

862
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
[sobs]

863
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Lady Big-sis-leon! And more captains!

864
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I didn't know you were alive--
[grunts] Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

865
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
[Big-sis-leon] Who are you calling,
"Big sis," huh? And don't assume I'm dead.

866
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
<i>I’ve been on my own</i>
<i>doing some intense training.</i>

867
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
[tense music playing]

868
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
[Big-sis-leon] Ah. Guests.

869
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I hope you’re here to tell me
we're gonna have some fun.

870
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I also have been away.

871
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
<i>On a mission with Jack.</i>

872
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
<i>Fortunately, that means</i>
<i>I wasn’t caught up in the initial attack.</i>

873
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The same goes for me. Now that we’re here,
we must rescue the others.

874
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
[laughs]

875
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We brought some other people
back from our mission.

876
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
They should come in handy.

877
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
<i>They're already out there,</i>
<i>pulling their weight,</i>

878
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>surveilling the giant flying arena.</i>

879
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
<i>According to them, it looks like Yami</i>
<i>and the other captains are still with us.</i>

880
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
<i>However, they’re currently trapped</i>
<i>inside the barrier.</i>

881
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Captain Yami.

882
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
[softly] Nozel is alive.

883
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Thank goodness, Yami,
I couldn’t handle your dying!

884
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
There’s something I don’t get.

885
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
They're captured.

886
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Why hold such powerful
Magic Knights captive?

887
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
-Wouldn't killing them be easier?
-[Nero] Because Conrad needs them alive.

888
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
He's wielding the Imperial Sword.

889
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
With it, he can absorb their power,

890
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
giving him and his friends
unlimited strength.

891
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
[man 1] Que, que!
So they’re his livestock!

892
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh! Earlier he said something
about needing a ton of power.

893
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
His plan depends on
sucking it out of them!

894
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
[man 2] So that’s what we’re dealing with.

895
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But if he siphons off
<i>their </i>magical powers, then…

896
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We don’t have much time.

897
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Asta, knights, gather all your courage.

898
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We're taking back the kingdom!

899
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
[all] Right!

900
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Before you run into battle,
I wanna get those tummies full.

901
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
-Open wide!
-[music becomes heroic]

902
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
[gulping loudly]

903
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
[sighs]

904
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
[Asta] Whoa! Charmy, you’re okay!

905
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
-I was worried.
-[woman] That’s right.

906
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Rouge and Captain Yami
gave us the opportunity to escape.

907
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
-[gasps] You're safe!
-[woman] Hmm.

908
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Noelle, it’s good to see you.

909
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Unfortunately, our base was trapped
inside one of their barriers.

910
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Henry and Gordon are there now.
[softly] I'm sure they're holding up.

911
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
[Noelle] Good.

912
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Then our first objective
is to break them out, right?

913
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
[quietly] The Black Bulls' base.

914
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
[music continues]

915
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The Imperial Sword
has absorbed tremendous amounts of power.

916
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They'll drive it into a vein of mana
called a singular point.

917
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Que! Well, that will spell
the end of this kingdom. Toodle-oo!

918
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Given all that we know
it’s safe to assume the Wizard Kings

919
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
were revived with Conrad’s magic
and the sword.

920
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
[gulps] So what if we break the sword?

921
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Would that take their power away?
Make 'em dead again?

922
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Given the precautions they’re taking,
I’d say that’s highly likely.

923
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Right. Our goal's to destroy
the Imperial Sword.

924
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Cut off their power source.

925
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Do whatever you need
to prepare for the battle ahead of us.

926
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Dawn is fast approaching,

927
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and that's our deadline!

928
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
[music intensifies]

929
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
[grunts]

930
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
[sighs] <i>I still can't use</i>
<i>the powerful spells in my grimoire,</i>

931
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
<i>but thanks to Charmy,</i>
<i>my magic has returned.</i>

932
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
<i>For now, I’ll focus on what I </i>can <i>do!</i>

933
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
[door opens]

934
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Hmm?

935
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
[music intensifies]

936
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
[Asta] Wait up!

937
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Hmm. I take it you're healed. You ready?

938
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh yeah!

939
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
[music climaxes, ends]

940
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
THE BASE OF THE BLACK BULLS SQUAD

941
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
[man] This is strange.

942
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
When I got back from training,
Henry was the only one here.

943
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It appears the former Wizard Kings

944
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
were somehow revived
and have taken over the capital.

945
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
[whoosh approaching]

946
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
[grunts]

947
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
[gasps]

948
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
[Asta groans]

949
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
[Asta roars]

950
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
No barrier's gonna stop me!

951
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
First, we go and rescue those
at the base of the Black Bulls.

952
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
[hesitantly] Wha-- I’m glad,
but are you sure?

953
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This'll be difficult.

954
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Our success hinges on us
preserving our fighting power.

955
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Plus, we're in need of transport.

956
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Something that will allow us
to move everyone safely.

957
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
-I understand.
-[Noelle gasps]

958
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Don’t you get it, kid? We'll tick off
some important boxes if we have your base.

959
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
-[Asta] Oh.
-That's true.

960
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But don't forget that Conrad has stolen
many types of magic he can use against us.

961
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It’s safe to assume he’ll easily
be able to counter normal attacks.

962
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
[man] That’s where you come in, Asta.

963
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Anti-Magic neutralizes every type
of magic power.

964
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And since that’s what you wield,

965
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you will be
our only hope of defeating Conrad.

966
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
We’ll work to give you that opportunity.

967
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So what do you say? Are you in?

968
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes, sir!

969
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
-[gladiatorial music playing]
-[Asta roars]

970
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
[music ends]

971
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
-[triumphant music playing]
-All right!

972
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
[man] Welcome back, everyone.
Oh, wow, we have so many guests!

973
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What’s the story, Henry?
Can you get us off the ground?

974
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Let's get goin'!

975
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
[chanting dreamily] I've got you covered!

976
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Quickly! Replenish your energy
by stuffing those faces!

977
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
[yummy noises]

978
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
[ecstatically] I've never felt
so much magic power before!

979
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
[music intensifies]

980
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So cool!

981
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The Black Bulls
are really flying in style now!

982
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Hold on.
[quavering] This thing is gonna fly?

983
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
[Henry dreamily] If there's enough power,
I think it will!

984
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
-You should hold on.
-[all grunt]

985
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
[music intensifies]

986
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
More resistance than expected. Damn.

987
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
[man] <i>Que, que! Severing Magic…</i>

988
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
[screaming] …<i>Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!</i>

989
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
[music accelerates]

990
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Briar Magic…

991
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
[yelling] Crimson Vine Spear!

992
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
[all gasp]

993
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
-[woman] Barely a dent in them.
-[man] Que, que! How annoying!

994
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Huh? Argh!

995
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
-Argh! Argh!
-[all grunt]

996
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
[somber music playing]

997
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Que, que!

998
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Perfect opportunity to slice and dice!

999
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We’ll stop them
from interfering with our mission.

1000
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
[man] The rest of you go on ahead!

1001
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
-Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!
-Hold on!

1002
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
-If you go, we can’t defeat Conrad.
-Uh--

1003
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, but-- There's only two of 'em.

1004
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Two don't stand a chance.

1005
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Three…

1006
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
is a better number.

1007
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
[thunderous crash]

1008
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
[man] World Tree Magic:
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

1009
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Go. While you have an opening.

1010
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Captain Vangeance!

1011
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
[Henry] Are you ready?

1012
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
[music intensifies]

1013
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
[tuts, breathes shakily]

1014
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
[Asta] Hey.

1015
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
[chuckles softly]

1016
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
[music fades out]

1017
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
[Vangeance] <i>Yuno</i>.

1018
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
<i>I leave the Wizard King to you.</i>

1019
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Well, I’d say it’s as good a time as any
to ask our barbarous guests to leave.

1020
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
[music builds]

1021
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Listen closely.

1022
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
We may be out three captains now,

How shall we proceed?

1033
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
They decided to resist.

As I know <i>you </i>would
if you were in their shoes.

1035

The grand finale is upon us.

1036

I’ve saved you
the best seat for the climax.

1037

Is that why you kept me alive until now,

1038
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000

almost all of my power?

to haunt your remaining hours.

1041

They will die
in front of their powerless false king.

1042

Only then will the new era

It's far more powerful
than the one at our base.

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
This will be tough to break through.

1050

Oh, hey! Look!

1051
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, well, one last desperate attempt

01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000

01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
[Jester] You’re a fool if you think
you managed to lure me into a snare.

1196
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's quite the opposite, you silly boy.

1197
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I’m the one who lured you
into what will soon be your tomb!

1198
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
All that absorbed magical energy
isn’t just powering this flying fortress,

1199
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
we’re able to tap into
as much of it as we want as well.

1200
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Which means as long as I’m here,
the well of my power

1201
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
doesn’t have any risk of running dry!

that means you’ve won?

01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Against us?

1205
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Wait. "Us"?

1206
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
[Yami] Not too shabby, Pretty Boy.

1207
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But points docked for being so rough.

1208
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You’re supposed to be gentle
with a damsel in distress.

1212
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I’ll do better next time.

1213
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Are you good?

1214
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Of course, it’s my duty as a captain.

1215
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Can’t have you kids risking your lives
without surpassing <i>my </i>limits.

1216
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
[shouts] Agreed, fellas?

1217
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000

[yawns] Well, at least you'll talk less
when I've killed you.

1225

This so-called backup of yours?

1226
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They’ve been chained up all day
while we siphoned off their magical power

1227
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
to fuel our magnificent fortress.

1228
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
These guys are beat. I’m surprised
they can even stand at this point!

1229
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
What good are these empty vessels
gonna do you? [laughs] Oh, don’t tell me!

1230
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You think you can stand against me
'cause you've got nerve?

1231
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Fine! Go ahead and try it!

1232
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000

from being drained <i>that </i>quickly!

The world you envisioned

I’ve driven the Imperial Sword’s magic
into the singular point.

No one can stop
the fall of the Clover Kingdom.

No, it’s not!

I’m gonna pull that sword out
and make you eat your words!

1410
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Because I don't even know how to quit!

I’ll follow through even if it kills me!

[Mereoleona] This battle…

If I’m not the strongest,

1446
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
then I can't call a certain someone…

1447
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
[roaring] …my rival anymore!

1448
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
[Princia] You draw strength
from your comrades, aye?

1449
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Not bad.

1450
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But I must admit it’s not <i>my </i>style.
[growling] Still…

1451
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
You’ve done well, Mereoleona!

1452
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
[chuckling] Honestly,
I think you could beat me in a fistfight.

1453
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So let’s see!

1454
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Are you powerful enough
to best me when I go all-out?!

1455

[Jester] Oh jeez.

1456

You’re really feisty for a baby knight.

1457
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
You even made me use my trump card.

1458
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
If I had met you
when I was still the Wizard King,

1459
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I might have made you one of my advisers.

Don’t gimme that.

No one actually knows
what’s right and what’s wrong,

01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
so <i>you </i>don't get to make that judgment!

and there's nothing we won't do
to bring those dreams to life!

1469
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I get you. In a battle like this, the idea
of right and wrong kinda falls apart.

1470
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So we’ll have to protect
what matters to us!

because a bunch of people
recognized your virtues!

When I was the Wizard King, I championed
the incremental changes you speak of.

01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
A better choice would be to work together.

1701
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
[Asta] I don’t mean to brag.

1702
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I can’t do anything
without the help of my friends.

1703
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
I nearly died a bunch of times,
but with them at my side,

1704
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I’ve been able to come
further than I thought possible!

1705
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000

to wake up and start a new day!

1709
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You don't make something like that
by killing a bunch of people!

1710
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
No one will accept your world
if that's the price!

It’s Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1718
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
A noble? Yes, of course.

1719
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I see now.

1720
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1721
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
You're a royal,
and yet you can empathize with the weak.

You gotta be kidding me. What a joke.

1726
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
[grunts] Well, I, for one,
can still keep fighting.

1727
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
[weakly] For many more rounds, I bet.

1728
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000

1736

This is a forbidden spell.

1737
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000

Argh!

1740
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
[Conrad] One more chance.

1741
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000

'Cause I’m not done yet either.

1746

1748
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So I’ll keep standing.

1749

No matter what.

What do you mean?

1757
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
[Julius] You won't need an explanation.

1758
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
That sword will lead the way.

Stop, Master Nacht! What are you doing?

1767
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You've gotta slow down.

1768
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
You’ve worked yourself ragged
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom.

1769
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
If you give up any more magical power,
you're gonna pass out for sure!

1770
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
A nice long nap
doesn’t sound like the worst idea.

1771

Especially if it means someone who’s doing
a good thing gets rewarded.

Why are you so hell-bent on destruction?

I see things as they are.

1790
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
This country must burn!

1791
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The nation is rotten to the core!

1792
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Its very foundation
must be razed and rebuilt anew!

1793

Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?
Those you deem worthy?

No! Those who are oppressed
and without hope in their lives.

1797
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
For their sake, I will create--

[Asta] Even if you’re a peasant
and don’t have magical power,

you can still be
the strongest person in the world.

A man not unlike Asta.

1832
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
But he was framed by the royalists.

1833

His wife and his comrades
were slaughtered as a result, and after…

1834

Why was I able to tap into

01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
[chuckles] Good call. [groans]

1873
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
[Yuno] I'll be a proper Wizard King,
so it's fine.

1874
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
[Asta] Not so fast! We both know
I'll be the one calling the shots--

1875
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
-[Yuno] Can't hear you.
-[Asta] Don't ignore me!

1876
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You wanna go? Let's do it!
The Triumph may have been canceled,

1877
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but I can still beat you in a one-on-one
match to prove I'm strongest.

1878
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Not a chance.

1879
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
[both] I'm going to be the Wizard King!

1880
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
[both roar]

1881
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
[metallic clang]
