1
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:51,924
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:55,646
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,690
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,693
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,096
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

6
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,591
<i>I don't wanna see them,
I don't wanna hear them.</i>

7
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:13,497
<i>I want no interaction with them
whatsoever.</i>

8
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:20,296
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,965
You got any issues with that?

10
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:25,217
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,893
No matter what happens

12
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,144
no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:38,731
<i>No violence.</i>

14
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,787
{\an8}Walt?

15
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,373
{\an8}- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,333
{\an8}Yeah, I'm okay.

17
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:44,088
You know, honey, you...
You really don't have to...

18
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:48,634
{\an8}Look, I like being here with you.

19
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,095
Yeah.

20
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:54,265
{\an8}I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay

21
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,934
{\an8}that really, if you wanna go...

22
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,523
{\an8}You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better

23
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,402
{\an8}knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. gets home from school.

24
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,074
{\an8}Okay.

25
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:16,234
{\an8}All right.
So you'll call me when you're finished?

26
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,080
{\an8}- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

27
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,211
{\an8}Oh, and have you been
in touch with Elliot?

28
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,923
{\an8}Because I haven't seen a check from him.

29
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,050
{\an8}Yes, I... I got it.

30
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:33,387
- Really?
- It came, yeah. And I...

31
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:35,254
Yeah, it did. It came last week,

32
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,559
and I put it right into
my credit union account.

33
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,812
So I'm taking care of it.

34
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,399
{\an8}- Good.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,527
So we're good. We're good.

36
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:56,702
Could you not deposit this until Monday?

37
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,664
Thank you.

38
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,273
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

39
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,004
{\an8}Yeah.

40
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:31,904
<i>Chemical reactions involve
change on two levels:</i>

41
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,573
{\an8}Matter and energy.

42
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,830
{\an8}When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

43
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:44,375
{\an8}I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

44
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:51,507
{\an8}For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

45
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,557
But if a reaction happens quickly

46
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:03,435
{\an8}otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

47
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:08,649
{\an8}that generates enormous bursts of energy.

48
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:18,909
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

49
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,499
{\an8}Hint, hint. Right here.

50
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,918
Like, an explosion?

51
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:32,381
Yes, good. Explosions.

52
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:37,052
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions

53
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:39,763
happening almost instantaneously.

54
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,517
{\an8}And the faster reactants,
i.e. explosives...

55
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:47,395
{\an8}And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

56
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,774
...the faster they undergo change...

57
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:53,944
...the more violent the explosion.

58
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,742
Explosions.

59
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,037
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own

60
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:06,749
from the top of chapter seven.

61
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,848
You okay?

62
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,268
I got it, Mr. White.

63
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,103
Don't worry.

64
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,522
You got kids to teach.

65
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,920
Thanks, Hugo.

66
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,433
<i>He's starting to lose weight</i>

67
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,355
which is tough, to see that.

68
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:17,611
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

69
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:27,454
- Can I talk to...?
- Of course.

70
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,999
Walt.

71
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,419
When you don't let me in

72
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,088
when you don't tell me what's going on...

73
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:40,718
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

74
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,052
No.

75
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:46,056
And recently, these afternoons

76
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:48,684
when you're coming home so late,

77
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:53,564
and we're just left wondering
where you are.

78
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,941
Yeah, Dad.

79
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,445
What's up with that?

80
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:06,994
Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from your family?

81
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,458
Now's the time to share.

82
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:19,465
Well, I...

83
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,303
I like to be alone, I mean, at times.

84
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,723
And it's not about you, really.

85
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:31,852
It's just that sometimes it feels better

86
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,774
not to talk at all

87
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:39,735
about anything

88
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:41,612
to anyone.

89
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:45,741
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

90
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:50,829
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

91
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:54,666
might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting

92
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,670
of whatever it is you do alone.

93
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,965
Well

94
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,845
I like to go on walks

95
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,850
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

96
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:18,023
And I really enjoy the nature.

97
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:21,360
<i>You know, the cacti</i>

98
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,906
<i>vegetation, that kind of thing.</i>

99
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:32,329
<i>It's really very therapeutic.</i>

100
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,235
Yo, God, are you okay?

101
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,321
- Hey, you did that shit?
- I'm dizzy. No.

102
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:09,241
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

103
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,077
- God, I feel like I'm burning up.
- Sit down, sit down.

104
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,371
- I gotta...
- Take this off.

105
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,500
Sit down, get some air.

106
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,045
Oh, God.

107
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,298
Here.

108
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,345
- Better?
- Yeah, that's better.

109
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,229
When were you gonna tell me?

110
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,942
Tell you what?

111
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,153
Cancer.

112
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,405
You got it, right?

113
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:56,955
How did you know?

114
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:01,376
My aunt had one of those dots on her

115
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:05,380
to target the radiation.
What, is it in your lung?

116
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:09,551
I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

117
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:12,679
God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

118
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,558
What stage are you?

119
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,354
Three-A.

120
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,524
Gone into your lymph nodes.

121
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,830
Your aunt

122
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:42,668
how bad was she when they caught it?

123
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,963
Bad enough, she didn't last long.

124
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:50,926
- How long?
- Seven months.

125
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,932
God.

126
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,766
I get it now.

127
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:01,395
That's why you're doing all this.

128
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,815
You want to make some cash
for your people before you check out.

129
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:07,066
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

130
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,696
You're the one that looks like
he just crawled out of a microwave.

131
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:18,578
You gonna be able to finish the batch?

132
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:19,913
Yes.

133
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:21,873
All right.

134
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,671
No.

135
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,549
You do it.

136
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,761
Me?

137
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,513
Yeah.

138
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,933
What happened to your mad skills?

139
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,317
Go on. Here.

140
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:50,110
You do it.

141
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,324
You can do it.

142
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:03,457
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

143
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,258
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

144
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,220
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

145
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,968
What's this, Christmas?

146
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:02,724
This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

147
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,271
- Holy shit.
- What?

148
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:11,738
Lab says they pulled up an imprint
of some writing on the inside

149
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,736
- Magic Marker or something.
- Yeah? What's it say?

150
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:18,365
"Property of
J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."

151
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,908
That's Walt's school.

152
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,781
We were supposed to start at 3.

153
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:45,452
Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

154
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,831
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

155
00:15:56,796 --> 00:16:00,133
- How much is this?
- Twenty-six big ones.

156
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,512
Is that all?
Twenty-six-thousand dollars?

157
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:07,641
No, that's 2600, and your share is 13

158
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:11,186
minus 25 bucks for that phone.

159
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:14,439
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

160
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:19,835
Last time I checked

161
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:23,736
there were 16 ounces to a pound.
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

162
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:26,023
Yo, I've been out all night
slinging crystal.

163
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,309
You think it's cake moving
a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

164
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:31,512
Why are you selling it
in small quantities?

165
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,251
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

166
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,378
To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

167
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:40,966
This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

168
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,426
This return is too little for the risk.

169
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,693
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound.

170
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,604
You may know a lot about chemistry,

171
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,642
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

172
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,979
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

173
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,106
Oh, my...

174
00:16:56,273 --> 00:17:00,110
Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just...

175
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:02,737
Just think outside the box here.

176
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:06,199
We have to move our product in bulk,
wholesale.

177
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:10,412
Now, how do we do that?

178
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:14,874
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

179
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,378
We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

180
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,715
Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

181
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,566
So who took Krazy-8's place?

182
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,319
Some guy named Tuco.

183
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:43,903
Badass, from what I hear.

184
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:48,533
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

185
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:51,661
Right. Like, "Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me

186
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:55,178
would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

187
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,340
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

188
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,510
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's OG.

189
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:04,257
- What... What does that mean?
- Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

190
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:07,552
He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

191
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,953
You don't understand the way it works.

192
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,183
You can't just bum-rush
some high-level ice man,

193
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,018
and start cutting deals.

194
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:18,855
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

195
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,982
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

196
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,099
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from third grade.

197
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,822
- And we can't talk to Emilio, because...
- All right, all right, all right.

198
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:33,244
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

199
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:36,205
I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you be satisfied

200
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,439
- with the way it is?
- Oh, come on! Jesus!

201
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,211
Just grow some fucking balls!

202
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:27,215
- Wait till Monday again?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

203
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,643
Oh, God.

204
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:59,164
Mr. White.

205
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:06,921
Thank you, Hugo.

206
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,406
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hey.

207
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:37,952
- How you feeling, Walt?
- Good. Yeah.

208
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,830
Are you up for having a visitor?

209
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:44,501
- Hey, buddy.
- Hank.

210
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,617
Well, let me know if you need anything.

211
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:49,214
I will. Thank you, Carmen.

212
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,383
Damn.

213
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,762
Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

214
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,517
So, what... What are you doing here?

215
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:04,896
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

216
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,013
You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

217
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:10,109
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

218
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,947
What do you mean, "work-related," though?

219
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:18,576
Do you recognize that?

220
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,623
No. No.

221
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:26,793
Well, that was used to cook meth.

222
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:32,090
Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

223
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,052
Old label on the inside used to say:

224
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:39,264
- "J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab."
- Really?

225
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:42,308
I don't understand
how that came from here.

226
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,518
I was hoping you could help me with that.

227
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:48,398
We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

228
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,443
A snitch?

229
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,660
Yeah, one of our confidential informants.

230
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,413
Went missing a while back.

231
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,784
No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

232
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:04,831
Probably chopped up into little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

233
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,792
Anyway, you...

234
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:10,837
Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

235
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:13,798
No. No.

236
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,384
No, I mean, not that I know of.

237
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,094
- I'll need to look at that inventory.
- Sure.

238
00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:21,681
Sure.
I've got a list hanging on the wall.

239
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,148
Do you mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

240
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,185
Not at all. No.

241
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:28,187
Be my guest.

242
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:33,067
All right, so who's got keys?

243
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:35,737
The science faculty, the staff, Carmen

244
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:39,991
the vice-principal has the master,
and me.

245
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,118
How about students?

246
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:45,246
No, no. No students have keys.

247
00:22:45,412 --> 00:22:47,462
Shit, I should hope not.
My question is

248
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:50,432
do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

249
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,127
I don't... I don't think so, no.

250
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:55,461
I mean, besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

251
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:58,009
Walt, look, I know they're your students,

252
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,637
but do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

253
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:03,848
- Are there any other respirators?
- No.

254
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:06,893
Because I'm counting six,
inventory says eight.

255
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,232
- Glassware looking a little sparse.
- Is it?

256
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:19,405
Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

257
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,199
Oh, yeah.

258
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:24,994
A five-thousand milliliter round-bottom.

259
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,455
Meth heads love to brew in this baby.

260
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:33,211
- You gonna answer that?
- Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...

261
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,296
Maybe it's Skyler and she's in trouble.

262
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,384
Shit, don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do.

263
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,011
- Jeez.
- Okay.

264
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:46,599
- Hello?
<i>- Yo, what's up, Mr. W?</i>

265
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:48,893
Speaking.

266
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:51,396
- Bad time to talk?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

267
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,147
All right, so just listen.

268
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,359
So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

269
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:59,926
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him

270
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,322
over at Los Lunas.

271
00:24:01,488 --> 00:24:06,285
<i>So we got our in. We're hauling
a pound to the dude right now.</i>

272
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:10,707
Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

273
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:15,586
My doctor is very solicitous.

274
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:19,298
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

275
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:22,343
But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

276
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:25,430
You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

277
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:26,931
I will.

278
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,143
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

279
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,778
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

280
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:46,373
So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

281
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:49,328
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

282
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:07,597
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

283
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:20,068
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo.
Come on.

284
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:27,116
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

285
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,256
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

286
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:54,393
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

287
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:12,245
Tuco, what's happening, my brother?

288
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:22,046
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

289
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:25,174
- What's it been, like, a year?
- This your boy?

290
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:28,219
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

291
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,486
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

292
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,141
Break out the ice.

293
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:53,786
- Take a bump.
- No worries, man, I'm no cop.

294
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,789
I said, hit it.

295
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,377
All right.

296
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:19,937
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

297
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,941
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

298
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,028
Bullshit.

299
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,740
Who you working for?

300
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:36,204
No one, man. I mean, I have a partner
that I cook with, but that's it.

301
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,666
All right.

302
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,879
We got a deal.

303
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,996
See, I told you Tuco would hook you up.

304
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:50,009
Cool. I haven't said how much.

305
00:27:58,935 --> 00:28:01,896
All right. How much?

306
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,898
Thirty-five large for the pound.

307
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:11,864
Well, I mean, you're a little light, <i>ese</i>.

308
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:17,620
It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

309
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,746
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

310
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,750
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

311
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:25,628
This is a consignment operation.

312
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:30,549
You want me to float thirty-five G's?

313
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,011
You don't trust me?

314
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:36,180
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.

315
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:39,517
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

316
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,395
Tough shit, the deal is done.

317
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,776
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

318
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,028
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.

319
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:55,241
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

320
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:01,330
Come on.

321
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,458
Oh, come on.

322
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:20,725
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal.

323
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,854
You really want your money up front?

324
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:49,712
Up front.

325
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:25,664
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

326
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,935
Morning, Hugo.

327
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:51,065
You don't mind if I call you Hugo, Hugo?

328
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,446
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

329
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:59,281
Is that Uncle Hank?

330
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,828
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

331
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,665
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

332
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:11,332
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

333
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,505
I got two words for you:
Background check. How about that?

334
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:20,010
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-6, to-the-9.</i>

335
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:23,139
<i>Representing the ABQ.
What up, biatch?</i>

336
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:25,141
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

337
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:28,978
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

338
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:31,564
- Hey, Walt?
- Yeah?

339
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:37,027
- Hank's about to deal.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

340
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:45,494
All right,
let's see what the turn brings us.

341
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:50,040
You're looking good, Walt.
Your color's better.

342
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:52,042
Yeah? Thanks.

343
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:55,045
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

344
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:59,007
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

345
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,791
Well, actually,
I just talked to Carmen this morning,

346
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,930
and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

347
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,558
- Good.
- I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

348
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,311
- Sorry.
- Your bet, tough guy.

349
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,229
Check.

350
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,064
Yeah, check.

351
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,484
Check's in the mail.

352
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:20,070
- Ten million.
- That's 25 million, blue's 10.

353
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:23,073
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

354
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,075
Hey, Uncle Hank

355
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:29,246
I heard you arrested
Mr. Archilleya the other day.

356
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:30,581
He's a pretty cool guy.

357
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:36,587
Well, turns out he has a record.
Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.

358
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,354
We figured he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

359
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:44,762
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

360
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,182
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

361
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:51,644
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

362
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,606
- It's to you, Walt.
- Yeah, I'll call.

363
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,023
You know,
I can't believe the school system

364
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,008
didn't know about this guy's record.

365
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,802
I mean, that's scary.
How could something like that

366
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,324
- just slip through the cracks?
- I don't know.

367
00:33:05,491 --> 00:33:10,621
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.

368
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:14,288
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal

369
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,127
if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

370
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:23,801
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

371
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,637
Turns out he's a major-league pothead.

372
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,265
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.

373
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,891
You hiding something?

374
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,277
I'm in. And the river card.

375
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,864
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

376
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:47,825
I'm out.

377
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:56,083
When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

378
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,836
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

379
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,673
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

380
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,510
Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

381
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,514
Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

382
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,809
I'm waiting.

383
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,355
You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

384
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:20,190
Hank.

385
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,360
Sorry.

386
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,032
I'm all in.

387
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:37,207
Dude.
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

388
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,711
What are you smoking there, huh?

389
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,590
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

390
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,222
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

391
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,226
- Talk about anti-climactic.
- Hey.

392
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,743
Your cards couldn't have been
that bad, come on.

393
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,065
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace?

394
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,984
- What are you doing?
- And a cowboy for...

395
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:12,493
A handful of nothing.

396
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,677
<i>Yeah, what up?</i>

397
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,390
Who is this?
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

398
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:19,351
<i>Hey, man, he's out.</i>

399
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,146
Well, where is he, then?

400
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:37,828
You the guy?

401
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,748
Yeah, I'm the guy.

402
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,671
How is he?

403
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,341
Got some busted ribs, and like that.

404
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:53,886
Got messed up pretty good.

405
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:58,515
I was all, like,
"Damn, Tuco, chill, <i>ese."</i>

406
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,060
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

407
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,191
He's out, man. Way out.

408
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:10,486
They got him doped up big time.

409
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:17,868
So you're the cook, huh?

410
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,372
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

411
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:38,722
Tell me about this Tuco.

412
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,809
Tell me everything about him.

413
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:24,953
Morning.

414
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,958
Could you pass the butter, please?

415
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:34,171
Badass, Dad.

416
00:40:21,176 --> 00:40:25,472
Hey, cue ball. Need directions?

417
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:28,600
You Tuco?

418
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:38,568
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

419
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:03,904
What's your name?

420
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,740
Heisenberg.

421
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:10,535
Heisenberg. Okay.

422
00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:12,454
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

423
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:16,374
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

424
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,210
No?

425
00:42:18,794 --> 00:42:20,378
All right.

426
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,006
Be that way.

427
00:42:25,884 --> 00:42:27,511
It's your meeting.

428
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:30,889
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

429
00:42:31,973 --> 00:42:33,809
Fifty thousand dollars.

430
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:39,815
Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

431
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:42,526
Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole,

432
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:45,592
and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

433
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:53,161
Partner.

434
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:03,547
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

435
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:05,841
So you must be Daddy.

436
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:16,560
Let me get this straight.

437
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,063
I steal your dope

438
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,985
I beat the piss out of your mule boy,

439
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:30,282
and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

440
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:36,037
That's a brilliant plan, <i>ese.</i>

441
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:37,747
Brilliant.

442
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,918
You got one part of that wrong.

443
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,550
This is not meth.

444
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:17,454
Are you fucking nuts?

445
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,039
You wanna find out?

446
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:22,876
No, no, Gonzo, <i>calma.</i>

447
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,675
You got balls, I'll give you that.

448
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:34,471
All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

449
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:43,021
That crystal that your partner brought me

450
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:48,276
it sold faster than ten-dollar ass in TJ.

451
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:55,867
Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

452
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,705
Money up front.

453
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,874
All right.

454
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,043
Money up front.

455
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:12,884
Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

456
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:17,806
Just as long as we got an understanding.

457
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,854
One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

458
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:32,487
Oh, really?

459
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:36,574
Hey, what is that shit?

460
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:41,288
Fulminated mercury,

461
00:45:42,163 --> 00:45:44,749
and a little tweak of chemistry.
