1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,674
BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,055
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,971
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:16,562
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,477
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,443
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,275
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,820
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,204
DR. WELLS: Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:32,453
You're just letting us go?

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,040
Just remember who it was made sure
you didn't get thrown on that plane.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,920
I call it the "Wizard's Wand."

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,798
Captain Singh mentioned there
may be positions available

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,299
on your anti-meta-human
task force.

15
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,756
- Why do you want to do this?
- Mark Mardon killed my dad.

16
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:48,515
James Jesse, Your Honor,
AKA... the Trickster.

17
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,799
(CROWD GASPS)

18
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,765
You're going to prison
either way, James.

19
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,396
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my father.

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,524
If he finds out that he might have a son
that grew up without knowing him,

21
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,808
It would crush him.

22
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,649
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her.

23
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:01,902
(CRACKLING)

24
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:04,063
(DISTORTED) You're next.

25
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,716
(GRUNTS)

26
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,727
Go ahead, kill me.

27
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,234
But my daughter is innocent.

28
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,314
Please.

29
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,609
Let Jesse live.

30
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,162
Go on!

31
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,161
Say something!

32
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,087
Merry Christmas.

33
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,015
- Fathwoom!
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,394
I had to fight
some old lady for the last one.

35
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,349
They didn't have
any Green Arrow dolls.

36
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,856
Don't know why you'd want a toy of that crazy
man. I can't figure out what to get Barry.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,110
I was thinking you could give him this.

38
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,941
Oh, that's nice.

39
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,105
But I kind of want to get him
something more meaningful.

40
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:32,118
I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

41
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,278
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

42
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,074
I know, babe. I miss Eddie, too.

43
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,703
How about you get Barry
uh, a really nice watch?

44
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,087
Like Grandpa Ben gave to you.

45
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,413
That ain't a bad idea.

46
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,548
You know, my dad only gave me
this watch because I was always late.

47
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,302
- You? (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

48
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,305
He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message,

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,591
like this watch,
or the time he bought me free weights

50
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,102
because he said
I was too skinny.

51
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,932
I told him, "When I have a son,
I'm only giving him fun presents."

52
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,360
And this thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

53
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,771
Because it's from family.

54
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,072
You sure you're all right?

55
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,197
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah, I promise.

56
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:20,957
(KISSING)

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,997
You know, we should really be
more professional.

58
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,381
- You do realize you initiated that.
- (CHUCKLES)

59
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,463
Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,432
I'm just saying, you know, anyone
could walk in like, Joe, or Captain...

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
- Yo.
- (CHUCKLES)

62
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,271
- But I... I have, like, a 4:00 to 12:00.
- Yep.

63
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,522
- But I'll call... I'll see you later.
- All right.

64
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,942
- I'll see you at Christmas.
- Yeah. Okay, bye.

65
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,772
I'm so happy for you.

66
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:52,314
Truly.

67
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,033
Thank you. I...

68
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,569
It means a lot to me that you like her.

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,788
(SIGHS) I don't know, it's...

70
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,832
Wells, um...

71
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,040
He left me that message where he said

72
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,043
that I'd never really be happy.

73
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,960
And for a while I really started
to believe him, but now...

74
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,503
I don't know. Maybe there is a way that...

75
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,716
Are you okay? What's wrong?

76
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,685
(WEEPING) I'm so sorry.
I can't keep this in anymore, Barry.

77
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:21,970
What?

78
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,855
I know I was so mad at you and Dad
for not telling me that you were The Flash,

79
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,644
But when I found out about this,
I didn't know what to do.

80
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,653
What? What's going on? What's...

81
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,858
When Francine came back,

82
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,072
my Dad told me not to trust her
and he was right.

83
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,572
I didn't know how much.

84
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:46,370
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

85
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,213
She had a son.

86
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,834
Joe's son. My brother.

87
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:58,346
What's his name?

88
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:00,675
Wally.

89
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,553
Wally West.

90
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:08,608
When I found out, I told her to leave
and then never come back,

91
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,983
and to never tell my dad.

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,898
But Barry, I feel... I feel like
this is hollowing me out.

93
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,069
Every time I look at Dad, I feel like
I'm hurting him. I don't know what to do.

94
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
I think you know what you have to do.

95
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,072
I can't. It's gonna kill him.

96
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,661
No, it won't.

97
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,747
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

98
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,461
Thank you. (SIGHS)

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,667
Yeah.

100
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,088
Hey, look. Snow.

101
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,016
Maybe it'll be a white Christmas.

102
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,643
That'd be nice.

103
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,651
I was just thinking that if we could
inject an unstable neutrino burst

104
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,356
into the individual breaches,

105
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,192
it might cause them
to seal on their own.

106
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,824
And stop Zoom from travelling back
and forth between our worlds.

107
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,783
At least then,
we wouldn't have to worry about him

108
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,536
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

109
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,322
- It means a lot.
- What does?

110
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:08,538
You looking after Barry. He's been
through a lot the last few weeks.

111
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,172
Barry's not the only person here
I want to keep safe.

112
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:16,675
Oh, dear Lord.
Just kiss already. Oh, the thirst is real.

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,427
Is everything all right?

114
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,682
Yeah, I keep checking, but all
is quiet on the meta-human front.

115
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,932
Hey, you think Zoom
decided to take Christmas off?

116
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,468
What's Christmas?

117
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:30,356
Oh, well, it's this holiday we have
where we cut down trees and sing songs

118
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,108
To celebrate the birth of a baby
2,000 years ago,

119
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,612
and then the Romans killed him,
so we give each other gifts.

120
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,021
That's your explanation?

121
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,817
- I know what Christmas is.
- Oh, right. Of course.

122
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:44,120
Um, you know, Joe and Barry and Iris
are having people over for Christmas Eve.

123
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,872
And they said we could
invite whoever we want.

124
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,579
Who, who do you want?

125
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,336
You.
I want to invite you, I mean.

126
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,790
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

127
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,050
Uh, no, I have not.
I told him to rest.

128
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,630
He's just as stubborn as all the rest
of my male patients in this place.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,593
I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay?
I'm gonna go find Harry.

- Sure.

00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,210
What do you mean?
What does Mardon have to do with Patty?

159
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,428
We should have expected this.

160
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,184
The unexpected drop in barometric pressure
had to mean Mardon's back in town.

161
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,596
- Patty...
- Jesse was on full communication lockdown

162
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,764
but that doesn't mean Mardon
and Snart weren't in contact.

163
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,059
Patty, Joe told me about Mardon.

164
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,687
(CHUCKLES)

165
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,147
I can't talk to you about this.

166
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,816
Hey, Patty, it's okay.

167
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:28,359
I got it.

168
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,485
Look, Barry, you're a really sweet guy,

169
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,404
but you have no idea what's
really going on in this city.

170
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,198
I mean, you don't even
know that Harrison Wells...

171
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,169
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to bring you up to speed.

172
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,378
That's ironic. Patty, Patty,
look, I care about you a lot.

173
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:44,759
I don't want to see
you do anything reckless.

174
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,888
I'm a cop. Going after
criminals is in my job description.

175
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,548
It's not reckless.

176
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,966
And powers or not, Mardon's
gonna answer for what he's done.

177
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,100
Patty...

178
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,562
Deck the halls with body parts
from a girl named Holly

179
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,601
(VOCALIZING)

180
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,734
I don't remember those being the lyrics.

181
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,909
Oh, I am tremendously creative.
That, I can tell you.

182
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,615
You better be. I didn't break you out,

183
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,246
I didn't break either of you out because,
I was looking to make new friends.

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,500
That is not the holiday spirit,
Marky-Mark.

185
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,162
Christmas is a time for togetherness.

186
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,423
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves?

187
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,466
- Hmm?
- So why did you break us out?

188
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,922
Well, I owed you one.

189
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:31,048
And this guy, he's just crazy.
That's a compliment.

190
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,049
And we all want the same thing.

191
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,679
Fashion advice?

192
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,389
To see The Flash dead.

193
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,725
Well, that was more of a
New Years resolution,

194
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,230
but, hey, I'm flexible.

195
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,438
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

196
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,820
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

197
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:50,109
Three against one. Plus,
the one isn't quite what he was.

198
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,778
See, another speedster,
dressed all in black,

199
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,038
nearly took him out a few weeks ago.

200
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,325
He's vulnerable. He's weak.

201
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,289
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

202
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:06,333
No. With my power, his flair,
and your smarts,

203
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,341
we can put him in the ground for good.

204
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,754
- Tell me your plan.
- Tell me you're in.

205
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,011
I'm thinking about it.

206
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,219
What's the matter?

207
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,759
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

208
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:22,139
- You wanna dance?
- Boys, boys, boys, play nice.

209
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,934
Mellow out, Mardon.
Don't have a snit, Snart.

210
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:26,442
Here's an idea.

211
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:31,278
We all go out, have a few drinks,
kill some carolers. We'll all feel better.

212
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,985
All right.

213
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,745
So what's it gonna be, Snart?

214
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,669
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah. Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

215
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:47,298
There's three of them and one of you.
I do not like those odds.

216
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,301
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

217
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,471
Oh, Oh, light bulb, up here.
I have an idea.

218
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,133
Most weather phenomena are marked,
no pun intended,

219
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,018
by a change in electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

220
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,100
We could just map out
those fluctuations to...

221
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,263
To pinpoint his location.

222
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,602
Right, it would just be a matter
of removing all the electricity...

223
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,018
From his immediate surroundings.

224
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,436
Attracting it to one spot.

225
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,945
The same way
a lightning rod does.

226
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,649
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

227
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,110
A wand?

228
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,116
Have we already had this conversation?

229
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,118
- Kind of.
- What does that mean?

230
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,736
Uh...

231
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,163
All right.
So the last time Mardon attacked,

232
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,452
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed all of Central City.

233
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,121
So, why are you
not all sleeping with the fishes?

234
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,630
Earth-2 has "The Godfather"?

235
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,292
Every Earth has
"The Godfather," Vito.

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,471
So, I ran back through time.
One day into the past,

237
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,506
and I got a do over, and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

238
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,392
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

239
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,052
That's what
the other Wells said.

240
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,142
So the good news is,
in that timeline,

241
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,852
you created The Wand
and it worked.

242
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,934
- For the first time.
- Yeah. No pressure.

243
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,394
I can give you a hand.

244
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,688
- Best of both worlds?
- I like that.

245
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,448
(BARRY CHUCKLES)

246
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,614
You good, Harry?

247
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,870
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

248
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,167
Holiday blues? It can't be easy knowing
Zoom still has his daughter.

249
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,705
Yeah. All right, look, I'll be right back.
I have something I have to deal with.

250
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,212
Hey.

251
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,133
(CHUCKLES)

252
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,804
Okay.

253
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,517
Okay, the last time the two of
you were looking at me like that,

254
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,101
Was when you both took
my convertible on a joy ride

255
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,609
and wrapped it around that
big oak tree on Fairmont Drive.

256
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,190
Dad... (CLEARS THROAT)

257
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,399
All right, Joe, we have something
that we need to tell you...

258
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,736
No, um...

259
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,740
I have something that I need to tell you.

260
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,202
It's about Francine.

261
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,082
(SNIFFLING)

262
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,758
(CLEARS THROAT) When she left us,

263
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,594
she was pregnant.

(SIGHS)

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,269
(SIGHS)

266
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,573
Did she have the baby?

267
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,613
Yes.

268
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,500
His name is Wally.

269
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,123
Wally West.

270
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,216
It's short for Wallace.

271
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,138
That's what we were gonna name you
if you were a boy.

272
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,466
I only found out
a couple of weeks ago, Dad.

273
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,886
Dad, I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

274
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,854
That's why she reached out to us
after all of these years.

275
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,984
She wanted us to know before...

276
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,900
- She...
- Before she died.

277
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,990
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

278
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,331
I gotta get to work.

279
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,163
Dad, listen... Dad.

280
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,666
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,129
Just let me sit with it.

282
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,136
Do you think that he's gonna be okay?

283
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,304
I do, yeah, I think...

284
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,769
It's just a lot to take in.

285
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,809
He just needs a little time
to process it.

286
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,355
Ho-ho-ho.

287
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,032
Hmm.

288
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,243
Cocoa isn't cocoa without
the mini marshmallows.

289
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,207
And you're out. I checked.

290
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,630
Are you out of your mind,
breaking into my home?

291
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:00,418
Careful. Made an upgrade to the cold gun.

292
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,462
If I release my grip from the handle,
the core goes critical.

293
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,349
You might make it. She won't.

294
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,725
Read your article
on the disappearing middle class.

295
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,941
Strong point of view.
Nice prose style.

296
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:20,649
Yeah, well, who needs a Pulitzer

297
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,235
when you have a homicidal
maniac's seal of approval.

298
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,868
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

299
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,370
Everyone in this room had
a rough childhood. Get over it.

300
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,745
Why are you here, Snart?

301
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,500
I got the Noel spirit,
wanted to give you a gift.

302
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,126
Mardon broke Jesse and me out to kill you.

303
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,584
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

304
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,419
Me, I'm gonna pass.

305
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,834
Why? You grow a conscience?

306
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,423
Mardon wants revenge.
Jesse wants chaos.

307
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,054
I'm just not invested like they are.

308
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,057
You mean there's no money
in it for you?

309
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,217
I was never much
for non-profit work.

310
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,385
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

311
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,772
Nah, consider me more
of a secret Santa.

312
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,355
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

313
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,769
(CHUCKLES)

314
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,443
You are full of it, Snart.

315
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,529
I think my friends
and I saved your sister's life,

316
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,818
and you just can't stand
owing me a marker.

317
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,411
I hate to break it to you, but that...
that right there is called honor.

318
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,951
Go on. Make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

319
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,958
Help me stop them.

320
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,171
Sorry. I'm not interested in being a hero.

321
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,459
(SCOFFS)

322
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,797
Well, you're doing a pretty lousy job
of being a villain this week.

323
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,883
Merry Christmas, Barry.

324
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:41,435
Hey.

325
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,154
I was just thinking about a big drug bust

326
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,990
that me and Singh made about 10 years ago.

327
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,913
Afterward, we went for a steak lunch,

328
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,498
to treat ourselves for a job well done.

329
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:03,086
And while we were ordering,
I got this feeling in my chest.

330
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,250
Like my heart was being squeezed.

331
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,836
And I knew something wasn't right.

332
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,971
So I called your school

333
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,134
and the nurse said to me that
she was just about to call me.

334
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,807
Iris was on her way to the hospital.

335
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,314
When her appendix burst.

336
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,974
And I knew it.
I could feel it, right here.

337
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,440
I knew my kid needed me.

338
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,857
So, if I have that feeling as a parent,

339
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,527
why didn't I feel it for my son?

340
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,866
Joe, it's not your fault that
you didn't know about him.

341
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,623
Yeah, it was.

342
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,829
When Francine left rehab that last time,
I should've looked for her.

343
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,838
I'm a cop. I could've found her.

344
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,250
Brought her back here.

345
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,884
Tried again. Tried harder.

346
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,589
You were protecting Iris.

347
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,301
I've been telling
myself that for 20 years.

348
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,762
A 20-year lie. But I wasn't
protecting her. I was protecting myself.

349
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,644
I couldn't stand it anymore.

350
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,054
I couldn't...

351
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,984
I hated not being able to help Francine.

352
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,436
So it was easier

353
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,284
for her to be dead.
Out of my life. Out of our lives.

354
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,782
But it wasn't for Iris.

355
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,455
I was being selfish.

356
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,118
And that poor boy
paid the price.

357
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,536
Joe.

358
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,292
He never had a father

359
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,502
to read to him at night,
to show him how to throw a football,

360
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,592
to make him feel safe.

361
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,423
And loved.

362
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,346
Who taught him how to be a man, Barry?

363
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,601
"Him," I can't even say his name.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,777
What have I done?

365
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,826
Joe, look,

366
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:59,825
you have been there for me
every day since I met you.

367
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,291
You have.

368
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,412
And...

369
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,467
You would've done the exact same thing
for him if you could've. I know it.

370
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,837
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,263
Where's your partner, Spivot?

372
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,555
I don't know,
I'm not his babysitter.

373
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,145
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure where Joe is.

374
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,563
Flashy the red-nosed Speedster

375
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,482
Had a very shiny suit

376
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,199
And if you ever saw him

377
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,036
You might even want to puke
(GRUNTS)

378
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,873
Merry Christmas, kiddywinks! I'm back.

379
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,880
Get TARU down here now.
I wanna know how he's doing this.

380
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,381
Citizens,

381
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,887
you know, the holidays can be a time
for gentle reflection on the year past,

382
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,800
our ups and downs,
our triumphs and heartaches,

383
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,847
but don't forget, they can also be a time
for disemboweling our enemies.

384
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,766
We don't have a Trickster on Earth-2.

385
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,979
He's one of a kind.

386
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,565
No, my stocking won't be
completely stuffed

387
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:15,324
until it's filled to the brim
with bloody Flash parts.

388
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:20,955
So what do you say, speed freak?
You want to roast chestnuts?

389
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,041
I want all tactical units on high alert.
Get in touch with other precincts.

390
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,499
I want watch commanders
coordinating deployment.

391
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,459
Spivot, I need you to... Spivot!

392
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,291
Are there any clues
as to where he is based on the video?

393
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,549
None that I can see.

394
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,548
Guys, there's a reflection
of something in his cornea. See?

395
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,933
What is that?

396
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,308
Not sure.

397
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,477
That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

398
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,061
- Come again?
- It's a doll.

399
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:52,104
A stuffed children's toy. I gave one to
my daughter when she was six.

400
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,738
Mr. Jiggle Wiggle
was manufactured by Okamura Toys.

401
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,650
Yahtzee! Okamura once had
a shipping facility in Central City

402
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,036
That shut down four years ago.
It's been abandoned ever since.

403
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,866
What if Weather Wizard's there?
The wand's not finished.

404
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:03,905
Well, the Trickster is.

405
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,135
THE FLASH: What are you doing here?

406
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,050
Same thing as you.
Trying to catch a murderer.

407
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,099
JAMES: We can't let Christmas
hog all the holiday fun.

408
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,689
Happy Hanukkah!

409
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:35,107
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel

410
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,943
I made you out of C-4!

411
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,275
(LAUGHING)

412
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,988
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

413
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:59,212
I'm afraid we are definitely looking
at closed casket funerals. (CHUCKLES)

414
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,924
There's nowhere for me to run us to!

415
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,259
So what should we do?

416
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,549
Hold me.

417
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,718
I'm seeing someone.

418
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,261
Me too. Don't let go.

419
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,368
- Detective!
- It was all just a trap for you.

420
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,825
Mardon and Jesse aren't even here.
They're still on the loose.

421
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,330
How did you know to come here?

422
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,083
Because there was a reflection in
Jesse's eye of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

423
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,835
And that's the thing that my dad...

424
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,125
It doesn't even matter.

425
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,664
That's why you came here alone

426
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,709
without any backup?
Because of your father?

427
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,719
You don't know anything about me.

428
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,006
I know that
you're being reckless.

429
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,846
And I'm sure the people in you
life care enough about you

430
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,601
To not want to see you get hurt.

431
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,104
Except Mardon
didn't kill my father.

432
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,013
I did.

433
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,979
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

434
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,690
so I worked there after school.
Except, one day,

435
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,196
I decided not to show up because...

436
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,734
because I was being stupid
and silly with my friends.

437
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,324
I didn't even call
to tell him that I was ditching.

438
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:11,209
So he brought
the deposits to the bank, not me.

439
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,542
He was shot and killed by Mardon, not me.

440
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,461
That's why you became a cop.
Joined the meta-human task force.

441
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,800
It'll be legal when I kill Mardon.

442
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,933
I have made my whole life about
getting justice for my father,

443
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,015
even if it meant I didn't have a life.

444
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,855
And now, I met a really great guy,
and that doesn't even feel real to me.

445
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,892
And I'm scared
he's gonna find out how angry I am.

446
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,357
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

447
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,900
Sometimes it's just easier to say
things to someone with no face.

448
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,617
Thank you for saving me.

449
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,496
You know, even if you get
this guy that wronged you,

450
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,077
It doesn't always make things better.

451
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,834
It has to be better than this.

452
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,212
(ENGINE STARTS)

453
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:09,386
BARRY: Patty, it's me again, uh...

454
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,476
I'd really love to talk.
I'm worried about you.

455
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,228
Anyway, just give me a call
when you get a chance, all right?

456
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,267
Thank you. Bye.

457
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,778
- Barry.
- Yeah?

458
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,564
How's it look?

459
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,941
- Eerily familiar.
- (CHUCKLES)

460
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,108
How's Patty?

461
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,369
She is, um,

462
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,117
hiding a lot of pain behind her smile.

463
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,875
They say couples start to resemble
each other after a little while.

464
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,246
The thing is, I mean,
she only opened up to Flash, not me.

465
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,460
So even if I could got her on the phone,
I don't know what to say.

466
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:42,207
Well,

467
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,344
it's been my experience that just
being around you can be a big help.

468

00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,414
(WEEPING)

630
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,675
- Barr, hey.
- Hey.

631
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,184
Everyone's heading over to our
place for Christmas. You okay?

632
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,346
Yeah. No. Nothing a little meta-human

633
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,684
regenerative healing
capabilities won't cure.

634
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,396
- (LAUGHING)
- How did it go with Francine?

635
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,527
It was good.
It was really good, actually.

636
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:09,525
I mean, I spent so long
lying about her being dead

637
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,652
that I started to believe it myself.

638
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,070
But the truth is, those feelings
were always there.

639
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,864
That anger, that regret,
the guilt...

640
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,494
(SIGHS) I just didn't realize
how much I needed to forgive her.

641
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,670
And now, there's room for another West.

642
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:27,500
Did you meet him?

643
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,590
No. He still doesn't know.

644
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,713
- That'll come.
- Wow.

645
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,175
- You have a son.
- I know, right?

646
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,467
It's crazy.

647
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,432
Speaking of which, take this.

648
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,230
What?

649
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:42,061
No, no, no, no,
I can't take that.

650
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,442
I've always said

651
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,646
that one day, I would give this to my son.

652
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,867
And now I have.

653
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,452
Merry Christmas.

654
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,498
Merry Christmas. Thank you.

655
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:07,668
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

656
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,253
- See you at the house.
- Yeah.

657
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:22,889
(SIGHS)

658
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:25,766
I know that you're not him,

659
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:31,489
but he's not here
and I have to say this, for me.

660
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,070
In that video message,

661
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,114
You said that,

662
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,536
that I would never really be happy.

663
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,543
And I've been trying.
I've been trying really hard.

664
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,916
(SIGHS)

665
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,260
After what Joe said,

666
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,722
helping Patty.

667
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,760
I realize that you are still in my heart.

668
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,146
How much I hate you

669
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,318
for what you've done. (SNIFFLES)

670
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,574
I don't want to hate you anymore. I can't.

671
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,619
I can't hate you anymore.

672
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,458
I forgive you.

673
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,748
(BEEPING)

674
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,376
You need me for something?

675
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,137
No, no, I'm good.

676
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:42,097
You know, you should, uh,
come over for Christmas tonight.

677
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,978
You shouldn't be alone.

678
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,643
It's a nice offer.

679
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,398
I can't celebrate without my daughter.

680
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:52,815
All right.

681
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,369
(CHUCKLES)

682
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,661
- Strong enough?
- We'll see.

683
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,295
Huh. (LAUGHS)

684
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,215
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

685
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:13,958
Hey.

686
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,217
What do you have there?

687
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,668
Mistletoe.

688
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:17,836
What's mistletoe?

689
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,597
Oh, uh, it's a hemi-parasitic plant
from the genus Santalaceae family,

690
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,885
in North America, I think.

691
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,931
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have mistletoe on Earth-2.

692
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,268
Right. Of course. (CHUCKLES)

693
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,978
Urn, we also have
this tradition over there.

694
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:39,949
We have that tradition here, too.

695
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,322
- JOE: Aw!
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

696
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,704
- Finally.
- Oh, let me get that.

697
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:44,989
- Eggnog, please?
- Yeah.

698
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,623
Hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

699
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,034
Aw, thank you for having me.

700
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,418
Merry Christmas.
This is for you.

701
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,748
- Thank you.
- Of course.

702
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,039
- Hey.
- Hi.

703
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,083
I've been really worried
about you. I've been calling.

704
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,594
I know... and I'm really sorry.

705
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:01,552
I just have been dealing
with something by myself,

706
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,469
But I want to tell you about it.
I think that I'm ready to.

707
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,728
Someone reminded me of what's important,

708
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,141
so if you want to hear, I
would like to share it with you.

709
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:12,775
That would be the best gift I could get.

710
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:13,981
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

711
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,862
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

712
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,864
(LAUGHING)
I hope it's as sweet as this one.

713
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,114
It's matching.

714
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,322
- Thank you.
- Of course.

715
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,579
- Detective Spivot.
- Hi!

716
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,862
What brings you here?

717
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,577
Merry Christmas.

718
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:32,085
Well, uh, I'm...
Barry's girlfriend.

719
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,623
- About time.
- Cheers.

720
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,880
(KNOCKING)

721
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,175
- Are we expecting anybody else?
- Not that I know of.

722
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,007
Maybe Harry changed his mind.

723
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,514
Hi. I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

724
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,655
(STAMMERING) I'm Joe.

725
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,326
This is Iris.

726
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

727
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:10,666
I just wanted to...

728
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:14,829
I don't know.

729
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,623
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

730
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:20,168
No. No, no, no. Come in.

731
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,402
Time's up, Wells. What's it going to be?

732
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,197
DR. WELLS: I know what you're doing.

733
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,579
I know why you keep sending villain
after villain from our Earth to this one.

734
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:58,623
You want Barry to get faster.
You want him to get stronger.

735
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:05,429
You want him to become more powerful,
more full of Speed Force.

736
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,766
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

737
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,559
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

738
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:20,568
And you're going to help me.

739
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:24,398
Let me see her first.

740
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,077
(GASP) Daddy?

741
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,496
(CRYING)

742
00:41:34,282 --> 00:41:36,501
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

743
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,914
Please help me.
Don't let him take me back there.

744
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,422
I won't.

745
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,963
ZOOM: Now decide.

746
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:48,097
In return
for your daughter's life...

747
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,099
I'll do it.

748
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,432
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.
