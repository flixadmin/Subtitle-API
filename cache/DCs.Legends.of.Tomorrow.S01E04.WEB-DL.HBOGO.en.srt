1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,120
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,760
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,480
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,200
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,880
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,080
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>but if we succeed,
they will be remembered as legends.</i>

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,200
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,440
His name is Chronos.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,480
He works for the Council
of Time Masters.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,600
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
The Lazarus Pit brought me back,

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,240
but it left me
with this need to kill.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,560
Sara! Sara, don't!

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,880
I'm dangerous.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Up until two months ago,

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,960
I was a barista, not some damn
winged demigoddess.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,200
Be the person, the woman,
the warrior you were meant to be.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,040
That wasn't so bad, was it?

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,240
Walk in the park.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
So where are we now?

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,360
Washington, D.C.
The year is 1986.

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,560
We've landed at the height
of the Cold War

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,080
in a world poised
for nuclear annihilation.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
<i>We've traveled here
because I have a new lead</i>

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
<i>on Vandal Savage's location.</i>

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,040
Yes. Gideon managed to intercept
this telefax concerning

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,320
Savage's last known whereabouts.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
Tele-what?

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,320
It's like an email on paper.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Wow, that's totally useless.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Dude, this whole thing's crossed out.

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,040
Yeah, redacted
by the U.S. government,

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,280
which is why we are here
to steal the original file

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,920
on Savage back from those
who are tracking him.

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,800
That's the...

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,840
Now, now...

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,720
Don't worry. We are cloaked.

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,000
You want us to break in
to the Pentagon?

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Sounds awesome.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,080
It sounds crazy.

43
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
What's the plan?

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,920
Oh, the Fabricator will fashion you
the necessary Pentagon credentials.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,240
And don't forget our G-man disguises.

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
I always wanted to be a spy.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,400
Now, the file we're after is kept
in a secure records room.

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,040
In order to gain access,
we're going to need to,

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
borrow a magnetic key card.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Because this is so much easier

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,080
{\an5}than just shrinking down
and stealing it.

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Let me show you how it's done...

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
old school.

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
You okay, ma'am?

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
I wasn't watching where I was going.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
{\an5}- Thank you.
- Just doing my job.

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
That's a nifty little trick.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Really?

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,880
We're trying to save the world
and you're lifting wallets?

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
It's called multitasking.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
The records room
has closed-circuit cameras.

62
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,160
We need a diversion.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
Someone call my name?

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Yeah!

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,800
{\an5}Double or nothing says
I put this punk on the pinewood.

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Yeah, I'll take
a piece of that action.

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>We got the file.</i>

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,880
Okay, now for the tricky part.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,200
All personnel are subject to search
upon exiting the Pentagon.

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,120
Firestorm will divert the power
long enough for you to exit.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
Ready when you are.

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,640
<i>All clear.</i>

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,440
<i>What did you do, Jefferson?</i>

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,640
<i>I warned you
about the electromagnetic pulse.</i>

75
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,680
<i>Now you've touched a neutral wire,
causing the power to pass through us.</i>

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
You mean, "Pass through me."

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,120
{\an5}<i>If you knew anything
about alternating current power...</i>

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,880
{\an5}- Gray?
<i>- Yes, Jefferson?</i>

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
Shut up.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
The alarm!

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
This is a restricted exit.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
Sorry, we must have gotten lost.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm going to need to see
your key card, ma'am.

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
We have a Code Seven violation.

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
We have a slight problem.

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,080
It's been fun, fellas.

87
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Back!

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
Where is that smoke coming from?

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
{\an5}We've got the file. What the hell
does Kendra think she's doing?

90
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
Good question.

91
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,520
{\an5}All right, wonderful,
we've got a demigoddess

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
who's gone completely berserk.

93
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Abort. I repeat, abort.

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
Get back to ship right now.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Roger that.

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
I meant, "Use the door,"
but while you're at it,

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
can you help return
our winged avenger to her cage?

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,160
Instead of dwelling
on what went wrong,

99
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,520
let's focus on the positive.

100
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,440
What are you talking about?
It was awesome.

101
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,920
In the same way
that tsunamis, earthquakes,

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,040
and other natural disasters
are "awesome."

103
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
We got the file on Savage.

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Despite the hiccup with the alarm?

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Oh, so it's my fault now?

106
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,360
{\an5}You know, maybe if you weren't
always yammering away in my head,

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
I could actually focus.

108
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an5}You have access to 60 years
of knowledge and experience.

109
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Why not just take advantage of that?

110
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,640
{\an5}Because it's my body
on the line out there, not yours.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Hey, it's not your fault.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,840
{\an5}Everything would have been fine
if Big Bird over here

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,240
{\an5}- hadn't freaked out.
- Excuse me?

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Enough.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,160
There is plenty of blame
to go around.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,720
{\an5}Now, fortunately, Gideon was able
to generate a low-end EMP,

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
which erased all the Pentagon's
magnetic media.

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,880
Like security footage?

119
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
Look, you're just lucky
that the Department of Defense

120
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,840
likes to keep incidents
like this under wraps.

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,600
Gideon, any luck
with our purloined secret file?

122
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,440
- Please say yes.
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>

123
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,760
<i>According to the Pentagon,</i>

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,040
<i>Savage has defected
to the Soviet Union.</i>

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,560
{\an5}So the most powerful evil
the world has ever known

126
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,040
{\an5}has just gone red
at the height of the Cold War.

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,320
And now he's gonna help them
cook up something

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
that kills the future.

129
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
Gideon, set a course...

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,520
for the Soviet Union.

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,000
{\an5}<i>Captain, we've just crossed
into Soviet airspace.</i>

132
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Don't worry, Jefferson,

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
{\an5}we are moving far too fast
for anyone to track us.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,880
{\an5}<i>I'm afraid that's not true.
Someone is tracking us.</i>

135
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
I thought this ship was cloaked.

136
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
<i>It is.</i>

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Boba Fett's back.

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
Chronos must have followed us

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
{\an5}when we made the jump
from the '70s.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,240
Sir, we have a lock on the WaveRider.

141
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,040
Prepare to fire.

142
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
<i>He's closing fast.</i>

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
<i>Captain,
what would you like me to do?</i>

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,680
{\an5}Slow down, drop our cloak,
and make as much noise as possible.

145
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
{\an5}Whoa, that's, like,
top three on the list of things

146
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,800
we definitely shouldn't do.

147
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,440
Just trust me.

148
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
We run out of gas or something?

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
<i>Chronos is still in pursuit.</i>

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
<i>Weapons systems tracking.</i>

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,520
Look, if this is your idea
of trying to lose him, then...

152
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,000
The Soviet Air Force to the rescue.

153
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Now, let's see how badly
Chronos wants to follow us.

154
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
Wow, it's a MiG-21.

155
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
No one's ever been this close
to one before.

156
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,120
- Are you quoting <i>Top Gun?</i>
- Maybe.

157
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,840
<i>I've got heat-seeking missiles</i>

158
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,760
<i>closing at a distance
of less than a mile.</i>

159
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
Which is why I need you
to cut the engines.

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Whoa, wait, don't
we need those to land?

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
I said, "Cut them," Gideon.

162
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
<i>Missiles are now targeting
something else.</i>

163
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Chronos.

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,080
I suggest you
all strap yourselves in.

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
It's going to be a bit
of a bumpy landing.

166
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,080
<i>Initiating emergency landing
protocol.</i>

167
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,440
- How's it going, Gideon?
<i>- There's not much more I can do.</i>

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,920
<i>Elevation is 5,000. 4,000. 3,000.</i>

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
When I said, "bumpy,"
I meant, "Prepare for crash landing."

170
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
<i>Good news, Captain.</i>

171
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,480
<i>Despite our rough landing,
the ship is still fully operational.</i>

172
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,480
Welcome to the U.S.S.R., gentlemen.

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,400
If it were up to me, they would
revoke your pilot's license.

174
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,760
"They" are more than welcome to,
considering I don't have one.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Did you get anything on Savage
from the Pentagon file?

176
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
It appears our friend
has been quite busy

177
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
since we last saw him.

178
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Svarog?

179
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,880
God of fire in Slavic mythology;

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,360
a secret project
the Soviets are working on.

181
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,520
Considering Savage's involvement,
most likely some sort of weapon.

182
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
Valentina Vostok.

183
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,920
Graduated top of her physics program

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,880
and then just dropped
out of academia.

185
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,320
To help develop
Savage's new weapon, no doubt.

186
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,720
The Cold War's up for grabs,
and Miss Vostok is the linchpin.

187
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
I say we put two in the back
of her head and call it a day.

188
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,480
We have no idea who this woman is
or what her effect may be on history.

189
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,440
She may be the next Madame Curie
for all we know.

190
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,640
She's working for Savage.

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
That's all we need to know.

192
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,920
She probably has no idea
who's backing her research.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,280
Just let me approach her
as a scientist,

194
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,320
and we'll see what she knows
about Savage's weapons program.

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,000
It's 1986, you're American,
and you don't speak Russian.

196
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
She'll have you pegged
as a spy in a second.

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Perhaps I can help with that.

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,560
Ingestible translators.

199
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,960
They attach to your larynx
via neural interface.

200
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
Swallow them;
you can speak and understand

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
any language spoken to you.

202
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,400
How, how do you turn it on?

203
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
Gideon? Switch them into Russian.

204
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,360
Go on. Say something.

205
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,680
Wait, I'm still speaking English.

206
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm speaking Russian now, aren't I?

207
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Now you're annoying
in multiple languages.

208
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
Gideon, switch him back to English.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,960
Now, according to Vostok's file,
she's a big fan of the ballet.

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,400
She has box seats at the Bolshoi
and attends every performance.

211
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,560
{\an5}<i>It seems the final performance
of</i>Le Roi Candaule<i>is today.</i>

212
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,960
Dr. Palmer, you will engage Vostok

213
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,840
at the ballet,
whilst you, Mr. Snart...

214
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
you're going to be his wingman.

215
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,960
Better go bone up on Vostok's CV.

216
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,560
I guess I'll bone up on the ballet.

217
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Gideon, bone me.

218
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
We have a problem.

219
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,280
Right, you're going to have
to be a little bit more specific.

220
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,440
It's Kendra.

221
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,320
She's completely unstable;
you saw her at the Pentagon.

222
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,120
That psycho priestess
Chay-Ara took over

223
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
and clawed a guard's eyes out.

224
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,840
Perhaps Kendra
just needs a bit of time.

225
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,280
Remember, it was her first time out
in the field since Carter's death.

226
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
Well, Carter's not going to be
the only dead body on our hands

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,400
if someone doesn't get her
under control.

228
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,760
You know, perhaps you're right,
and it just so happens

229
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,760
I have the perfect candidate
for the job.

230
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
No.

231
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,080
No, I was not talking about me.

232
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,920
And yet, I can think of no one
better suited to the task.

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,720
I'm not a fan of feelings.

234
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,080
If Kendra needs someone
to talk through her grief with...

235
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,360
Kendra needs someone to help her
get her warrior side under control.

236
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
I imagine you, above anyone else,
know how to do that.

237
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,560
This is a bad idea.

238
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,640
I got eyes on Vostok.

239
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
She's headed straight for you,
lover boy.

240
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
All right, gentlemen.

241
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,280
Everything's looking good
from my end.

242
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Proceed.

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ms. Vostok.

244
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,960
Simon Huntsberger,
University of Moscow

245
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
physics department.

246
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm not interested
in talking to student.

247
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,160
If you want lecture,
come by office hours.

248
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm actually a fellow scientist.

249
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,160
I read your paper on applied physics
and nuclear fusion.

250
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
Perhaps, if you allow me
to take you to dinner,

251
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,960
we can discuss in detail.

252
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Damn, that was cold,
even by Russian standards.

253
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Heads-up.

254
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
What the hell is this?

255
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,520
Warriors train every day.

256
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

257
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,400
"Sorry" is not gonna help
that guard that you defaced

258
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
at the Pentagon.

259
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,600
Two months ago, I was a barista.

260
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
I had no idea
I had some psycho hawk goddess

261
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,320
inside of me, and then I meet Carter,
and he convinces me

262
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
to let her out,
and now that he's gone...

263
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,920
I can't control it,
so thanks for the offer,

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,680
but I won't risk
letting that monster out again.

265
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,480
That monster inside you
is not gonna go away.

266
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,480
You have to learn how to control her.

267
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,400
And how, exactly,
do you expect me to do that?

268
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Let's find out.

269
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,760
<i>Temporal anomaly detected.</i>

270
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,480
- Chronos.
<i>- The Russian jet damaged his ship.</i>

271
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
He's still alive?

272
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,360
<i>He went down just outside
Moscow city limits.</i>

273
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
Mr. Rory, how would you like
to accompany me on a little mission?

274
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,120
Will I get to use my gun?

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,880
A near-certain likelihood.

276
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
Lead the way, Captain.

277
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,200
You struck out, Raymond.

278
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
Maybe I should take a crack at her.

279
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
I think we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

280
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
- I don't mean to bother you...
- Too late.

281
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,960
But, as an investor,

282
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
I'm in a position
to fund your research.

283
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
That is why I wanted us to meet.

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
Easy, Raymond,
you're gonna spook her.

285
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,440
I think it's important to know
who's funding your research,

286
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,920
don't you think?

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
For instance...

288
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,640
Project Svarog.

289
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,760
Sorry, is this man bothering you?

290
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,560
Don't trouble yourself.
I'm not a damsel in distress.

291
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Good, because I'm not a white knight.

292
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,960
Seems intermission is over.

293
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,880
You wouldn't want to miss
Queen Nisia dancing naked

294
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
with the nymphs.

295
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
My favorite part of the ballet...

296
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,800
but I've seen it so many times.

297
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,120
Perhaps, you wouldn't mind
walking me home instead.

298
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,960
I hate nature.

299
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
Thirty meters.

300
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,720
Chronos must be hiding out
in the trees.

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

302
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,720
Time Master Druce,
how on earth did you find me?

303
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
You haven't exactly been subtle.

304
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
Can I waste this guy?

305
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
Could you give us a moment?

306
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
You said I'd get to use my gun.

307
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,520
What a colorful team
you've assembled for yourself.

308
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,640
I thought that you were...

309
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Chronos?

310
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,480
He was killed in the crash,
I'm afraid.

311
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,560
I was sent to scuttle his time ship,
lest it be discovered by the Soviets.

312
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,360
And you left a temporal anomaly.

313
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,720
To lure you out of the cold,
as it were.

314
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,280
You've turned your back
on the very institution

315
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
you were meant to serve.

316
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,200
Our job is to protect time,
thereby protecting all life.

317
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,720
I am trying to save the world
from complete destruction.

318
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
You and your band of rogues
have run rampant throughout history.

319
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,640
This is why we work alone, Rip.

320
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
A team is a liability;
you've proven that.

321
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
They keep you from making
the tough choices.

322
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,000
I am here because the council refused
to make that tough choice.

323
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,960
Well, they can sometimes
be slow to realize the obvious,

324
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,520
but I've been authorized
to offer you a deal.

325
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
End this foolish crusade;

326
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,880
return with me
to the vanishing point.

327
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,240
You'll be acquitted
of all charges, and in...

328
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
a few hundred years,
we may even be able to fix

329
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,680
the damage you've caused.

330
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
And what about my team?

331
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,600
They will be returned
to their own timelines unharmed,

332
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
which is more than I can say
for Carter Hall.

333
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,680
You were one of my brightest pupils
and by far my favorite.

334
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,080
Will you at least consider my offer?

335
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
I'll consult with my comrades.

336
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Please do, Rip...

337
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,240
and then meet me here in an hour.

338
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
And if I don't?

339
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,760
Then you're beyond my help.

340
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
That's a pretty sweet deal

341
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,040
"Time Cop" offered you back there.

342
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,840
Well, I see we can add
"eavesdropping"

343
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,560
to your criminal resume.

344
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,240
Maybe you should start
thinking more like a crook.

345
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,280
Your friend's planning
on killing you.

346
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
Time Master Druce is one
of my most trusted friends;

347
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
besides, if he wanted
to do me any harm,

348
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,000
why didn't he do it just now
when he had the chance?

349
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,240
Because he wants you to bring
the whole team with you...

350
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
and that's not gonna happen,
because I'm taking a pass.

351
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,800
Are we done here yet?

352
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,960
If you want to harness your power,

353
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,680
you need to learn
to control your fear.

354
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Yeah, well, you've been training
for half your life

355
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
to be some cold- blooded assassin,

356
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,760
so I really don't think
you understand what it's like.

357
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
Before you can control it,

358
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,240
you have to accept
that it's part of you.

359
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,960
- Ease up, will you?
- You've got to channel your anger.

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,080
Sara, stop.

361
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Push down your emotions.

362
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,160
Focus on your opponent.

363
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Kendra?

364
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,200
Sara!

365
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Sara, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry...

366
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
Sara, what are you doing?

367
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
It's me!

368
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,920
Are you sure
you don't want your coat back?

369
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,240
I can't believe
how you're not freezing.

370
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,920
Oh, I love the cold.

371
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And ballet.

372
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,960
So what is it about the ballet
that you love, Valentina?

373
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,800
The combination
of grace and strength,

374
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
pushing the body
to its breaking point.

375
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,480
It's a thing of beauty.

376
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
My apartment.

377
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,880
You know, this time of night,
it's colder than a Siberian winter.

378
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,720
It sounds perfect.

379
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,600
You know, I'm sure
we could heat it up.

380
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,520
Sadly, I have business
elsewhere this evening.

381
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Well...

382
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,080
if this is good-bye...

383
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
You enjoy the show, Raymond?

384
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,000
I think I've got frostbite
in some not-so-fun places

385
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,120
from waiting out here.

386
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
Did she tell you what kind of weapon

387
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Savage is building?

388
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Didn't come up.

389
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,760
Such a romantic evening;
I didn't want to spoil the mood.

390
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,080
So other a steamy good night kiss
and a possible case of hypothermia,

391
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
we've got nothing.

392
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,840
I wouldn't say that.

393
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,240
It's Valentina's security badge
for a place called Luskavic Labs.

394
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,080
Whatever weapon she's building
for Savage, we'll find it there.

395
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
I guess I should just be happy
you didn't swipe her wallet.

396
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,240
So, what happens?

397
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,800
You hand over the ship
and turn yourself in

398
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,560
to the Time Masters,
and the rest of us just...

399
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Will be returned to your former lives
in January 2016.

400
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,800
It will be as if you never left.

401
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,280
Aside from the fact
that Starling City might be part

402
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,440
of the U.S.S.R.,
thanks to our efforts.

403
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,320
All the more reason
to consider the offer.

404
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,560
The Time Council will do
everything within their power

405
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,440
to correct the mistakes
that we've made.

406
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
But they still haven't
changed their mind

407
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
about stopping Savage?

408
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,720
Well, according to them, he's part
of the natural course of history,

409
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,680
terrible as that course may be.

410
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Look, I'm not saying that this offer
is without its downsides.

411
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,600
If we abandon our plan now,
then I still lose my wife and son.

412
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,080
So why throw in the towel?

413
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,440
I thought you said this mission
was bigger than any one of us.

414
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes, but if you'll remember,
when I first recruited you,

415
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,880
I wasn't entirely forthright
about my motivations

416
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,360
or about how dangerous
this mission would be.

417
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,640
Carter Hall knew the risks
before he signed on.

418
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,280
Well, for the rest of you,
it's now time to decide

419
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,040
whether the future
is worth fighting for.

420
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,600
I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to see you, Hunter.

421
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,880
I finally came to my senses.

422
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,600
You were right, as always.

423
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,160
I've risked the lives of my team;

424
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,560
I've endangered the very fabric
of time itself.

425
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,200
I only hope you can forgive me.

426
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,120
All will soon be made right again.

427
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Hello, old friend.

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm so sorry
it had to turn out this way,

429
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,200
but the council cannot risk
keeping you alive.

430
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,680
Such a shame.

431
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,480
I won't be able to tell Mick
he was right.

432
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,800
- Mick?
- My colorful friend,

433
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,080
who was convinced
you were planning on killing me.

434
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Your friends seem to have
abandoned you, but no matter.

435
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Chronos will track them down.

436
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,240
Can't believe you brought this stooge
to do your dirty work.

437
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,440
I never had you pegged
as a coward, Druce.

438
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,840
In that case, I promise to stay here

439
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,160
to ensure that your punishment
is carried out properly.

440
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,160
I wouldn't want you to die alone.

441
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,320
Who says I'm alone?

442
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
What a wuss.

443
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
<i>This is not the time to show off.</i>

444
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,680
<i>It's best if we attack
from a covered position.</i>

445
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,080
I'm through playing it safe.

446
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,800
This time, we do things my way.

447
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
Run, punk! Run!

448
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,600
Jefferson!

449
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,960
Where is he? Chronos' blast
forced us to separate.

450
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,520
I... I didn't see where he landed.

451
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Jax!

452
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
Jefferson!

453
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,240
All right, no need to shout;
I'm right here.

454
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,880
There you are;
thank God you're okay.

455
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,360
Why didn't you answer
when I called you?

456
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,160
Did it not occur to you
that I'd be worried?

457
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
Look, I just got a little lost.

458
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,760
We need to get him
to the med bay now.

459
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Oh, gentlemen,

460
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,520
I trust everything went according
to plan at the Bolshoi?

461
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,280
Piece of cake. Made contact
with Vostok and swiped her badge.

462
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,560
Thanks to me.
Pretty boy just froze his ass off.

463
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
What happened to him?

464
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Chronos.

465
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
- Jax here was...
- Almost got himself killed.

466
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,040
And we need to get you
to the med bay.

467
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,720
The med bay,
where a morphine drip awaits me.

468
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Now just try and take it slowly.

469
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,800
Don't bother telling him what to do;
he'll just do the opposite.

470
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,640
Oh, yeah, it would be my fault
that I got hurt,

471
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,920
because I didn't listen to you
in your infinite wisdom.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,360
I am sorry, professor.

473
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
Exactly.

474
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,440
It seems this partnership
of ours has become untenable.

475
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,000
Partnership?
No, this is a dictatorship,

476
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,920
one in which you get
to call all the shots

477
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,320
and I get to take all the shots.

478
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440
Do you think I like seeing you hurt?

479
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,720
Don't act like you actually
care about me, man.

480
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
I'm just a life-support system.

481
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,480
I didn't even want to come
on this stupid trip.

482
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,320
- You kidnapped me.
- Oh, this old tune.

483
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,880
Did you ever stop to think
that I actually had a life

484
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
back in 2016?

485
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,400
I almost forgot: a promising career
as an auto mechanic.

486
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,600
I had a mom...

487
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
a widow.

488
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,120
What happens to her
if something happens to me in 1986?

489
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,200
She's just gonna think
that I left her

490
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,480
without even saying good-bye.

491
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,440
Man, do you have any idea
what that does to her?

492
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
We've all made sacrifices.

493
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
But can't you see that this mission,

494
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,280
stopping Savage,
is bigger than any one of us?

495
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
I am so sick of you using that tone.

496
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,160
When are you gonna learn
you are not my father?

497
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,880
I'm sorry you lost him
at such a tender age,

498
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,040
but if your father were here,
right now,

499
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,840
he'd be saying what I'm saying.

500
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,960
Just grow up, Jefferson.

501
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,440
The future of the world is at stake,

502
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,160
and if you insist
on getting yourself killed,

503
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,680
as terrible as that might be
for your mother, or me,

504
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
who, incidentally, would also die,

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,280
I am more concerned
with the billions of people

506
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,280
who will die because of your
arrogant adolescent ego!

507
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Okay.

508
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,200
Please don't, don't, don't say it.

509
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,240
I was cruel and unjustified,
and I, I said those things...

510
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,320
just for the sake of hurting him.

511
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,680
Why aren't you telling that to Jax?

512
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,360
I had to hurt him, Raymond;
it's the only way

513
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,600
I can get through to him.

514
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,120
I've tried everything else.

515
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Well, he's just a kid.

516
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
So was Ronald,
and look what happened to him.

517
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,600
Your former half of Firestorm.

518
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Yes.

519
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,920
I can't, I, I can't go through
this again.

520
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,200
I can't lose another.

521
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,960
The reason I'm constantly
lecturing Jefferson

522
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,280
is because I'm the one
who brought him along,

523
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,600
and if something happens...

524
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm the one
who has to go back to 2016

525
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
and tell his mother
that her little boy

526
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,960
is never coming home...

527
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,680
and I would rather die than do that.

528
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,000
That looks sore. What happened?

529
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,000
Maybe you should ask the lunatic
you put in charge of training me.

530
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,560
I, actually, I was hoping
that the arrangement

531
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
between you and Sara might be...

532
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,560
mutually beneficial.

533
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,160
You mean you knew
about this bloodlust thing?

534
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,360
It's the captain's job
to know everything on his ship.

535
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,720
Look, Sara went through hell
when she was resurrected,

536
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,280
and I was hoping
that you'd be able to...

537
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,760
coax out her human side
from the darkness of the Lazarus Pit.

538
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Why me?

539
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,560
Well, after 4,000 years
of reincarnation,

540
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,000
surely you know a thing
or two about rebirth.

541
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Heads up!

542
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Let's go.

543
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,120
"A warrior trains every day,"
remember?

544
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not a warrior,

545
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,600
and I tried to kill you the last time
we did this, remember?

546
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,080
"Tried" being the operative word.

547
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,360
Look, you want to know my theory?

548
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
No.

549
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,440
I think your problem
is the opposite of mine.

550
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,640
I need to learn to embrace
my inner hawk goddess,

551
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,400
but you, you need to learn
to embrace your human side.

552
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,680
And what if that side of me is gone?

553
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
What if she doesn't exist anymore?

554
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, only one way to find out.

555
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,760
What, are you baiting me?

556
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,320
No,

557
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
I'm training you.

558
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Come on.

559
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Are you scared?

560
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,160
Here we are, Luskavic Labs,

561
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,000
the secret facility
where Vostok works.

562
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,280
- So what's the plan?
- Simple.

563
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,120
We use Vostok's credentials
to enter the lab

564
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
and find out what she's building
on behalf of Savage.

565
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,120
Reconnaissance in a laboratory.

566
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Finally, my kind of mission.

567
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
No, no, no, hang on a minute;

568
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,040
Jefferson's still recovering
from his injuries.

569
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,840
This is hardly a job for Firestorm;
let him rest.

570
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm Dr. Gregor Gavrilov
of the State Council of Science,

571
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,960
and I'm here to inspect the facility.

572
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,680
I'm in and heading to the basement.

573
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,120
Here's hoping the key that Mr. Snart
stole off Valentina works.

574
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Oh, my God.

575
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,960
I know what Vostok is working on.

576
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,040
She's trying to build me.

577
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,560
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Savage has spent

578
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
<i>the last decade trying to level
the arms race against our team.</i>

579
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,760
Operation Svarog.

580
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,960
Slavic God of fire, of course.

581
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,120
He and Vostok...

582
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,040
are building a Soviet Firestorm.

583
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
They've already built a thermal core.

584
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,880
Professor, need I remind you,
this is a reconnaissance mission.

585
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,920
It's only a matter of time
before Vostok figures out

586
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,360
how to stabilize a Soviet Firestorm.

587
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,880
I'm not leaving without it.

588
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,000
It's the key
to building others just like me.

589
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,880
Yes, but perhaps you should
wait for the rest of the team.

590
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
<i>They're on their way.</i>

591
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,400
Are you familiar
with ultra-high-energy

592
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,720
cosmic rays, Captain?

593
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,720
The radiation released
inside this chamber

594
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,520
will kill anyone other than me.

595
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,920
Look, despite your impermeability
to nuclear energy,

596
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,880
you're still quite vulnerable
to bullets.

597
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,760
I just need someone
to take the core offline,

598
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,160
so I can remove it
safely and shield it.

599
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,280
<i>I'm all over it, professor.</i>

600
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
We're all over it.

601
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,640
<i>Remember, Dr. Palmer,
that shutting down the core</i>

602
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,960
<i>incorrectly can lead
to the creation of...</i>

603
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Strangeness, black holes,
and uncontrolled fusion reactions

604
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,480
that consume the universe?

605
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,800
See? I was listening
during class, professor.

606
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,600
How we doing, Boy Scout?

607
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,960
Point of fact,
I completed all 21 merit badges,

608
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,680
including nuclear science,
so I'm an Eagle Scout.

609
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
We got a problem.

610
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,760
Valentina's headed toward
the core containment unit.

611
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,440
The radiation Stein's about
to unleash, if she opens the door...

612
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
We're here to stop Savage
from building

613
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,640
a nuclear-powered superhero.

614
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,760
Saving some commie broad
ain't on the agenda.

615
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,080
Even if the radiation
doesn't kill her,

616
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Savage will, the second he finds out
the lab's been sabotaged.

617
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,400
Look, we gotta get her out of here.

618
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,520
Well, who's gonna shut down
the core, Raymond?

619
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,120
I skipped that merit badge.

620
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,320
Raymond, why is the thermal core
still running at full power?

621
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,040
I'll handle the core.
You handle Valentina.

622
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,360
You're willing to risk the mission
for a woman you barely know?

623
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,480
Be helpful to others.

624
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,840
It's the Scout motto.

625
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
30 seconds.

626
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,040
I'll get Vostok, you kill the power
for Stein, and, Raymond...

627
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
promise me.

628
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,040
Bad idea.

629
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
What are you doing here?

630
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,800
Believe me, I've been asking myself
the same question.

631
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,280
That night at the Bolshoi.

632
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,440
It was you who stole my keys.

633
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,880
And your wallet,
but it was nothing personal.

634
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,160
What the hell is that man doing?

635
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,360
He has no idea
what the core is capable of.

636
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,640
Relax.

637
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,640
He's the one who invented it.

638
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm the first person
to have ever seen

639
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,320
cosmic radiation with his own eyes.

640
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
You know, let's keep it that way.

641
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,200
Snart, you better keep Valentina out
of the core containment unit.

642
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
You used me.

643
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,240
You work for American government.

644
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm wanted
by the American government.

645
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,200
Does that count?

646
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,880
Look, I may be your white knight
just this once,

647
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,320
but that weapon
Savage has you building?

648
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,840
He's creating
a nuclear-powered monster.

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,440
I know.

650
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,320
It was sweet of you to think of me
as a damsel in distress, but...

651
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm not the one who needs rescuing.

652
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,320
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.

653
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm not the sentimental type.

654
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,160
No, but your partner, the physicist
with the big brown eyes, is.

655
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,680
<i>Turn the core back online.</i>

656
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,560
<i>You will turn it back on,</i>

657
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,280
or I will put a bullet
in your friend's head.

658
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,440
Don't you dare.

659
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,200
She's gonna shoot me
whether you do it or not.

660
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
That may be true,

661
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,840
and you can take that gamble
if you like.

662
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,560
<i>It's only his life you wager.</i>

663
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,840
Almost there.

664
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,280
<i>I'm not joking, Raymond.</i>

665
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,320
Don't you dare push that button.

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,080
Raymond, what's going on?

667
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,600
The core just went back online.

668
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,160
Sorry, professor, I had to do it.

669
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
You idiot.

670
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,920
I, I can still remove it.

671
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,440
I just hope I can absorb
the excess power.

672
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,800
No. Do you have any idea
the kind of energy that...

673
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,400
Should have listened to your friend.

674
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,280
<i>What the hell are you doing, Gray?</i>

675
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,480
Jefferson?

676
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,480
You are not Firestorm;
you're just a stubborn old man

677
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,840
<i>who's about to make
a really stupid decision.</i>

678
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,520
Wait, is this what it's like
when I'm in your head?

679
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,760
I, I apologize, dear boy,
because it's rather distracting.

680
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,360
<i>Your body cannot handle this alone.</i>

681
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,800
Appreciate your concern.

682
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
You were right.

683
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,440
I've risked your life enough times.

684
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,640
Now, it's my turn.

685
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
No!

686
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,800
He's too weak.

687
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,920
<i>He'll never get out of there alone.</i>

688
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,080
Professor Stein...

689
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
your comrade here tells me

690
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,640
you know quite a bit
about this project of mine.

691
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,040
Very good.

692
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,800
You and I have much to discuss.

693
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,800
What are you waiting for?

694
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,800
You forget how to use that thing?

695
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,800
My employer, Mr. Savage,
would very much like to meet you

696
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,320
and the rest of your friends.

697
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Careful what you wish for.

698
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,560
This where the party's at?

699
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,480
Mr. Snart, can you hear me?

700
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,120
Do not let Vostok leave
with that thermal core.

701
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,520
Get the hell out of here!

702
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,560
What are you waiting for?

703
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,320
Go, go!

704
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,400
Now might be a good time
to send in reinforcements.

705
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,880
Mick and Stein just got pinched
by the Russkies.

706
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
You're gonna have to get out of there
right now.

707
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,600
They're hanging us out to dry,
Rip; I need backup.

708
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm afraid our only option
is retreat.

709
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,720
What about my partner?

710
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,680
Well, until we devise our next move,

711
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,560
Mr. Rory will have to fend
for himself.

712
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,080
Remember the mission.

713
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,520
If the Soviets get that
thermal core back,

714
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,800
your partner will not be
the only one who dies.

715
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,000
You better kill me now.

716
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,960
If I ever get my hands on you,

717
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,160
I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV"
on your ass.

718
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm gonna remember that, comrade.

719
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,360
We must leave now, Colonel.

720
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,080
There's still one more intruder,
and he has the thermal core.

721
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,640
We don't need it now.

722
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,080
We have something far better.

723
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,720
Thank God you managed to grab it.

724
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,280
Where was my backup, Captain?

725
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,000
Half the team is gone...

726
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,640
Because of you.

727
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Only if I'd have sent
the other half in to save them,

728
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,720
they'd be captured too,
and where would we be, hmm?

729
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,200
Savage would have both halves
of Firestorm, a dead Kendra

730
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,720
on top of a dead Carter,
everything he wants.

731
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,840
It would be the end
to our little crusade,

732
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,960
and, most likely, the world.

733
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,800
So before you pull that trigger,
ask yourself...

734
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
what would you have done?

735
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,680
That is a pretty cold calculation,
Rip.

736
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,880
Almost criminal...

737
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,760
except we criminals have a code:

738
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,480
"You never leave
one of your own behind."

739
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,800
We will get them back.

740
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,200
Now, if Savage even hopes
to create a Firestorm,

741
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,920
first, he's going to need
a new one of these.

742
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
A thermal core?

743
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Let me get this straight.

744
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,680
You had Kendra and I training
for the next mission,

745
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,400
when we should have been
out there helping them.

746
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,000
We will help them,
and our next mission

747
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,360
is to get our compatriots back
from Vostok.

748
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,120
Who is to say
they're not already dead?

749
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,120
Vostok needs the professor alive
in order to rebuild the thermal core.

750
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,400
And Ray and Rory?

751
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,880
Savage will keep them alive too.

752
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,040
As leverage.

753
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,480
He'll torture them
if Stein tries to hold out.

754
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
Well, we'll have to pray
that he does.

755
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,880
If Savage's goal
is to create his own Firestorm,

756
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,240
then Stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

757
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,280
And if Vostok figures out
how to turn Stein's powers

758
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,320
against us, then...

759
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,480
I'm afraid the world
is beyond saving.

760
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,160
Stein's a lot tougher than he looks.

761
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,560
I mean, it will take a lot
to break him.

762
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,480
That's the good news.

763
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,000
The bad news is that our compatriots
are being held...

764
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,120
in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.

765
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,400
Get a good night's sleep.

766
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,600
You and Dr. Vostok have
much work to do in the morning.

767
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,320
My companions from the lab...

768
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,920
what did you do with them?

769
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,240
Don't worry.

770
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,360
They're alive.

771
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:21,080
Whether they remain that way
is entirely up to you, Professor.
