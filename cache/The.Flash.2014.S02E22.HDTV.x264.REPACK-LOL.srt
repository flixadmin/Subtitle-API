1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:03,145
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,047
and I am the

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,405
fastest man alive.

4
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:07,741
To the outside world,

5
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:09,926
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

6
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:12,929
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,232
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,268
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,705
but in doing so I opened up
our world to new threats.

10
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:25,191
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

11
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,144
I am The Flash.

12
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:29,564
Previously on "The Flash"...

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,995
Welcome to Earth-2.

14
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,130
I met your doppelganger.
She's a cold-hearted

15
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,798
ice queen named Killer Frost.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,884
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

17
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:39,670
My brothers and sisters,

18
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,589
I've brought us to this new world,

19
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,925
ours for the taking!

20
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,927
Whose world is this?

21
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,180
Our world! Our world!

22
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,017
Our world, our world!

23
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,200
Reloading!

24
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:15,672
Ah!

25
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:17,541
David!

26
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,676
Back door! Captain's down.

27
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,929
Go, go, go, go, go!

28
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,054
Down, down! Down, get down!

29
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,539
Some people are calling
it the metapocalypse,

30
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,076
the days when Central City
was overrun by an army

31
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,578
with powers beyond imagination.

32
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,082
But in these dark times,

33
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,001
we must never forget our own strength,

34
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:04,138
our own power to fight back.

35
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:09,973
That it is only in the blackest of nights

36
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:13,360
that we can truly see the light...

37
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:16,730
and know for sure we are not alone.

38
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:20,901
We are never... ever... alone.

39

40
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,491
We usually take these guys
down one at a time,

41
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:30,410
not 100 at a time.

42
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,495
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

43
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,331
I know we can do it.

44
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,167
Guys. You have to come see this.

45
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,920
Cisco, what are you...

46
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,254
Caitlin?

47
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:43,924
She's in shock.

48
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,893
A little... dehydrated and malnourished,

49
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,012
but I think she'll be fine.

50
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:51,147
I'm okay.

51
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,233
What happened? How did you get away?

52
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:56,736
He... let me go.

53
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:59,189
I didn't think he would;
I thought it was a trap.

54
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,442
But... he told me you were dead.

55
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm not. I'm right here.

56
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,497
We're all here, together.

57
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,115
Snow.

58
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,367
Jay's not here.

59
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:12,452
You're safe.

60
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:15,538
He's gonna overrun the city.
You can't stop him.

61
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,123
Yes, we can.

62
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,209
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.

63
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,094
We've got this. This is our Earth.

64
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:22,295
You don't know that.

65
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,513
You don't know what he is capable of.

66
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:25,966
I know from being in the Speed Force

67
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:28,885
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

68
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,721
And if the universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose?

69
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,223
Right, guys?

70
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,808
Yeah, yeah, right.

71
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,361
You've been through a lot.

72
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:39,813
You should get some rest, come on.

73
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:43,066
You were in the Speed Force?

74
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,985
I... when you were gone.

75
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:47,954
It's hard to explain, but we
tried to get my powers back

76
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:50,323
and when the dark matter lightning...

77
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,158
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,795
Um, we don't think he's being
just a little too...

79
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:57,213
Overconfident?

80
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,299
Yeah, maybe it was
his time in the Speed Force.

81
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:02,052
I mean, he's acting like he's
invincible now or something.

82
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,004
Yeah, like nothing fazes
him anymore, which isn't...

83
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,722
Realistic, no.

84
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,508
Somebody needs to talk to him
before letting his guard down

85
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,310
gets him hurt or worse.

86
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,345
He did bring me out of my coma.

87
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:14,814
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

88
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:18,601
Well, like I said, somebody
needs to talk to him.

89
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,710
Amazing job, Anupam.

90
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:23,096
This is exactly the kind of
groundbreaking thinking

91
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,215
I built this company for.

92
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:26,633
Well done.

93
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,882
Everyone, evacuate! Now!

94
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:01,835
Hurry!

95
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,229
Hey.

96
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,348
She's out like a light, huh?

97
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,683
Yeah.

98
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,651
Jay really did a number on her.

99
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,186
It's not like he

100
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:24,490
exactly used kid gloves
on the rest of us.

101
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,993
She'll be okay. She just needs time.

102
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,362
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.

103
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,197
Which we will.

104
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,335
Yeah, because the universe
is with us, right?

105
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:37,837
Listen, man...

106
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,855
Cisco?

107
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,774
Hey. You okay?

108
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,392
- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:01,611
What'd you see?

110
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:04,480
I saw a bird.

111
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,199
Like, a dead bird.

112
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:14,290
Mercury Labs.

113
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,825
It's under attack.

114
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,010
All right.

115
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,930
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

116
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,133
I'm not stupid.

117
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,441
Boom.

118
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,234
So how did you know?

119
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,735
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,020
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.

121
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,438
We're paid to be perceptive.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,640
And you're always a
little too well informed

123
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:38,243
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

124
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:39,694
But I don't believe
we've ever met before.

125
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,162
Dr. Christina McGee.

126
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:42,364
Doctor Henry Allen.

127
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:43,782
I'm Barry's father.

128
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,033
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag,

129
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:46,334
did you happen to see who it was

130
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,919
that cause your building to collapse?

131
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,871
I didn't see anything.
It happened so fast.

132
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:52,207
Maybe the security cameras
caught something?

133
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,092
Can we access them?

134
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:57,345
Mercury Labs does have a
Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.

135
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:58,713
A what?

136
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,932
Virtually a black box for buildings.

137
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,517
It will have stored all
the security footage

138
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,269
right up until the building collapsed.

139
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:05,854
Okay, great, I'll go find it.

140
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,889
This wasn't some random meta-human.

141
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,191
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted

142
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,310
in the past there's always
been a specific reason.

143
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,362
Yeah, someone's after something.

144
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,480
Yes, and that someone

145
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,699
is probably Zoom.

146
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,618
There may be one more possibility.

147
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,536
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells

148
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,238
running out of my facility.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,407
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm certain it was him.

150
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,627
Is there any way he could
have anything to do with this?

151
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,211
A few months ago?

152
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:31,830
Sure.

153
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,298
Now?

154
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,000
No.

155
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,502
Yeah, there are a few
more things that we could

156
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,220
catch you up on, Dr. McGee.

157
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,145
Hey, my purse!

158
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:01,693
That ain't yours, punk.

159
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,244
Big mistake.

160
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:06,247
You picked a bad time to play hero.

161
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,430
Dad?

162
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:28,470
Wally.

163
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:30,388
What the hell were you doing?

164
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,890
That guy just jacked a bunch of people

165
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,191
so I had to go after him.

166
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:35,143
You could have got yourself killed!

167
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,945
I'm not just gonna let
these guys get away with this.

168
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,063
I have to do something.

169
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,814
Wally, these are not just guys!

170
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,032
These are meta-humans!

171
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,867
Leaves this to the cops and The Flash.

172
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,486
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.

173
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,871
I... I have to do what I can to help.

174
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,574
I have to show him I
was worth being saved.

175
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,246
Wally...

176
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,668
You are... worth it.

177
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,671
Really?

178
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:05,140
Am I?

179
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:07,475
'Cause last time I checked,
I'm the guy who avoided

180
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,761
his dying mother for weeks.

181
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,229
I'm the guy who shamed
a bunch of other guys

182
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:13,148
and illegally took their cars from them.

183
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,850
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers and start

184
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:18,019
this whole damn "metapocalypse"
in the first place.

185
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,237
Wally...

186
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,573
Last time I checked,

187
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:25,026
I've a whole lot to make up for.

188
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:27,162
That's what I intend to do.

189
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,953
Damn it.

190
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,344
Snow.

191
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,879
Oh.

192
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,214
I didn't know you were here.

193
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:47,549
What you doing?

194
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:49,267
Uh... Jesse asked me to run some tests

195
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,272
to see if her genetic
structure had changed.

196
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,392
Why did you ask Dr. Snow...

197
00:10:57,394 --> 00:10:59,277
to run tests on you again?

198
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,062
Because I got hit with
a dark matter, okay?

199
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:03,398
I mean, that must have
affected me somehow.

200
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:16,411
You're not a meta-human.

201
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,213
What you are

202
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,414
is a young woman

203
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,467
with a genius-level IQ that we could use

204
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:27,088
in our fight against
this new wave of meta-humans.

205
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,424
Okay. All right, fine.

206
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:31,176
Fine.

207
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:40,935
Snow?

208
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:43,772
You all right?

209
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:45,774
Yeah, I'm fine.

210
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,334
- Is this it?
- That's the one.

211
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:59,170
All right, great. Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco.

212
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,288
Why don't you guys crack this open,

213
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,956
- see what you can find?
- Sure.

214
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,541
We'll go see what kind
of meta-human powers

215
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:05,126
can take down a building
like that and how to stop it.

216
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:06,878
- Great.
- Sounds like fun.

217
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,297
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help

218
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,932
in the streets. Everybody cool here?

219
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,384
Should be a piece of cake, right?

220
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:17,972
- Hey, slugger!
- Hey.

221
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,358
Can I talk to you for a minute?

222
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,442
Yeah, sure.

223
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,111
What's up?

224
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,729
Well, I know you said that

225
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,115
what happened to you in the Speed Force

226
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:29,984
changed the way you see things,

227
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,453
but you seem very optimistic,
you know, with a lot

228
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,823
of meta-humans running around
tearing up the city.

229
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:36,958
What, did you see the future in there?

230
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,661
No... um... not this time.

231
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,079
No... I... look...

232
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,082
What I was shown in the Speed Force

233
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:46,384
didn't just change my mind,

234
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,837
it changed me.

235
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,639
I don't know...
what you're seeing as optimism

236
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:54,475
is, for the first time,

237
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,178
I'm just not afraid anymore.

238
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,650
Great, that's...

239
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,236
But...

240
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:08,356
You know you still
have to be careful, right?

241
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,158
What do you mean?

242
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,326
Well...

243
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,662
I don't... why are you trying to

244
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,332
take something from me
that I fought so hard to get to?

245
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,417
- Barry!
- I... you... you don't know

246
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,085
everything that I've been through, Dad.

247
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,121
You haven't been here
long enough to know.

248
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,007
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

249
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,342
I don't know why I said that.

250
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,344
I think I do.

251
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,429
Hadn't been around.

252
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:34,349
Teach you how to drive
or take you to look at colleges.

253
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:35,683
But I've done everything in my power

254
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,219
to know who you are.

255
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:39,971
Barry, I don't want to
take anything from you.

256
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:42,307
I believe in you.

257
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,442
This isn't about my not believing in you.

258
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:46,277
I know that.

259
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,780
And I'm fine. Okay?

260
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:50,565
Thank you, thank you very much

261
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,983
for worrying about me.

262
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:54,152
I love you.

263
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:56,487
But I'm fine.

264
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,410
Come on.

265
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,917
What is that?

266
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,386
It's CCPD.

267
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:12,503
Zoom.

268
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:13,588
Barry.

269
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,590
Don't do it.

270
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,265
You know, I never saw the crime photos

271
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,985
of my mother's murder.

272
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:28,937
Well, I guess I didn't need to.

273
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:34,275
I have a ringside seat
while you got whisked away.

274
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:35,576
Too delicate, I suppose.

275
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:42,033
Not just a hologram after all,
are you, Flash?

276
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,705
Interesting.

277
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:53,094
I know you didn't
call me up here just to banter.

278
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,762
Let's finish this.

279
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,381
Right now.

280
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,299
Actually, I did.

281
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,718
I called you up here to
tell you you can't keep running

282
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,054
from one meta to the next.

283
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,889
Around and around,

284
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,608
like a dog chasing its tail.

285
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,227
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

286
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:12,313
If only that were good enough.

287
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:14,365
'Cause here's the thing.

288
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,451
I know you.

289
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,821
I know you, I know
what's holding you back.

290
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:23,574
You and me...

291
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,126
we're really just the same person.

292
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,830
Yeah, you keep saying that,

293
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:30,415
but it's not gonna make it true.

294
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,967
You'll see. We are.

295
00:15:35,388 --> 00:15:37,005
Same tragic background.

296
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,840
Same reason for running.

297
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:42,393
Same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

298
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:43,978
The difference?

299
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,097
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

300
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:48,933
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

301
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:51,185
Doesn't it get exhausting?

302
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:52,820
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry!

303
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:55,523
It was exhausting playing
Jay, believe me.

304
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:56,691
I'm not pretending.

305
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,246
Now if it were me,

306
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,198
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought.

307
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,533
But you,

308
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,835
you'll never let that happen, will you?

309
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:10,755
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

310
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:14,509
Because you always have to be the hero.

311
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,794
And while you're
playing the good little boy...

312
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:23,468
I'll be busy winning.

313
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,684
We can't let Zoom destroy
another building.

314
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,359
We need to take him down.

315
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,079
Now.

316
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:38,950
And how do you propose we do that

317
00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:41,669
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

318
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,588
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.

319
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,006
What makes us different?

320
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:47,458
We're a team.

321
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,711
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

322
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:51,729
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

323
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:52,964
Barry, we don't even know

324
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:54,549
how many of his minions there are.

325
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:56,684
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

326
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:58,803
And all of them, they're all
working with different powers.

327
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,438
It could take weeks to
track them all down.

328
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,806
Guys, we don't have weeks.

329
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,558
So what we need do to is

330
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,393
come up with a way to
stop them all at once.

331
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,395
Again?

332
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,814
How?

333
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,032
Cisco,

334
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,067
your goggles, your camera,

335
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,703
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

336
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,503
Yeah, it was a whole different frequency.

337
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,389
And the way you took
down the Time Wraiths,

338
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:19,807
that was based on frequency.

339
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,142
Hartley's entire shtick...

340
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:24,428
I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

341
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,813
- Yeah.
- So basically,

342
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:28,098
we create some vibrational tech

343
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,683
that can take down the Earth-2 metas.

344
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,101
- Basically.
- Oh, I gotcha.

345
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,020
- Me too.
- I'll help.

346
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,238
- Okay.
- I'll let you know

347
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,606
if I hear anything from CCPN.

348
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:39,410
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

349
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,612
You guys...

350
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:44,031
we got this.

351
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,873
Barr, can I talk to you for a second?

352
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,291
Yeah.

353
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,786
Birds.

354
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,455
Why?

355
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:27,291
It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.

356
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,042
What's up?

357
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,161
Man, it's Wally.

358
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:32,212
Is he okay?

359
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,381
Not really.

360
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:37,251
Earlier, he thought it
would be a good idea

361
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:38,969
if he used himself

362
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:43,090
as bait against a meta-human psycho.

363
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,092
Thought he could do things

364
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,561
the way The Flash would.

365
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:49,596
Joe, I mean, he... he did tell me that

366
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:52,933
he wasn't gonna waste the
opportunity The Flash gave him.

367
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:54,852
I don't know if you can stop him.

368
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,437
I'm gonna have to or
he's gonna get himself killed.

369
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,572
Look, he ain't you, Barry.

370
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:00,774
He can't just go Mach 50...

371
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,242
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

372
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:04,077
The point is

373
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,281
thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

374
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:10,617
Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

375
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,036
and him throwing caution to the
wind on top of all that?

376
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,005
No.

377
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:18,425
We got to keep him safe.

378
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:21,879
So... in the Flash,

379
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:23,881
talk to him.

380
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:25,215
Again.

381
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:29,686
Yeah, I'll talk to him.
I'll try, I promise.

382
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:32,306
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:33,390
Thank you.

384
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:55,245
I thought throwing things was

385
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,331
Harry's preferred method
of dealing with stress.

386
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,499
That is how frustrated I am right now.

387
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,085
I'm... just running out
of ideas as to how

388
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,670
to make this work. Where's Barry?

389
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,422
I need a taste of that
"Walking on Sunshine" thing

390
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:07,674
he's got going on right now.

391
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,634
No... No!

392
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,903
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

393
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,104
It's me, okay?

394
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:23,106
Breathe. Breathe.

395
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:25,492
You're okay, all right? You're shaking.

396
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,910
I... I thought I saw him... Zoom...

397
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:28,028
I thought I saw him right there.

398
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,329
It's just me, okay?

399
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:30,697
Look at me, he's not here.

400
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:33,166
He's not here.

401
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,036
I see him everywhere.

402
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,955
Look, you literally

403
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:41,291
just escaped a psychopath
who kidnapped you, all right,

404
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,759
so I think it's normal for you to have

405
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,177
a severe reaction like this.

406
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,346
This is so much worse than that.

407
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:50,267
I... I'm afraid all the time.

408
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,970
I don't think I can ever move forward.

409
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:54,271
You will.

410
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,439
When?

411
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:58,141
Jay took everything from me.

412
00:20:58,143 --> 00:21:01,645
My confidence, my trust, my sanity.

413
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:07,401
I don't think I'll ever be whole again.

414
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:10,704
Of course you will.

415
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:12,823
I promise.

416
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,088
Stealing is illegal, you know.

417
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:34,344
Detective West tells me that you've been

418
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:36,179
fighting Zoom's army on your own.

419
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:40,567
Yeah. I want to help.

420
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:43,153
I admire what you're trying to do,

421
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:46,440
but the best way to help is to just

422
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:48,942
leave this to the police.

423
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,827
Like you did.

424
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:57,117
I do have powers, Wally.
It is a little different.

425
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,586
This isn't your fight.

426
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:00,954
It's mine.

427
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:03,373
No, it's all of ours.

428
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,258
This is my city too now.

429
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,927
It's up to all of us to protect it.

430
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:11,882
Barry, we got a major meta-human alert

431
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:13,684
at 5th and Main... get there.

432
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:16,103
5th and Main. Got it.

433
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:17,387
We'll continue this later.

434
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,952
Why is it always so difficult to choose?

435
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,370
Barry, what it is?

436
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:35,372
It's...

437
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:36,907
Laurel Lance.

438
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,512
Laurel.

439
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,548
Laurel Lance is dead.

440
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,301
On this Earth, anyway.

441
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:56,105
Poor Black Canary. Bye-bye, birdy.

442
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,808
Earth-2 Laurel.

443
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,893
You knew her doppelganger?

444
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:03,646
We didn't just know her, we loved her.

445
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,817
So... what do I call you?

446
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,452
You can call me

447
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,954
Black Siren.

448
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:15,074
Zoom mentioned that you
might be showing up.

449
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,326
If he told you what I can do,

450
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,245
you should look more afraid.

451
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,081
And so should you.

452
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,750
Tell me,

453
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,002
why did you take down Mercury Labs?

454
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:30,589
Because I like to watch
things crumble and fall.

455
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:33,926
Guess what. You're next, red.

456
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:47,106
You okay, Barry?

457
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,774
Look.

458
00:23:48,776 --> 00:23:51,193
Anything over 200 decibels
will kill a human.

459
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,331
Was that too loud?

460
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,784
Perhaps we should quiet
things down a bit.

461
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,130
You know, the sad thing is,

462
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,549
I think Zoom's actually afraid of you.

463
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,051
And I didn't think that
he feared anything.

464
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:20,606
And you, you're hardly worth the chills.

465
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,559
How many metas did he send
to try and kill you?

466
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,527
Well, it's too bad.

467
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,061
He should have just sent me

468
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,062
because that way,

469
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,264
you would have already been...

470
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,285
Get in.

471
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,886
Thought you might need a lift.

472
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:53,505
Yeah. Thanks.

473
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,728
You're welcome.

474
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,686
Why do so many villains
that we go against

475
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:09,655
use sound as a weapon?

476
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:11,407
- What?
- Nothing.

477
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,943
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thanks.

478
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,862
So Wally just drove on up
into the thick of it?

479
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:19,281
Mm-hmm.

480
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,617
Must have been some
conversation you two had,

481
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,869
seeing as though he did
literally the opposite

482
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,754
of what we wanted.

483
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,423
This I can hear.

484
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,124
It's not funny.

485
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,125
I'm sorry.

486
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,961
I'm in no laughing mood.

487
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,380
Look, Joe, I tried.

488
00:25:34,382 --> 00:25:36,599
I told you I would try, right? I...

489
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,851
Wally's a determined kid.

490
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,970
Yeah, determined to get himself killed.

491
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,138
Or determined to help people.

492
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,607
And be glad, or you know,

493
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,108
I would not be standing here right now.

494
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,643
Well, he was lucky tonight.

495
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:50,779
I don't want to see the
day when he isn't.

496
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,782
We've got more than
luck on our side, Joe.

497
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,161
You know you're not invincible, right?

498
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:11,133
Yes, of course, I know this.

499
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:13,585
Joe's being

500
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,087
overprotective, but I get it.

501
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:16,755
Yeah, but it's like

502
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:19,642
you think that nothing can touch you.

503
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,645
Like nothing bad can get in your way.

504
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,431
That's not true for any of us.

505
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,433
What are you saying?

506
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:29,184
Look,

507
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:32,521
I know that you had an
experience in the Speed Force.

508
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:36,191
And I'm happy that you think
we're gonna win the day.

509
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:39,528
But I think a little fear
can be a healthy thing.

510
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,582
It helps you determine
which risks are worth taking.

511
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,867
I think that's something for both

512
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,535
you and Wally to take to heart.

513
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,712
I met your little red friend tonight.

514
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:59,048
Aren't you going to ask
me if I killed him?

515
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,350
You didn't.

516
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,052
You're good but not that good.

517
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,473
And yet I seem to be

518
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:10,025
the only one of your top lieutenants

519
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,143
still standing.

520
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:14,063
Like I said, you're good.

521
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,982
So why don't you go
knock down a few more buildings?

522
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,034
Like I ordered.

523
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,319
What's the point?

524
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,074
The point is so that

525
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,242
it seems random.

526
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:29,244
That way The Flash and
his merry band won't

527
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,580
realize what I'm up to

528
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:34,216
till it's too late.

529
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:40,506
What are you up to?

530
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:43,509
No good.

531
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,428
- Ow.
- Sorry.

532
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,814
- Ow!
- There we go.

533
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:50,099
Are you kidding me with this?

534
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,183
Hey, at least it works.

535
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:52,184
Tremendous.

536
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,569
What is it exactly?

537
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,938
It's just a small source of joy,

538
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940
but more importantly, it's how
we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

539
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,775
By giving them all electroshock therapy?

540
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,111
By giving them all
dimensional shock therapy.

541
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,114
This is where I play stupid
and you explain science.

542
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,865
Okay. Fair enough.

543
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:09,535
So all matter vibrates at
its own unique frequency, right?

544
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:11,370
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

545
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:13,839
Like how an opera singer
shatters glass with her voice.

546
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,457
Exactly. So we found out that

547
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,042
all Earth-2 people vibrate at their own,

548
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:20,295
- more erratic frequency.
- Higher frequency.

549
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,431
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

550
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,800
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

551
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:27,052
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?

552
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:29,438
And he postulated that
we could create a sort of

553
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,057
dimensional tuning fork... Voilà...

554
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,642
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

555
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,644
Just let me have this one, okay?

556
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,112
- Have it, have it.
- Thank you.

557
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,697
So if you run around the city

558
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,983
fast enough to create a refracting field,

559
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,118
the device can send out

560
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,536
a pulse

561
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,955
that'll bounce off of it, split apart,

562
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:49,208
and collide with itself over and over.

563
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,077
Amplifying it to an erratic
frequency on the Earth-2...

564
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,662
- Higher. Higher frequency.
- Higher frequency

565
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,164
on the Earth-2 spectrum.

566
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,166
And when that pulse
hits anyone from Earth-2...

567
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,218
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

568
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

569
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,088
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

570
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,007
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

571
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,675
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

572
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:08,010
Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.

573
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,478
Yes you did.

574
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,430
Uh, we designed these headphones

575
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:12,848
to protect us from the pulse.

576
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,683
Beats by Wells.

577
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,104
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

578
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,106
That's the high-rise development
on the west side.

579
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:22,524
Hundreds of people live there.

580
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,409
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.

581
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:27,079
Set that pulse off right now.
Allen, you need to start

582
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,864
generating that refracting
field right now.

583
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,916
But Black Siren can take down
this building at any point.

584
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:32,451
Wha... all those people, Wells.

585
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:35,370
How many more people
are gonna die while we wait?

586
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:37,372
Guys, which is it?

587
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,960
I think I just got
the worst idea of all time.

588
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:57,476
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

589
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:00,028
Maybe you're not as
powerful as you think!

590
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,746
What are you two doing here?

591
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:21,083
Why should you have all the fun?

592
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:28,805
I thought you two were dead.

593
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,164
Zoom thinks that too.

594
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,733
And we'd like to keep it that way.

595
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:36,887
For now.

596
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:41,341
You think you two can
pull one over on Zoom?

597
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,376
Well, enjoy being dead.

598
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:45,011
I told you.

599
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,814
Give her a chance.

600
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,015
What chance?

601
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,017
She's not ready.

602
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:55,105
Excuse me.

603
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:58,191
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

604
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,026
Try it, and I'll shatter your entire

605
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,245
nervous system without breaking a sweat.

606
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:06,449
Wow, you really think
you can take on Zoom.

607
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:09,419
We can.

608
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:12,205
You don't even know how powerful you are.

609
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:15,342
With a single call,
you can take down a building.

610
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:18,261
I'd call that impressive.

611
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:21,047
But why... stop...

612
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,266
there?

613
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:26,136
Why serve a master when
you can be a master,

614
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:28,888
when you can be a god?

615
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,027
We... could be gods.

616
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:43,236
- All right!
- All right.

617
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:44,404
We're synced up with whatever

618
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,956
the heck that thing is.

619
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,540
Finally something we're both baffled by.

620
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,125
I'm kidding. That, my friend,

621
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:53,580
is a 75KTSB 40,000-watt
reverberating sound amplifier

622
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,498
designed to single out
the operating frequency

623
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,584
of every single Earth-2
being on this planet...

624
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:59,636
which, went contained and magnified

625
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:01,338
by The Flash creating
a sound pressure wall

626
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,923
around the city, will render all of us

627
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:06,726
Earth-2 beings unconscious.

628
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:08,845
Hence...

629
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:11,348
the safety precautions.

630
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,983
I'm baffled by it.

631
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,485
Are we ready?

632
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:18,405
- Yes, we are.
- All right.

633
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:23,827
Here... we...

634
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,412
go.

635
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:38,792
If I were interested

636
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:42,462
in forming an alliance with you two,

637
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:44,631
what's your plan?

638
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,550
Exactly?

639
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:50,804
We ambush Zoom at CCPD.

640
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,138
With our three powers combined,

641
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,890
he'll be no match for us.

642
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,975
Hmm.

643
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:58,945
Well, I like the sound of that.

644
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:00,280
Great.

645
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:02,816
Then let's go.

646
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:05,151
There's just one more thing.

647
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,657
Reverb... catch.

648
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,332
You know, all doppelgangers...

649
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,167
they're mirror images of themselves.

650
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:23,970
But you two, you didn't
know that, did you?

651
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:25,972
Reverb is left-handed.

652
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,641
Well, I just... I just happened to...

653
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:31,094
catch it with my right... run!

654
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,771
Oh, no.

655
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:43,656
What are we gonna do?

656
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:47,360
I don't think that
there's anything you can do.

657
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:53,416
What the what?

658
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:54,367
I don't know.

659
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,618
Well, do it again!

660
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,342
Cisco...

661
00:34:06,715 --> 00:34:08,548
We're a go.

662
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:18,892
There's nothing on this Earth

663
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:21,277
that can stop us!

664
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:26,950
It's working.

665
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,289
Yaaaahh!

666
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,292
Dad?

667
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:38,128
Dad, it hurts.

668
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,839
- No... no... stop...
- It's okay.

669
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:51,591
- No...
- It's okay, honey.

670
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,326
Turn it off! Turn it off, it worked!

671
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:14,247
It's okay, it's okay,
we'll take care of him.

672
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,282
It's okay, Jesse.

673
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,084
He's gonna be okay.

674
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:21,955
Barry. We did it.

675
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:23,540
Bring them all in.

676
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,926
Copy that. I'm on clean up.

677
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:34,291
What's that? I can't... I can't hear you

678
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,410
through the double-paned
soundproof glass.

679
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:40,297
It's... it's kind of hard
to make out what you're saying.

680
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:43,417
So should we tell Sara
and Captain Lance about her?

681
00:35:43,419 --> 00:35:45,085
No, I've seen what interacting with

682
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:47,504
your family's doppelgangers can do.

683
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:48,922
It's not even Laurel.

684
00:35:48,924 --> 00:35:50,424
No. It's just a poor imitation.

685
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:52,426
Speaking of, that was a pretty good

686
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:54,595
Killer Frost you did back there.

687
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:55,896
Guess I was in the right head space

688
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:58,398
to play a cold, vicious killer.

689
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,567
How you doing, are you okay?

690
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:02,069
No.

691
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,271
But I think I'm gonna be.

692
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:05,689
Being out there with you guys,

693
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:07,608
fighting meta-humans,

694
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,777
saving people...

695
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,278
It's the first time I felt

696
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
normal in a long time.

697
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,531
Come here.

698
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,917
- This is a group hug moment.
- Yeah.

699
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,085
It is.

700
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:26,627
So all of Zoom's meta-humans

701
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:28,011
are locked up in Iron Heights?

702
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:30,297
Most of them. Some are somewhere else.

703
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:31,298
I don't want to know.

704
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,466
No you don't.

705
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:33,550
And Zoom?

706
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:36,520
The metas we spoke to said Zoom

707
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:38,021
created a breach and escaped.

708
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,556
And how did he do that again?

709
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:41,058
Who knows, but he's back on Earth-2 now.

710
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,693
Earth-2?

711
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:44,978
That something else
I don't want to know about?

712
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,146
- No.
- No.

713
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:49,283
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.

714
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:51,318
The man who saved Central
City once again.

715
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,704
No, we're all just part of the same team.

716
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:56,990
Speaking of teams, where
the hell is Allen?

717
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,460
Ooh... Sorry, man, sorry... hey.

718
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,663
Heard my name. Uh, what's up?

719
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,965
Good, well, you've got
about 100 meta criminal cases

720
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:06,750
to get through, so I would get
to cracking if I were you.

721
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,837
I will get right on that.

722
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,638
Captain.

723
00:37:12,675 --> 00:37:14,842
- Well done.
- Thanks.

724
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:17,928
Listen, uh,

725
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,013
I've been thinking about Wally some more.

726
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:22,149
Are you gonna talk to him again?

727
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,066
No, I'm not.

728
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:24,234
Why not?

729
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,819
Because he's your son, Joe.

730
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:27,487
I know he's my son.

731
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:29,022
I... look... what I mean is

732
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:31,074
he's got your values.

733
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:34,194
He's got your inner drive
to help people do what's right.

734
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,330
We're supposed to think
we're something we're not

735
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:37,948
until we become that thing.

736
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,450
That's the path that Wally's on.

737
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:42,836
I'm not gonna stop him
from being the hero

738
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:45,505
that he's gonna become.

739
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:47,374
I really don't think you should either.

740
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:51,712
I can't wait till you have
kids and they torture you.

741
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:53,013
I'ma laugh in your face.

742
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,016
All right, gramps.

743
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:57,184
Poppa.

744
00:37:57,186 --> 00:37:58,468
What?

745
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,772
My grandkids are gonna call me "poppa".

746
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,057
All right.

747
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:09,696
♪ Ah ah ♪

748
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:12,149
♪ When I was young ♪

749
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:16,203
What in the world?

750
00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:17,321
What is this?

751
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:19,122
- Blame Iris.
- Okay.

752
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:21,658
I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

753
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,243
we should celebrate.

754
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:26,129
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

755
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,749
Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.

756
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,667
Thank you.

757
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:33,086
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello, Henry.

758
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:34,922
- Jesse.
- Hi.

759
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:37,925
Good to see you.

760
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,843
Good to see you too.

761
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:42,012
- You look... great.
- Thank you.

762
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:45,766
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

763
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,068
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

764
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,569
Mm-hmm.

765
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:53,273
So I guess you are invincible.

766
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:54,691
Told you.

767
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,360
The Speed Force is with us.

768
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,864
Since I'm

769
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:04,785
feeling extra invincible lately,

770
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:06,453
what do you say

771
00:39:06,455 --> 00:39:09,756
you and I

772
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:13,010
give this a shot?

773
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:14,461
Yeah, I would like that.

774
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:21,468
So is it true?

775
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,971
You saved The Flash's life?

776
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,439
Oh, I mean, I was

777
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,557
just in the right place
at the right time.

778
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,393
Proud of you, Wally.

779
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:31,695
You did good.

780
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:33,230
Thanks, dad.

781
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:35,532
What?

782
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:37,451
I'm just... I'm proud of you too.

783
00:39:37,453 --> 00:39:39,569
- Soup's on.
- Hey!

784
00:39:39,571 --> 00:39:41,071
Taking out a city full of monsters

785
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:43,123
makes a man hungry.

786
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,659
First,

787
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:47,661
a toast.

788
00:39:47,663 --> 00:39:48,912
To family.

789
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,747
To family.

790
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:52,299
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet.

791
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:54,801
Let's eat.

792
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:01,425
Oh. You guys.

793
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:02,676
Great.

794
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:07,681
Earth-2.

795
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:19,609
Cisco?

796
00:40:19,611 --> 00:40:22,362
What... What is it?

797
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:23,663
What'd you see?

798
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,699
What do you mean "see"?

799
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,117
Cisco gets visions.

800
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,201
I don't understand.

801
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,203
What Cisco?

802
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,040
Earth-2 splitting in half.

803
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:35,042
Straight down to the poles.

804
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:36,877
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

805
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:38,345
Please tell me I did not

806
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:40,881
just see the end of the world!

807
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:51,475
Our story continues,

808
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:53,894
Flash.

809
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:59,699
- Henry!
- Oh, my God.

810
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:09,459
Dad?

811
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,911
Dad?

812
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,917
It's poetic, returning
to your childhood home.

813
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:19,920
Jay.

814
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:22,089
Don't do this.

815
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:23,423
I'm begging you.

816
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:25,058
I'm begging you! Take me.

817
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,927
- Kill me!
- No!

818
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:28,929
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

819
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,648
- Come on.
- Barry, look at me, son.

820
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,568
So I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

821
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,903
Whatever happens you have made me

822
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:39,489
- the happiest father...
- Dad...

823
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:41,408
This time, you're gonna
watch your parent die

824
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,609
just like I did.

825
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,077
- No, no!
- And this

826
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,995
is what's gonna make you

827
