1
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,522
Jae-jun, are you at your base?
You're not going anywhere, right?

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,940
Put on your gas masks!

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,776
I'm not going there, Mom. Don't worry.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,779
They said on TV
that all the soldiers are going there.

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,114
So you must be going too.

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,241
Why would I?
I'm being discharged next week.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,118
When you're about to be discharged,

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,245
they don't have you stand guard
or even train.

9
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,455
As if.

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,124
Then why was your last leave canceled?

11
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,501
Can you imagine how worried I am?

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,211
-You didn't even call--
-Mom.

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,588
What?

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,797
I have to go.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,258
Did you go somewhere else
instead of coming home?

16
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,178
Where are you going?

17
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,471
To play soccer. Bye, Mom.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,555
Jae-jun!

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,281
Why are you playing soccer?
What if you get hurt?

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,581
Then what should I do all day long?
I'm bored of playing video games.

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,000
All you did was play video games before.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,841
-Status.
-Clear.

23
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,093
-Clear.
-Clear.

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,177
Report.

25
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,180
Control, this is Shadow Gamma.

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,557
All infected on F1 have been eliminated.

27
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,351
No survivors found within range.

28
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,978
We're moving to the third floor.

29
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,653
I know you're lying.
You're not going to play soccer, are you?

30
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,321
I'm telling you, I am.

31
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,674
Come out. You're safe.

32
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,509
We're saved! Come out.

33
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,552
Hurry.

34
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,347
Walk slowly. Maintain order.
It's safe this way.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,265
Hurry!

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,609
Zone three on B2.
Difficulty suppressing the infected.

37
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,696
Okay. Pull out.

38
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,024
Think of me
and don't go anywhere dangerous.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:11,941
Okay?

40
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,485
I love you, Son.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,447
You know I do, right?

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,698
I love you too, Mom.

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,619
I'll call you later.
See you when I get discharged.

44
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,786
-Okay?
-Jae-jun.

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,331
Get back safely.

46
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,791
Make sure to call me later.

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,627
I'll be waiting, okay?

48
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,936
There's hope.

49
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,147
A small number of white blood cells
were detected in the blood.

50
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,693
Even after full transformation,
the white blood cells remained

51
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,945
and were fighting like warriors.

52
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,864
If the body temperature rises,
the white blood cells activate.

53
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,118
Current temperature is 29 degrees Celsius.

54
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,870
In case blood does not flow,

55
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,291
I'll raise the temperature
both internally and externally.

56
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,959
Leave a message if you want.

57
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,173
I don't have anything to say.

58
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,177
You?

59
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,187
We believe you.

60
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,398
You can untie that now.

61
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,488
Why are you doing this?

62
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,657
Because the others are nervous.

63
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,413
Aren't you?

64
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,790
No.

65
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,126
Why not?

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,794
Just because.

67
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,504
I'm not.

68
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,138
You know how I said
I wanted to bite you earlier?

69
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,598
It's okay. Don't say things like that.

70
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,772
It felt like I was dreaming.

71
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,402
You gave off such a nice scent.

72
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,654
What kind of scent?

73
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,534
I'm not sure.

74
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,163
It was something
I had never smelled before.

75
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,501
All I could think of was
that I wanted to eat you.

76
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,797
I wanted to bite you.

77
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,176
I kept thinking of biting and eating you.

78
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,639
That was all I could think of.

79
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,771
Then I heard your voice.

80
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,609
Nam-ra.

81
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,615
Your voice woke me up.

82
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,496
You know you never called me
by my name before?

83
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
You always call me "Prez."

84
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,506
It was the first time
you called me by my name.

85
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,308
I know.

86
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,646
I was afraid you'd find out

87
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,398
if I called you by your name.

88
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,776
Find out what?

89
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,988
That I like you.

90
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,663
I don't get good grades,

91
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,250
and I hung out with the bullies
in tenth grade.

92
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,961
But you're a model student

93
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,380
and get good grades.

94
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,427
And you're pretty.

95
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,947
Su-hyeok.

96
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,908
I like you.

97
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm glad…

98
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,196
I found out before I died.

99
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,638
NIGHT DUTY ROOM

100
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,518
Hello, sir.

101
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,647
Shit. You scared me.

102
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,442
You're…

103
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,236
you're Seon-yeong, right?

104
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,572
It's Eun-ji.

105
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,824
Right. Eun-ji.

106
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
Are you all right?

107
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,331
I am.

108
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,335
But I'm starving.

109
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,380
It's driving me crazy.

110
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,882
What?

111
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,011
Hey.

112
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,905
You're not okay, are you?

113
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,574
You were bitten, weren't you?

114
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,493
Yes.

115
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,203
I was.

116
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,340
All right.

117
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,676
God, you must've been very hungry.

118
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,470
Eun-ji.

119
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,557
My God. That must've hurt a lot.

120
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,934
Right?

121
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,146
You should go to the infirmary, then!

122
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,285
Sir, remember what you said
when I told you I was getting bullied?

123
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,833
"Why are you telling me?"

124
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,335
"Go tell your homeroom teacher."

125
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,925
And after the committee, you also said,

126
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,887
"You're an outcast
because you're so dense."

127
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,724
Do I still seem dense?

128
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,395
Okay, I get it. So get out.

129
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,858
Get out. Please.

130
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,072
Stay back.

131
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,283
Stay back.

132
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,081
Get out.

133
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,208
Get out.

134
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,744
-What is it?
-I heard something strange.

135
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,183
What if she's turning?

136
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,936
-I thought hambies didn't turn?
-You scared me.

137
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,103
My bad.

138
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,274
I hear it.

139
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,861
-What?
-What do you hear?

140
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,033
Someone is puking.

141
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,085
It stopped.

142
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,757
What did?

143
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,802
The puking.

144
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,196
Stop that. You're scaring me.

145
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,825
Don't you hear it?

146
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,244
What are you talking about?

147
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,959
What?

148
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,503
-What is it?
-Are you scared?

149
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,171
Stop that.

150
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,881
It's just that

151
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,384
you're breathing the loudest.

152
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,858
I hate this fucking school.

153
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,738
Do you hear something?

154
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,615
All I hear is that zombie.

155
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,693
What?

156
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,503
Let's get out of here.
This place feels weird.

157
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,463
We can't just leave.

158
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,757
There are too many zombies.

159
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,302
We should've gone to the rooftop
when the music was playing earlier.

160
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,720
Damn it.

161
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,638
Music.

162
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,557
That's right. We have music.

163
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,185
Where do we have music?

164
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,034
Fuck.

165
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,882
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

166
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,350
Ah, fuck!

167
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,062
You moron. Fuck.

168
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,939
You scared me.

169
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,152
Hey, come in here.

170
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,237
What are you waiting for? Move your ass!

171
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,781
Hurry up. Get in here.

172
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,033
Get in here.

173
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,410
Come in, you asshole.

174
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,377
-Are you okay?
-What?

175
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,588
Where were you?

176
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
Me?

177
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,049
Obviously, you.

178
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,594
What happened to your eye?

179
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,014
What? My eye?

180
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,101
Stop spacing out, asshole.

181
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,770
What are you looking at, moron?

182
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,191
Hey. Listen carefully. You see that car?

183
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,569
-Run to it.
-Why should I?

184
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,946
Just shut up and run if I say so.

185
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,824
You want me to lure the zombies?

186
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,828
You go that way and lure the zombies.

187
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,747
I'll go that way and scream.

188
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,458
Let's run to the snack shop
while the zombies are confused.

189
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,920
-Got that?
-I'll be going away from the snack shop.

190
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,089
That's why you should run like hell
and circle around.

191
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,925
Go. Get going. Run.

192
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,635
I don't want to.

193
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,637
You chickenshit.

194
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,263
Get out. Go.

195
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,308
I'm not a chicken anymore.
I'm not your gopher anymore either.

196
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
Hey. What's gotten into you?

197
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,606
Snap out of it, will you?

198
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:33,982
Look at me.

199
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,026
It's me, asshole.

200
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,819
Me.

201
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,284
Fine. I'll go.

202
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,452
Hurry.

203
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,830
Hurry up. Now.

204
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,252
Come with me.

205
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,169
What?

206
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,553
Quiet.

207
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,764
The zombies will come.

208
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,476
Watch carefully.

209
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,103
Look.

210
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,648
I'm above you now, got that?

211
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,649
Okay.

212
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,111
You moron. You chickenshit.

213
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,654
Beg for your life.

214
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,409
Come on.

215
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,869
"Save me." Go on.

216
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,415
Save me. Please save me.

217
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,541
I don't want to.

218
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,509
Gwi-nam! Help me, you fucking asshole!

219
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,438
Cheong-san.

220
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,983
I'll gouge your eye out.

221
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,285
We'll build a tall barricade here

222
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,538
and lure them in with music.
We'll use the instruments too.

223
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,958
If we leave the door open,
they'll hear the music and come in.

224
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,919
When the hallway clears,
we'll use the back door and go up.

225
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,212
So you're saying we should

226
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,175
stack desks, chairs, and whatnot
in the middle here,

227
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,387
open the door,
and run out through the back door, right?

228
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,640
Not here. A little farther back.

229
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,017
More room on this side.

230
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,227
Why is that?

231
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,772
There aren't many of us,
but there are many zombies.

232
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,776
I see. She sucks at school,
but she's pretty smart.

233
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,943
Hey.

234
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,570
It's a compliment.

235
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,743
Let's give it a shot.
We can think about the rest later.

236
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,745
We have a TV too.

237
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,247
Let's connect it and make it louder.

238
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,416
We have to look for the cord.

239
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,669
-Ji-min, help me look.
-Okay.

240
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,088
-Me too.
-This way, Ji-min.

241
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,798
Let's give it a shot.

242
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,009
Guys.

243
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,469
What should we do first?

244
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,970
Let's untie that.

245
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,889
We should build a frame first.

246
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,725
I'll do the moving.
You guys work on the frame.

247
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,310
It's okay.

248
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,895
Su-hyeok.

249
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,855
Keep it down.

250
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,400
She can never get close
to the others like this.

251
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,485
And no one will approach her.

252
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,154
How do we do this quietly?

253
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,283
-Hatred is contagious.
-Try this one if that's too heavy.

254
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,660
But so is trust.

255
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,286
Which one? That one?

256
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,455
Not that one.

257
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,498
Put it down here.

258
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,749
Right here?

259
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,750
Nam-ra.

260
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,670
One, two, three.

261
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,557
You should've been
the classroom president.

262
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,148
Joon-yeong, I can't find the cable.

263
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,484
Where is it?

264
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,700
Let's help.

265
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,410
Let's go.

266
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,707
Hey, can you lift this?

267
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,251
One, two, three.

268
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,297
What can I do? That hurts.

269
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,325
RESTRICTED AREA

270
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,054
Hey. Keep it down.

271
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,014
Be quiet.

272
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,897
They'll latch on in swarms.

273
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,066
Make sure to stack it right
so it doesn't fall.

274
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,526
Well…

275
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,154
Over there. Fill the empty spot.

276
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,664
Let's tie it there first.

277
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,460
You need to tie them tighter.

278
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,212
More tightly!

279
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,590
On the other side too.

280
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,849
Is there anything bigger?

281
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,777
It's looking great.

282
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,748
It hurts!

283
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,333
It hurts!

284
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,335
Suck it up.

285
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,087
You're a damn senior.

286
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,631
Must seniors endure everything?

287
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,884
I'm enduring not smoking,
but you can't handle that?

288
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,637
-Do you die from not smoking?
-Yes, you do.

289
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,473
I feel like I'm going to fucking die,
so you suck it up too.

290
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,809
We'll take the trail behind the building.

291
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,019
Once we get past the tennis courts,

292
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,689
we can go through the construction site
and go up the mountain.

293
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,691
Can we make it?

294
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,236
-I don't know.
-Fuck.

295
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,279
Min-jae.

296
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,991
If you don't think you can go on,
just drop it and shoot.

297
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,785
Okay.

298
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,203
What about me?

299
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,958
-Let's go.
-Mi-jin, on three.

300
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,795
Ready? One, two, three!

301
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,963
Hold on. Wait.

302
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,340
Wait.

303
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,426
Hold on. Wait.

304
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:44,514
Hey. Give them the arrows
when they run out, okay?

305
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,350
Let's go.

306
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,186
One, two, three.

307
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
Fuck, he's so heavy!

308
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,400
Shit.

309
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,077
Hold on.

310
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,791
Hey. Wait.

311
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,547
Hey. It broke! What now?

312
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,591
-Get back in. Hurry!
-Get inside! Hurry!

313
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,884
-Get back!
-Damn it!

314
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,968
They're coming!

315
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,388
-Oh my God.
-They are coming!

316
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,565
Hey. Just go without me.

317
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,983
Idiot.

318
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,860
You can't take me anyway.

319
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,697
You'll post about it on Facebook
if we leave you behind.

320
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,948
I won't.

321
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,074
I don't trust you.

322
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,160
Hey, stop pretending to be nice.

323
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,829
You killed Ha-lim.

324
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,502
What? You don't care about others.

325
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,045
You're such a dick.

326
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,675
Let's make it again. Stronger this time.

327
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,385
Okay.

328
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,774
What? What the hell do you want from me?

329
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,986
It hurts like crazy.
Do you know how it feels to be dying?

330
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,613
I do.

331
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,449
I feel that way every time I take a test.

332
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,869
But

333
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,956
there's only so much I can take
because you're in pain.

334
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,583
Shut up and stay quiet.

335
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,964
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

336
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,681
Is that okay? Does it hurt?

337
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,353
Sir.

338
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,273
I think

339
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,485
we should use our mobility
to get out of here first

340
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,737
and send the army for the kids.

341
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,489
I think that's more rational.

342
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,533
Sir?

343
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,205
If we all die,
who will let them know about the laptop--

344
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,707
Ho-seong.

345
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,958
It's Ho-cheol.

346
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,959
Ho-cheol.

347
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,672
Do you know why people run to safety
when there's danger?

348
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,177
It's because others put themselves
in danger for them.

349
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,639
There's no reason for us
to put ourselves in danger for them.

350
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
You're so frustrating.

351
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,436
I ought to just…

352
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,897
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

353
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,983
to get a statue of you erected.
One as big as Admiral Yi Sun-sin's.

354
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,359
Okay? Happy now?

355
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,571
Seriously.

356
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,699
If you're scared, you can stay here.

357
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,702
Goodness. Well put.

358
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,624
We'll leave here together now.

359
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,043
We'll go zoom on the motorcycle, okay?

360
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,795
What about Mommy?

361
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,220
Mommy?

362
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,433
Let's come back for her later, okay?

363
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,774
My son is about your age. He's handsome.

364
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,484
I'll introduce him to you later.

365
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,445
I already have a boyfriend.

366
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,326
What did I say to do once we go out?

367
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,413
You said to keep my eyes shut
and hold onto you.

368
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,874
That's right. Good girl. Very good.

369
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,293
Are you ready?

370
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,170
No.

371
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,675
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

372
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,553
Go faster! Faster!

373
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,514
Speed up! Go faster!

374
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,683
Shut up!
You're drawing them to us, asshole!

375
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,810
Shut up, you idiot!

376
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,854
I said to shut up!

377
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,816
Oh my goodness!

378
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,240
-They're behind us!
-In front of us too, moron!

379
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,704
Turn!

380
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,374
-Where?
-Turn!

381
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,256
-Shit.
-This way, sir. This way.

382
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,634
Watch out! Careful!

383
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,553
Right! Go right!

384
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,682
It's a dead end! Fuck!

385
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,308
-What do we do?
-Wait.

386
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,310
Hey! There's a way!

387
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,895
-There is?
-There is!

388
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,938
Let's go.

389
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,815
What are you doing?

390
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,279
Come this way, assholes! Let's go!

391
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,539
Sir!

392
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,875
Se-bin, we're saved!

393
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,793
Pipe down unless you want more of them.

394
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,462
Help me!

395
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,796
What was that?

396
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,089
-Over here!
-What's that?

397
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,257
Where's it coming from?

398
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,092
Here!

399
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,552
Help me!

400
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,054
Hey!

401
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,056
-Over here!
-What is that?

402
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,015
Hey, you idiot!

403
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,851
-Thank goodness.
-Why's he talking down to us?

404
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,397
-All right. Hang on.
-What took you so long?

405
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,649
-Let's just go. Please?
-What?

406
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,651
Let's just go.

407
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,652
Please help me.

408
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,321
Just go. Let's go.

409
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,741
-Do you have something to drink?
-They're coming.

410
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,700
Where?

411
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,496
No, they're not, asshole.

412
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,373
Can you make it down?

413
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,084
No. I hurt my leg.

414
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,377
-I can't get down.
-I said let's just go.

415
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,630
Let's go. Come on.

416
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,674
What? Why are you getting off?

417
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,259
-What do you plan to do?
-Hey.

418
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,596
Here, take the baby.

419
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,764
Why am I taking it?

420
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,140
Hurry up, sir.

421
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,643
-Hold on.
-What are you doing?

422
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,602
Stay still.

423
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,646
Stay right here.

424
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,357
-Bring the bike close.
-Gosh.

425
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,900
Yes, climb up there.

426
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,361
Bring it close. Hurry.

427
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,363
They're coming. Come on. Hurry.

428
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,739
Screw that.

429
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,866
Ho-cheol!

430
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,409
-What? Where is he going?
-Hey!

431
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,912
-Hey! Ho-cheol!
-Where the hell is he going?

432
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,706
-Hey, Seoul University! Hey!
-Get back here!

433
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,729
I think this is good enough.

434
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,399
Okay.

435
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,193
Aren't you coming over?

436
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,320
Come over. We left a gap.

437
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,656
Let's go.

438
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
Come over here.

439
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,423
Someone has to open the door.

440
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,803
Couldn't you use your head
a little better?

441
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,722
It's okay.

442
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,807
-I'll open it and come over.
-Wait.

443
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,142
I'll go with you.

444
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,603
-It's okay.
-It is not okay.

445
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,063
Here.

446
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,495
Something happened
between you and Gwi-nam, right?

447
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,372
He wanted to kill you.

448
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,836
Shit.

449
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,506
I saw him kill the principal.

450
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,927
I said I'd tell the cops,

451
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,178
so he tried to kill me.

452
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,514
Crazy asshole.

453
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,108
Gwi-nam's dead.

454
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,944
Really?

455
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:18,903
Yes.

456
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,114
He fell from the fourth floor
while we were fighting.

457
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,620
-And I like Nam-ra.
-What?

458
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,248
I've liked Nam-ra for a while.

459
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,793
-The classroom president?
=Be good to On-jo, okay?

460
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,546
Don't treat her like a guy, you moron.

461
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,926
What are you looking at?
I'm going to open the door.

462
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,638
Go. Get over there.

463
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,640
Go.

464
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,343
Damn it!

465
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,284
Oh no.

466
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,211
Fuck!

467
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,881
Dae-su, make some noise!

468
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,469
You zombie bastards!

469
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,393
Again!

470
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,436
God.

471
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,816
Come here, you fucking zombies!

472
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,670
Wu-jin!

473
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,715
We can't go yet! Hang on!

474
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,023
Nam-ra!

475
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,374
It's going to fall!

476
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,795
Fuck.

477
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,550
How much longer? When can we fucking go?

478
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,221
A little more. Hang on!

479
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,420
We need to study him
to create a treatment or a vaccine,

480
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,006
but we don't have
the facilities or the manpower here.

481
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,175
We must take him to the KDCA.

482
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,181
He cannot leave the quarantine zone
for any reason whatsoever.

483
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,226
Recruit scientists and build the facility.

484
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,354
Airlift all the necessary equipment
and medical supplies.

485
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,150
-What's his name?
-He's Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun.

486
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:13,113
He had a week left until his discharge,
but he volunteered for the operation.

487
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,033
Call his parents
and get their consent for research.

488
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,329
We're under martial law,
so we don't need consent.

489
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,915
If you give the go-ahead,

490
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,502
we can begin the experiments
or autopsy right away.

491
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,337
Call his parents.

492
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,715
Even if we're under martial law,

493
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,301
that's our duty
as the military who took in their child.

494
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,303
Yes, sir.

495
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,610
Commander, sir.

496
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,321
There's an assembly member
awaiting testing.

497
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,364
Follow the rules.

498
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,951
It's Park Eun-hee
from the National Defense Committee.

499
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,120
Darn it.

500
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,589
I'm the commander.

501
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,467
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

502
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,469
Even if you are an assembly member,

503
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,055
there won't be any special treatment.

504
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,600
That is what I came to tell you.

505
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,769
Don't harass the people working hard.

506
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,981
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay quiet and follow the rules.

507
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,568
Fine. I have a favor to ask though.

508
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,112
Please send a chopper
to Hyosan High School.

509
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,032
A firefighter is heading there alone.

510
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,701
Commander. Hey. Wait!

511
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,537
Send a chopper to the school!

512
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,456
We must save the students!

513
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,127
Even wars can't eliminate schools.

514
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,714
Even if we win the war,
we lose if we lose our schools!

515
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,729
How many students have we saved so far?

516
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,066
Zero so far, sir.

517
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,234
We think no one got out

518
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,612
because they were in class.

519
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,782
Are there choppers available?

520
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,159
No, sir.
They've all been sent on missions.

521
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,417
Request a Black Hawk
and have them scan schools in Hyosan.

522
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,795
Yes, sir.

523
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,131
MAP OF HYOSAN

524
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,812
Should we scan Gangha-dong as well?

525
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,275
Isn't that where your mother is?

526
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,408
We can check
once it is selected as a rescue zone.

527
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,161
Yes, sir.

528
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,180
It's clear! We have to go now!

529
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,187
Hurry!

530
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,067
Cheong-san!

531
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,404
-Go!
-You go first!

532
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,457
I think I'm going to shit myself! Go!

533
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,756
-Come on.
-Let's go.

534
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,405
Hurry.

535
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,996
Move.

536
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,140
PROPER EDUCATION BREEDS GOOD CHARACTER!

537
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,145
Alpha is at the rescue zone.

538
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,982
It is impossible to check for survivors
at Cheongmok Middle School.

539
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,692
Alpha lifting.

540
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,277
Going to Hyosan High.

541
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,706
Come on.

542
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,550
Over here!

543
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,260
Here! I'm here!

544
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,605
Open it!

545
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,357
It's locked.

546
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,067
What?

547
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,527
Move.

548
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,620
Wait. Step aside.

549
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,208
Shit.

550
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,546
Is anyone there?

551
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,173
Anyone?

552
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,092
Is anyone there? Anyone?

553
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,761
Open the door!

554
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,555
Nobody's there! Get back.
Hey, brother-in-law.

555
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,266
One, two, three!

556
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,060
One, two, three!

557
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,859
THE ROOFTOP IS OFF LIMITS TO STUDENTS

558
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,444
Shit.

559
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:13,992
They're coming.

560
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,327
What's coming?

561
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,918
We're outcasts again.

562
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,753
And this is still hell.

563
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,965
I hope everyone dies.
Every single one of them.

564
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,353
Mom.

565
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,355
It's me.

566
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,191
Dad, you're okay too, right?

567
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,985
I'm…

568
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,530
I'm doing okay.

569
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:54,992
Mom.

570
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,745
But Cheongsan Chicken is still lame.

571
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,791
If it were Cheongsan Air, Cheongsan Auto,

572
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,292
or Cheongsan Group,

573
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:06,878
it would be fine.

574
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,966
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

575
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:16,263
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

576
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,479
They're here.

577
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,630
DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

578
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,556
Get back!

579
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,573
Throw this over!

580
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,814
Out of my way.

581
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,079
Freeze!

582
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,957
Get down!

583
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,880
Are you okay?

584
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,136
What about your friends?

585
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,513
Isn't there anyone else?

586
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,352
Hold onto it!

587
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,770
Pull it tight!

588
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,790
ONE HEART

589
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,021
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

590
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,315
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

591
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:29,404
