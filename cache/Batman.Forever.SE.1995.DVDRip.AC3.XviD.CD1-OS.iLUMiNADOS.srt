1
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,079
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich
with you, sir?

2
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,152
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,996
You're counting on the winged avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,911
aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,553
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,349
Maybe, maybe not. You can say
we're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,916
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,791
What say we flip for it?

9
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,517
One man is born a hero,
his brother, a coward.

10
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,195
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,233
holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,233
Why?

13
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,315
Luck!

14
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,349
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,749
clueless luck!

16
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,549
The wrath of toss.

17
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,952
The only true justice.

18
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,555
Let's see what justice has in store...

19
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,834
for you.

20
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,871
It's like the touch of God. Wait.

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,911
Fortune smiles,
another day of wine and roses.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,070
Or, in your case, beer and pizza.

23
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,389
Out of here!

24
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,118
- But you said you'd let me live!
- Too true, and so you shall.

25
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,158
Nothing better than live bait to trap a bat.

26
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
What if we could get some kind of a horn?

27
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,113
Hot entrance.

28
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,709
Two-Face?

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,950
Two guards are dead.
He's holding a third hostage.

30
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,600
- Didn't see this one coming.
- We should have, though.

31
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,678
The Second Bank of Gotham on the...

32
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,637
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,153
How could Two-Face resist?

34
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,793
I'm Chase Meridian.

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,673
I asked Dr. Meridian to come to Gotham
to consult on this case.

36
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,829
She specializes in...

37
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,070
Abnormal Psychology,
multiple personalities.

38
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,394
I read your work.

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,392
Insightful. Naive, but insightful.

40
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,674
I'm flattered.

41
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,228
Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

42
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,435
Can we reason with him?

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,239
- He's holding innocent people up there.
- It won't do any good.

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,038
He'll slaughter them
without thinking twice.

45
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,109
Agreed.

46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,590
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves the victim...

47
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,513
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,352
- Exactly.
- Like you.

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,436
Let's just say,
I could write a hell of a paper...

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,829
on a grown man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

51
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,715
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,036
Really? I didn't know that.

53
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,312
You are interesting.

54
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,033
And call me Chase.

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,597
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I just call you "Bats"?

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,391
Let's start this party with a bang!

57
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,559
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.

58
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,359
Boys, kill the bat!

59
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,593
Blast him!

60
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,952
Open sesame.

61
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,799
It's a trap!

62
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,789
Oh, no!

63
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,632
<i>Attention, citizens of fair Gotham.</i>

64
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,315
<i>When we open that safe,</i>
<i>we'll have everything we ever wanted.</i>

65
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,869
<i>Enough cash</i>
<i>to rain down upon fair Gotham...</i>

66
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,554
<i>a glorious flood of chaos.</i>

67
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,428
<i>And, of course, you, my boy, dead.</i>

68
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,949
Oh, no, it's boiling acid!

69
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,839
<i>For your dying pleasure</i>
<i>we're serving the very same acid...</i>

70
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,354
<i>that made us the men we are today.</i>

71
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,548
- No.
- Hold on.

72
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,868
Yes.

73
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,268
Haul away.

74
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,711
Yes, haul away.

75
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,875
- Give me your hand.
- Don't let go!

76
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,839
Gonna have to borrow this.

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,635
Hey, that's my hearing aid!

78
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,189
Thanks.

79
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,397
My shoes are melting!

80
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,594
No more!

81
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,716
- Hang on.
- Hang on?

82
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,790
Get him down.

83
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,317
Take it easy with him, fellows.

84
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,874
You'll be all right, young man.
Just stay calm.

85
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,712
Easy, just easy.

86
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,913
This'll fix him.

87
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,993
Hang on, Batty!

88
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,829
Let's see.

89
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,555
Yes.

90
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,195
Yes! Oh, happy day.

91
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,119
Farewell forever to that
pointy-eared night rat.

92
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,189
Face!

93
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,277
Hey, Face!

94
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,396
- Die!
- No!

95
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,235
You need help, Harvey. Give it up.

96
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,514
Have the good taste to die.

97
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,833
See you.

98
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,593
<i>Despite a valiant effort last night</i>
<i>by Batman...</i>

99
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,309
<i>Harvey Two-Face is still at large</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

100
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,868
<i>And in other news today,</i>

<i>of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

104
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,838
- Mr. Wayne.
- Hello, Fred.

105
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,115
Your inspections
are a departmental highlight.

106
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,839
Oh, my God, it's him.

107
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,392
I am a winner.

108
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,433
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

109
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,398
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

110
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,155
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

111
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,074
Mister...

112
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,632
Bruce Wayne.

113
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,359
No, that's my name. And you are?

114
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,475
Nygma.

115
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,675
Edward.

116
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,320
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

117
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,710
Just like I tell everyone.

118
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,839
We've never actually met,
but your name was on the hiring slip.

119
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,311
- I have it.
- I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.

120
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,031
Yes, of course.

121
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,633
I'm sorry.

122
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,312
It's just that...

123
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,634
you're my idol.

124
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,994
Back to work, Edward.

125
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,516
And some people
have been trying to keep us apart.

126
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,273
- Back to work, Edward.
- It's okay.

127
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,511
So, Mr. Nygma, what's on your mind?

128
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,751
Precisely. What's on all our minds?

129
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,476
Brain waves.

130
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,834
The future of Wayne Enterprises...

131
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,351
is brain waves.

132
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,273
I'm gonna have to apologize, Mr. Wayne.

133
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,396
I personally terminated his project
this morning.

134
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,469
It's okay.

135
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,919
I have it.

136
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,155
<i>Voilà.</i>

137
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,679
My invention...

138
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,514
beams any TV signal
directly into the human brain.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,436
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves, if you will...

140
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,310
this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

141
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,919
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

142
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,992
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

143
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,955
Yes.

144
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,113
But...

145
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,272
someone like you would never need it.

146
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,438
Someone so...

147
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,075
intelligent, witty...

148
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,028
and charming.

149
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,078
I just need a bit of additional funding
for human trials.

150
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,913
- Let me show you, please.
- Now, listen, Ed...

151
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,878
I want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

152
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,793
I want you to know
we'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

153
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,633
Look at us. Two of a kind!

154
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,473
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

155
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,758
That's not gonna be good for me.

156
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,552
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,192
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,234
I'm sorry, Ed, then the answer is no.

159
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,270
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,952
mind manipulation...

161
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,319
it just raises too many questions.

162
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,835
Sorry.

163
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,192
Thanks everybody, keep up the good work.
Factory looks great.

164
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,874
All right, everyone, back to work.

165
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,871
We'll discuss this later.

166
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,397
You were supposed to understand.

167
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,713
I'll make you understand.

168
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,675
Lock.

169
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,194
Chair.

170
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,909
- Alfred.
- I saw the signal, sir.

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,399
All is ready.

172
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,550
- Commissioner Gordon?
- He's at home.

173
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,912
I sent the signal.

174
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,399
What's wrong?

175
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,957
Last night, at the bank,
I noticed something about Two-Face:

176
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,268
His coin.

177
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,278
It's his Achilles' heel.

178
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,193
- It can be exploited.
- I know.

179
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,238
You called me here for this?

180
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,470
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

181
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,798
I wish I could say
that my interest in you was...

182
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,552
purely professional.

183
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,108
Are you trying to get under my cape,
Doctor?

184
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,953
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

185
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,315
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.

186
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,354
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

187
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,756
In grade school, it was guys with earrings.

188
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,355
College: Motorcycles, leather jackets.

189
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,835
Now...

190
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,077
black rubber.

191
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,829
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

192
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,590
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

193
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,833
- We all wear masks.
- My life's an open book. You read?

194
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,194
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

195
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,675
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

196
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,470
you bring your scarred psyche.

197
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,552
- Direct, aren't you?
- You like strong women.

198
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,358
I've done my homework.

199
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,512
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

200
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,834
I haven't had that much luck with women.

201
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,719
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

202
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,795
I saw the signal.

203
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,677
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

204
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,995
False alarm.

205
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,033
Are you sure?

206
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,389
Women.

207
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,519
Okay...

208
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,876
now I've got it!

209
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,188
Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

210
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,713
There's just too many...

211
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,792
I'll show you it works.

212
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,348
What the hell is going on here?

213
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,399
I told you this project is terminated.
I'm calling security.

214
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,472
Caffeine will kill you!

215
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,188
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

216
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,874
What are you doing, Nygma? Untie me.

217
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,473
This won't hurt a bit.

218
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,869
At least, I don't think it will.

219
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,440
What're you doing? Nygma!

220
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,273
- You touch that switch and...
- Which one? This?

221
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,993
Losing resolution.

222
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,672
More power.

223
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,594
Edward Nygma, come on down...

224
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,992
you're the next contestant on <i>Brain Drain.</i>

225
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,712
I'll take what's inside thick skull
number one!

226
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,711
What have we got for him, Johnny?

227
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,876
Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough...

228
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,951
and a breakdown, maybe!

229
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,235
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

230
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,232
No, several geniuses.

231
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,072
A gaggle, a swarm...

232
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,913
a flock of freaking Freuds.

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,268
Riddle me this, Fred.

234
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,559
What is everything to someone
and nothing to everyone else?

235
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,637
Your mind, baby!

236
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,757
Now mine pumps with the power of yours.

237
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,559
I'm sucking up your IQ...

238
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,872
vacuuming your cortex...

239
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,234
feeding off your brain.

240
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,349
Fred!

241
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,233
What a rush!

242
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,036
What the hell just happened?

243
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,549
A very surprising side effect.

244
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,838
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

245
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,674
I utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

246
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,990
Bruce Wayne was right.

247
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,756
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad.

248
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,956
It is brain manipulation.

249
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,190
I'm reporting you to the FCC...

250
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,193
the Human Experimentation Board,
the AMI, and the police.

251
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,271
You are going up on charges...

252
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,918
to court, to jail...

253
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,197
and then to a mental institution,
for the rest of your twisted little life.

254
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,158
But, first and foremost, Nygma,
you are fired.

255
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,708
Do you hear me? Fired!

256
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,916
I don't think so.

257
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,034
Hang on!

258
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,589
Fred.

259
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,869
Babe!

260
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,316
You are fired.

261
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,949
Or should I say terminated?

262
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,758
Surf's up, big kahuna!

263
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,115
Nice form, but a little rough
on the landing.

264
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
He may have to settle for the bronze.

265
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,188
Questions, Mr. Wayne?

266
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,791
My work raises too many questions?

267
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,594
<i>Why hasn't anybody...</i>

268
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,750
<i>put you in your place?</i>

269
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,154
<i>Harvey Dent,</i>
<i>once Gotham 's District Attorney...</i>

270
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,630
<i>was horribly scarred</i>
<i>by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.</i>

271
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,631
<i>Although Batman tried to save him...</i>

272
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,315
<i>Dent's left-brain damage</i>
<i>transformed him into a violent criminal...</i>

273
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,188
<i>who blames Batman, and who has vowed</i>
<i>to destroy the Dark Knight.</i>

274
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,155
<i>Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,</i>
<i>repeat, extremely...</i>

275
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,912
That was the Commissioner Gordon, sir.

276
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,878
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

277
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,197
- Horrible way to die.
- Yes.

278
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,157
The video surveillance cameras
are down here.

279
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,310
We'll dredge the river,
but with that current...

280
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,152
I doubt we'll ever find the body.

281
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,229
Why? Oh, why?

282
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,191
I just can't believe it.

283
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,113
Two years working in the same office.

284
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,791
He was like my father, my brother...

285
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,879
or a cousin that visits all the time.

286
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,916
Get a grip, Edward.

287
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,437
I found this in my cubicle.

288
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,670
You'll find the handwriting matches
his exactly...

289
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,716
as does sentence structure and spelling.

290
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,920
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

291
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,675
The memories...

292
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,189
This is last night's security log.

293
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,033
There's Stickley.

294
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,592
Pretty cut-and-dry.

295
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,510
Yep, definitely suicide.

296
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,199
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

297
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,872
Stickley's suicide. It doesn't make sense.

298
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,712
I want full benefits for his family.

299
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,314
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

300
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,072
I know. Full benefits.

301
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,310
Gossip Gerty has called a record 32 times.

302
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,313
- Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?
- I'll let you know. What's this?

303
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,473
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

304
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,713
That's hideous.

305
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,592
What does it mean?

306
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,874
It's a riddle.

307
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,270
"Numbers on my face... 13."

308
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,077
One through 12. The answer is "a clock."

309
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,310
Who would send you a riddle?

310
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,234
That, Maggie, is the riddle.

311
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,759
Guess what I did today?

312
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,599
Wayne Manor.

313
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,313
See you soon.

314
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,919
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

315
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,555
I...

316
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,394
guess I'm early.

317
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,757
I have an appointment.

318
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,559
- I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Good.

319
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,269
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

320
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,479
I'm sorry.

321
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,913
You sounded like you were in...

322
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,078
you know, trouble.

323
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,791
I prefer healthy expressions of violence...

324
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,791
as opposed to breaking and entering.

325
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,391
So, how can I help you, Mr. Wayne?

326
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,676
Someone's been sending me love letters.

327
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,877
One at my office,
and one last night at my home.

328
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,515
I...

329
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,751
Commissioner Gordon thought you might
give me your expert opinion.

330
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,234
Clock.

331
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,435
Clock.

332
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,394
A match.

333
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,674
My opinion, this letter writer
is a total wacko.

334
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,435
Wacko?

335
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,717
That a technical term?

336
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,548
Patient may suffer
from obsessional syndrome...

337
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,872
with potential homicidal tendencies.
Does that work better for you?

338
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,396
So, what you're saying is
this guy's a total wacko.

339
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,953
Exactly.

340
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,158
He's obsessed with you.

341
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,073
His only escape
may be to purge the fixation.

342
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,953
To kill me.

343
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,233
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

344
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,592
You have a thing for bats?

345
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,710
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne. An inkblot.

346
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,756
People see what they want.

347
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,037
I think the question would be,
do you have a thing for bats?

348
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,675
Still playing with dolls, Doctor?

349
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,995
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

350
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,476
Some cultures believe
she protects you from bad dreams.

351
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,990
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

352
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,033
You look so sad.

353
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,158
Do you need one?

354
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,397
Me? No. Why would I?

355
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,150
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you, Bruce Wayne?

356
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,308
What is it you really came here for?

357
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,316
Yikes, time's up.

358
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,478
That's usually my line.

359
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,790
Listen, I'd love to stay here chatting...

360
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,393
Would you?

361
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,199
I'm not so sure.

362
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,155
I've really got to get you
out of those clothes.

363
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,596
- Excuse me?
- And into a black dress.

364
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,955
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

365
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,157
Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,276
boys and girls of all ages...

367
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,079
welcome to the greatest show on earth.

368
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,958
Bruce, who is this
beautiful young woman you're with?

369
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,600
- Dr. Chase Meridian.
- A doctor?

370
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,352
What kind of doctor?

371
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,556
<i>... for Gotham Children's Hospital.</i>

372
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,995
<i>Let's thank our largest single donor:</i>

373
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,435
<i>Bruce Wayne!</i>

374
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,989
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

375
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,230
<i>70 feets above the ground...</i>

376
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,108
<i>performing feats</i>
<i>of unimaginable aerial skill...</i>

377
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,430
<i>the Flying Graysons.</i>

378
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,549
Listen...

379
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,438
I'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

380
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,832
I'd like to...

381
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,593
I love climbing. I really love it.

382
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,995
But?

383
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,112
I've met someone.

384
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,389
That's fast work. You just moved here.

385
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,232
You could say he just kind of...

386
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,078
dropped out of the sky...

387
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,991
and bang!

388
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,119
I think he felt it, too.

389
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,555
- He sure did.
- What?

390
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,355
Who wouldn't?

391
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,112
<i>And now...</i>

392
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,275
<i>Richard, the youngest flying Grayson...</i>

393
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,920
<i>will perform the awe-inspiring...</i>

394
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,831
<i>death drop...</i>

395
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,950
<i>without the safety of a net.</i>

396
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,077
- Okay, let's go.
- You'll be all right.

397
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,349
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

398
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,352
<i>at this time, the new management</i>
<i>of the Circus International...</i>

399
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,910
<i>invites you to forget this good, clean,</i>
<i>wholesome all-American fun...</i>

400
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,389
<i>and join us in a celebration</i>
<i>of absolute chaos...</i>

401
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,835
<i>and true jesters!</i>

402
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,876
Bring it on, now!

403
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,072
<i>Tonight, a new act</i>
<i>for your personal amazement...</i>

404
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,755
<i>we call it Massacre Under the Big Top.</i>

405
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,595
<i>If we may direct your attention</i>
<i>to the middle of the center ring.</i>

406
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,797
<i>Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...</i>

407
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,589
<i>that's two-hundred sticks of TNT.</i>

408
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,231
<i>And in our innocent hand,</i>
<i>a radio detonator.</i>

409
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,870
- What the hell do you want, Harvey?
<i>- Want, Mr. Mayor?</i>

410
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,951
<i>One simple thing: Batman...</i>

411
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,709
<i>bruised, broke, bleeding. In a word: Dead!</i>

412
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,798
- Batman.
<i>- Who do we have before us?</i>

413
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,434
<i>Gotham 's finest, well-to-do, influential...</i>

414
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,829
<i>surely one of you knows who Batman is.</i>

415
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,072
<i>Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits</i>
<i>is Batman.</i>

416
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,988
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

417
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,594
Harvey...

418
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,879
I'm Batman!

419
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,155
Bruce!

420
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,073
We could stop them.
Mitch, if we go out on the rigging.

421
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,037
- Be careful, boys.
- Don't worry, Mom.

422
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,678
Go to work, boys.

423
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,352
Our kind of day.

424
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,432
Reach for it! Stop it.

425
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,715
Oh, my God!

426
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,909
Bruce.

427
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,197
It's good of you to take him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

428
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,159
We've had him filling out papers all day.
He hasn't slept, he hasn't even eaten.

429
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,192
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.

430
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,112
How you doing, Al?

431
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,351
There's a room prepared for you upstairs...

432
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,795
but perhaps you'd like to get
something to eat first.

433
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,070
Okay, I'm out of here.

434
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,555
Excuse me?

435
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,108
Look, I figured,
telling that cop I'd stay here for a while...

436
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,112
saved me a truckload
of social service interviews and charities...

437
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,919
so, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

438
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,394
Take it easy, Al.

439
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,789
Where will you go?

440
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,440
The circus must be halfway to Metropolis,
by now.

441
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,557
I'll get a fix on Two-Face.
Then I'm gonna kill him.

442
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,438
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.
It'll make it worse.

443
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,715
Look, spare me the sermons,
all right, Bruce?

444
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,599
I don't need your advice
and I don't need your charity.

445
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,556
- Nice bike.
- Hang out at a lot of biker bars, Bruce?

446
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,112
I see you're almost on empty.
Why don't you...

447
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,715
fill it up in the garage. There's not
a gas station around here for miles.

448
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,873
Pump's over here.

449
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,394
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

450
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,795
Wow.

451
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,828
- It's a 1917 Harley.
- Yep.

452
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,714
Indian classic, fully restored.

453
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,470
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

454
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,198
They only made like 100 of these.

455
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,153
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

456
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,472
- You've got two of them.
- Yeah, that one doesn't run, though.

457
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,430
Throttle sticks on this one.

458
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,159
Alfred's actually
a very good mechanic, but...

459
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,390
some of these need a lot of work.

460
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,275
Someone were to fix them up,
they could keep one as a fee.

461
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,155
Anyway, have a nice trip.

462
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,912
Sure you'll land on your feet.

463
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,549
Is the young master leaving?

464
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,868
Pity.

465
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,919
I'll just toss this away then,
perhaps the dogs are hungry.

466
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,638
Hey, Al, wait up.

467
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,192
Master Bruce?

468
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,990
Just like my parents.

469
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,311
It's happening again.

470
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,515
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

471
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,679
I killed them.

472
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,632
What did you say?

473
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,554
He killed them. Two-Face.

474
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,790
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

475
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,839
No. You said, "I killed them."

476
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,352
Take care of the kid.

477
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,919
Certainly, sir.

478
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,517
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

479
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,635
No.

480
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,118
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

481
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,839
Is this a robin?

482
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,879
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

483
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,070
My father said I was his hero.

484
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,959
I flew in like a robin.

485
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,950
Some hero I turned out to be.

486
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,635
But your father was right.

487
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,633
You are a hero. I can tell.

488
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,797
Throw this away, will you, Alfred?
I won't be needing it anymore.

489
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,592
I think I'll just put it in here.

490
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,475
Broken wings mend in time.

491
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,790
One day Robin will fly again.

492
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,913
I promise.

493
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,074
We'll drive, thank you.

494
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,993
The Puzzler?

495
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,039
The Gamester?

496
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,599
Captain Kill?

497
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,592
Question Mark Man?

498
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,156
Thank you. Thank you so much.

499
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,593
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

500
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,950
is driving us insane!

501
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,512
Don't worry, baby.

502
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,912
You'll kill him soon.

503
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,956
Besides, I made your favorite tonight.

504
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,271
Sparkling champagne and...

505
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,036
yummy poached salmon
with little itty-bitty quail eggs...

506
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,514
and a creamy, dreamy...

507
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,353
lemon soufflé.

508
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,996
No, I made your favorite.

509
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,834
A charred heart of black boar...

510
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,480
a side of raw donkey meat...

511
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,030
and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

512
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,634
Perfect!

513
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,558
Ladies, you spoil us.

514
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
We're of two minds about
what to eat first.

515
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,869
- What?
- I hope you made extra.

516
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,158
Who the hell are you?

517
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,433
Just a friend.

518
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,437
But you can call me...

519
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,359
The Riddler.

520
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,556
I'll call you dead, is more like it!

521
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,596
How did you find us here? Talk!

522
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,033
But then if I talked...

523
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,078
what would keep you from slaying me,
O Segregated One?

524
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,354
By the way...

525
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,079
that's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

526
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,957
- Let's see if you bleed green.
- Harvey...

527
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,154
I don't think it's me you want to kill.

528
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,239
That's just too easy
for someone as powerful as you...

529
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,549
and you.

530
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,793
But Batman...

531
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,838
there's a challenge.

532
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,954
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

533
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,439
But have you thought it through?

534
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,592
A few bullets, a quick splash of blood,
and then what?

535
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,194
Wet hands.

536
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,555
Post-homicidal depression.

537
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,829
- Why not humiliate him first?
- Yeah.

538
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,356
Expose his frailties.
And then, when he is at his weakest...

539
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,153
crush him!

540
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,757
I see that sparkle in your left eye.

541
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,550
I can help you get Batman.

542
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,312
That is, if you'll...

543
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,868
spare my life for just a few moments.

544
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,194
Thank you.

545
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,190
I simply love what you've done
with this place.

546
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,714
<i>Heavy Metal</i> meets <i>House and Garden.</i>

547
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,314
Beautiful.

548
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,630
It's so dark and Gothic and...

549
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,190
disgustingly decadent.

550
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,195
Yet so bright and chipper...

551
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,432
and conservative.

552
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,276
It's so you!

553
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,709
And yet, so you!

554
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,831
Very few people are
both a summer and a winter...

555
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,276
but you pull it off nicely.

556
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,952
What's the point, big boy?

557
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,238
Has anybody ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

558
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,110
This is the point.

559
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,790
This is how I found you.

560
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,792
Let me demonstrate.

561
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,670
This is your brain on The Box.

562
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,791
This is my brain on The Box.

563
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,155
Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?

564
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,071
I'll have a bit more. Thank you.

565
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,038
There's more. But only the first one's free.

566
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,798
Here's the bargain.

567
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,269
You will help me steal production capital...

568
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,033
so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

569
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,752
and become Gotham's cleverest
carbon-based life form!

570
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,912
And in return...

571
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,876
Is everybody paying attention?

572
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,953
I will help you
solve the greatest riddle of all.

573
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,996
The mother of all riddles:

574
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,154
Who is Batman?

575
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,830
You have broken into our hideout.

576
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,388
You have violated the sanctity of our lair.

577
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
For this we should crush your bones
into powder.

578
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,430
However, you've posed
a most interesting proposition.

579
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,718
Therefore, heads, we accept, and tails,
we blow your damn head off.

580
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,959
Here's a good one.

581
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,553
No!

582
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,038
There is a good one.

583
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,949
Leave that, Master Dick. I'll attend to it.

584
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,678
I'm not used to being waited on, Al.

585
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,389
Don't shoot me, please.

586
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,869
Don't you eyeball me! Give me that!

587
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,228
Hey, Two-Face,
show me how to punch a guy.

588
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,437
It's dirt-simple, my boy.
Ball up the fist, reach way back...

589
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,839
and assert yourself.

590
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,358
That looks like fun. Let me try.

591
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,512
Ball up the fist, reach way back,
assert yourself.

592
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,318
$100,220...

593
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,079
$100 and...

594
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,753
I lost count!

595
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,159
<i>In Gotham, last night...</i>

596
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,073
<i>another robbery perpetrated by</i>
<i>the city's green-suited menace...</i>

597
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,550
<i>resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,</i>
<i>with no sign of Batman.</i>

598
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,914
<i>Teamed with Two-Face...</i>

599
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,958
<i>this new criminal's pattern</i>
<i>of marking his crimes with puzzles...</i>

600
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,873
<i>has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.</i>

601
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,238
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

602
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,592
That was with the morning mail.

603
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,996
"The eight of us go forth, not back...

604
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,913
"to protect our king from a foe's attack."

605
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,438
Chess pawns. Clock. Match.

606
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,397
All physical objects, man-made.

607
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,675
Small in size, light in weight.

608
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,113
What's the connection?

609
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,590
With all due respect, sir, I think
that's why they call him The Riddler.

610
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,072
May I help you, Master Grayson?

611
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,799
How come this the only locked door
around this museum?

612
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,632
What've you got back there?

613
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,756
Master Wayne's dead wives.

614
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,552
The silver closet. On your way.

615
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,631
Now you can be part of the action!

616
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,552
NygmaTech brings the joy...

617
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,837
of 3-D entertainment
into your living room.

618
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,594
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...

619
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,634
my vision.

620
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,640
The Box in every home in America...

621
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,519
and one day, the world.

622
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,994
<i>In local news, Edward Nygma 's 3-D Box...</i>

623
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,230
<i>has become the rage of Gotham.</i>

624
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,554
<i>Rioting occurred last night</i>
<i>at electronics stores, which were sold out.</i>

625
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,472
<i>There is hardly a home</i>
<i>without the Nygma Tech Box.</i>

626
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,316
<i>Critics have claimed</i>
<i>The Box turns Gothamites into zombies.</i>

627
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,992
<i>But Edward Nygma just shrugs:</i>

628
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,833
<i>"That's what they said</i>
<i>when TV was invented. "</i>

629
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,359
Master Dick!

630
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,473
Up here, Al.

631
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,231
Just checking, young sir.

632
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,311
<i>Intruder alert.</i>
