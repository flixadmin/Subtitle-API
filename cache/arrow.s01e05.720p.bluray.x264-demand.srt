- It is the videotape, the suspicious timing.

- That is the reason.
- This is Oliver Queen we're talking about.

He wrecks fancy cars and he dates models.
He doesn't kill people.

No, he just uses them. Like he used Sara.
And like he used you.

He's only asked you to be his lawyer
to get at me.

No, he asked me to be his lawyer
