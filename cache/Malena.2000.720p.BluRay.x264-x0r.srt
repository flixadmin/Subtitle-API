1
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,168
Il Duce (Mussolini) 
will speak to the nation!

2
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,170
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,259
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,638
are ordered to turn them on.

5
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,558
Mussolini will speak to

6
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,311
all Italians!

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:07,107
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,403
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
II Duce will speak to the nation.

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,784
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.

10
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,370
and my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.

11
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,624
That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain ...

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,670
and I got my first bicycle.

13
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,256
The frame is British, the gears are German,

14
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,176
the pedals are French,

15
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:38,305
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,767
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

17
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,310
Are you sure it's safe?

18
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,145
I have new bikes too.

19
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,692
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

20
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,153
Fightingmen,

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,200
on land, on sea and in the air,

22
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,329
Black shirts of the revolution,

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,707
men and women of Italy...

24
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,085
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,780
The hour...

26
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,117
of decisions from which

27
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,496
there is no return.

28
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,292
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

29
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,418
Who knows?

30
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,421
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

31
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,549
The declaration of war...

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,429
has already been delivered to the ambassadors.

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,576
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

34
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,914
Hey, guys!

35
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,045
Lucky bastard.

36
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,174
- he got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

37
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,928
Custom-made, just like the racers.

38
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,848
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

39
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,100
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

40
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,937
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

41
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,189
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

42
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:57,361
- And you,"Don Sasa"?
- I don't want some kid poking into our business.

43
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,364
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

44
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,371
She's coming!

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,252
What's going on?

46
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:18,340
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

47
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,769
- Who is she?
- The daughter of the deaf guy, our new Latin teacher.

48
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,356
What's her name?
What a wonderful ass!

49
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,463
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

50
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,592
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

51
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,219
What's her name?

52
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,348
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

53
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,315
The sun is bigger than the moon.

54
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,361
"Sole magnum est quam lunam."

55
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,990
Or "Sol maior est luna."

56
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,076
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

57
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,494
Yes, but hurry.

58
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,499
I love honesty more than wealth.

59
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:03,088
"Magis diligo onestatem quam divitias."

60
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,718
Or "Magis diligo onestatem divitiis."

61
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,377
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

62
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,546
- Mine's a bazooka!
- I got eight!

63
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,675
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

64
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:52,304
One, two...three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

65
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,805
Torpedo!

66
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,059
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

67
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,271
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

68
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,442
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

69
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,654
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

70
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,657
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

71
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,204
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

72
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,206
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

73
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:24,169
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

74
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,589
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

75
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:31,468
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

76
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,639
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

77
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,766
and you still haven't measured yourself.

78
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,018
Measure it!

79
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,979
One, two,

80
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,274
three, four, five...

81
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,776
Only six!

82
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,655
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

83
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,615
Short pants: short dick!

84
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,535
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

85
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,786
Bullshit!

86
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,417
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

87
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,628
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

88
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,512
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

89
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,821
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

90
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,958
What cigarettes do you want?

91
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,003
Macedonia Extra.

92
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,651
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

93
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,738
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

94
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,784
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

95
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,288
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

96
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,748
My father's still young.

97
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,168
And you're too young
for long pants.

98
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,420
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

99
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,923
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

100
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,635
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

101
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:23,682
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

102
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,184
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

103
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,187
- Leave him alone!
- I know what I'm doing.

104
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,318
And you let your friends beat you up.

105
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,906
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

106
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,536
But stealing trousers from your father...

107
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,915
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

108
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,333
But, Papa, you don't understand!

109
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,545
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

110
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,047
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

111
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,216
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

112
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,176
Enough!
He's still a child!

113
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,973
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

114
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,814
Let's make a deal.

115
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:18,194
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

116
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,240
then you'll get long pants.

117
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,491
Swear it.

118
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,027
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

119
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,156
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

120
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,242
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

121
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,369
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

122
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,040
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

123
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,169
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

124
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,922
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

125
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,882
Not me!

126
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,137
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

127
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:35,263
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

128
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,776
<i># But love, no,</i>
<i>My love cannot...</i>

129
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,780
<i># ... dissolve itself in the</i>
<i>wind with the roses.</i>

130
00:17:53,906 --> 00:18:00,745
<i># So strong that it will not surrender.</i>

131
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,418
<i># I will watch over it,</i>
<i>I will defend it...</i>

132
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,381
<i># ...from all those poisoned</i>
<i>hidden dangers...</i>

133
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:18,304
<i># ...that would want to rip</i>
<i>from the heart. Poor love!</i>

134
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:26,938
<i># Maybe you will go,</i>
<i>to look for other women's caress.</i>

135
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,399
<i># Poor me!</i>

136
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,403
<i># And if you come back...</i>

137
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,199
<i># ... you will find every</i>
<i>beauty already faded in me.</i>

138
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:46,457
<i># But love, no, My love cannot fade away</i>
<i>like the gold in my hair.</i>

139
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:52,088
<i># Until I die it will be alive in me.</i>
<i>Only for you.</i>

140
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,799
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

141
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,093
It's that pretty, romantic one...

142
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,933
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

143
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,188
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

144
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,690
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

145
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,816
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

146
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,715
Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,

147
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:45,136
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,

148
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,014
it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.

149
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,268
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

150
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,396
I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...

151
00:21:55,522 --> 00:22:00,276
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

152
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,738
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.

153
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,783
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

154
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,698
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

155
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
So long!

156
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,538
Don't get lost!

157
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,291
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

158
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,751
Mind your own fucking business!

159
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:36,390
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

160
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:12,343
The show's over!
She's gone now!

161
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,358
I forgot the key.

162
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,544
So it's true what people say!

163
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,796
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

164
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,256
You've poisoned me with your lies.

165
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,426
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

166
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:41,056
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

167
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,268
But I've never done anything wrong.

168
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,396
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

169
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,773
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

170
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,068
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

171
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,778
Liar!

172
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,410
- Amoroso.
- Here!

173
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,578
- Cali.
- Here!

174
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,330
- Costanza.
- Here!

175
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,334
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

176
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,794
Can I put mine in her mouth?

177
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,922
Can I put mine
between her legs?

178
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,716
Okay, but one at a time!

179
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,602
Do you spit instead of oiling it?

180
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:31,232
No. I use cooking oil.

181
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,733
If you come, I will give it to you.

182
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,986
Used machine needs oil, fool.
Or grease, which is better.

183
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,864
Do you know grease?
Keep over the chain slippery!

184
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,336
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

185
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,004
I'm sure no one wanted her.

186
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,887
They say she's a seamstress.

187
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,098
But she's so vulgar.

188
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,234
My son says she looks fake.

189
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,236
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

190
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,991
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

191
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,410
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

192
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,163
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

193
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,167
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

194
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,253
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

195
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,473
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

196
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,225
Our brave and invincible Fightingmen
have delivered a powerful blow...

197
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:34,355
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

198
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,734
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

199
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,947
of our forces at the front,

200
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:49,620
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

201
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,629
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

202
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:16,039
You will go blind!

203
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,340
Malena.

204
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,676
Right rank!
Eyes front!

205
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,929
Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

206
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,349
One, two! One, two!

207
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,062
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

208
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,190
Malena is available!

209
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,472
Comrades of Castelcuto,

210
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,141
we are gathered here today...

211
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,521
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

212
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,023
which has struck our town.

213
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,610
To express our deepest condolences...

214
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,363
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

215
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:34,284
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

216
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,663
and to his bride Maddalena,

217
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:42,251
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

218
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:46,880
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

219
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,301
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

220
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,429
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

221
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,807
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fightingmen!

222
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:06,525
The martyrdom of our fellow citizen in defense
of his country was not a useless sacrifice.

223
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,403
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

224
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,824
A lucky girl will catch him!

225
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,327
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

226
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,589
For Victory!

227
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,673
Long live II Duce!

228
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,095
From now on I'll be at your side.

229
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,931
Forever. I promise.

230
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,308
Just give me time to grow up.

231
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,115
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

232
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,243
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

233
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,246
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

234
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,415
She knows her way
around the block!

235
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,251
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

236
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,420
One day he was distracted
ass he walked by...

237
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,549
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

238
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,803
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

239
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,056
Guess she's too busy!

240
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,146
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

241
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,689
with subversive tendencies.

242
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:36,067
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

243
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,572
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

244
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:45,535
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

245
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,079
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

246
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,956
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

247
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,493
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

248
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,495
They're too intimate.

249
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,706
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.

250
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,625
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

251
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:45,345
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

252
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,641
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

253
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,395
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

254
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,921
Don't you like the movie?

255
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,701
I am always at your service.

256
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,953
- Renewed condolences, Malena.
- Condolences.

257
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,590
What a piece of ass!

258
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,676
Son of a bitch!

259
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,931
You little runt!
Come back here!

260
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:34,076
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

261
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,513
I cannot live without my life.

262
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,390
I cannot die without my soul.

263
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,147
Renato, It's late.

264
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,525
Renato, get up.

265
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,368
Monster!

266
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,662
You're a fetishist,

267
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,039
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

268
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:28,044
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

269
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,132
Shame on you!

270
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,511
Shame on you!
Can I keep this?

271
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,934
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

272
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,686
Come here, you little pig!

273
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,064
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

274
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:54,571
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

275
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,282
- Answer me!
- Okay!

276
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,414
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

277
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,084
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

278
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,297
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

279
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:17,093
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

280
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,305
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

281
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,184
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

282
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,436
Still... What is this shit?

283
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,607
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

284
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,609
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

285
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,612
Everything they give us is terrible!

286
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,740
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

287
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,367
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

288
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,369
The thread isn't the problem!

289
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,706
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

290
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,626
What does that mean?

291
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,378
Do you get it now?

292
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,506
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

293
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,593
But he'll have no pockets.

294
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,221
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

295
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,600
Lights out!

296
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:11,231
...that the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor...

297
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,525
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

298
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,034
While upon women's work
you sat intent,

299
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,412
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

300
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,790
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

301
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,170
This child needs air.

302
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,381
- Air?
- Air.

303
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,911
Good morning, Professor.

304
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,093
This letter is for you.

305
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,596
It says "urgent."

306
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,944
You're dishonored. Your daughter
Malena is sleeping with the whole town.

307
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,257
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

308
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,093
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

309
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,512
So there's hope for us too!

310
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,141
Take it back!

311
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,853
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

312
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,313
Tonight was wonderful.

313
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,819
- For me too.
- I know it's been only ten months since.

314
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,781
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

315
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,201
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

316
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,953
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

317
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,592
Take care of yourself.

318
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,353
So see you tomorrow?

319
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,479
Yes.

320
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,233
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

321
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,612
What time?

322
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,492
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

323
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:55,872
How dare you
pester my fiancee!

324
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,125
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

325
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,335
You're a liar and a bastard!

326
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,881
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

327
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,134
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

328
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:14,348
- Coward, scoundrel!
- Get up.

329
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,475
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

330
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,770
I'll break you in two!

331
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,108
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

332
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:30,531
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

333
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,910
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
With a man?

334
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,288
With a traitor!

335
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,916
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

336
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,042
It's the dentist.

337
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,756
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

338
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,175
And as for you,

339
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,678
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

340
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,567
We knew she had one lover, but two?

341
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,779
But where does
the dentist fit in?

342
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,280
He fits in between her legs!

343
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:15,326
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

344
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,329
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

345
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,707
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

346
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:27,338
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

347
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,675
What's the dentist
got to do with it, poor guy?

348
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,970
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

349
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,973
That Lt. Cadei seemed
like such a gentleman.

350
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,350
How could he get mixed up in this?

351
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,853
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

352
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,189
The lieutenant was asking for it!

353
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,442
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
- Will they go to court?

354
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:54,490
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

355
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:59,078
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

356
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,623
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

357
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,750
That's insulting an officer.

358
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,128
We'll all end up in court!

359
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,256
While we were
watching her caboose,

360
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,634
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

361
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,707
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

362
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,710
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

363
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,714
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

364
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,676
Can I help you?

365
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:39,428
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

366
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,347
Please have a seat.

367
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,727
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

368
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,731
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

369
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,244
Have her come in.

370
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,371
- Go in.
- Thank you.

371
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,374
Please sit down.

372
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,251
Charmed.

373
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:19,593
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

374
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,888
the widow Scordia called Malena.

375
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,267
She could get two years in prison.

376
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,771
Everything will be fine, trust me.

377
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,029
Sit down.

378
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:51,292
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

379
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:55,171
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

380
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,506
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

381
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,551
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

382
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,678
Yes.

383
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:07,683
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

384
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,269
Absolutely not.

385
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,938
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

386
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:16,776
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

387
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,944
on his way to your house?

388
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,154
I don't know.

389
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,408
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

390
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,301
Yes, once.

391
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,934
Where?
- At my house.

392
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,819
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

393
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:05,449
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

394
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,617
What did you do?

395
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,247
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

396
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,127
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

397
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,504
I don't know.

398
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,843
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

399
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,136
He said good-bye and left.

400
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,478
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

401
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,480
who, five years ago...

402
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:40,526
had the honor of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth...

403
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,778
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

404
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:47,408
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

405
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,285
Your husband's crazy.

406
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:54,373
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

407
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:02,423
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

408
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,758
are no concern of the law.

409
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,431
All right.
Did you know that,

410
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,435
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

411
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,269
One down.

412
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:19,148
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

413
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,399
Clerk.

414
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,027
He declared to have encountered

415
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,531
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

416
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:32,036
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

417
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:36,540
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship."

418
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,545
Son of a bitch.

419
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,716
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

420
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:50,346
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

421
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,098
certain feelings.

422
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,727
But unlike the married Cusimano,

423
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,857
who was, let's face it, guilty...

424
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,735
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

425
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,738
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

426
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:13,369
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

427
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,579
Cadei is...

428
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,833
and was...

429
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,251
a bachelor... a bachelor!

430
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,462
Clever, that lawyer.

431
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,506
He's a bachelor himself.

432
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:30,844
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

433
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,264
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

434
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,017
than that of being ill-fated,

435
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,896
alone and beautiful.

436
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,148
Here is her crime: her beauty!

437
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,858
And from here, the envy,

438
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,403
the lies, the disgrace,

439
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,990
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

440
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:55,619
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

441
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,498
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

442
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:05,796
in faraway East Africa.

443
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,259
In the beating heart of our argument...

444
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:15,014
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

445
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,182
which asks just one question:

446
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,393
Can a young woman...

447
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:24,398
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

448
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:29,570
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

449
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,073
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

450
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,326
a new ending to her own love story?

451
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,163
Your Honor,

452
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,540
the citizens
of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"

453
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,220
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

454
00:57:55,430 --> 00:58:00,184
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

455
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,353
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

456
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,317
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

457
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,362
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

458
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,740
Let's get to us!

459
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,829
I know it's not much.

460
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,583
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

461
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,002
Don't you understand?

462
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,755
That's peanuts!

463
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,633
My fee is much more than that.

464
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,637
You'll never have enough money!

465
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,765
But how will I ever repay you?

466
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,768
It's very easy, my sweet.

467
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:47,147
What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

468
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,108
I'm in love with you!

469
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,490
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

470
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,868
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

471
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,790
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

472
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,569
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

473
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,195
only once and never again.

474
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,573
But you didn't keep our agreement.

475
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,450
Now we're even.

476
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,168
Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...

477
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:59,089
wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.

478
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,966
Now I understand why.

479
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,219
It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.

480
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,848
But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.

481
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:12,602
They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.

482
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,730
I know how badly
they treat you here,

483
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,317
how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...

484
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,861
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.

485
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:25,240
But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...

486
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,577
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?

487
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:33,582
They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.

488
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,835
How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against

489
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,004
the sweat of an old man...

490
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,008
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

491
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,119
Is it true you're getting married?

492
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,498
What are you writing?

493
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,626
Give me that!
Let me see!

494
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,753
Get out!

495
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,694
Stand up straight.

496
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,822
A little longer, Don Placido.

497
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,951
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

498
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,202
Will they be ready tomorrow?

499
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:56,081
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

500
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,458
...as Allied bombings continue.

501
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,466
Wait for me.

502
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,722
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

503
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,106
Moron! Idiot!

504
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,441
Idiot!

505
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,609
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

506
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,486
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

507
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,949
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

508
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,368
Never! Never!

509
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:37,622
Never!

510
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,857
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

511
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:07,402
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

512
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,906
Malena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

513
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,659
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

514
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:20,373
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

515
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,918
Yeah, his plan
is in his pants.

516
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,004
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

517
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,465
Good morning, Antonio.

518
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,385
I brought some sugar and flour.

519
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,762
- What about the bread?
- The best.

520
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,770
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

521
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,982
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

522
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,343
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

523
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,075
It's Professor Bonsignore.

524
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,328
Malena's father.

525
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,854
I'm here for you.

526
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,525
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

527
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,780
Condolences.

528
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,411
Step aside, kid.

529
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,164
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

530
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,165
Don't forget my offer.

531
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,209
Who is it?
- It's me.

532
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,961
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

533
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,797
I brought you some more food.

534
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,216
Come in.

535
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,191
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

536
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,195
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

537
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:45,753
I can come every Thursday!

538
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,588
As long as you bring the food.

539
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,293
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

540
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,296
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

541
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,008
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

542
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,885
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

543
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,055
Look who's here.

544
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,204
She's a redhead now.

545
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,082
Look how she's put together.

546
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,542
I'd like to cut off that hair.

547
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,830
How disgusting!

548
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,420
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

549
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:18,466
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

550
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,719
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

551
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,597
But with the Germans?

552
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:28,226
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

553
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,479
The two whores run
from room to room...

554
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:35,441
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

555
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,360
Holy shit!

556
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:12,019
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

557
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,397
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

558
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:24,365
Rosa!

559
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,287
Come here!

560
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,498
That's enough!

561
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,793
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

562
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,128
No.

563
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:41,048
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

564
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:44,427
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

565
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,387
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

566
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:49,056
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

567
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,559
Cast the devil into the wild.

568
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,312
Shameful!

569
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,940
Disgraceful!

570
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:03,070
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

571
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:05,948
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

572
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,201
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

573
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:19,712
Renato!

574
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:28,095
Renato, wait here for me.

575
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,439
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

576
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,983
- My father?
- He's coming.

577
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,861
Ladies!

578
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,738
Choose the one you like.

579
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:48,866
Ladies!

580
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:50,826
What do we have here?

581
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,870
Fresh young meat.

582
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,564
Lupetta, up to the room.

583
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,318
Treat him right.

584
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,954
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

585
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,956
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

586
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:23,711
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

587
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,541
Go ahead.

588
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:16,907
- Is it your first time?
- No.

589
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,660
I've imagined it many times.

590
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,746
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

591
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:54,002
Stay back.
This is between the women.

592
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,846
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

593
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,400
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

594
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,113
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

595
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:02,174
Now let's see
what men make of you!

596
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,808
The madame is served.

597
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,503
Get lost!

598
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,380
Disappear!

599
01:32:18,741 --> 01:32:21,618
- I know that face.
Who is it?

600
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,748
Nino Scordia,
Malena's husband.

601
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,127
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

602
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:40,345
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

603
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:48,395
Isn't that Malena's husband?

604
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,884
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

605
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,811
Do you know Malena Scordia?

606
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:31,771
Who's she?

607
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:34,399
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

608
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,318
We don't know anything.

609
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,154
When we came,
no one was living here.

610
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,780
No one?

611
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,924
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

612
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:02,928
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

613
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:06,681
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

614
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:10,227
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

615
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:14,731
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

616
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,442
Sir, he lost his arm...

617
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,861
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

618
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,738
Me "boy-bar." Coffee.

619
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:25,825
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

620
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:26,993
Okay, okay.

621
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,997
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

622
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:33,333
Now no one will talk to me.

623
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,876
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

624
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:38,004
No one in town knows
where she is.

625
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,967
his wife was the woman

626
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:44,719
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

627
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:47,639
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

628
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,016
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

629
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,919
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

630
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:21,881
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

631
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:26,303
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

632
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:28,263
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

633
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,682
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

634
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:36,438
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

635
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,693
You're a family of heroes!

636
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,405
You're right.

637
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:50,035
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

638
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:54,539
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

639
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:58,209
You may find your wife there!

640
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:02,732
Wait a minute. Come back!

641
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,532
Dear Signor Scordia,

642
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:14,536
forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.

643
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:19,916
These last months have
taught me much about courage,
even if I have found little myself.

644
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:23,044
I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.

645
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:27,424
Around here, they only say
bad things about her.

646
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,678
But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.

647
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:35,640
You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.

648
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:38,643
It is true,
a lot of things happened,

649
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:42,021
but back then,
you had been dead along time.

650
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:47,068
The last time I saw her, she was
on a train for Messina.

651
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:51,531
I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,

652
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,575
but my name is Renato.

653
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,818
a year later

654
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:35,742
Good morning, Judge.

655
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,245
All is well, thank God.

656
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:42,832
Eat up, my sweet pea.

657
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:59,265
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

658
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,226
Giorgio, look who's here!

659
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,707
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

660
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,333
It's nothing.

661
01:40:35,487 --> 01:40:38,364
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

662
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:40,491
Quiet. She's here!

663
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,996
It took a lot of courage to come back.

664
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,498
Look who's here.

665
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,628
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

666
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:54,631
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

667
01:40:57,635 --> 01:41:00,136
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

668
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:01,888
She's put on weight, too.

669
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,392
But she's still beautiful.

670
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:08,895
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

671
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:26,245
Good morning.

672
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:31,626
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

673
01:41:31,669 --> 01:41:34,045
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

674
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,175
Nice things here!

675
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,929
- Like it, Signora Malena?
- Yes.

676
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,431
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

677
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:47,558
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

678
01:41:48,143 --> 01:41:51,938
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

679
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,899
- Thank you.
- Good day.

680
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,461
It's okay. I'll get it.

681
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,508
Thank you.

682
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:06,888
Thank you for your help.

683
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,271
Good luck, Signora Malena.

684
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:48,930
I pedaled as fast as I could

685
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,182
as if I were escaping...

686
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:54,310
from longing,
from innocence, from her.

687
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,938
Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.

688
01:43:57,314 --> 01:44:00,191
And as they've held me close...

689
01:44:00,442 --> 01:44:04,821
and asked if I will
remember them,

690
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:10,076
I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you."

691
01:44:10,285 --> 01:44:14,163
But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...

692
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:15,389
Malena.
