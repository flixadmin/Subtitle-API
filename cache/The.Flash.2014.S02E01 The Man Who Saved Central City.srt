the less he's gonna want to do it.

Yeah, but he should go.

154

00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,272
Wow.

329
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:38,841
You deserve it. [chuckles]

330
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:42,078
I spotted you, at the rally today,

331
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,348
and I'm guessing you saw what happened.

332
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,216
Cisco, I can't come back.

333
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,852
Okay, check this out:
we found this on a victim

334
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,387
at the nuclear power plant,

335
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,656
but the badge shows
absolutely nothing at all,

336
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:55,558
which is so weird.

337
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,361
What's also weird is that at the
same time that meta-human grew,

338
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:01,330
all the x-ray machines within a
mile radius just went belly-up.

339
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:04,233
- Cisco.
- Just... if you could just...

340
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,636
See if the badge was
tampered with or something.

341
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:07,904
I mean, if it's broken, or...

342
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,239
Whatever.

343
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,341
It'll really help.

to get in touch with you for several months.

350

Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

I've just, um...

352
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,270
I've been really busy with police work.

353
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:43,606
We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs.

354
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,275
As you know, Harrison Wells
left the property to you

355
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,543
as part of his living trust.

356
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:51,347
Yeah, which I did not ask him to do,

357
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,416
but I've been keeping the place up.

358
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,118
Well, It's going to take more
than cleaning the floors

359
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,353
to retain it, I'm afraid.

360
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,255
The facility and the real
estate are scheduled to go

361
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:03,793
into receivership at the
end of this week unless...

362
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,030
you watch this.

363

What is this?

364
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,934
A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.

365
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,204
What's on it? Have you seen it?

366
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,206
No. He was very specific.

367
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,442
It was only to be watched by you.

368
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:20,877
The device will send me a notification

after you've viewed it.

370

And at that point, I'll have
everything ready to execute.

371
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,749
I'm not going to watch that.

Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen.

373

I'm only here to represent
Harrison Wells' final request.

What are you guys doing here?

- Working.
- So, Caitlin was right.

379
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,663
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

380
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,132
due to contact with cell
phones, microwaves,

381
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,366
televisions, et cetera.

382
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:19,602
Our bodies are natural conductors.

383
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,571
I think our meta's been
sucking up all the radiation

384
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,339
around him and using it to power himself.

385
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:25,274
- Which is why the x-ray
machines at the hospital

386
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,509
failed the day of the rally.

387
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:27,843
So if we want to find him,

388
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,745
we gotta look for places without radiation.

389

All right, guys, I don't want
any of you here right now.

Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

391
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,221
Barry, everyone in this
room cares about you,

392
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:40,089
but we also care about this city.

393
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,357
We all want to make a difference,

394
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,725
and that means fighting meta-humans,

395
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,760
and that means working with the Flash.

<i>Not anymore. Got him.</i>

398
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,332
There's a three block dead zone

399
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,167
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

400
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,369
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

401
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:57,240
That's where you'll find your atom smasher.

I was thinking, what if, in the morning,

675
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,297
the two of us started looking
for an apartment for both of us,

676
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,268
and Iris has actually been
doing some research on

how to get your medical license back

678
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,805
so you could start your practice up again,

or, if you wanted, come work
with us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

- Yeah, it's a party.

Come on, we can talk
about all this tomorrow.

- Talk about what?
- Barry...

Are you not planning on sticking around?

685
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,629
Okay.

686
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,931
Okay, do you think...

687
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:46,004
Can you be all that you are becoming...

Well, that's not really true, is it?

692
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,258
Don't you have another family in this room?

They need your help too, Barry.

When you need me, I will be here,
