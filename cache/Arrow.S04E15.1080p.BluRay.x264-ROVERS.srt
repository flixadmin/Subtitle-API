1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,247
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,250
He can't know that you're his father.
And nobody else can.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,081
Samantha, there is someone in my life now.
Please, don't make me keep this from her.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,761
You will if you want
a relationship with my son.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,765
I know who Oliver Queen
cares about more than anyone.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,445
Nora, honey,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,602
This is William.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,205
It's an implantable bio stimulant.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,448
This little piece of technology
is gonna help me walk again?

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,603
After it's implanted in your spine. Yes.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,287
I can do this. I can do this.
I can so totally do this.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,445
Yes, you can.
But either way, we've got you.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,290
There's no pressure here, Ms. Smoak.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,284
Curtis' implant
is the longest of long shots.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,721
I was expecting
a little more encouragement

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,649
from the husband of the genius
who invented the thing.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,882
My man works miracles with technology,

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,481
but the human body
doesn't play by the same rules.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,641
Well...

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,127
Here we go.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,322
Here we go.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,925
Here we go.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,481
Here we're going.

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,565
Okay. It's okay.
Got you. Got you. Got you.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,241
Here we go.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,082
Well, that went nowhere.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,760
<i>- Curtis ever tell you how we met?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,481
He came in with an Achilles tendinitis.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,682
He was training to qualify
for the Olympics,

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,400
- so all he cared about was results.
- Mmm.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,321
Took me weeks just to get him
focused on what really mattered.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,082
How handsome his therapist was?

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,846
Healing.

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,003
You gotta be patient with yourself.
These things take time.

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,050
Are you sure
what Conklin told you was the truth?

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,966
Conklin was dying.
He had no reason to lie.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,243
Whatever Reiter has planned,
he is gonna kill everyone here.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,771
Mr. Queen.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,010
It appears we are within
striking distance of my prize.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,768
I want you both at my side
when I claim it.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,281
I don't give a damn
about your superstitious crusade.

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,848
Nevertheless,
you'll both bear witness to its fruition.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,565
You Okay?

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,761
Me?

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,247
I knew you were gonna ask me,
so I thought I'd beat you to the punch.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,090
Are you okay?

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,760
A guy, a brilliant guy,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,925
says he can put a microchip
in my spine and I will walk again.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,246
I'm enough of a geek to know
science fiction when I see it.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,646
You're still disappointed.

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,849
- Yeah. You know. It's stupid.
- No.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,321
Talk to me.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,489
I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle
on our wedding day.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,287
Aw, you two just melt my stone-cold heart.

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,449
<i>You almost make me believe in love again.</i>

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,166
Nice to see you, Mr. Queen.
How was your Christmas?

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,407
Son of a bitch.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,483
Oh! You're so brave for a political
candidate and reformed party boy.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,682
Oh, sorry about the limo.
Love the wheelchair.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,048
Might I suggest motorized?

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,286
We have extremely powerful friends.
You do not know who you're messing with.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,201
If it makes you happy,
the "messing" ends today.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,971
I tried to bring you
into the fold, Mr. Queen.

64
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,844
I tried to kidnap
your nearest and dearest.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,168
I tried to kill you,
but none of that took.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,007
Like she said,
you don't know who you're messing with.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,123
I suspect that is true.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,726
But as they say... Well, or should,
the fourth time is the charm.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,369
Go ahead. Take a look. I'll wait.

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,487
William thinks that
I'm friends with his mother.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,886
<i>Funny.</i>

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,849
Anyhoo, 6:00 on Friday
you're going to hold a press conference

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,451
and drop out of the mayoral race.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,286
Oh, that's 6:00 p.m., by the way.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,081
I'll be at home watching you
from my brand new television.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,842
What did he show you on your phone?
Who's William?

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,403
He's my son.

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,960
Please say something.

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,362
Look, Felicity, I can explain...

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,971
Stop.

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,090
I cannot hear another lie.

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,726
You know, it's more complicated than that.

83
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,410
God, Oliver,
you are the only person on the planet

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,244
that considers the truth complicated.

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,647
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child.

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,166
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,969
What does it say about our relationship

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,931
if your first instinct
is to always hide the truth?

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,571
William's mother made a condition

90
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,082
that the only way I would be
allowed to meet my son

91
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,169
is if I agreed to keep him secret.

92
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,367
Even from you.

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,289
Who even makes that kind of ultimatum?

94
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,403
I just don't...
A mother who is trying to protect her son.

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,602
And she thought that
the best thing for him

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,490
was to keep his world separate from mine.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,929
After everything that's happened,
can you really say that she was wrong?

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,690
Well, it didn't work, did it?

99
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,250
Somehow Darhk still found out.

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,091
Hey, we got your 911.

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,362
<i>Darhk paid us a visit.
He's holding a 10-year-old boy hostage.</i>

102
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,609
Says that he'll release him
if Oliver drops out of the mayoral race.

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,926
<i>Let's get in touch with Alex.</i>

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,327
Have him schedule a press conference
for Friday at 6:00 p.m.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,330
You are not actually
going for this, are you?

106
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,602
The boy Darhk has, William...

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,926
He's my son.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,770
<i>Yeah, I just found out, too.</i>

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,163
Apparently, the only two people that knew
about William were Oliver and Darhk.

110
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,370
Actually, I found out too.

111
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,570
Um, what's our next plan?

112
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,330
William lives in Central City, right?

113
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,567
Yeah.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,962
I will call Barry.
See what the CCPD can do.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,884
Is it okay if I tell Barry
that William is your...

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,525
Barry knows too.

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,006
Let's also get in touch with Malcolm.

118
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,282
He has an ax to grind after
what happened with the League, and, um...

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,327
Malcolm knows as well.

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,208
Maybe it would be easier to list the
people who don't know about your son.

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,563
- Samantha's here.
- Who's Samantha?

122
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,204
It's William's mother.

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,487
Alex?

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,006
She said her name was Samantha Clayton.

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,725
The name struck a bell
from the million dollar check

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
you told Thea
wasn't going to be a problem.

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,930
It's not going to be a problem.

128
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,167
Okay.

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,328
Then why did I
just get a 911 text from Thea

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,766
telling me that
you're pulling out of the race?

131
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,364
Have you heard from William?
Do you know where he is?

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,562
I don't, but I'm doing everything I can.

133
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,761
I knew it.

134
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,769
I knew it the second
I realized he was gone.

135
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,646
I knew that you had to have
some sort of involvement in this.

136
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,411
My God, what was I thinking
letting you get into his life?

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,521
Two months later, and he's missing.

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,768
Samantha, I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,968
No, Oliver. You need to tell me
what the hell is going on

140
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,162
and you need to give me
my son back right now.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,001
I'm trying, but you need to tell me
what happened, please.

142
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,728
I went upstairs to get him for dinner,
and he was gone.

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,570
Gone.

144
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,651
No... No note, no sign of struggle.
Just vanished.

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,487
I called the CCPD,
and they've been looking everywhere,

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,843
but it's already been
48 hours and still nothing.

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,805
But then a crime scene technician
pulled me aside,

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,162
and said that
I needed to talk to you about this.

149
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,521
Barry Allen?

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,926
Yes, that's the one.

151
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,568
- Oliver, you promised.
- L...

152
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,366
You promised me that
you wouldn't tell anyone about my son...

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,801
Barry figured it...
That's not what's important right now.

154
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,929
What's important is
I'm going to do everything,

155
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,522
and I mean absolutely everything
in my power and we will get him back!

156
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,807
What can you do, Oliver?

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,163
What can you do that the entire
police force hasn't been able to do?

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,930
Samantha...

159
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,489
I'm the Green Arrow.

160
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,650
This doesn't make any sense.

161
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,889
Well, like I said,
I'm not the person that I used to be.

162
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,962
Samantha, these are my friends and
they are going to help us find William.

163
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,965
You probably remember...

164
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,527
Laurel Lance?

165
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,164
I'm so sorry
that you're going through this, Samantha.

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,010
We will help you get William back.

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,929
Look, Laurel... It was one time.

168
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,289
And I knew that
you and Oliver were together,

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,246
but I was young and stupid and selfish.

170
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,610
And I should have been honest with you.

171
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,167
No. Oliver should have been.

172
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,120
Come on.

173
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,644
Does CCPD have anything?

174
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,729
No. it was a clean grab.

175
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,924
Do we have any other angles we can work?
Other than Malcolm.

176
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,766
Finding William isn't the problem.
Beating Damien Darhk is.

177
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,522
Every time we've faced him
we have been beaten, thoroughly.

178
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,324
It's because
we can't go against his magic.

179
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,807
We just need to fight harder,
we need to fight smarter.

180
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,041
No, Oliver.

181
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,481
Insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again

182
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,125
and expecting a different result.

183
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,807
We need a new strategy.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,967
What about Constantine?

185
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,321
He's in hell.

186
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,681
Really? What's going on?

187
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,690
I mean, he's actually literally in hell.

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,001
Oh.

189
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,204
But I might know someone else.
Her name is Mari McCabe.

190
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,210
She possesses a totem
which is powered by magic.

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,881
She calls herself Vixen.

192
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
What the hell was that thing?

193
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,289
Cerico doesn't pay us enough to find out.

194
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,284
Come on out. Face us like a man.

195
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,010
<i>I've got</i> a <i>better idea.</i>

196
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,009
How about I kick your ass
like a woman instead?

197
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,241
What the hell?

198
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,730
- I had that under control.
- I know.

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,408
What, not enough in Star City
to keep you busy?

200
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,408
I need your help.

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,769
I have got to get me one of these.

202
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,001
- Mari.
- Laurel, hey.

203
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,362
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

204
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,400
Mari, this is John Diggle
and my sister, Thea.

205
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,647
Pleasure.

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
It's nice to meet you.

207
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,767
Sorry it's under
such horrible circumstances.

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,803
You spoke to Felicity on the phone.

209
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,280
_H€Y-_H€Y-

210
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,131
And this is Samantha. William's mother.

211
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,085
She's a friend.
A hero in Detroit they call "Vixen."

212
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,329
Mari and I had
an animated encounter last year

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,602
and we've stayed in touch ever since.

214
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,842
How are you going to help me find my son?

215
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,446
With magic.

216
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,801
- Magic?
- Yeah.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,970
It's a long story,
but the short version is that this totem

218
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,404
gives me the ability to channel
the ashe or the spirit of any animal.

219
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,930
Do you have anything
of William's with you?

220
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,169
Yes, I do. Just this. It's his favorite.

221
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,127
Don't you dare
tell Barry about this.

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,122
He's in the city. I think I can find him.

223
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,731
Okay, good. Dig and I will cover you.

224
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,129
Laurel, get in touch with your father,
we're gonna loop in the SCPD.

225
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,163
Felicity, I need you to...

226
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,404
Would it be all right
if you sat with Samantha?

227
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,682
Working up a search profile. Sure.

228
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,644
Thank you. Thea.

229
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,683
Yeah, Malcolm's coming over.
I'll go talk to him.

230
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,211
We're going to find him.
And he's going to be okay.

231
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,526
Okay.

232
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,569
Can you feel it? The energy. Primordial.

233
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,201
What is that?

234
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,887
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

235
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,202
I know you're here.

236
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,324
There's no need to lurk in the shadows
like the boogeyman.

237
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,490
You haven't seen me in a while.
And I'm not the man I used to be.

238
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,726
Yeah, I know.

239
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,331
They told me.

240
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,927
- Not pretty, is it?
- Mmm.

241
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,725
It could have been a lot worse.
Could've chopped your head off.

242
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,410
And I would've been better off for it.

243
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,250
He took the League away from me
and gave it to Nyssa al Ghul.

244
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,205
And that was more important
than saving your daughter's life?

245
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,684
Yeah, heard about
that part of the story too.

246
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,207
Refusing to bargain with Nyssa
to save me...

247
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,731
My intention was to save your life

248
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,123
and to keep my seat of power
for the betterment of the world.

249
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,210
Did you tell Darhk about Ollie's son?

250
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,845
Do you really think
I'd do something like that...

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,644
Just answer the question.

252
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,086
No.

253
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,444
No, I won't.

254
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,528
Because you should know me better
than to ask me the question.

255
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,563
I know you all too well.

256
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,761
You should know one thing, Thea,

257
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,244
no matter what happens,
I will always love you.

258
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,687
It's what fathers do.

259
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,926
Crazy world we live in, huh?
Metahumans. Magic.

260
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,845
Oliver Queen, father.

261
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,526
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- No, man, I totally get it.

262
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,285
Samantha put you in a tough spot.

263
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,208
Couldn't have been
an easy decision for you,

264
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,925
and I totally get why you made it.

265
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,127
She was right.

266
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
William was safer
when I didn't know about him.

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,650
So maybe if I never found out I...

268
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,808
Can't even go there, man.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,244
You'll eat yourself up inside with the
"What if this" or the "Maybe that."

270
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,565
Part of being a parent.

271
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,681
Most important thing now is focusing
on getting your boy back home safe.

272
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,006
John“.

273
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,083
How do you do it?

274
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,362
I know where Sarah is every night, Oliver.

275
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,402
I know what she's doing. Who she's with.

276
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,282
She sees my face every single day

277
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,285
I'm there for her.

278
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,161
And she knows, and I know

279
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,246
that I would never
let anything bad happen to her.

280
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,371
I keep her close, man, and that's how you
keep your children safe.

281
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,687
He was wearing a blue hoodie,
plaid shirt, gray corduroys,

282
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,010
and, um, a Diamonds baseball cap.
He's a big fan.

283
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,201
Oliver likes baseball too.

284
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,449
Here's hoping that the innate
fatherly influence stops there.

285
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,281
Um, does he have any
distinguishing features?

286
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,802
Freckles, birthmarks, anything like that?

287
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,523
Oliver told me that
there was someone in his life.

288
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,886
Someone special.

289
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,723
And her name was Felicity.

290
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,288
He wanted to tell you
and I wouldn't let him.

291
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,451
I didn't know who he was now.
I didn't know what kind of person he was.

292
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,371
That's going around.

293
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,442
Just try and remember
that I was the one that made him choose

294
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,483
between you and knowing his son.

295
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,211
All right, I've got the whole force,
what's left of them anyway,

296
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,561
canvassing for William.

297
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,125
Thank you.

298
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,244
You don't seem as surprised as I expected.

299
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,647
What, that party boy Oliver Queen
knocked up some girl?

300
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,451
I'm amazed there isn't an army of
little Olivers running around out there.

301
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,121
Well, there may be.
He certainly got around back then.

302
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,601
Yeah.

303
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,446
You okay?

304
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,041
I don't know.

305
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,929
It's the mother, Samantha.

306
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,482
She was with him when I was with him.

307
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Baby...

308
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,767
I don't know why it still stings.

309
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,881
It was a million years ago

310
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,566
and it's not like I didn't know
that Oliver cheated on me.

311
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,728
Yeah, but that's one thing.

312
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,763
Knowing he had a kid...

313
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,481
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

314
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,207
- Come here.
- Thank you.

315
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,440
It's Oliver.

316
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,648
He knows where William's being held.

317
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,489
I count four guards patrolling the roof.

318
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,841
Mari's in position.

319
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,962
I wondered how long it would take for
your buddy Oliver to drag you into this.

320
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,202
- Where is the boy?
- Oh, he's fine.

321
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,481
I had him moved about two minutes

322
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,808
before you and your posse
disturbed my evening in.

323
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,081
You know what?

324
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,243
You might wanna learn
to be a little bit more discreet.

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,843
Have you considered black
instead of green?

326
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,651
- You tell me where you've taken him.
- Or what?

327
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,089
You'll fire an arrow at me?
I think we've seen that movie before.

328
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,045
Iwin. You lose. Rinse, repeat.

329
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,241
This time's different.

330
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,846
Oh, really?

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,481
Where's the boy?

332
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,560
You have some
very interesting friends.

333
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,807
Atta boy.

334
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,601
My, mY-

335
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,282
I haven't seen that trinket
in a dog's age.

336
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,926
M'Changa province, am I right?

337
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,681
(Sta)'-

338
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,081
Oh, I like you.
And I don't like many people.

339
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,966
<i>I</i> QOt you.

340
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
What happened? Where did he go?

341
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,768
- I can't track him.
- Darhk's protected by magic.

342
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,764
<i>No, not just Darhk.</i>

343
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,485
I lost William.

344
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,362
Where's William? What happened?

345
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,523
We had a small setback,
but we're not giving up.

346
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,767
"Setback"? What do you mean?

347
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,008
Hey, blocked ID.

348
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,001
Hello.

349
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,003
<i>Oh, hi, Oliver.
How's your evening going?</i>

350
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,010
Mine, somewhat eventful.

351
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,090
Some of your friends stopped by
my place earlier, completely unannounced.

352
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,441
Very rude.

353
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,365
I wanna talk to my son, Darhk.
I wanna know that he's safe.

354
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,522
Oh, this must be the first time
your son's been kidnapped

355
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,961
'cause clearly you don't understand
how these things work.

356
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,361
I make the demands.

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,206
Well, you've made them and I've agreed.
Friday night I'm dropping out of the race.

358
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,401
<i>Why wait?</i>

359
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,648
Give your green friend
less time to botch things up.

360
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,201
So, go find yourself a television camera.

361
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,089
I wanna know that my son is safe!

362
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,727
Oh, and by the way, you're going to
completely endorse Ruvé Adams.

363
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,885
Save us all the trouble of those
pesky little write-in ballots.

364
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,930
He moved up the timetable.

365
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,406
He wants me to drop
out of the race tonight.

366
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,886
Thea, let Alex know.

367
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,561
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

368
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,083
I know you brought me here
to fight magic with magic, but I...

369
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,401
Mari, this isn't on you.

370
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,404
There's still so much
that we don't know about Darhk's power.

371
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,841
We don't... We don't even know
what the source of it is.

372
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,081
Wait.

373
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,925
I get my powers from this necklace.

374
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,923
Without it,
I'm just a wannabe fashion designer

375
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,770
who lives at home with her foster dad.

376
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,685
So up to now, everyone I've gone up
against with mystical powers

377
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,331
has had some sort of a totem like mine.

378
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,251
What if Darhk has an object
that helps him with his magic?

379
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,765
I think he does.

380
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,129
I walked in on him once or twice
in front of this cabinet thing.

381
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,924
And inside there is some kind of,
I don't know, idol.

382
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,081
Can you draw it for me?

383
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,446
Well, yeah, I'll give it a whirl.

384
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,762
Okay, Oliver, what if this little
art project doesn't yield any results?

385
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,803
- Well...
- And what if it takes too long?

386
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,807
Mari and Captain Lance are working
on a way to eventually stop Darhk.

387
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,762
Right now, I have to save William.

388
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,441
What's he saying?

389
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,967
Whatever it is, it's not good.

390
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,491
We have to get out of here now.

391
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,121
Reiter, what are you doing?

392
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,651
Proving what I know about you is true.

393
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,205
You can't leave us in here with it!

394
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,561
Reiter!

395
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,564
You...

396
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,290
You are worthy to pass.

397
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,126
Good evening.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

398
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,006
When I entered this race,

399
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,801
it was because no one else
was willing to step into the spotlight.

400
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,325
It has always been my hope
that my actions would inspire others.

401
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,525
Four months later and they have.

402
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,089
Knowing that, effective immediately,
I will be suspending my campaign

403
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,886
and throwing my full support
behind Ruvé Adams.

404
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,241
Now, I'd like to take a moment

405
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,411
to thank all my supporters
for all of your hard work.

406
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,848
What you've done will not be forgotten.

407
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,211
Thank you.

408
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,201
New numbers are out.
You were leading by 16 points.

409
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,767
Alex, I'm sorry.

410
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,163
I know that you put your heart and soul
into this campaign and...

411
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,524
And your days of speech-making
are now behind you.

412
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,930
Look, man. I don't want "sorry."
I just want an explanation.

413
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,243
That's why I'm sorry.

414
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,610
Sucks when you can't tell the truth.

415
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,961
Samantha told me about her ultimatum.

416
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,327
I just figured
that eventually she'd trust me.

417
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,966
Yeah, you'd work your Oliver Queen charm.

418
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,283
I didn't wanna be a part of William's life

419
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,926
without the opportunity for you
to be a part of his life.

420
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,003
John's made it pretty clear

421
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,931
that, uh, I should've made more of an
effort to be a part of William's life.

422
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,691
And that the best way to keep him safe
would've been to keep him close.

423
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,282
Even with all of this.

424
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,568
Your resignation's all over the news.
Have you heard from Darhk?

425
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,047
Not yet.

426
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,727
Speak of the devil. Literally.

427
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,486
It's not Darhk. It's Mari.
She has something.

428
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,448
I emailed Captain Lance's
drawing of Darhk's idol

429
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,051
to a friend of mine at Detroit University.

430
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,241
And did he recognize it?

431
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,489
It's a Khushu idol.
Very rare. Very powerful.

432
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,364
But its power
requires a constant connection

433
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,050
to one of the Earth's ley lines.

434
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,764
- I never thought I'd say this, but huh?
- Okay.

435
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,847
Think Wi-Fi for magic.
And the idol is his Internet connection.

436
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,169
If Professor Macalester's theory
is correct, and this map is accurate...

437
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,529
Then Darhk must be holed up
near one of these ley lines

438
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,767
in order for him to get
the strongest signal.

439
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,611
I'll start cross-referencing all the
locations that we've encountered Darhk.

440
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,690
You pulled out of the race.
Why isn't this man giving me my son back?

441
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,405
He will and everything will be fine.

442
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,887
You keep saying that,
but it hasn't been yet.

443
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,281
You're doing everything you possibly can.

444
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,891
You can't beat yourself up about it.

445
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,048
Well, you don't know me very well, do you?

446
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,047
Just before Christmas, Darhk took
Thea, Felicity, John, held them captive.

447
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,889
We agreed that
I would trade myself for them,

448
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,081
I did,

449
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,411
and Darhk did not live up
to his end of the bargain.

450
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,762
So you're worried
that's playing itself out again now?

451
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,922
We're going to get William back, Oliver.

452
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,844
But when we do,

453
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,401
I think you should consider that...

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,287
Maybe letting him go
isn't such a bad thing.

455
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,161
What do you mean?

456
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,247
Well, I heard what you told Felicity
about keeping him close.

457
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,691
Owl ears.

458
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,122
Uh, I never knew my real parents.

459
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,688
I grew up in a foster home
and my whole life I wondered, "Who am I?"

460
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,086
"Where did I come from?
Why didn't my real parents want me?"

461
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,369
A boy should know who his father is.

462
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,847
He should. And he will.

463
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,130
But knowing what William
is going through right now

464
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,766
I realize that
I wasn't ready for the answers.

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,322
Learning about my heritage, my powers,

466
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,922
the evil my mother fled our homeland
to protect me from,

467
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,122
no child should have to carry that burden.

468
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,726
I mean, look around you, Oliver.

469
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,321
The best gift
you can give him is his childhood.

470
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,770
Keep him as far away from your world
for as long as possible.

471
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,160
I can't imagine a greater sacrifice.

472
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,481
Isn't that what parenthood is?

473
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,523
Hey, guys. I think we found something.

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,806
Darhk moves his idol around,
which makes sense but...

475
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,201
It makes him a whole lot harder to track.

476
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,323
Right, but after referencing
a buttload of satellite feed,

477
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,045
thermal imaging data in the ley line map,

478
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,447
I think Darhk's located out
in a compound in Sky Woods.

479
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,127
Hello?

480
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,926
Very good speech.
You look great on television.

481
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,690
<i>Nelson Plaza. Three hours.</i>

482
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,041
William will be there.

483
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,165
Darhk says he's going to release William
three hours from now at Nelson Plaza.

484
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,681
There is no guarantee with Darhk.
This could be a trap.

485
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,042
And now we have a chance
to take out his power idol thingy.

486
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,042
Ollie, without his magic, he won't be able
to do this to anybody ever again.

487
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,009
It will be game over.

488
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,522
Samantha, he's your son. it is your call.

489
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,891
He's your son too, Oliver.

490
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,244
Get him back.
And take this son of a bitch Darhk out.

491
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,764
I count 17 Ghosts.

492
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,689
Copy. Black Canary?

493
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,961
Ready.

494
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,286
- Spartan?
- I'm set.

495
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,567
<i>Let's do this.</i>

496
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
Vixen, you're up.

497
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,168
I'm guessing
your insurance won't pay for that.

498
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,169
Cute. Buh-bye.

499
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,161
When you're dead, I'll make sure
that totem gets put to better use.

500
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,643
Took the words right out of my mouth.

501
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,128
Well, that happened.

502
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,170
Speedy, Canary, I can't get a clear shot.
Where are you?

503
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,407
<i>On our way.</i>

504
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,883
Find William. I'll take care of Darhk.

505
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,042
I'm sorry. I can't hear you
with your throats closing up like that.

506
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,561
Steady.

507
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,847
I've got the totem.
Has it had any effect?

508
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,007
Separating it from Darhk
didn't do anything.

509
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,287
Go to plan B.

510
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,164
What's plan B?

511
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,841
Please don't hurt them.

512
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,451
William.

513
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,326
<i>Get</i> out of here.

514
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,083
- Mom.
- William.

515
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,401
Hi.

516
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,003
Medics checked him out.
He's in perfect health.

517
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,004
Oh, thank goodness.

518
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,771
There's someone here
that you must have missed.

519
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,521
What's wrong?

520
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,846
I'm kind of over The Flash.

521
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,162
I want a Green Arrow action figure.

522
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,602
Well, the Green Arrow is pretty amazing.

523
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,688
I will let you guys get reacquainted.

524
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,361
Hey-

525
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,687
ls everything okay?

526
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,009
Detectives questioned William
while the docs were checking him out.

527
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,204
Darhk didn't take him.
It was a guy with a missing hand.

528
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,847
You son of a bitch.

529
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,041
I assure you, Mr. Queen,

530
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,925
I had all the faith in the world
that you would survive.

531
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,849
Yeah? But what about everybody else?

532
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,008
You are my only concern.

533
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,523
We've gotten this far because of you.

534
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,481
Let's finish it.

535
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,405
<i>You too, Ms. Venediktov.</i>

536
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,251
Mr. Queen seems to behave at his best
when you are around.

537
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,567
- Is William gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

538
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,091
He's a tough one.

539
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,002
Just like his dad.

540
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,328
Could not have done this without you.

541
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,845
Thank you.

542
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,371
Anytime.

543
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,166
Have you thought any more
about what I said?

544
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,488
You know, I just got him back.

545
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,806
Let me just say,

546
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,601
for all the frustrations I have
about my real parents giving me up,

547
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,683
I am so grateful
I was raised in a situation

548
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,002
where that was my biggest issue in life.

549
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,565
The best thing my parents
ever gave me was that freedom.

550
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,323
Well, that, and this totem
that makes me a total badass.

551
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,291
You don't need a totem for that.

552
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,286
Damn right, I don't.

553
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,607
Take care of yourself, Oliver.
I'm just a phone call away.

554
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,483
Me too, Mari. Me too.

555
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,763
I heard you found the boy.
You can't believe how relieved I...

556
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,684
- Cut the crap.
- Excuse me?

557
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,891
I know it was you.
You took him. Out of spite.

558
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,161
For us.

559
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,328
You have to believe me. I did it for us.

560
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,364
You purposely...
You put him in danger. How...

561
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,607
You know what?

562
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,928
I'm not doing this anymore.

563
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,600
This song and dance
where you come over to my apartment

564
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,723
and you whisper your lies...

565
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,251
It is over.

566
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,001
- Thea, I did it to protect us.
- Shut up.

567
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,720
How could you possibly think
that there was an "us" to protect?

568
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,288
<i>You know, sometimes I lay awake at night</i>

569
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,525
and I wonder what Robert
would think about our relationship.

570
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,042
He raised me. He loved me.

571
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,801
And I threw that all away
the moment I became your daughter.

572
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,520
Yes. Yes, you did. And it was your choice.

573
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,728
And lwish I never did.

574
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,002
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

575
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,001
You would be dead 10 times over
if not for me.

576
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,403
I taught you how to fight.
How to be strong.

577
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,968
I turned you from
a delicate, spoiled brat into a warrior.

578
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,571
And all I've ever gotten from you
in return is your venomous spite.

579
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,603
For a very good reason.

580
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,087
You have no idea what you are up against.

581
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,760
You are incapable
of seeing the bigger picture,

582
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,331
butlcan.

583
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,280
And I would rather
you hate me and be alive,

584
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,687
than love me and be dead.

585
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,485
Hi, William.

586
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,400
I hope you're well.

587
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,450
And I hope you're safe.

588
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,046
There is something that I wanna tell you.

589
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,046
I wanted to tell you before, but...

590
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,484
But this is better.

591
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,290
I'm your father. Biologically, that is.

592
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,284
As far as really being your father goes,

593
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,244
I haven't earned that yet.

594
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,250
<i>A father should be there for his child,
every day, no matter what.</i>

595
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,971
<i>To make sure that they feel loved,
that they feel safe.</i>

596
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,164
<i>And a child should be able
to rely on their father</i>

597
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,161
<i>and go to him for
guidance and reassurance.</i>

598
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,081
I have failed to do that for you.

599
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,567
And now, I'm gonna tell you why.

600
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,524
I'm the Green Arrow.
And my life is very dangerous.

601
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,324
Which is why

602
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,208
we decided to keep you out of it
for all of these years.

603
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,641
What happened to you in Star City,
that was my fault.

604
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,721
And I can't allow anything like that
to happen ever again.

605
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,605
<i>That's why I have asked your mother
to move you far away,</i>

606
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,643
and to not tell anyone
where she's taking you.

607
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,410
Including me.

608
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,563
That's also why I asked her to wait
to show you this message

609
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,883
until after your 18th birthday.

610
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,449
I wanted to give you a real childhood.

611
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,243
I wanted to give you that gift.

612
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,764
Goodbye, son.

613
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,044
I sure hope it's not forever.

614
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,088
How much of that did you hear?

615
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,601
Enough.

616
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,801
Oliver, we need to talk.

617
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,726
About a number of things, I suspect.

618
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,124
Let's start with...

619
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,769
I can't do this.

620
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,600
<i>When your son was in danger,</i>

621
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,441
I had to table
what I was feeling about everything.

622
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,930
But now that I've had some space,

623
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,089
I realize I need space.

624
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,407
Felicity.

625
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,881
I know the position Samantha put you in.

626
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,248
I know it was an impossible decision.

627
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,161
But you were right,
you should have told me.

628
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,288
Marriage is about inclusion.

629
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,086
It's about

630
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,967
leaning on your partner
when things get complicated.

631
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,803
I don't think that
you know how to do that.

632
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,321
I'm trying.

633
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,248
And now you're sending William away
and I understand why.

634
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,327
<i>You know that I do,</i>

635
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,966
but once again,
you have left me out of the decision.

636
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,800
Felicity?

637
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,167
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

638
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,841
