1
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,025
<i>Jules Verne once wrote,</i>

2
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,526
<i>"Put two ships in the open sea"</i>

3
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:14,865
<i>"without wind or tide,</i>
<i>they will come together."</i>

4
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:41,625
<i>That's how my parents met.</i>
<i>Like two ships destined for each other.</i>

5
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:48,230
<i>We are something else.</i>
<i>Try Arthur Treacher...</i>

6
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,704
It's okay.

7
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,749
Easy. You weren't breathing.

8
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,698
<i>They were from different worlds.</i>

9
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,169
<i>But life, like the sea,</i>

10
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,640
<i>has a way of bringing people together.</i>

11
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:14,984
Uh...

12
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,020
I was gonna
make you some eggs.

13
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,789
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

14
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:26,727
It's okay.

15
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,265
I made tea.

16
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:34,735
Go on, try it.

17
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:36,005
It'll make you better.

18
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:59,061
So, uh, who are you?

19
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,834
Atlanna.

20
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:08,337
Queen of Atlantis.

21
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:11,972
Wow.

22
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:16,945
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

23
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:50,143
<i>She had fled an arranged marriage.</i>

24
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:52,178
<i>Left her whole world behind.</i>

25
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,380
<i>But in my father's lighthouse,</i>

26
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,851
<i>she found something unexpected.</i>

27
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:03,459
<i>And my father found the love of his life.</i>

28
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,663
<i>Category 4 Hurricane Arthur</i>

29
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,566
<i>is due to make landfall</i>
<i>sometime after 2:00 p.m.</i>

30
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:14,903
How about Arthur?

31
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:16,971
After the hurricane?

32
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:21,675
After a legend.
He's a king, isn't he?

33
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:24,478
He's more than that.

34
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,148
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

35
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,019
He could unite
our worlds one day.

36
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,196
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

37
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:48,535
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

38
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:52,740
It made him so powerful that
the ocean itself became jealous

39
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:57,210
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

40
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:59,612
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

41
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:04,217
But, legend has it that one
day a new king will come

42
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,552
who will use
the power of the trident

43
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:09,788
to put Atlantis back together again.

44
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,865
Take him!

45
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,517
<i>Queen Atlanna,</i>

46
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,652
<i>by the authority of King Orvax,</i>

47
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:42,755
<i>you are ordered to return to Atlantis.</i>

48
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:44,024
Atlanna!

49
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,096
<i>But Atlantis' memory is long...</i>

50
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,733
<i>And its king refused to let her go.</i>

51
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,581
Atlanna!
Tom!

52
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,485
My weapon!
Here!

53
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,878
<i>Their two worlds</i>
<i>were never meant to meet,</i>

54
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,281
<i>and I was a product of a love</i>
<i>that never should've been.</i>

55
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:45,250
You don't have to do this,
Atlanna. Please.

56
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:49,389
No. They will always find me.

57
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:51,158
Next time,
they'll send an army.

58
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:57,665
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

59
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,670
Save you.

60
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,276
Where I come from...

61
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,914
The sea carries
our tears away.

62
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,451
Not here.

63
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,454
Here you feel them.

64
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:32,666
I will return to you.
When it's safe.

65
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:34,666
One day.

66
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,604
Right here, at sunrise.

67
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,108
We'll be together again.

68
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:46,845
You stay strong,
my little prince.

69
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,048
I'll always be with you.

70
00:08:57,323 --> 00:09:00,527
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

71
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:27,953
All life came from the sea,

72
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:30,222
so if we want
to understand ourselves,

73
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:32,190
we must journey
to where we began.

74
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:37,061
Now, today, we have better maps of
Mars than we do of our own sea floor.

75
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:39,197
Come on, closer.
Come on, fishy.

76
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,666
Come on. Come over here.
Boys!

77
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,935
Stop that. Come on.

78
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:46,103
Come along.

79
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:50,040
Bye, fishy. Bye.

80
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:53,177
My name's Arthur.
What's yours?

81
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,380
You guys hungry? Me, too.
Check it out.

82
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:58,917
Arthur is talking to the fish.

83
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,619
Such a freak, Arthur.

84
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,254
Stop!
What are you gonna do about it, freak?

85
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,422
Stop it! Don't!

86
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:06,627
Let me go!

87
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:05,408
Who are you?

88
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,111
Come on, let's go.
Move it.

89
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:09,280
Come on. Hurry up.

90
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,090
Sir, we've secured
the captain.

91
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,959
Distress signal's disabled.

92
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,593
We're running dark again.

93
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,996
But they heard it.
You can count on it.

94
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:30,633
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

95
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,837
And you don't tell me
how to pirate.

96
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,581
Where's the rest of the crew?

97
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,417
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

98
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,519
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

99
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,220
Our reputation precedes us.

100
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,889
Your reputation.

101
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:54,325
This is your win.

102
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,533
Here.

103
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,300
Can't take that piece of junk.

104
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:05,738
It's the love of your life.

105
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,575
I never told you
the story behind it.

106
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:13,010
This was your grandfather's.

107
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:16,780
He was one of the Navy's first
frogmen during World War II.

108
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:22,518
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

109
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,288
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

110
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,862
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

111
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,428
And this knife.

112
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,467
He gave it to me
when I was your age.

113
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:39,971
And now it's yours, son.

114
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,735
Did we just hit something?

115
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:15,403
No. Something hit us.

116
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,906
Sir, there's something
out there.

117
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,107
Another submarine?

118
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,742
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

119
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,694
That's not a man.

120
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:17,767
<i>Alpha, to the right.</i>
<i>Bravo team, sweep the passageway.</i>

121
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,724
Permission to come aboard?

122
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:12,516
Aquaman!

123
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,981
I've waited a long time for this.

124
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,229
Am I supposed to know
who you are?

125
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,631
I scavenge the high seas.

126
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,865
You're the Aquaman.

127
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:07,134
We were bound
to meet at some point.

128
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,575
Let's not make it a habit.

129
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,176
Up.

130
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,665
Ow.

131
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:24,313
Dad!

132
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,148
Dad? Ow.

133
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,821
That's your kid?

134
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,258
Shame on you.

135
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,929
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

136
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,197
Get yourselves out of it.

137
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,200
Bastard!

138
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,010
Dad!

139
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,386
Dad!

140
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,788
Wait!

141
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,623
Help me! He's trapped!

142
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,394
You can't leave him like this!

143
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:15,628
Please!

144
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,701
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

145
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,615
Get outta here! I got this!

146
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,282
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

147
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:40,253
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

148
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,858
Now, go!
No!

149
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,428
Go!
Shut up!

150
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,268
No!

151
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:54,935
No!

152
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,390
Damn you!

153
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:15,957
Go.

154
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,969
I always know
where to find you.

155
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,171
Old habits.

156
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:49,848
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
All right!

157
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:56,156
You want me to have them put
that in a sippy cup for you?

158
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:00,993
How is it that I can
breathe underwater,

159
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:03,396
but you can still drink me
under the table?

160
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,232
That's my superpower.

161
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,832
<i>A Russian submarine</i>

162

00:23:17,578 --> 00:23:20,912
<i>And a further development,</i>
<i>we now have unconfirmed reports</i>

167
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:24,650
<i>that the met a human dubbed by</i>
<i>social media as "The Aquaman"</i>

168
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:26,521
<i>was responsible for this daring rescue.</i>

169
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:28,953
That's not me.

170
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:33,124
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?

171
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:35,393
What Vulko trained you to do.

172
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:39,632
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

173
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,734
Your mother
always knew you were special.

174
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:43,301
Don't even start.

175
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:46,371
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

176
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:47,541
Just stop.

177
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:54,713
Whatever Atlantis' problems
are, you're bigger than them.

178
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:56,748
Atlantis murdered my mother.

179
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,249
You don't know that for sure.

180
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,617
Yes, I do.

181
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:03,423
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

182
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,625
And you know it.

183
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:13,864
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

184
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:21,308
Hey, buddy.

185
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:25,144
You that fish boy from the TV?

186
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,514
Oh, great.

187
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:37,187
It's "fish man."
What do you want?

188
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:39,191
I'll tell you what I want.

189
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:44,561
Could we get
a picture with you?

190
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,498
You're like
our local hero, man.

191
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,137
It would mean a lot.
Just a quick...

192
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,040
Whatever.

193
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,642
All right. Let's do this.
Don't touch me.

194
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:00,945
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

195
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:03,548
There we go. Everybody smile.

196
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:59,938
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

197
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,906
He'll hear you out.

198
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,260
King Orm.
King Nereus.

199
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:26,697
You picked a meeting place too
close to the surface for my liking.

200
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,533
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

201
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,936
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

202
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,639
our ancestors gathered here.

203
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:38,343
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

204
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:42,044
Xebel, as always, by his side.

205
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:43,914
Brine. Fishermen.

206
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,148
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

207
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,251
The Lost Nation
had not yet vanished.

208
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:52,221
Together, they were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

209
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,223
But now,
I sit on Atlan's throne,

210
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:56,927
shackled by archaic laws
and politics.

211
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,095
While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

212
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:01,400
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

213
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,634
They will destroy themselves.

214
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,470
Not before
destroying us first.

215
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:09,740
We have been hiding
long enough.

216
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:13,544
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

217
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,714
We honor you,
King Nereus,

218
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:20,517
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

219
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,819
to join King Orm's alliance.

220
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,655
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

221
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,823
By law, you need
four of the Seven Kingdoms

222
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,492
to ascend and attack.

223
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:30,694
The Lost Nation and the
Deserters have long perished.

224
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:32,763
The Trench are nothing
but animals.

225
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:35,399
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

226
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:40,537
Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn.

227
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,906
But I know
what you really want.

228
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:45,776
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

229
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,445
you will be ordained.

230
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:49,848
Ocean Master.

231
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,316
That is merely a title.

232
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,318
I'm no fool, King Orm.

233
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,787
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

234
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:59,589
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

235
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,593
I am the natural choice
to lead it.

236
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:05,829
Are you?

237
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,464
What about the rumors
that there's another?

238
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:12,069
An Atlantean,
living among the surface.

239
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:14,537
One of royal blood.

240
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,441
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

241
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,576
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

242
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:23,913
My mother's bastard has
never even been to Atlantis.

243
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:25,147
His loyalty is to the surface.

244
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:38,363
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

245
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,416
Your king is injured!

246
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:02,245
I'm not trying to start a war.

247
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,713
The war has already begun.

248
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:08,318
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

249
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:14,023
I'm good.
Stop.

250
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,824
Here're the keys.
Thank you.

251
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,226
Let's go home
and work on your <i>ta moko.</i> Huh?

252
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:19,728
If your grand pops
was still alive,

253
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,798
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

254
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:26,568
Yes, he would, but there is
plenty of time for that.

255
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,272
We gotta get you to bed.

256
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:32,774
Got it?

257
00:30:39,483 --> 00:30:41,049
I've been looking for you.

258
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,383
Oh, no, no, no...

259
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:43,752
I need you to come with me
to Atlantis.

260
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,587
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

261
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,589
that I told that
rusty starfish Vulko.

262
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,624
Except nicer,
because you're a lady.

263
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:51,626
No, thank you.
I'm not interested.

264
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,796
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

265
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,965
That had nothing to do
with Atlantis.

266
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:00,301
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

267
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:02,238
Billions will die.

268
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,674
Your people and mine.

269
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:06,376
We must stop him.

270
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:12,815
And how do you propose
we do that?

271
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:16,284
You are the firstborn son
of Queen Atlanna.

272
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,586
The throne is yours
by birthright.

273
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:24,093
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

274
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:27,662
is for you to take
your rightful place as king.

275
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,501
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

276
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:37,071
I'm the bastard son of the
queen your people executed.

277
00:31:37,073 --> 00:31:39,707
Trust me. I am no king.

278
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,575
I agree.

279
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:42,977
That's awesome. Cool.

280
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:45,947
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason,

281
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:47,582
and that's why I'm here.

282
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:50,485
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

283
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,554
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

284
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,088
It's not a myth.

285
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,191
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

286
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:59,493
You can then claim your
birthright and dethrone Orm.

287
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:03,363
My birthright?
It died with my mother.

288
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,767
But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

289
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,939
I will treat him exactly the
same way your people treated her.

290
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:11,707
With no mercy.

291
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:13,768
<i>That submarine was barely operational,</i>
<i>but it served its purpose.</i>

292
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,537
One of your kind intervened.

293
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,606
<i>He is not one of us.</i>

294
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:22,511
He killed my father.

295
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,748
<i>Our transaction has ended.</i>

296
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:32,855
Keep the money.
I want Aquaman.

297
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:45,026
Dad!

298
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,499
Dad!

299
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:19,962
Dad!

300
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:25,767
Pops!

301
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:28,768
Pops!

302
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,841
Come on, Pops.

303
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,377
Come on! He's not breathing.

304
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:38,679
Move! Let me help.

305
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:47,588
Come on, Pops.

306
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,134
Come on.

307
00:36:14,614 --> 00:36:16,916
I don't even know your name.

308
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:19,686
It's Princess Y'Mera
Xebella Challa.

309
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,689
You may call me Mera.

310
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,993
Thank you, Mera.

311
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,615
Dear God.

312
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:50,951
This was Orm's doing.

313
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,654
The worst is yet to come.

314
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,096
<i>There's a</i>
<i>flash flood warning here</i>

315
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,799
<i>that was just extended</i>
<i>for a couple hours.</i>

316
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:09,401
<i>Unprecedented sights</i>
<i>from all over the world today.</i>

317
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:13,072
<i>We are seeing warships and trash</i>
<i>washed up by massive waves.</i>

318
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:16,408
<i>These extraordinary scenes</i>
<i>of coastlines deluged with waste</i>

319
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,911
<i>and garbage are taking place</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

320
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:22,181
<i>Decades of pollution</i>
<i>has been thrown back onto land.</i>

321
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:24,016
<i>Many are asking the question,</i>

322
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:25,384
<i>"Was this a natural disaster</i>
<i>or something else?"</i>

323
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,987
<i>No. This was no natural disaster.</i>

324
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:30,322
<i>They threw out our garbage</i>
<i>and our warships.</i>

325
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,724
<i>This was our first contact</i>
<i>with the people of Atlantis.</i>

326
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:36,028
<i>There you go again with your</i>
<i>insane Atlantean theory.</i>

327
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,929
<i>You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.</i>

328
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,365
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

329
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:40,932
<i>We already have</i>
<i>an Atlantean living among us,</i>

330
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,669
<i>and his name is Aquaman.</i>

331
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:51,976
What is it?

332
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:56,181
This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson.

333
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:59,518
You have to forget all
the teaching of the surface world

334
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,289
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

335
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,559
But I already know
how to swim.

336
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:08,295
Not even close.

337
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:13,798
Just so we're clear,

338
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,835
I'll help you stop this war.

339
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,071
But then, I'm done.

340
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:20,874
Maybe that's for the best.

341
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,494
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

342
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:44,895
It is who we are.

343
00:38:44,897 --> 00:38:46,997
Wait, you can talk underwater?

344
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:50,501
I can talk underwater, too!

345
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:52,769
This is awesome!

346
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,741
Oh, we can do more
than just talk.

347
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:06,884
Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.

348
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:11,889
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,

349
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,427
and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark.

350
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:39,783
This is awesome!

351
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:10,983
So, Vulko,
when can I meet my mother?

352
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:15,452
Soon, my young prince.

353
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:19,858
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

354
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,004
I hid my ship in here.

355
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,505
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

356
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,441
Well, to get where we're
going, you're gonna have to.

357
00:40:37,443 --> 00:40:39,609
Your fish ship has been
marinating in chum butter.

358
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,611
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

359
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,349
That'd be an improvement.

360
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,922
Yup. Okay.

361
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,784
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

362
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:56,186
The Gateway Bridge
is a remnant of the Old World.

363
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:58,188
It's also the only way
in or out of the Capital.

364
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,723
Why can't they just
go over the walls?

365
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,358
Security is impenetrable.

366
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,092
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

367
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:05,029
they'd never get past
the hydro-cannons.

368
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,066
People try to sneak in
all the time.

369
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:12,003
Yeah, right.

370
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,255
What is this?

371
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,691
Customs and border control.

372
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:38,696
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

373
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:47,572
Welcome home.

374
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,487
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

375
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:41,757
The Highborns never venture
to the sea floor.

376
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:42,760
We're here.

377
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:13,689
What is this?

378
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:16,025
We use this air pocket as an
extra layer of precaution.

379
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:18,594
Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air.

380
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:20,431
Plus,
it keeps the animals out.

381
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,300
They get kind of messy.

382
00:44:25,903 --> 00:44:27,803
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

383
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:30,841
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

384
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:37,312
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

385
00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:39,647
I can't believe Orm attacked.

386
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:40,582
It wasn't an attack.

387
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:42,918
Legally,
he's not allowed to yet.

388
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,354
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

389
00:44:46,356 --> 00:44:47,890
What provoked it?

390
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:51,526
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

391
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:54,162
By the surface?
I don't think so.

392
00:44:54,164 --> 00:44:56,097
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

393
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,799
I was there.

394
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,668
A surface warship fired at us.

395
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,404
Now, Xebel sides
with Atlantis,

396
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:07,309
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

397
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:11,880
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

398
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:15,149
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

399
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:16,919
You don't understand.

400
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,421
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

401
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:23,157
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

402
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:25,828
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

403
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,395
Okay? I don't even know
where to begin.

404
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:29,865
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

405
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:34,605
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

406
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:40,577
Hmm.

407
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:42,913
I already got one of those.

408
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:46,414
Not like this one, you don't.

409
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:49,084
This is
the Lost Trident of Atlan.

410
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:50,318
Oh, I know the story.

411
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,821
It's more than a story.
It's real.

412
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:58,860
<i>It was forged by the greatest</i>
<i>weapon masters in history.</i>

413
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:02,632
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel</i>
<i>for King Atlan,</i>

414
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:06,634
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

415
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:10,874
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued</i>
<i>with the power to command the sea.</i>

416
00:46:12,242 --> 00:46:14,075
So what happened to it?

417
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:17,679
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

418
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:21,916
<i>when King Atlan ruled over all that was,</i>

419
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:24,688
<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis</i>
<i>were one.</i>

420
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:33,628
<i>It was a time of great prosperity</i>
<i>and technological advancement.</i>

421
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,263
<i>We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy</i>

422
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,999
<i>at a time when
the rest of the world</i>

423
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,736
<i>still thought the earth
was flat.</i>

424
00:46:42,204 --> 00:46:45,405
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

425
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:48,076
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

426
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:07,797
<i>The ocean swallowed us,</i>
<i>and Atlantis sank.</i>

427
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:12,300
<i>But the very power that</i>
<i>collapsed our civilization</i>

428
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:15,603
<i>also paved the way to our future.</i>

429
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:18,808
<i>It gave us the ability</i>
<i>to breathe underwater.</i>

430
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:22,510
<i>And so, we evolved.</i>

431
00:47:22,512 --> 00:47:25,680
<i>Others regressed,</i>
<i>became savage.</i>

432
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:32,820
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

433
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:37,191
<i>Neither he nor the trident</i>
<i>were ever seen again.</i>

434
00:47:37,193 --> 00:47:41,461
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

435
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:45,332
It's an ancient recording dating
back to the First Dynasty.

436
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:49,070
I believe it contains Atlan's
final message to his people

437
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:52,140
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

438
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:53,573
So, what does it say?

439
00:47:53,575 --> 00:47:56,343
We don't know.
The technology's too old.

440
00:47:56,345 --> 00:48:00,114
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

441
00:48:00,116 --> 00:48:02,916
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

442
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:06,889
The clue to Atlan's final
resting place is inside of this.

443
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:27,306
<i>Border Defense.</i>
<i>You are under arrest for illegal entry.</i>

444
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:28,510
No!

445
00:48:30,212 --> 00:48:32,045
You mustn't be seen here!

446
00:49:27,936 --> 00:49:29,976
I don't suppose you want
to talk about this, do you?

447
00:49:35,077 --> 00:49:36,576
Neither do I.

448
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:20,988
<i>In the name of His Highness,</i>
<i>King Orm, I place you under arrest.</i>

449
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,210
Welcome to Atlantis...

450
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:45,913
Brother.

451
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:52,619
I can't believe
you're finally here.

452
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:56,857
I've heard so many stories
about you.

453
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,831
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

454
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:09,970
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

455
00:51:09,972 --> 00:51:13,039
Ashamed of the fact that I
have a half-breed brother

456
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,976
whose heart I wanted
to run my trident through.

457
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:21,381
But now that you're finally here before
me, I must admit...

458
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,689
I am conflicted.

459
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,992
You want conflict,

460
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:35,661
why don't you take these chains
off, little brother?

461
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,598
And we'll see
who gets run through.

462
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:44,970
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

463
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:48,674
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

464
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,275
To kill me?

465
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,078
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

466
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,014
I see.

467
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,849
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

468
00:51:56,851 --> 00:52:00,786
that the surface
continues to commit?

469
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:05,558
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

470
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:08,894
and poisoned our children.

471
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:12,464
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

472
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:18,170
And you've come all this way to
take sides against your own people?

473
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:20,339
There are no sides
in a war like this.

474
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:23,074
You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

475
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:25,111
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

476
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:30,048
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

477
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,353
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

478
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:36,888
Well then, perhaps
that's how we'll proceed.

479
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,656
Your Majesty!
Orm, please.

480
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,058
Don't you see?

481
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,093
If I defeat the firstborn son
of Atlanna

482
00:52:42,095 --> 00:52:44,562
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

483
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:49,667
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

484
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,671
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

485
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,275
Your brother
is clearly an imbecile.

486
00:52:56,943 --> 00:52:59,211
Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways.

487
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,348
Then he's about to get
an education.

488
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:04,850
Are you officially
challenging me?

489
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,052
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

490
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,586
If you win,

491
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:12,293
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

492
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,761
But if I win...

493
00:53:16,497 --> 00:53:17,697
You're over.

494
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:19,997
Let's do it.

495
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,632
So be it.

496
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:24,669
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

497
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:27,139
Prepare him
for the Ring of Fire.

498
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:30,344
Wait. The ring of what?

499
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:52,330
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

500
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:55,032
It seems to me like I just
solved all of our problems.

501
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:57,335
I beat him in a battle,
war's over, I get to go home.

502
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:59,570
You're a formidable fighter
on land,

503
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:02,106
but here you're out
of your element, literally.

504
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:04,909
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

505
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,613
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

506
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:10,780
You taught me
how to fight, Cobra Kai.

507
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:12,919
Let's see
if you remember anything.

508
00:54:16,655 --> 00:54:18,022
So, what's with the big fork?

509
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:20,792
It's a trident.
Now, defend yourself.

510
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:55,859
What the hell is this?

511
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:58,164
I'll teach you this move when
you've mastered the trident.

512
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:09,840
It's not fair.

513
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,909
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

514
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:15,680
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

515
00:55:15,682 --> 00:55:19,283
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

516
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:20,952
Why has she never
come to see me, huh?

517
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:23,087
I told you,
when you're ready...

518
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:27,191
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

519
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:30,026
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

520
00:55:30,028 --> 00:55:31,464
When am I gonna
be good enough?

521
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:38,236
Does she not love me?

522
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:41,472
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

523
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:45,308
But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

524
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,679
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

525
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,380
so she had to marry him...

526
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:53,850
And bear him a son,
Prince Orm.

527
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:56,186
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

528
00:55:56,188 --> 00:55:58,755
he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

529
00:55:58,757 --> 00:56:03,428
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the Trench.

530
00:56:06,164 --> 00:56:08,767
Are you saying
they executed her?

531
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:11,270
Because she had me?

532
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,751
I remember...

533
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:29,054
Everything.

534
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:35,458
I have something for you.

535
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,562
It belonged to my mother.

536
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:42,064
Tell me...

537
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,570
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

538
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:51,675
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

539
00:56:51,677 --> 00:56:55,010
I truly do. I don't want war...

540
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,412
Don't patronize me!

541
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:57,881
I know you.

542
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:59,583
What you're doing flies
in the face of everything

543
00:56:59,585 --> 00:57:01,551
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

544
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:02,653
If she were here...

545
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:06,623
But she's not here, is she?

546
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:09,328
What my mother taught us
was treason.

547
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:12,896
Don't follow in her wake.

548
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:15,832
All right! So,
this is the big, old ring of fire, huh?

549
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,970
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

550
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:23,973
Vulko.

551
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:27,945
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

552
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:40,858
Let's go, Lady Mera.

553
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:50,767
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

554
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:55,672
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

555
00:57:55,674 --> 00:58:00,075
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

556
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:04,781
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

557
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:08,417
Atlantis has been
lying in wait...

558
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:10,321
And now,
the beast has awakened.

559
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:22,266
There was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

560
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,567
Get to know my little brother.

561
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:30,174
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

562
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,546
If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be.

563
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:42,418
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

564
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,021
And I've hated you
for it ever since.

565
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:50,992
But I do not want
to kill you, Arthur.

566
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,230
I'm going to give you
one chance.

567
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:57,265
Go home.

568
00:58:57,267 --> 00:59:00,171
Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.

569
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:04,641
You are not going to win this.

570
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:08,444
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

571
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:12,082
And I am bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

572
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,386
You know I can't
let that happen.

573
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:18,222
I know.

574
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:22,560
What the hell is that?

575
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,163
The Ring of Fire.

576
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:36,306
Yeah!

577
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,977
Yeah!

578
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:49,118
Shit.

579
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,855
People of Atlantis, hear me!

580
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:56,727
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

581
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:01,697
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

582
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:06,234
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

583
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,213
Traitor!

584
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,215
Traitor!

585
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,723
You'll never be king!

586
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,004
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

587
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,839
would bow before
the king of Atlantis.

588
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,876
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

589
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,344
Beg them for mercy?

590
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,713
I detest the surface
as much as you do.

591
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,051
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

592
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:03,326
But you wouldn't be
that gullible, would you?

593
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,930
You want this war too,
don't you?

594
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:10,531
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

595
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,269
If this is how it must be
done, then so be it.

596
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,509
You have our mother's trident.

597
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,714
Powerful, but flawed like her.

598
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,183
I wield my father's.

599
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,184
And it has never known defeat!

600
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,234
I promised Atlanna
I'd protect him.

601
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,881
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

602
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:32,666
I am the one true king!

603
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:18,345
You waiting for an invitation?
Get in!

604
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,457
Mera!

605
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:35,161
Oh, yeah.
So, what's the plan?

606
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:38,298
The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm.

607
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,033
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

608
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:41,036
Shit happens.

609
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:48,540
Heads up!
We got a bogey on our six!

610
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:50,809
What does that even mean?
Bad guys behind us.

611
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:53,579
Then just say that!
Bad guys behind us!

612
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:03,182
Whoa, whoa, wait,
you said we couldn't go over these walls.

613
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:05,183
I did!
You said there were hydro-cannons!

614
01:07:05,185 --> 01:07:06,453
I did, now shut up!

615
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,793
Oh, shit!

616
01:07:35,783 --> 01:07:37,517
Shit!

617
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:39,885
Shit.

618
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,890
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

619
01:07:44,624 --> 01:07:45,859
Oh!

620
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,500
Here, hold this.

621
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:57,835
What are you doing?

622
01:07:57,837 --> 01:07:59,670
Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
Who?

623
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:02,475
Never mind.
Come here, get in. Come on.

624
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:06,612
Great.
So we're getting eaten.

625
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:30,334
How are you even
doing this, anyway?

626
01:08:30,336 --> 01:08:32,103
I don't know.

627
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:34,672
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

628
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:37,540
Right. Because you're
both big, dumb animals.

629
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:40,077
Hey, I just saved your life.
I saved yours first!

630
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,583
She said, "Coast is clear."

631
01:08:46,585 --> 01:08:48,720
So, where to now?

632
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:53,625
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

633
01:08:54,526 --> 01:08:56,095
All right.

634
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:21,218
I don't usually take charters,

635
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,754
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

636
01:09:23,756 --> 01:09:25,024
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

637
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:28,993
Oh, man.

638
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:30,761
Are you okay?

639
01:09:30,763 --> 01:09:32,965
I've never been
so high up before.

640
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,702
Or so far from home.

641
01:09:37,703 --> 01:09:39,571
But at least you have a home.

642
01:09:40,373 --> 01:09:41,906
Not anymore.

643
01:09:41,908 --> 01:09:43,606
I can never go back.

644
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:46,578
I betrayed everything when I
saved you from the coliseum.

645
01:09:50,483 --> 01:09:53,750
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

646
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:56,920
Atlantis is many
wonderful things.

647
01:09:56,922 --> 01:09:58,822
But forgiving, it is not.

648
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:00,157
Yeah, but you're royalty.

649
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,460
So was your mother.

650
01:10:02,462 --> 01:10:05,329
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

651
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:08,033
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

652
01:10:12,572 --> 01:10:14,505
Look on the bright side,

653
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:16,773
now you don't have to marry some tool
bag that you're not in love with.

654
01:10:16,775 --> 01:10:19,976
My obligation isn't to love.

655
01:10:19,978 --> 01:10:22,546
It is to my family
and my nation,

656
01:10:22,548 --> 01:10:24,616
and I've turned
my back on both.

657
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:30,687
Sometimes,
you have to do what's right,

658
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:33,625
even if your heart aches
against it.

659
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:51,841
Your Highness.

660
01:10:51,843 --> 01:10:56,949
The tracker places Princess Mera
here, in the Deserter Kingdom.

661
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,018
You said she was dead.

662
01:10:59,619 --> 01:11:01,087
Apparently not.

663
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:04,288
Then your brother
still lives as well?

664
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,623
Not for long.

665
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,625
Captain Murk, assemble
a strike force immediately.

666
01:11:07,627 --> 01:11:12,363
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

667
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:13,531
She betrayed the throne.

668
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:15,932
She is a daughter of Xebel.

669
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:18,902
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

670
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:20,471
Your Highness,

671
01:11:20,473 --> 01:11:23,873
we are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen Kingdom.

672
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:27,977
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

673
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:30,081
should be
our immediate concern.

674
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:39,189
My vizier is correct.
As usual.

675
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:45,697
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

676
01:12:08,587 --> 01:12:10,088
We're here!

677
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:12,754
Hey!

678
01:12:12,756 --> 01:12:14,290
Is there anything nearby?

679
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,392
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

680
01:12:16,394 --> 01:12:18,428
Nothing but desert.
He's wrong.

681
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,499
Hey! What are you doing?
Wait! No! Oh...

682
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:27,069
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

683
01:12:27,071 --> 01:12:29,572
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

684
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:46,855
Shit!

685
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:00,802
Oh, you're crazier
than I thought!

686
01:13:00,804 --> 01:13:02,240
A-ha!

687
01:13:03,341 --> 01:13:04,808
This way.

688
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:29,467
<i>You were defeated the last time because</i>
<i>your surface weapons failed you.</i>

689
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:31,569
<i>Ours will not.</i>

690
01:13:34,972 --> 01:13:36,506
<i>It's prototype armor</i>

691
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:39,374
<i>for the next generation</i>
<i>Atlantean soldier.</i>

692
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:42,110
<i>Revenge is something</i>
<i>we Atlanteans understand.</i>

693
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:45,480
<i>You will lead my finest</i>
<i>commandos as your personal army</i>

694
01:13:45,482 --> 01:13:48,050
<i>to hunt down</i>
<i>the half-breed abomination.</i>

695
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:52,554
<i>I cannot touch them, but you can.</i>
<i>He's fled to your world.</i>

696
01:13:52,556 --> 01:13:56,024
<i>Kill him and the woman he's with,</i>
<i>and you will be rewarded.</i>

697
01:13:56,026 --> 01:13:58,329
Killing him is my reward.

698
01:14:01,799 --> 01:14:04,168
<i>The crown jewel.</i>
<i>Still experimental.</i>

699
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:08,605
<i>Converts water into beams</i>
<i>of energized plasma.</i>

700
01:15:20,778 --> 01:15:22,377
Hmm.

701
01:15:22,379 --> 01:15:24,880
I think I'm gonna need
a bigger helmet.

702
01:15:24,882 --> 01:15:27,482
One of the tribes of
Atlantis broke off and settled here

703
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:29,651
when this region
was still an inland sea.

704
01:15:29,653 --> 01:15:32,487
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

705
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:34,221
Perished?
Yeah, that's terrific.

706
01:15:34,223 --> 01:15:35,457
We're getting close now.

707
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:37,925
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

708
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:39,895
Close to getting
punched in the face!

709
01:15:39,897 --> 01:15:41,696
Look, <i>Fight Club,</i> I know you're
new to how things work up here.

710
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,998
Why don't you look around?
We are lost.

711
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,600
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

712
01:15:45,602 --> 01:15:48,369
<i>Nada.</i> This place
is a wasteland.

713
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:50,872
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

714
01:15:50,874 --> 01:15:52,506
This isn't my home!

715
01:15:52,508 --> 01:15:54,341
It's not like the whole
surface looks like this!

716
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:56,277
Oh, no, of course not.

717
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,513
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

718
01:15:59,515 --> 01:16:01,415
and whole mountains
made out of trash.

719
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:03,117
And, oh, you've got
great factories

720
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:05,019
that do nothing but belch
out filth and melt ice caps.

721
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:07,087
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

722
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:08,556
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

723
01:16:08,558 --> 01:16:10,558
but we've got some
good things too, all right?

724
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,827
We got green forests and big
mountains and beautiful lakes.

725
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:15,663
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

726
01:16:15,665 --> 01:16:17,498
Are you trying to provoke me?

727
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,200
I'm just saying you cannot judge a
place before you've even seen it.

728
01:16:19,202 --> 01:16:22,037
You've judged Atlantis
on far less.

729
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:28,975
No. Would you just stop it
with that? No.

730
01:16:28,977 --> 01:16:32,580
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane

731
01:16:32,582 --> 01:16:34,742
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

732
01:16:37,854 --> 01:16:40,490
If you're the next true king,
we're doomed.

733
01:17:08,818 --> 01:17:10,152
That was awesome.

734
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:18,160
Oh. Look what I found.

735
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:20,461
What you found?

736
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:21,464
Yeah.

737
01:17:31,874 --> 01:17:33,576
Check this place out.

738
01:17:34,175 --> 01:17:35,809
This is badass!

739
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,847
This is the Hall of Armory.

740
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:43,184
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

741
01:17:44,554 --> 01:17:46,689
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

742
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:54,362
Vulko was right.

743
01:17:56,899 --> 01:17:58,333
It's real.

744
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,705
Huh.

745
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:39,405
Nothing.

746
01:18:39,407 --> 01:18:41,407
Of course it's not working.

747
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:44,409
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

748
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,747
Man!

749
01:18:47,749 --> 01:18:50,783
"Since before
the Sahara was a desert."

750
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:52,952
Thank you for repeating
what I just said.

751
01:18:52,954 --> 01:18:54,823
It's completely dried out.

752
01:18:56,759 --> 01:18:58,324
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

753
01:18:58,326 --> 01:19:00,326
when you're not
thinking at all.

754
01:19:00,328 --> 01:19:01,394
All right, now hold still.

755
01:19:01,396 --> 01:19:03,663
Hey. What are you doing?

756
01:19:03,665 --> 01:19:06,802
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

757
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:09,437
Now, hold still.

758
01:19:15,577 --> 01:19:16,611
Hmm.

759
01:19:45,607 --> 01:19:46,741
Show-off.

760
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,243
I could have just peed on it.

761
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:00,855
King Atlan.

762
01:20:02,857 --> 01:20:07,994
<i>In this trident</i>
<i>resides the power of Atlantis.</i>

763
01:20:07,996 --> 01:20:11,898
<i>In the wrong hands,</i>
<i>it would bring destruction.</i>

764
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,167
<i>But in the hands of the true heir,</i>

765
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:18,270
<i>it would unite all our</i>
<i>kingdoms above and below.</i>

766
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:23,208
<i>If you seek my power,</i>
<i>you must prove your worth.</i>

767
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:26,745
<i>Journey beyond the edge of</i>
<i>the world to the Hidden Sea.</i>

768
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:30,015
<i>Look inside the bottle</i>
<i>for the charted path.</i>

769
01:20:30,017 --> 01:20:35,756
<i>Only in the hands of the</i>
<i>true king can he truly see.</i>

770
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:45,298
Hmm.

771
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:53,339
We can't let Orm find this.

772
01:20:55,776 --> 01:20:56,943
Hey! Wait!

773
01:20:58,046 --> 01:20:59,579
What?

774
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,379
Shouldn't we have
written it down first?

775
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:03,484
I memorized it. Didn't you?

776
01:21:05,086 --> 01:21:06,654
Oh, yeah. Totally.

777
01:21:08,223 --> 01:21:09,523
What'd he just say?

778
01:21:11,358 --> 01:21:13,560
"Something something trident."

779
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,811
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

780
01:21:36,984 --> 01:21:38,786
It's our next stop.

781
01:23:12,578 --> 01:23:15,479
I'm starting to think you actually
like these surface-dwellers.

782
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:18,417
It would be wrong to judge a
place I've never seen before.

783
01:23:20,553 --> 01:23:23,023
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

784
01:23:42,175 --> 01:23:46,043
Well, apparently, it's just right
up on the hill. A big old castle.

785
01:23:46,045 --> 01:23:48,915
And I just learned something
very interesting.

786
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:55,387
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

787
01:23:55,389 --> 01:23:58,689
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

788
01:23:58,691 --> 01:24:00,090
Oh!

789
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,492
I got it from the movie.

790
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:10,433
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

791
01:24:10,435 --> 01:24:12,602
beyond that ancient notion

792
01:24:12,604 --> 01:24:14,838
that war with the surface
is inevitable.

793
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,674
It is the position
of the Fishermen

794
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:20,945
that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the landsmen,

795
01:24:20,947 --> 01:24:24,817
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

796
01:24:26,118 --> 01:24:28,888
I admire your lofty
aspirations, King Ricou.

797
01:24:32,624 --> 01:24:37,627
But I suspect they are but clouds
of ink hiding the heart of a coward.

798
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:40,164
How dare you!

799
01:24:42,033 --> 01:24:44,335
Please. I implore you.

800
01:24:44,337 --> 01:24:48,137
You're a kingdom of bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets

801
01:24:48,139 --> 01:24:51,674
whose waters have grown
stagnant, and it sickens me.

802
01:25:00,286 --> 01:25:01,785
My King!

803
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:05,558
The king is dead!
Long live his heir.

804
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:08,527
Princess.

805
01:25:09,528 --> 01:25:13,130
Prepare your armies,
Your Highness.

806
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:16,669
We move against
the Brine Kingdom at once.

807
01:25:24,143 --> 01:25:26,210
What did the recording say, again?

808
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:29,179
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea."

809
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:31,281
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

810
01:25:31,283 --> 01:25:35,587
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

811
01:25:37,289 --> 01:25:40,259
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

812
01:25:42,228 --> 01:25:43,561
Hmm.

813
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:46,931
Oh, man.

814
01:25:47,466 --> 01:25:48,664
What?

815
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:51,034
Wow.
That's awesome.

816
01:25:51,036 --> 01:25:52,203
Let me see.

817
01:25:53,571 --> 01:25:55,772
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

818
01:25:55,774 --> 01:25:57,307
Here, let me see.

819
01:25:57,309 --> 01:25:59,008
What was the last line?

820
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:02,479
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

821
01:26:02,481 --> 01:26:04,215
"Only in the hands
of the true..."

822
01:26:05,683 --> 01:26:07,817
Marcus Agrippa.

823
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:09,788
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

824
01:26:11,656 --> 01:26:13,158
Neither was Scipio.

825
01:26:14,459 --> 01:26:16,125
How do you know
all this stuff?

826
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:18,227
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

827
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:24,534
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

828
01:26:24,536 --> 01:26:26,570
First king of Rome.

829
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,809
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

830
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:43,785
There it is.
That's our heading.

831
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,756
What? Let me see.

832
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:49,158
We did it!

833
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,328
Oh!

834
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:54,098
That's not bad
for an imbecile, huh?

835
01:26:56,368 --> 01:26:57,802
Not bad at all.

836
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:12,884
Mera.

837
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:20,556
"Loathsomeness
waits and dreams in the deep",

838
01:27:20,558 --> 01:27:25,830
"and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

839
01:27:29,534 --> 01:27:30,767
Get back!

840
01:27:36,207 --> 01:27:37,375
Arthur!

841
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:41,978
I order you to stand down!

842
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:44,182
<i>Princess Mera,</i>
<i>you've been charged with high treason.</i>

843
01:28:04,502 --> 01:28:05,834
Who the hell are you?

844
01:28:05,836 --> 01:28:08,038
Maybe this will
jog your memory.

845
01:28:55,919 --> 01:28:58,086
You're the guy from the sub.

846
01:28:58,088 --> 01:28:59,522
That's right.

847
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:03,328
But now I have
Atlantean steel.

848
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:11,935
Call me "Black Manta."

849
01:29:27,017 --> 01:29:29,219
You thought
you could walk away?

850
01:29:35,092 --> 01:29:36,994
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

851
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:58,914
You can't run.

852
01:29:59,716 --> 01:30:01,982
You owe me blood!

853
01:30:01,984 --> 01:30:03,652
How'd you find me?

854
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:07,923
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

855
01:31:24,668 --> 01:31:25,868
No!

856
01:32:00,269 --> 01:32:01,270
Come on.

857
01:32:05,907 --> 01:32:07,775
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

858
01:32:12,848 --> 01:32:16,949
I'll show you the
same mercy you showed my father.

859
01:32:16,951 --> 01:32:19,787
And gut you
like the fish you are!

860
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:16,502
Arthur!

861
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,642
Mera, they're tracking you.

862
01:34:22,644 --> 01:34:23,776
What?

863
01:34:23,778 --> 01:34:25,513
They're tracking you.

864
01:34:36,323 --> 01:34:39,493
Arthur, stay with me.

865
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,230
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

866
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,213
Um...

867
01:35:34,782 --> 01:35:36,414
Did you steal a boat?

868
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:39,551
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

869
01:35:39,553 --> 01:35:42,722
No, those belong to people.

870
01:35:42,724 --> 01:35:44,522
Huh.

871
01:35:46,293 --> 01:35:48,027
Those were
Orm's elite commandos.

872
01:35:48,029 --> 01:35:51,329
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

873
01:35:51,331 --> 01:35:53,698
I've never seen him before.

874
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,367
Yeah, I have.

875
01:35:55,369 --> 01:35:57,871
He and his father
were pirates.

876
01:35:59,339 --> 01:36:01,906
And he blames me
for his father's death.

877
01:36:01,908 --> 01:36:06,480
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

878
01:36:07,314 --> 01:36:09,249
That's not how it feels.

879
01:36:11,284 --> 01:36:15,253
It was up to me,
and I let him die.

880
01:36:15,255 --> 01:36:18,155
I could've saved him,
but I didn't.

881
01:36:18,157 --> 01:36:22,127
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

882
01:36:22,129 --> 01:36:23,630
And that would
have been my fault.

883
01:36:25,532 --> 01:36:27,634
Well, he's behind us now.

884
01:36:28,869 --> 01:36:31,471
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

885
01:36:33,073 --> 01:36:36,409
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

886
01:36:38,045 --> 01:36:40,479
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

887
01:36:41,114 --> 01:36:42,479
Yes.

888
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:44,581
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

889
01:36:44,583 --> 01:36:46,751
It's become a place of death.

890
01:36:46,753 --> 01:36:48,955
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

891
01:36:53,093 --> 01:36:55,326
We should turn back.

892
01:36:55,328 --> 01:36:58,130
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

893
01:36:58,132 --> 01:36:59,731
Turn back?

894
01:36:59,733 --> 01:37:03,768
Look, I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

895
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:07,006
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

896
01:37:07,008 --> 01:37:10,008
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

897
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:14,479
But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip.

898
01:37:14,481 --> 01:37:17,515
I'm no leader.
I'm not a king.

899
01:37:17,517 --> 01:37:21,252
I do not work
or play well with others.

900
01:37:21,254 --> 01:37:25,957
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

901
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:30,662
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

902
01:37:30,664 --> 01:37:33,798
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

903
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,536
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

904
01:37:40,372 --> 01:37:41,875
The only question is...

905
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:45,779
Can you?

906
01:38:01,061 --> 01:38:04,864
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

907
01:38:05,898 --> 01:38:07,366
Vulko.

908
01:38:08,135 --> 01:38:10,001
My trusted vizier

909
01:38:10,003 --> 01:38:13,672
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

910
01:38:15,741 --> 01:38:18,642
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

911
01:38:18,644 --> 01:38:21,779
I have already
given it, My King.

912
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:25,284
But I will stand
by your decision, as always.

913
01:38:25,918 --> 01:38:27,453
My decision.

914
01:38:29,421 --> 01:38:30,823
To protect it.

915
01:38:33,225 --> 01:38:34,593
While you betray it.

916
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:39,295
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

917
01:38:39,297 --> 01:38:44,601
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

918
01:38:44,603 --> 01:38:50,042
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

919
01:38:53,045 --> 01:38:54,713
Do not deny it.

920
01:38:57,851 --> 01:38:58,985
I do not.

921
01:38:59,585 --> 01:39:00,854
Why?

922
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:05,223
I am the pure blood.

923
01:39:05,225 --> 01:39:08,259
I have devoted my life
to Atlantis.

924
01:39:08,261 --> 01:39:11,762
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

925
01:39:11,764 --> 01:39:12,763
I do serve it.

926
01:39:12,765 --> 01:39:15,432
Arthur may only be
half-Atlantean,

927
01:39:15,434 --> 01:39:19,572
but he's already twice
the king you'll ever be.

928
01:39:25,878 --> 01:39:27,346
Take him.

929
01:39:28,547 --> 01:39:30,516
But make sure he has a view.

930
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,283
What the hell
are these things?

931
01:41:13,285 --> 01:41:15,120
The Trench! We're here!

932
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:19,590
There are too many of them!
Come on, inside!

933
01:41:30,068 --> 01:41:31,133
They're from the depths.

934
01:41:31,135 --> 01:41:32,804
They're scared
of the light. Here!

935
01:41:45,149 --> 01:41:46,551
Come on!

936
01:41:51,255 --> 01:41:52,623
You ready to jump?

937
01:43:01,526 --> 01:43:03,161
Over there!

938
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:39,794
That thing
will tear us apart.

939
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:41,631
We don't have a choice!

940
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:03,253
Arthur!

941
01:44:06,523 --> 01:44:07,724
Mera!

942
01:44:38,954 --> 01:44:40,022
Mera!

943
01:44:41,157 --> 01:44:42,158
Mera!

944
01:45:03,813 --> 01:45:05,015
Mera!

945
01:45:08,018 --> 01:45:09,019
Mera!

946
01:45:53,262 --> 01:45:54,431
Arthur.

947
01:45:55,331 --> 01:45:56,732
Mom?

948
01:46:34,902 --> 01:46:39,640
King Orvax sacrificed
me to the Trench, but I survived.

949
01:46:39,642 --> 01:46:43,109
I fought my way through as you
did, and I ended up here.

950
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,944
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

951
01:46:44,946 --> 01:46:46,413
Yes.

952
01:46:46,415 --> 01:46:47,915
Come. Sit here.

953
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:55,423
You must forgive me.

954
01:46:55,425 --> 01:46:58,058
Forgive me for everything.

955
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,561
This happened
because you had me.

956
01:47:00,563 --> 01:47:05,432
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

957
01:47:05,434 --> 01:47:08,335
I made a choice.
I had to leave...

958
01:47:08,337 --> 01:47:12,441
To save you,
to save your father.

959
01:47:14,843 --> 01:47:17,413
Tell me. Tell me about him.

960
01:47:17,846 --> 01:47:19,248
Is he...

961
01:47:23,018 --> 01:47:25,487
He still walks
to the end of that dock.

962
01:47:27,323 --> 01:47:28,357
Every morning.

963
01:47:31,393 --> 01:47:32,860
Every day.

964
01:47:35,963 --> 01:47:37,466
Waiting for you.

965
01:47:45,073 --> 01:47:46,608
Why didn't you ever come back?

966
01:47:52,146 --> 01:47:56,383
Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return.

967
01:47:56,385 --> 01:48:00,019
The trident
is the only way back.

968
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:04,058
But it is guarded
by the Karathen.

969
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,829
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

970
01:48:08,831 --> 01:48:11,966
It lies beyond the waterfall.

971
01:48:16,037 --> 01:48:18,371
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

972
01:48:18,373 --> 01:48:19,740
No.

973
01:48:19,742 --> 01:48:21,574
It's too powerful.

974
01:48:21,576 --> 01:48:25,411
I've tried many times
over the years.

975
01:48:25,413 --> 01:48:29,016
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

976
01:48:31,918 --> 01:48:33,554
You're afraid.

977
01:48:36,324 --> 01:48:37,392
Yes.

978
01:48:38,892 --> 01:48:40,194
Good.

979
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:43,131
You're ready.

980
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:46,267
Atlantis has always had a king.

981
01:48:48,034 --> 01:48:50,236
Now, it needs something more.

982
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:52,373
But what could be
greater than a king?

983
01:48:52,874 --> 01:48:54,141
A hero.

984
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:58,312
A king fights
only for his nation.

985
01:49:00,081 --> 01:49:02,350
You fight for everyone.

986
01:50:30,905 --> 01:50:36,674
You do not belong here.

987
01:50:36,676 --> 01:50:43,248
I have guarded the trident against
false kings since the beginning.

988
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:45,650
And for a thousand years

989
01:50:45,652 --> 01:50:51,456
I have seen the greatest
champions try and fail.

990
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:57,997
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

991
01:50:57,999 --> 01:51:05,236
You dare come here with
your tainted mongrel blood

992
01:51:05,238 --> 01:51:08,774
to claim Atlantis'
greatest treasure?

993
01:51:11,077 --> 01:51:12,312
So be it...

994
01:51:13,714 --> 01:51:15,482
Half-breed.

995
01:51:34,969 --> 01:51:38,169
You thought yourself worthy?

996
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:41,306
You thought yourself a king?

997
01:51:41,308 --> 01:51:45,710
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

998
01:51:45,712 --> 01:51:46,813
Stop!

999
01:51:54,387 --> 01:51:59,057
You're right.
I am a half-breed mongrel.

1000
01:51:59,059 --> 01:52:01,993
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

1001
01:52:01,995 --> 01:52:03,895
I know I'm not.

1002
01:52:03,897 --> 01:52:07,966
You understand me?

1003
01:52:07,968 --> 01:52:09,734
I do.

1004
01:52:09,736 --> 01:52:16,543
No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.

1005
01:52:17,644 --> 01:52:20,847
Who are you?

1006
01:52:21,648 --> 01:52:23,115
I'm nobody.

1007
01:52:25,317 --> 01:52:28,187
I came because
I had no choice.

1008
01:52:29,655 --> 01:52:34,259
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

1009
01:52:36,362 --> 01:52:40,464
I came because the trident
is their only hope.

1010
01:52:40,466 --> 01:52:42,668
And if that's not
good enough...

1011
01:52:45,105 --> 01:52:46,672
Then screw you.

1012
01:52:48,607 --> 01:52:55,649
No man has ever freed
the trident from Atlan's grip.

1013
01:52:56,483 --> 01:52:59,684
Should he deem you unworthy...

1014
01:52:59,686 --> 01:53:05,056
Well, I haven't feasted
in eons,

1015
01:53:05,058 --> 01:53:08,260
and I am famished.

1016
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:41,319
The one true king.

1017
01:54:53,664 --> 01:54:56,800
Remember,
the Brine are powerful, savage brutes,

1018
01:54:56,802 --> 01:55:01,338
but a swift assault aimed directly at
their leadership will turn the tide.

1019
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,173
Defeat the Brine King,

1020
01:55:03,175 --> 01:55:06,845
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1021
01:55:08,714 --> 01:55:10,716
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1022
01:55:12,384 --> 01:55:13,986
Tomorrow,
we scorch the surface!

1023
01:55:15,286 --> 01:55:18,690
Rise, Atlantis!

1024
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:39,778
Death to the
Atlantean hagfish!

1025
01:55:44,983 --> 01:55:47,284
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1026
01:55:47,286 --> 01:55:51,823
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1027
01:56:58,257 --> 01:57:01,058
No! We need him!

1028
01:57:03,262 --> 01:57:04,860
Join me or die.

1029
01:57:04,862 --> 01:57:08,430
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

1030
01:57:08,432 --> 01:57:09,867
Not Your Highness.

1031
01:57:11,869 --> 01:57:13,437
Call me...

1032
01:57:14,138 --> 01:57:15,838
Ocean Master.

1033
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,742
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1034
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:23,312
But you will never
have my allegiance!

1035
01:57:23,314 --> 01:57:24,582
So be it!

1036
01:57:56,446 --> 01:57:57,781
What the...

1037
01:58:33,083 --> 01:58:34,818
The king has risen.

1038
01:58:42,425 --> 01:58:44,593
Attack!

1039
02:00:43,345 --> 02:00:46,046
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1040
02:00:46,048 --> 02:00:49,384
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

1041
02:00:50,718 --> 02:00:52,285
And what if I can't?

1042
02:00:52,287 --> 02:00:55,523
Last time,
he was in his element.

1043
02:00:55,525 --> 02:00:58,727
This time,
make him fight in yours.

1044
02:01:25,654 --> 02:01:27,588
Um...

1045
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:30,859
What was the plan, again?
The plan is to not get killed.

1046
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:34,696
Yeah, good plan.
Don't get killed.

1047
02:02:07,629 --> 02:02:09,663
The Trench!
He commands the Trench!

1048
02:02:09,665 --> 02:02:11,166
Impossible!

1049
02:02:28,015 --> 02:02:29,748
Stand down! Let her pass.

1050
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:32,952
Please, Father,
he has the trident.

1051
02:02:32,954 --> 02:02:35,321
I know you think
this war is necessary,

1052
02:02:35,323 --> 02:02:37,890
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

1053
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,559
And if you turn your back
on that now,

1054
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:41,860
then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead.

1055
02:02:41,862 --> 02:02:44,930
It's true!
The half-breed wields King Atlan's trident.

1056
02:02:44,932 --> 02:02:46,200
He commands the sea!

1057
02:02:48,269 --> 02:02:50,338
Then that half-breed
is your king.

1058
02:04:07,481 --> 02:04:09,982
Vulko! Come on,
he needs our help!

1059
02:04:09,984 --> 02:04:11,883
We can't! Look.

1060
02:04:11,885 --> 02:04:13,521
The people must bear witness.

1061
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:22,129
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

1062
02:04:23,029 --> 02:04:24,565
A half-breed bastard.

1063
02:04:27,167 --> 02:04:30,504
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

1064
02:04:33,206 --> 02:04:34,575
Well, then by bloodshed...

1065
02:04:36,811 --> 02:04:38,845
Do the gods
make known their will.

1066
02:05:08,275 --> 02:05:10,578
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1067
02:06:46,405 --> 02:06:47,605
Finish it.

1068
02:06:47,607 --> 02:06:48,972
Yield the throne.

1069
02:06:48,974 --> 02:06:50,743
Mercy is not our way.

1070
02:06:52,344 --> 02:06:54,481
Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother...

1071
02:06:59,954 --> 02:07:01,820
But I'm not one of you.

1072
02:07:01,822 --> 02:07:03,056
Do it!

1073
02:07:05,291 --> 02:07:07,293
Kill me!
No!

1074
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:11,631
That is enough killing.

1075
02:07:19,105 --> 02:07:20,473
Mother?

1076
02:07:21,007 --> 02:07:22,675
Oh, my son.

1077
02:07:31,818 --> 02:07:33,951
It's a long story.

1078
02:07:33,953 --> 02:07:35,488
I'll tell ya later.

1079
02:07:36,456 --> 02:07:37,724
Come on!

1080
02:07:44,263 --> 02:07:47,431
I don't understand.
We thought...

1081
02:07:47,433 --> 02:07:48,434
I know.

1082
02:07:49,002 --> 02:07:50,803
Arthur saved me.

1083
02:07:54,506 --> 02:07:56,776
You're with him?
I am.

1084
02:07:59,344 --> 02:08:04,447
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1085
02:08:04,449 --> 02:08:06,685
But you have been misguided.

1086
02:08:08,053 --> 02:08:12,122
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1087
02:08:12,124 --> 02:08:13,991
He was wrong.

1088
02:08:13,993 --> 02:08:16,728
The land and the sea

1089
02:08:18,031 --> 02:08:19,565
are one.

1090
02:08:39,551 --> 02:08:40,686
My queen.

1091
02:08:43,789 --> 02:08:45,156
Vulko.

1092
02:08:47,459 --> 02:08:49,258
Take him.

1093
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:51,597
But make sure he has a view.

1094
02:08:58,605 --> 02:08:59,606
When you're ready,

1095
02:09:02,008 --> 02:09:03,408
let's talk.

1096
02:09:18,057 --> 02:09:22,192
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1097
02:09:22,194 --> 02:09:25,161
but let it end in joy.

1098
02:09:25,163 --> 02:09:29,699
I give you
King Arthur of Atlantis.

1099
02:09:29,701 --> 02:09:31,401
Hail to the king!

1100
02:09:31,403 --> 02:09:34,437
Hail to the king!
Hail to the king!

1101
02:09:42,481 --> 02:09:44,816
So, what do I do now?

1102
02:09:45,417 --> 02:09:47,218
Be their king.

1103
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:49,786
Ooh.

1104
02:09:49,788 --> 02:09:51,890
This is gonna be fun.

1105
02:10:43,908 --> 02:10:46,809
You came back. You're back.

1106
02:10:46,811 --> 02:10:48,913
Yes. Yes.

1107
02:10:54,786 --> 02:10:57,689
<i>My father was a lighthouse keeper.</i>

1108
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:00,559
<i>My mother was a queen.</i>

1109
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:03,829
<i>They were never meant to meet...</i>

1110
02:11:07,331 --> 02:11:09,735
<i>But their love saved the world.</i>

1111
02:11:11,937 --> 02:11:14,536
<i>They made me what I am.</i>

1112
02:11:14,538 --> 02:11:18,242
<i>A son of the land,</i>
<i>and a king of the seas.</i>

1113
02:11:19,811 --> 02:11:21,847
<i>I am the protector of the deep.</i>

1114
02:11:23,647 --> 02:11:24,715
<i>I am...</i>

1115
02:11:26,383 --> 02:11:28,352
<i>Aquaman.</i>

1116
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:38,607
Hey!

1117
02:14:42,544 --> 02:14:44,078
<i>I spent 15 years</i>

1118
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:46,446
<i>at the United States Institute</i>
<i>of Marine Science...</i>

1119
02:14:46,448 --> 02:14:49,616
<i>Weren't you fired?</i>
<i>Studying oceanic phenomenon,</i>

1120
02:14:49,618 --> 02:14:51,985
<i>and this is the most conclusive</i>
<i>evidence we have to date.</i>

1121
02:14:51,987 --> 02:14:55,556
<i>Deep-sea seismographs have recorded</i>
<i>explosions on the ocean floor.</i>

1122
02:14:55,558 --> 02:14:57,758
<i>We have satellite imagery</i>

1123
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,127
<i>of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface...</i>

1124
02:15:00,129 --> 02:15:01,929
<i>Dr. Shin!</i>
<i>Will you please let me finish?</i>

1125
02:15:01,931 --> 02:15:04,165
<i>Here we go again.</i>
<i>Atlantean?</i>

1126
02:15:04,167 --> 02:15:06,934
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>The government does not want us to know</i>

1127
02:15:06,936 --> 02:15:08,502
<i>about the threat that exists right here...</i>

1128
02:15:08,504 --> 02:15:10,838
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1129
02:15:23,086 --> 02:15:25,019
This is Atlantean technology,
isn't it?

1130
02:15:25,021 --> 02:15:27,154
Can you tell me
how you got this?

1131
02:15:27,156 --> 02:15:30,523
Sure. But first,

1132
02:15:30,525 --> 02:15:33,495
you gotta tell me
how to find him.
