1
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,946
Longing

2
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:13,824
Rusted

3
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,617
Seventeen

4
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:16,994
Daybreak

5
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,496
Furnace

6
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,623
Nine

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,792
Benign

8
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,587
Homecoming

9
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,672
One

10
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,634
Freight car

11
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,268
Good morning, Soldier.

12
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,063
Ready to comply.

13
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,858
I have a mission for you.

14
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,361
Sanction and extract.

15
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,530
No witnesses.

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,907
Well done Soldier.

17
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,036
All right, what do you see?

18
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
Standard beat cops.

19
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,958
Small station.

20
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,128
Quiet street.

21
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,172
It's a good target.

22
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,465
There's an ATM on the south corner,
which means?

23
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,675
Cameras.

24
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,510
Both cross streets are one-way.

25
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,179
So, compromised escape routes.

26
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,306
Means our guy doesn't care
about being seen.

27
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,141
He isn't afraid to make a mess
on the way out.

28
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,977
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

29
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,021
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.

30
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,648
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...

31
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,150
which means more guns...

32
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,819
which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.

33
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,488
You guys know I can
move things with my mind, right?

34
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,158
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

35
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,036
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

36
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,496
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?

37
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,748
Eyes on target, folks.

38
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,875
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow in six months.

39
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,918
I don't want to lose him.

40
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,462
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

41
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,838
He kind of hates us.

42
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,593
Sam...

43
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,136
see that garbage truck?

44
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,053
Tag it.

45
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,157
Give me X-ray.

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,997
That truck's loaded for max weight.

47
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
And the driver's armed.

48
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,291
It's a battering ram.

49
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,376
-Go now.
-What?

50
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,878
He's not hitting the police.

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,069
Body armor, AR-15s.

52
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,112
I make seven hostiles.

53
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,998
I make five.

54
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,421
Sam.

55
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,051
Four.

56
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,890
Rumlow's on the third floor.

57
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,433
Wanda, just like we practiced.

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,559
What about the gas?

59
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,644
Get it out.

60
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
Pack it up.

61
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,368
He's here.

62
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,623
Rumlow has a biological weapon.

63
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,125
I'm on it.

64
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,078
I don't work like that no more.

65
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,166
Fire in the hole.

66
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,923
No!

67
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,905
Sam.

68
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,199
He's in an AFV heading north.

69
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,830
Take this to the airstrip.

70
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,124
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

71
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,633
Where are you going to meet us?

72
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,926
I'm not.

73
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,231
I've got four, they're splitting up.

74
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,779
I got the two on the left.

75
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,539
They ditched their gear.

76
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,374
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

77
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,340
There you are, you son of a bitch.

78
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,676
I've been waiting for this.

79
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,278
He doesn't have it.

80
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:12,738
I'm empty!

81
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,239
Out of the way!

82
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,863
Drop it.

83
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,156
Or I'll drop this.

84
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,785
-Drop it!
-He'll do it!

85
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,086
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.

86
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,128
Don't thank me.

87
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,089
I'm not thanking that thing.

88
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,090
His name is Redwing.

89
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,258
I'm still not thanking it.

90
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,717
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

91
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,517
Come on!

92
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,777
This is for
dropping a building on my face.

93
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,885
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

94
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,011
Who's your buyer?

95
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,221
You know, he knew you.

96
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,473
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.

97
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,059
What did you say?

98
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,978
He remembered you.

99
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,023
I was there. He got all weepy about it.

100
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,318
Till they put his brain back in a blender.

101
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,987
He wanted you to know something.

102
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,071
He said to me...

103
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,657
"Please tell Rogers.

104
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,492
"When you gotta go...

105
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,494
"you gotta go."

106
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,873
And you're coming with me.

107
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,517
Oh, my...

108
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,604
Sam...

109
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,442
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.

110
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,444
We gotta get up there.

111
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,340
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.

112
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,551
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

113
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,679
This is why I love
coming home for Christmas...

114
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,138
right before you leave town.

115
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,558
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

116
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,560
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

117
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,936
Candice.

118
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,273
Do me a favor? Try not to
burn the house down before Monday.

119
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,566
Okay, so it's Monday.

120
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,735
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

121
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,737
Where you going?

122
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,407
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

123
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,992
We might have to make a quick stop.

124
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,244
At the Pentagon. Right?

125
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,414
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

126
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,250
They say
sarcasm is a metric for potential.

127
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,335
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

128
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,753
I'll get the bags.

129
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,592
He does miss you when you're not here.

130
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,597
And frankly, you're going to miss us.

131
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,767
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.

132
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,062
You know what's about to happen.

133
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,023
Say something.

134
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,108
If you don't, you'll regret it.

135
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,363
I love you, Dad.

136
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,783
And I know you did the best you could.

137
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,593
That's how I wish it happened.

138
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,640
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...

139
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,849
or BARF.

140
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,726
God, I gotta work on that acronym.

141
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,523
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...

142
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:01,652
to clear traumatic memories.

143
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,867
It doesn't change the fact
that they never made it to the airport...

144
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,663
or all the things I did
to avoid processing my grief, but...

145
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,877
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

146
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,507
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

147
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,511
Help me out, what's the
MIT mission statement?

148
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,682
"To generate, disseminate
and preserve knowledge.

149
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,934
"And work with others...

150
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,854
"to bring it to bear
on the world's great challenges."

151
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,649
Well, you are the others.

152
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,151
And, quiet as it's kept...

153
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,405
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.

154
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,532
Plus, most of you are broke.

155
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,410
I'm sorry. Rather, you were.

156
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,619
As of this moment...

157
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:55,163
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

158
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,417
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

159
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,085
As in...

160
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,671
all of your projects
have just been approved and funded.

161
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,635
No strings, no taxes...

162
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,054
just reframe the future!

163
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,764
Starting now.

164
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,609
Go break some eggs.

165
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,955
That took my breath away.

166
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,582
Tony! So generous.

167
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,918
So much money! Wow!

168
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,794
Out of curiosity...

169
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,714
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

170
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,132
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.

171
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,426
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

172
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,761
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

173
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,804
-Restroom's this way, yeah?
-Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.

174
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,307
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

175
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,644
I didn't know Miss Potts had canceled.
They didn't have time to fix it.

176
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,439
It's fine. I'll be right back.

177
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:03,774
We'll catch up later.

178
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,627
That was nice, what you did
for those young people.

179
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,005
They deserve it.

180
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,258
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.

181
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:34,429
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

182
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,058
But if you've got the money...

183
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,061
break as many eggs as you like.

184
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,146
Right?

185
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:52,781
Are you going up?

186
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,492
I'm right where I want to be.

187
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:56,869
Okay. Hey.

188
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,333
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

189
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,127
I work for the State Department.

190
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,546
Human Resources.

191
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,174
I know it's boring...

192
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,468
but it enabled me to raise a son.

193
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,181
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

194
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,768
His name was Charlie Spencer.

195
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,272
You murdered him.

196
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,775
In Sokovia.

197
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,530
Not that that matters in the least to you.

198
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,201
You think you fight for us?

199
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,662
You just fight for yourself.

200
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,292
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

201
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,545
He's dead...

202
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,714
and I blame you.

203
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,726
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...

204
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,686
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...

205
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,730
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.

206
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,900
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...

207
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,985
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.

208
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,197
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...

209
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,117
not only because of the actions
of criminals...

210
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,913
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.

211
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,333
Victory at the
expense of the innocent...

212
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,752
is no victory at all.

213
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,462
The Wakandan king went on to...

214
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:33,841
They are operating outside and
above the international law.

215
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,802
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.

216
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,931
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...

217
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,391
to operate in Nigeri...?

218
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,272
It's my fault.

219
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,607
-That's not true.
-Turn the TV back on.

220
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,943
They're being very specific.

221
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,697
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.

222
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,283
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

223
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,787
and all of a sudden I was
a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn.

224
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,585
And people died.

225
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:12,796
It's on me.

226
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,048
It's on both of us.

227
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,509
This job...

228
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,472
We try to save
as many people as we can.

229
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,142
Sometimes
that doesn't mean everybody.

230
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,311
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

231
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:29,354
then next time...

232
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,441
maybe nobody gets saved.

233
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,655
Vis! We talked about this.

234
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,450
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

235
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,288
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr. Stark was arriving.

236
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,831
Thank you. We'll be right down.

237
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,792
I'll use the door.

238
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,795
And apparently, he's brought a guest.

239
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,631
We know who it is?

240
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,508
The Secretary of State.

241
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,513
Five years ago...

242
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,723
I had a heart attack...

243
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,018
and dropped right in the middle
of my backswing.

244
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,271
Turned out it was the best round
of my life...

245
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:15,359
because after 13 hours of surgery
and a triple bypass...

246
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:20,072
I found something 40 years in the Army
had never taught me.

247
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:21,949
Perspective.

248
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,038
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

249
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,792
You have fought for us...

250
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,045
protected us, risked your lives...

251
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,383
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

252
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,385
there are some...

253
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,763
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

254
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,224
What word would you use,
Mr. Secretary?

255
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,600
How about "dangerous"?

256
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:54,398
What would you call a group of
US-based, enhanced individuals...

257
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,234
who routinely
ignore sovereign borders...

258
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,238
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

259
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,867
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?

260
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,373
New York.

261
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,972
Washington, D.C.

262
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,565
Sokovia.

263
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,285
Lagos.

264
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,421
Okay. That's enough.

265
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,176
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...

266
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,053
and no supervision.

267
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:10,057
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.

268
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,062
But I think we have a solution.

269
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,151
The Sokovia Accords.

270
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,571
Approved by 117 countries...

271
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:30,077
it states that the Avengers shall
no longer be a private organization.

272
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,453
Instead...

273
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:35,958
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...

274
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:40,379
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

275
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,508
The Avengers were formed
to make the world a safer place.

276
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,176
I feel we've done that.

277
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:50,389
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

278
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,226
If I misplaced
a couple of 30 megaton nukes...

279
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,728
you can bet there'd be consequences.

280
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:01,400
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

281
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,444
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

282
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,198
So, there are contingencies.

283
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,285
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

284
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,453
to ratify the Accords.

285
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,207
Talk it over.

286
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,462
And if we come to a decision
you don't like?

287
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,175
Then you retire.

288
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,324
Hello?

289
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,286
Is this your car out front?

290
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,664
I jumped the curb.

291
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,250
Maybe we could...

292
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,419
take care of it ourselves.

293
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,671
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

294
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,215
-I guess.
-No.

295
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,885
No cops.

296
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:10,802
Thank you.

297
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,676
You have kept your looks, Colonel.

298
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:52,344
Congratulations.

299
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,477
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."

300
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,979
Who are you?

301
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,107
My name is Zemo.

302
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,485
I will repeat my question.

303
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:13,991
Mission report, December 16, 1991.

304
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,951
How did you find me?

305
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,036
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

306
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,665
Black Widow released HYDRA files
to the public.

307
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:26,336
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.

308
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,508
But, I have experience.

309
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,011
And patience.

310
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,431
A man can do anything if he has those.

311
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,683
What do you want?

312
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,853
Mission report.

313
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,855
December 16.

314
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,440
1991.

315
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,569
Go... to... hell!

316
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,044
HYDRA deserves
its place on the ash heap.

317
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,214
So your death would not bother me.

318
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,716
But I'd have to use this book...

319
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:16,428
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

320
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,515
I don't look forward to that.

321
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,601
You'd only be dying for...

322
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,144
your pride.

323
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,745
Hail HYDRA.

324
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:55,300
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honor...

325
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,552
which is one more than you have.

326
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,470
So let's say we agree to this thing.

327
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,596
How long is it gonna be

328
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,765
before they LoJack us
like a bunch of common criminals?

329
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,059
117 countries want to sign this.

330
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:06,270
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."

331
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,855
How long are you going to play
both sides?

332
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,231
I have an equation.

333
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,275
Oh, this will clear it up.

334
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,945
In the eight years since Mr. Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...

335
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:18,532
the number of known enhanced
persons has grown exponentially.

336
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,451
During the same period...

337
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,912
the number of
potentially world-ending events

338
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,455
has risen at a commensurate rate.

339
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,790
Are you saying it's our fault?

340
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,751
I'm saying there may be a causality.

341
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,506
Our very strength invites challenge.

342
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,301
Challenge incites conflict.

343
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,136
And conflict...

344
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,140
breeds catastrophe.

345
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,600
Oversight...

346
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,855
Oversight is not an idea
that can be dismissed out of hand.

347
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,023
Boom.

348
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,150
Tony.

349
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,986
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.

350
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,237
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

351
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,281
Boy, you know me so well.

352
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,951
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

353
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,580
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

354
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,249
It's discomfort.

355
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,335
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

356
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,796
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

357
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,181
That's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.

358
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:27,684
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

359
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,437
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

360
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:33,148
But first, he wanted to put a few miles
on his soul...

361
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,943
before he parked it behind a desk.
See the world.

362
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,528
Maybe be of service.

363
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,197
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas
or Fort Lauderdale,

364
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,323
which is what I would do.

365
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,201
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

366
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,078
He decided to spend his summer

367
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,871
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

368
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,414
Guess where. Sokovia.

369
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,545
He wanted to make a difference,
I suppose.

370
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:55,629
We won't know

371
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,257
because we dropped a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

372
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,184
There's no decision-making
process here.

373
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,062
We need to be put in check!

374
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,731
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

375
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,067
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...

376
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,278
we're no better than the bad guys.

377
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,989
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.

378
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:22,739
Who said we're giving up?

379
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,534
We are if we're not taking responsibility
for our actions.

380
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,452
This document just shifts the blame.

381
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,329
I'm sorry, Steve.

382
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,081
That is dangerously arrogant.

383
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,083
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

384
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:37,045
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.

385
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,840
No, but it's run by people with agendas,
and agendas change.

386
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,800
That's good. That's why I'm here.

387
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:44,636
When I realized what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

388
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,263
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

389
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,807
Tony, you chose to do that.

390
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:51,768
If we sign this,
we surrender our right to choose.

391
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,105
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

392
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,691
What if there is somewhere
we need to go and they don't let us?

393
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:01,236
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.

394
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,699
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.

395
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,701
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

396
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,495
-You're saying they'll come for me.
-We would protect you.

397
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,372
Maybe Tony's right.

398
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:18,128
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...

399
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,296
Aren't you the same woman

400
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,507
who told the government
to kiss her ass a few years ago?

401
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,009
I'm just reading the terrain.

402
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,471
We have made
some very public mistakes.

403
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,640
We need to win their trust back.

404
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,975
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

405
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,102
-or did you agree with me?
-I want to take it back now.

406
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:35,062
No, you can't retract it.

407
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,439
Thank you. Unprecedented.

408
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,484
Okay. Case closed. I win.

409
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,237
I have to go.

410
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,283
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

411
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,701
to come up and say a few words.

412
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,676
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

413
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,596
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

414
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:54,892
She had a photograph in her office.

415
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,978
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

416
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,898
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

417
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,442
But it was a lot to live up to.

418
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,986
Which is why I never told anyone
we were related.

419
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:11,700
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...

420
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:16,038
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.

421
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,332
She said, compromise where you can.

422
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,503
But where you can't, don't.

423
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,926
Even if everyone is telling you that
something wrong is something right.

424
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,346
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

425
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,099
it is your duty
to plant yourself like a tree...

426
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:40,729
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

427
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:57,120
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.

428
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,998
Then I found out she was alive.

429
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,501
I was just lucky to have her.

430
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,461
She had you back, too.

431
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,465
Who else signed?

432
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:12,135
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

433
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,054
Clint?

434
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:16,431
Says he's retired.

435
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,308
-Wanda?
-TBD.

436
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,728
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

437
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,523
There's plenty of room on the jet.

438
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,237
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

439
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,657
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

440
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,702
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

441
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,663
What are we giving up to do it?

442
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,168
I'm sorry, Nat.

443
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,004
I can't sign it.

444
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,339
I know.

445
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,342
Then what are you doing here?

446
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,390
I didn't want you to be alone.

447
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,440
Come here.

448
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,823
At a special
United Nations conference...

449
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:20,287
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

450
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,084
-Excuse me, Ms. Romanoff?
-Yes?

451
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,711
These need your signature.

452
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,589
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

453
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,968
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.

454
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,305
It's not always so flattering.

455
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,807
You seem to be doing all right so far.

456
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,352
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

457
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:47,397
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.

458
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,607
Well, I'm not.

459
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,443
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms. Romanoff.

460
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,487
Why? You don't approve of all this?

461
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:56,907
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

462
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,827
Two people in a room
can get more done than a hundred.

463
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,288
Unless you need to move a piano.

464
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,918
-Ms. Romanoff.
-King T'Chaka.

465
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,088
Please, allow me to apologize
for what happened in Nigeria.

466
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,798
Thank you.

467
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,133
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.

468
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,512
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

469
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,930
Yes, so am I.

470
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,433
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.

471
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,477
That is the future calling.

472
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,480
Such a pleasure.

473
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:29,940
Thank you.

474
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:34,903
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,

475
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,489
you're getting quite good at it.

476
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,700
I'm happy, Father.

477
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:45,455
Thank you.

478
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:47,291
Thank you.

479
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:53,547
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...

480
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,593
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.

481
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,596
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

482
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:04,725
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.

483
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:10,230
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

484
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:14,026
We will fight to improve the world
we wish to join.

485
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:18,322
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

486
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,536
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.

487
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:25,662
Everybody get down!

488
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:03,534
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...

489
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:05,160
but not Aunt Peggy.

490
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,412
She bought me my first thigh holster.

491
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,373
Very practical.

492
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:10,958
And stylish.

493
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,007
CIA has you stationed over here now?

494
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,843
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.

495
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,220
Right. Right. Sounds fun.

496
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,305
I know, right?

497
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,227
I've been meaning to ask you.

498
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,564
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

499
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,898
You mean when I was doing my job.

500
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,069
Did Peggy know?

501
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:43,782
She kept so many secrets.

502
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,909
I didn't want her to have one from you.

503
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:51,748
Thanks for walking me back.

504
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,417
Sure.

505
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,088
Steve.

506
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,048
There's something you gotta see.

507
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:01,758
A bomb hidden in a news van...

508
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:02,843
Who's coordinating?

509
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,136
ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.

510
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,179
Good. They're solid. Forensics?

511
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:06,430
More than 70 people
have been injured.

512
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:10,309
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.

513
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:12,394
Officials have released a video
of a suspect...

514
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,938
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...

515
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,440
the Winter Soldier.

516
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,941
The infamous HYDRA agent...

517
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:21,361
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.

518
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,280
I have to go to work.

519
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,955
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.

520
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,458
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.

521
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,969
I'm very sorry.

522
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,353
In my culture...

523
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,356
death is not the end.

524
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,402
It's more of a stepping-off point.

525
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,030
You reach out with both hands...

526
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:09,993
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...

527
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,330
where you can run forever.

528
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,707
That sounds very peaceful.

529
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,336
My father thought so.

530
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,340
I am not my father.

531
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,716
T'Challa...

532
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,678
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

533
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,057
Don't bother, Ms. Romanoff.

534
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,227
I'll kill him myself.

535
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,025
Yeah?

536
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,485
You all right?

537
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,363
Yeah, thanks. I got lucky.

538
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,831
I know how much Barnes means to you.
I really do.

539
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,960
Stay home.
You'll only make this worse.

540
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,670
For all of us.

541
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:02,671
Please.

542
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:03,922
Are you saying you'll arrest me?

543
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,549
No.

544
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,593
Someone will.

545
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:10,012
If you interfere.
That's how it works now.

546
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:13,390
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.

547
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,391
Why?

548
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,311
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

549
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,147
Shit.

550
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,570
She tell you to stay out of it?

551
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:29,239
Might have a point.

552
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:30,699
He'd do it for me.

553
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,201
1945, maybe.

554
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:35,287
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

555
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,457
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.

556
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,587
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

557
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,631
Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier
goes to their gym.

558
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,758
Most of it's noise.

559
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,092
Except for this.

560
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,514
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

561
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,766
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

562
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:56,767
Thank you.

563
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,685
You're gonna have to hurry.

564
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,438
We have orders to shoot on sight.

565
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,572
Homecoming

566
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,283
One

567
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:14,785
One

568
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,042
Freight car

569
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,222
I have your breakfast.

570
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:41,061
I could smell it before I opened the door.

571
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,105
Side of bacon and black coffee.

572
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:43,772
Again.

573
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,316
I can make you something different, if you like.

574
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,150
This is wonderful...

575
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,610
I will just put this on your...

576
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,654
It's okay, I can manage!

577
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:24,998
Heads up, Cap.

578
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:27,376
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.

579
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,378
Understood.

580
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,179
Do you know me?

581
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:43,767
You're Steve.

582
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,937
I read about you in a museum.

583
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,147
They've set the perimeter.

584
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,443
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.

585
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,780
But you're lying.

586
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,992
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

587
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,368
They're entering the building.

588
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,954
The people who think you did
are coming here now.

589
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:05,914
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

590
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,541
That's smart.

591
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:08,792
Good strategy.

592
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:11,837
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.

593
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,800
This doesn't have
to end in a fight, Buck.

594
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,849
-It always ends in a fight.
-Five seconds.

595
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,435
You pulled me from the river.

596
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:27,978
Why?

597
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:30,647
-I don't know.
-Three seconds.

598
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,524
Yes, you do.

599
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:34,943
Breach! Breach! Breach!

600
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,465
Buck, stop!

601
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,300
You're gonna kill someone.

602
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,304
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

603
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,185
Suspect has broken containment!

604
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:51,311
...he's headed down the east stairwell!

605
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:03,657
Come on, man.

606
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:09,973
Sam, southwest rooftop.

607
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:11,475
Who the hell's the other guy?

608
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,893
About to find out.

609
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,324
-Sam.
-Got him.

610
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:10,033
Stand down!

611
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,162
Stand down!

612
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,651
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

613
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:45,986
Right behind you.

614
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:23,125
Stand down, now.

615
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:31,967
Congratulations, Cap.

616
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,136
You're a criminal.

617
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:57,826
Your Highness.

618
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:06,293
"A pinch of paprika."

619
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:07,377
A pinch.

620
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:13,050
Is that paprikash?

621
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,637
I thought it might lift your spirits.

622
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,860
Spirits lifted.

623
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:38,408
In my defense, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...

624
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:39,743
May I?

625
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:40,702
Please.

626
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,169
Wanda?

627
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,296
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

628
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:54,758
Thanks.

629
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,884
You're welcome.

630
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:59,221
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.

631
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,557
They can't help but be afraid of you.

632
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:02,391
Are you?

633
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,685
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

634
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,650
I used to think of myself one way.

635
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,279
But after this...

636
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,614
I am something else.

637
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:21,493
I'm still me, I think, but...

638
00:53:23,495 --> 00:53:26,123
that's not what everyone else sees.

639
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,628
Do you know, I don't know what this is?

640
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,463
Not really.

641
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,632
I know it's not of this world...

642
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:39,469
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...

643
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:44,308
its true nature is a mystery.

644
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,435
And yet, it is part of me.

645
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:47,728
Are you afraid of it?

646
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,856
I wish to understand it.

647
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,192
The more I do, the less it controls me.

648
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:56,236
One day... who knows?

649
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,779
I may even control it.

650
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,328
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

651
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,247
I'm gonna go to the store.

652
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:09,833
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

653
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,253
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

654
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:17,174
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

655
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:20,636
It is a question of safety.

656
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,679
I can protect myself.

657
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,516
Not yours.

658
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:31,688
Mr. Stark would like to avoid the
possibility of another public incident.

659
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:36,360
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

660
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,822
And what do you want?

661
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,367
For people to see you...

662
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,869
as I do.

663
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:19,903
So, you like cats?

664
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,822
-Sam.
-What?

665
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:24,491
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?

666
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,495
Your suit... it's vibranium?

667
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,253
The Black Panther has been the
protector of Wakanda for generations.

668
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,841
A mantle,
passed from warrior to warrior.

669
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:45,053
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

670
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,557
I also wear the mantle of king.

671
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,726
So, I ask you...

672
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,770
as both warrior and king...

673
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:58,859
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

674
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,963
What's gonna happen to him?

675
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:22,049
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

676
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,468
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

677
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,470
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

678
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:28,263
What about a lawyer?

679
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,182
Lawyer. That's funny.

680
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,309
See their weapons are placed in lockup.

681
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,353
We'll write you a receipt.

682
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:38,065
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

683
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,865
You'll be provided with an office
instead of a cell.

684
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:49,076
Now, do me a favor, stay in it?

685
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,662
I don't intend on going anywhere.

686
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:55,791
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.

687
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:57,167
He's alive.

688
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:58,836
No.

689
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,171
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.

690
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,006
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.

691
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,133
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

692
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:07,678
Consequences?
You bet there'll be consequences.

693
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,056
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?

694
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,182
Thank you, sir.

695
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:14,685
"Consequences"?

696
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,353
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

697
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:17,479
Had to give him something.

698
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,064
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

699
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,150
Technically, it's the government's
property. Wings, too.

700
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:23,527
That's cold.

701
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:24,945
Warmer than jail.

702
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,725
Hey, you wanna see something cool?

703
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:57,686
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

704
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:00,522
Felt timely.

705
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:08,322
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

706
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:11,783
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

707
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,994
Some would say it brought our country
closer to war.

708
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,081
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

709
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,377
I'm trying to... What do you call it?

710
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,379
That's an olive branch.

711
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,715
Is that what you call it?

712
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:30,677
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

713
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,139
We're kinda...

714
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,433
-Well, not kinda...
-Pregnant?

715
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,435
No. Definitely not.

716
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,437
We're taking a break.

717
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,897
It's nobody's fault.

718
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:44,942
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

719
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:48,612
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

720
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,573
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

721
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,076
and then Ultron. My fault.

722
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,454
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

723
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,998
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

724
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,460
I don't wanna lose her.

725
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:06,296
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

726
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,969
In her defense, I'm a handful.

727
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:17,599
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.

728
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,059
I'm glad Howard got married.

729
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,895
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

730
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.

731
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:28,151
Maybe only a thousand times.

732
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:30,237
God, I hated you.

733
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:33,824
I don't mean to make things difficult.

734
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:36,201
I know,
because you're a very polite person.

735
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,162
If I see a situation pointed south...

736
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:41,623
I can't ignore it.

737
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,000
Sometimes I wish I could.

738
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,293
No, you don't.

739
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:49,214
No, I don't.

740
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,591
Sometimes...

741
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,677
Sometimes I wanna punch you
in your perfect teeth.

742
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:55,846
But I don't wanna see you gone.

743
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,223
We need you, Cap.

744
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:02,477
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

745
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,521
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

746
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,982
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-center...

747
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:09,026
instead of a Wakandan prison.

748
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,206
I'm not saying it's impossible...

749
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,458
but there would have to be safeguards.

750
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:25,792
Sure.

751
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:29,546
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.

752
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,548
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

753
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,634
Wanda? What about Wanda?

754
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:35,385
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

755
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,762
Vision's keeping her company.

756
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:37,888
Oh, God, Tony.

757
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,390
Every time I think
you see things the right way...

758
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,809
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.

759
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:44,937
-There's worse ways to protect people.
-Protection?

760
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,898
Is that how you see this?
This is protection?

761
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:48,982
It's internment, Tony.

762
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:50,567
-She's not a US citizen.
-Come on, Tony.

763
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,194
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

764
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:52,945
She's a kid!

765
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,655
Give me a break!

766
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,908
I'm doing what has to be done.

767
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,743
To stave off something worse.

768
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:04,790
You keep telling yourself that.

769
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:09,253
Hate to break up the set.

770
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:18,554
Hello, Mr. Barnes.

771
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:21,598
I've been sent by the United Nations
to evaluate you.

772
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,934
Do you mind if I sit?

773
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,607
Your first name is James?

774
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:33,944
The receipt for your gear.

775
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,614
"Bird costume"? Come on.

776
01:01:37,656 --> 01:01:39,408
I didn't write it.

777
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:46,999
I'm not here to judge you.

778
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:48,917
I just want to ask you a few questions.

779
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,963
Do you know where you are, James?

780
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,802
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me, James.

781
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,805
My name is Bucky.

782
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:11,815
Hello?

783
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:19,990
Hey!

784
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,388
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?

785
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,974
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

786
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:49,061
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

787
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:51,188
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

788
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:53,398
Get seven billion people
looking for the Winter Soldier.

789
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:55,400
You're saying someone framed him
to find him?

790
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:57,653
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.

791
01:02:57,694 --> 01:02:59,988
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

792
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:02,449
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.

793
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,368
It guarantees that we would.

794
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:11,291
Yeah.

795
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,671
Tell me, Bucky.

796
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,340
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

797
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:21,718
I don't wanna talk about it.

798
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:26,557
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.

799
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:31,728
Don't worry.

800
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,401
We only have to talk about one.

801
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,343
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

802
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,722
Friday, get me a source on that outage.

803
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:10,058
Sub-level five, East Wing.

804
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:15,105
What the hell is this?

805
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:16,940
Why don't we discuss your home?

806
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:20,068
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

807
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:24,865
I mean your real home.

808
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:31,955
Longing

809
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:33,707
No.

810
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:35,876
Rusted

811
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:36,835
Stop.

812
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:38,670
Seventeen

813
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:42,007
Stop.

814
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:44,968
Daybreak

815
01:04:51,642 --> 01:04:52,142
Furnace

816
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:56,104
Nine

817
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:00,484
Benign

818
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,489
Homecoming

819
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,157
One

820
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,660
Freight car

821
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:27,386
Soldier?

822
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,640
Ready to comply.

823
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:38,230
Mission report.
December 16, 1991.

824
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:49,867
Help me.

825
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:51,493
Help.

826
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:55,539
Get up.

827
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,794
Who are you? What do you want?

828
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:04,214
To see an empire fall.

829
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,289
Hey.

830
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:45,547
Evac all civilians.

831
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,758
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.

832
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,510
Please tell me you brought a suit.

833
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:52,095
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.

834
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:53,805
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.

835
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:55,766
Follow me.

836
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:13,492
We're in position.

837
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,068
You could at least recognize me.

838
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:42,413
Damn it.

839
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,972
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.

840
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:23,974
I said I wasn't sure.

841
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,894
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?

842
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,438
I'm going to bed.

843
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:30,856
I love you.

844
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:38,780
James Barnes the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing...

845
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,365
...escaped custody today.

846
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:43,619
...also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

847
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:44,661
and Sam Wilson.

848
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:09,770
Hey, Cap!

849
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:23,492
Steve.

850
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,870
Which Bucky am I talking to?

851
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,582
Your mom's name was Sarah.

852
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:37,965
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

853
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,551
Can't read that in a museum.

854
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:42,427
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

855
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:44,221
What did I do?

856
01:11:44,388 --> 01:11:45,138
Enough.

857
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:47,057
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.

858
01:11:47,224 --> 01:11:49,685
Everything HYDRA put inside me
is still there.

859
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:51,687
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

860
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:53,564
-Who was he?
-I don't know.

861
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,649
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

862
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,235
the doctor did all that
just to get 10 minutes with you.

863
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:00,112
I need you to do better than
"I don't know."

864
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:06,493
He wanted to know about Siberia.

865
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,873
Where I was kept.

866
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:14,501
He wanted to know exactly where.

867
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:16,920
Why would he need to know that?

868
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:22,009
Because I'm not
the only Winter Soldier.

869
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:16,647
It hurts!

870
01:13:54,184 --> 01:13:55,394
Good work.

871
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,948
Get me out of here.

872
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:23,213
Who were they?

873
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:24,840
Their most elite death squad.

874
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:27,050
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

875
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:28,552
And that was before the serum.

876
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,096
-They all turn out like you?
-Worse.

877
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:33,557
The doctor, could he control them?

878
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:36,018
Enough.

879
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,895
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

880
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,771
With these guys, he could do it.

881
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,399
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

882
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,735
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.

883
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,737
They can take a whole country down
in one night,

884
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:47,863
you'd never see them coming.

885
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:52,618
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

886
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:55,370
-If we call Tony...
-No, he won't believe us.

887
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:56,496
Even if he did...

888
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,332
Who knows
if the Accords would let him help.

889
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,751
We're on our own.

890
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,003
Maybe not.

891
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,673
I know a guy.

892
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:10,761
I don't suppose you have any idea
where they are?

893
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:11,678
We will.

894
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:15,349
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.

895
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:16,767
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

896
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:18,936
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

897
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:21,438
It's clear you can't be objective.

898
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,023
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

899
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,566
What happens
when the shooting starts?

900
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:25,776
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

901
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:27,110
If we're provoked.

902
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:30,614
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

903
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:34,576
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

904
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:37,538
Feel free to check my math.

905
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:40,374
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.

906
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:41,792
You gotta let us bring them in.

907
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,836
How would that end any differently
than last time?

908
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:46,797
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.

909
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:49,883
72 hours, guaranteed.

910
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,885
36 hours.

911
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,721
Barnes.

912
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:57,599
Rogers.

913
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,309
Wilson.

914
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:01,395
Thank you, sir.

915
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:06,733
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

916
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,489
-You all right?
-Always.

917
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,954
36 hours. Jeez.

918
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:21,164
We're seriously understaffed.

919
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:22,332
Oh, yeah.

920
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:25,544
It'd be great if we had a Hulk
right about now. Any shot?

921
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:30,174
You really think he'd be on our side?

922
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,341
No.

923
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:32,801
I have an idea.

924
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:35,262
Me, too. Where's yours?

925
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,347
Downstairs.

926
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:38,557
Where's yours?

927
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:02,039
Hey, May.

928
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,290
Hey.

929
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:07,252
How was school today?

930
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:08,712
It was okay.

931
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:11,048
This crazy car parked outside.

932
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:15,344
Mr. Parker.

933
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,682
What are you doing...

934
01:17:20,724 --> 01:17:22,518
Hey! I'm Peter.

935
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:23,936
Tony.

936
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:25,938
What are you doing here?

937
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:29,233
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?

938
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,943
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Right?

939
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:33,278
-Regarding the...
-You didn't even tell me about the grant.

940
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:35,072
-About the grant.
-The September Foundation.

941
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:36,156
-Right.
-Yeah.

942
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,408
-Remember when you applied?
-Yeah.

943
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:41,036
I approved, so now we're in business.

944
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,747
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

945
01:17:43,914 --> 01:17:44,873
You keeping secrets from me now?

946
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,917
I just know
how much you love surprises

947
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,836
so I thought I would let you know...

948
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,172
-Anyway, what did I apply for?
-That's what I'm here to hash out.

949
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:53,715
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

950
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:56,552
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

951
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:58,929
Yeah, we come in all shapes and sizes,
you know?

952
01:17:59,429 --> 01:18:01,598
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

953
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:02,975
-Let me just stop you there.
-Yeah.

954
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:07,104
Is this grant got money involved
or whatever? No?

955
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:09,648
-Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
-Yeah? Wow.

956
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:11,441
Look who you're talking to.

957
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,569
-Can I have five minutes with him?
-Sure.

958
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,786
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

959
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,957
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech?

960
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:28,834
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

961
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:30,961
-The garbage, actually.
-You're a dumpster diver?

962
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:32,254
Yeah, I was...

963
01:18:32,296 --> 01:18:35,424
Anyway, look, I definitely did not
apply for your grant...

964
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:37,176
-Me first.
-Okay.

965
01:18:37,259 --> 01:18:39,761
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

966
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:43,056
That's you, right?

967
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:44,433
No.

968
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,143
-What do you mean?
-Yeah.

969
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,812
Look at you go.

970
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:52,107
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

971
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:54,985
That's not easy.
You got mad skills.

972
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:58,655
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?

973
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,824
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.

974
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:04,453
-It's like that video. What is it?
-Yeah.

975
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,371
You mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

976
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,331
Exactly.

977
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:08,999
What have we here?

978
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,010
You're the Spider-ling.

979
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:22,054
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

980
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,850
Spider-Man.

981
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:28,727
Not in that onesie, you're not.

982
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:31,188
It's not a onesie.

983
01:19:32,606 --> 01:19:33,607
I don't believe this.

984
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,859
I was actually having
a really good day today, Mr. Stark.

985
01:19:35,943 --> 01:19:39,071
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

986
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,366
and Algebra test, nailed it.

987
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,660
Who else knows? Anybody?

988
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:47,329
Nobody.

989
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,831
Not even
your unusually attractive aunt?

990
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,250
No. No.

991
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,044
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

992
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:55,879
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

993
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:58,048
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.

994
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:03,178
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?

995
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,721
I did.

996
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:07,391
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

997
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:08,892
Adhesive gloves?

998
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:10,227
It's a long story. I was...

999
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:13,230
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1000
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:14,398
Yes, I can.

1001
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:15,607
I'm blind!

1002
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:18,110
I can see in those.

1003
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:19,111
Okay?

1004
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,738
It's just that when whatever happened,
happened...

1005
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,074
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1006
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:28,954
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1007
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,498
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1008
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:34,042
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1009
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:35,127
That's why I'm here.

1010
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,131
Why you doing this?

1011
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,592
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1012
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,177
What gets you outta that twin bed
in the morning?

1013
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:45,596
Because...

1014
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,602
Because I've been me my whole life,

1015
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,312
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1016
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:57,482
I read books, I build computers.

1017
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:03,071
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1018
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,698
-Sure, because you're different.
-Exactly.

1019
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:07,284
But I can't tell anybody that,
so I'm not.

1020
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:15,792
When you can do the things that I can,
but you don't...

1021
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:20,214
and then the bad things happen...

1022
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:22,758
they happen because of you.

1023
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:29,973
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1024
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,434
Make the world a better place,
all that, right?

1025
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:35,145
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1026
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,731
That's what it is.

1027
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,157
I'm gonna sit here,
so you move the leg.

1028
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,836
-You got a passport?
-No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1029
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,420
-You ever been to Germany?
-No.

1030
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:01,505
You'll love it.

1031
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:03,549
-I can't go to Germany.
-Why?

1032
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:07,302
I got homework.

1033
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,972
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1034
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,015
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1035
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:13,267
Might be a little dangerous.

1036
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,227
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1037
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:19,898
Don't tell Aunt May.

1038
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:21,859
All right, Spider-Man.

1039
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:26,780
Get me out of this.

1040
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:27,906
Sorry. I'll get the...

1041
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,171
What is it?

1042
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:43,630
Stay here, please.

1043
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:51,722
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1044
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:55,350
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

1045
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:57,936
Disappointing my kids.

1046
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,066
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1047
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:05,402
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1048
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:06,737
Clint!

1049
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:09,990
You should not be here.

1050
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:13,577
Really?

1051
01:23:14,077 --> 01:23:17,206
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1052
01:23:17,331 --> 01:23:19,583
Please consider the consequences
of your actions.

1053
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,709
Okay, they're considered.

1054
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:23,712
Okay, we gotta go.

1055
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,259
It's this way.

1056
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:31,637
I've caused enough problems.

1057
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:37,768
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1058
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,728
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1059
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,855
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1060
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:43,440
Shit.

1061
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:52,115
I knew I should've stretched.

1062
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:08,257
Clint, you can't overpower me.

1063
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,259
I know I can't.

1064
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:12,469
But she can.

1065
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:17,099
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1066
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:18,976
I'm leaving.

1067
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:20,185
I can't let you.

1068
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:26,608
I'm sorry.

1069
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,905
If you do this...

1070
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:35,409
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1071
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:40,205
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1072
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:58,098
Come on. We got one more stop.

1073
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:00,559
It's just a matter of time.

1074
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,353
Our satellites are
running facial, biometric,

1075
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:05,189
and behavioral pattern scans.

1076
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:12,029
Move or you will be moved.

1077
01:25:13,197 --> 01:25:16,033
As entertaining as that would be...

1078
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:18,202
You really think you can find him?

1079
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:20,412
My resources are considerable.

1080
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:22,956
Yeah, it took the world 70 years
to find Barnes...

1081
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,459
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1082
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,462
You know where they are.

1083
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:30,547
I know someone who does.

1084
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:35,886
Not sure you understand the concept
of a getaway car.

1085
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:36,970
It's low profile.

1086
01:25:37,596 --> 01:25:40,390
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1087
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:43,727
Can you move your seat up?

1088
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:45,103
No.

1089
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:46,271
I owe you again.

1090
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,482
Keeping a list.

1091
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,362
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1092
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,990
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1093
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:02,663
They're going to come looking for you.

1094
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:03,539
I know.

1095
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,751
Thank you, Sharon.

1096
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,602
-That was...
-Late.

1097
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:26,436
Damn right.

1098
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:33,151
-I should go.
-Okay.

1099
01:26:57,759 --> 01:26:58,927
Cap.

1100
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:01,305
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

1101
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:02,764
Hey, man, you're doing me a favor.

1102
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,392
Besides, I owe a debt.

1103
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:07,102
Thanks for having my back.

1104
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:08,645
It was time to get off my ass.

1105
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,814
How about our other recruit?

1106
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:12,608
He's rarin' to go.

1107
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,610
Had to put a little coffee in him...

1108
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:17,070
but he should be good.

1109
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,075
What time zone is this?

1110
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,994
Come on. Come on.

1111
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,081
Captain America!

1112
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:28,999
Mr. Lang.

1113
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:31,126
It's an honor.

1114
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:33,462
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1115
01:27:33,504 --> 01:27:34,838
Wow! This is awesome!

1116
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:37,508
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

1117
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:42,304
Jeez.

1118
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:46,391
Look, I wanna say, I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1119
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:49,353
thinks for thanking of me.

1120
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:51,230
-Hey, man!
-What's up, Tic Tac?

1121
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:54,066
Good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...

1122
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:57,361
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1123
01:27:57,528 --> 01:27:59,905
They tell you what we're up against?

1124
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:03,367
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1125
01:28:03,534 --> 01:28:05,536
We're outside the law on this one.

1126
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:07,579
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1127
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:09,665
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1128
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:10,666
We should get moving.

1129
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:12,584
We got a chopper lined up.

1130
01:28:17,214 --> 01:28:18,966
They're evacuating the airport.

1131
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:20,300
Stark.

1132
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:21,051
Stark?

1133
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,221
Suit up.

1134
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:46,994
Wow, it's so weird
how you run into people at the airport.

1135
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,871
-Don't you think that's weird?
-Definitely weird.

1136
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:50,163
Hear me out, Tony.

1137
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:53,417
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1138
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:57,754
Captain.

1139
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:58,755
Your Highness.

1140
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:00,424
Anyway...

1141
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:03,010
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1142
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:06,054
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1143
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:07,598
You're after the wrong guy.

1144
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,766
Your judgment is askew.

1145
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,394
Your old war buddy
killed innocent people yesterday.

1146
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:15,397
And there are five more super soldiers
just like him.

1147
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,025
I can't let the doctor find them first,
Tony. I can't.

1148
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:19,067
Steve...

1149
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:22,279
you know what's about to happen.

1150
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:24,740
Do you really wanna punch your way
out of this one?

1151
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,787
All right, I've run out of patience.

1152
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,872
Underoos!

1153
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:38,712
Nice job, kid.

1154
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:39,588
Thanks.

1155
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,632
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1156
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,717
New suit.
It's nothing, Mr. Stark.

1157
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,885
It's perfect. Thank you.

1158
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:46,720
Yeah, we don't really
need to start a conversation.

1159
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:47,971
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1160
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:50,474
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1161
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:51,475
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.

1162
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:53,519
-Hey, everyone.
-Good job.

1163
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:54,978
You've been busy.

1164
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:57,272
And you've been a complete idiot.

1165
01:29:57,397 --> 01:29:58,232
Dragging in Clint...

1166
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,817
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place
she doesn't even want to leave,

1167
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,152
a safe place.

1168
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:03,570
I'm trying to keep...

1169
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,824
I'm trying to keep you
from tearing the Avengers apart.

1170
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:10,577
You did that when you signed.

1171
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:12,746
All right, we're done.

1172
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:16,208
You're gonna turn Barnes over,
you're gonna come with us, now,

1173
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,292
because it's us...

1174
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:19,211
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1175
01:30:19,378 --> 01:30:21,964
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1176
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,092
Come on.

1177
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:27,845
We found it.

1178
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:31,223
Their Quinjet's in hangar five,
north runway.

1179
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:36,061
All right, Lang.

1180
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:38,522
Hey, guys, something...

1181
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,941
What the hell was that?

1182
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,193
I believe this is yours,
Captain America.

1183
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:44,361
Oh, great.

1184
01:30:44,444 --> 01:30:45,696
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1185
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,197
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1186
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:48,866
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?

1187
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:51,034
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.

1188
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:51,994
Barnes is mine.

1189
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,955
Mr. Stark, what should I do?

1190
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:56,957
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.

1191
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:58,292
Okay, copy that.

1192
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:04,840
Move, Captain.

1193
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:06,592
I won't ask a second time.

1194
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,387
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

1195
01:31:11,054 --> 01:31:12,389
I wouldn't stress about it.

1196
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,069
What the hell is that?

1197
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:28,197
Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1198
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,163
You have a metal arm?

1199
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:37,831
That is awesome, dude.

1200
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,001
You have the right to remain silent!

1201
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:57,142
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...

1202
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,435
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1203
01:32:03,857 --> 01:32:05,901
Wanda, I think
you hurt Vision's feelings.

1204
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:07,402
You locked me in my room.

1205
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:08,987
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.

1206
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:11,490
Second, I did it to protect you.

1207
01:32:11,657 --> 01:32:12,908
-Hey, Clint.
-Hey, man.

1208
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:14,785
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.

1209
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:16,453
You got tired of shooting golf?

1210
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,956
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1211
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:21,083
Just can't seem to miss.

1212
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,128
First time for everything.

1213
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,129
Made you look.

1214
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:38,392
Multiple contusions detected.

1215
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:40,269
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1216
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:49,152
Oh, God!

1217
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:52,072
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1218
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:07,004
-Those wings carbon fiber?
-Is this stuff coming out of you?

1219
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,839
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1220
01:33:08,881 --> 01:33:10,174
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.

1221
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,092
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1222
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:13,677
but there's usually
not this much talking.

1223
01:33:13,844 --> 01:33:14,887
All right, sorry. My bad.

1224
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:23,437
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...

1225
01:33:23,604 --> 01:33:26,940
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1226
01:33:30,194 --> 01:33:32,196
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1227
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:33,864
I hate you.

1228
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:41,371
Great.

1229
01:33:41,538 --> 01:33:43,081
Hey, Cap, heads-up!

1230
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,043
Throw it at this.

1231
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,711
Now!

1232
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:52,508
Oh, come on!

1233
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:58,222
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.

1234
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:00,307
Sorry.

1235
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:03,727
All right, now I'm pissed.

1236
01:34:04,603 --> 01:34:06,063
Is this part of the plan?

1237
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,899
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?

1238
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:12,236
There's our ride.

1239
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:15,739
Come on!

1240
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:25,832
Captain Rogers...

1241
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:29,837
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1242
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:32,422
But for the collective good...

1243
01:34:32,589 --> 01:34:34,925
you must surrender now.

1244
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,652
What do we do, Cap?

1245
01:34:54,695 --> 01:34:56,363
We fight.

1246
01:34:57,781 --> 01:34:59,366
This is gonna end well.

1247
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:07,541
They're not stopping.

1248
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:08,458
Neither are we.

1249
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:40,824
We're still friends, right?

1250
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:42,492
Depends on how hard you hit me.

1251
01:35:51,335 --> 01:35:53,253
You were pulling your punches.

1252
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:59,009
I didn't kill your father.

1253
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:01,178
Then why did you run?

1254
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,031
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1255
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:22,991
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1256
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:24,868
Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.

1257
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:36,380
He also said to go for your legs.

1258
01:36:48,225 --> 01:36:49,476
Clint, can you get him off me?

1259
01:36:49,643 --> 01:36:50,894
Buckled in?

1260
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:52,521
Yeah. No, I'm good.

1261
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:54,565
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!

1262
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:17,713
Stark tell you anything else?

1263
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,049
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1264
01:37:21,091 --> 01:37:22,593
That makes you dangerous.

1265
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:29,057
Guess he had a point.

1266
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:36,231
You got heart, kid. Where you from?

1267
01:37:37,274 --> 01:37:38,108
Queens.

1268
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:41,278
Brooklyn.

1269
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:47,701
Friday?

1270
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:49,119
We have
some weapon systems offline.

1271
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,204
What?

1272
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,789
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.

1273
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:54,291
Who's speaking?

1274
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:58,253
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.

1275
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,839
-Friday?
-Deploying fire suppression system.

1276
01:38:04,885 --> 01:38:05,886
Oh, boy!

1277
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:17,314
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1278
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:18,982
We gotta draw out the flyers.

1279
01:38:19,024 --> 01:38:20,943
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.

1280
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,653
No, you get to the jet!

1281
01:38:22,819 --> 01:38:23,612
Both of you!

1282
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,533
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1283
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:28,742
As much as I hate to admit it...

1284
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:32,162
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.

1285
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:34,206
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1286
01:38:34,373 --> 01:38:36,041
All right, Sam. What's the play?

1287
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,335
We need a diversion. Something big.

1288
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:41,672
I got something kinda big.

1289
01:38:41,755 --> 01:38:43,131
But I can't hold it very long.

1290
01:38:43,507 --> 01:38:45,634
On my signal, run like hell.

1291
01:38:45,759 --> 01:38:47,094
And if I tear myself in half...

1292
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:48,345
don't come back for me.

1293
01:38:48,387 --> 01:38:49,346
He's gonna tear himself in half?

1294
01:38:49,513 --> 01:38:51,014
You sure about this, Scott?

1295
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,599
I do it all the time.

1296
01:38:52,766 --> 01:38:54,643
I mean, once. In a lab.

1297
01:38:54,768 --> 01:38:56,395
Then I passed out.

1298
01:38:56,562 --> 01:38:58,355
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.

1299
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:16,039
Holy shit!

1300
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:22,212
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1301
01:39:24,214 --> 01:39:25,382
I guess that's the signal.

1302
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:27,009
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1303
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:30,345
Give me back my Rhodey.

1304
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,225
I got him.

1305
01:39:57,873 --> 01:39:59,082
Okay, anybody on our side

1306
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:02,169
hiding any shocking and fantastic
abilities they'd like to disclose...

1307
01:40:02,336 --> 01:40:03,462
I'm open to suggestions.

1308
01:40:11,595 --> 01:40:13,222
You wanna get to them...

1309
01:40:13,388 --> 01:40:14,515
you gotta go through me.

1310
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:43,085
We haven't met yet.

1311
01:40:45,587 --> 01:40:46,380
I'm Clint.

1312
01:40:46,505 --> 01:40:47,297
I don't care.

1313
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:15,993
Get off!

1314
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,718
Something just flew in me!

1315
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:57,784
You're not gonna stop.

1316
01:41:58,619 --> 01:41:59,620
You know I can't.

1317
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:01,705
I'm gonna regret this.

1318
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:06,668
Go.

1319
01:42:12,216 --> 01:42:16,386
Hey, guys, you ever see that
really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?

1320
01:42:16,637 --> 01:42:17,888
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?

1321
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:20,265
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.

1322
01:42:22,434 --> 01:42:25,437
You know that part where they're
on the snow planet...

1323
01:42:26,772 --> 01:42:28,232
with the walking thingies?

1324
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:31,693
Maybe the kid's onto something.

1325
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:32,778
High now, Tony. Go high.

1326
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:42,329
Yes!

1327
01:42:42,913 --> 01:42:44,456
That was awesome!

1328
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:02,224
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1329
01:43:07,729 --> 01:43:08,730
Kid, you all right?

1330
01:43:10,941 --> 01:43:14,069
Same side. Guess who.
Hi. It's me.

1331
01:43:14,152 --> 01:43:15,279
-Hey, man.
-Yeah.

1332
01:43:15,362 --> 01:43:16,738
-That was scary.
-Yeah.

1333
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,448
You're done, all right?

1334
01:43:18,532 --> 01:43:20,659
-What? I'm good, I'm fine.
-You did a good job. Stay down.

1335
01:43:20,742 --> 01:43:21,952
No, it's good.
I gotta get him back.

1336
01:43:22,035 --> 01:43:22,995
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1337
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,413
-Dude.
-You're done!

1338
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:25,581
Wait.

1339
01:43:25,747 --> 01:43:28,750
Mr. Stark, wait. I'm not done.
I'm not...

1340
01:43:30,961 --> 01:43:33,213
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1341
01:43:49,396 --> 01:43:51,607
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.

1342
01:43:52,191 --> 01:43:53,734
There's a difference.

1343
01:44:00,532 --> 01:44:01,366
I'm sorry.

1344
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:03,285
Me, too.

1345
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,162
It's as I said.

1346
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:07,331
Catastrophe.

1347
01:44:20,344 --> 01:44:22,095
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1348
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:27,851
Vision! You copy?

1349
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,978
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.

1350
01:44:45,244 --> 01:44:46,370
Rhodey!

1351
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:49,957
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1352
01:44:58,131 --> 01:44:58,757
Rhodes!

1353
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:13,480
Read vitals.

1354
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:14,898
Heartbeat detected.

1355
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,942
Emergency medical is on its way.

1356
01:45:22,072 --> 01:45:22,990
I'm sorry.

1357
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:46,638
- this is room 201...

1358
01:45:47,973 --> 01:45:49,641
Bacon and black coffee again today?

1359
01:45:51,018 --> 01:45:52,561
You know me so well...

1360
01:45:54,146 --> 01:45:55,981
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1361
01:45:56,982 --> 01:45:58,025
May I let myself in?

1362
01:46:22,966 --> 01:46:24,676
What's gonna happen to your friends?

1363
01:46:33,185 --> 01:46:34,645
Whatever it is...

1364
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:37,064
I'll deal with it.

1365
01:46:40,108 --> 01:46:41,985
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.

1366
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:51,161
What you did all those years...

1367
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:53,622
It wasn't you.

1368
01:46:54,456 --> 01:46:56,208
You didn't have a choice.

1369
01:46:57,376 --> 01:46:59,002
I know.

1370
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:03,924
But I did it.

1371
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:20,315
How did this happen?

1372
01:47:20,357 --> 01:47:22,359
I became distracted.

1373
01:47:24,695 --> 01:47:26,822
I didn't think that was possible.

1374
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:29,867
Neither did I.

1375
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:49,553
The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1376
01:47:49,636 --> 01:47:52,472
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.

1377
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:55,184
Probably looking
at some form of paralysis.

1378
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,022
Steve's not gonna stop.

1379
01:48:00,856 --> 01:48:03,192
If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1380
01:48:03,358 --> 01:48:04,526
You let them go, Nat.

1381
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:05,819
We played this wrong.

1382
01:48:05,944 --> 01:48:07,237
"We"?

1383
01:48:07,613 --> 01:48:09,823
Boy, it must be hard to
shake the whole double agent thing.

1384
01:48:10,365 --> 01:48:12,075
It sticks in the DNA.

1385
01:48:13,493 --> 01:48:16,163
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1386
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:18,373
for one goddamn second?

1387
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:24,880
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...

1388
01:48:26,215 --> 01:48:27,841
they're coming for you.

1389
01:48:28,884 --> 01:48:32,095
I'm not the one
that needs to watch their back.

1390
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:41,647
What am I looking at, Friday?

1391
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:44,107
Priority upload from Berlin police.

1392
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:48,862
Fire up the chopper.

1393
01:48:54,618 --> 01:48:58,205
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.

1394
01:48:58,330 --> 01:49:00,958
The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard from Geneva

1395
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:02,251
within the hour.

1396
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:04,044
He was met by this man.

1397
01:49:04,127 --> 01:49:06,296
-Did you run facial recognition yet?
-What do I look like?

1398
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,590
I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.

1399
01:49:08,632 --> 01:49:10,300
You must be
thinking of someone else.

1400
01:49:10,384 --> 01:49:11,510
Must be.

1401
01:49:11,635 --> 01:49:14,304
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.

1402
01:49:15,472 --> 01:49:17,641
Sokovian Intelligence.

1403
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,686
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...

1404
01:49:20,811 --> 01:49:23,272
a Sokovian covert kill squad.

1405
01:49:25,524 --> 01:49:27,025
What happened to the real Broussard?

1406
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:28,986
He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.

1407
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:31,905
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...

1408
01:49:32,656 --> 01:49:36,118
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.

1409
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,954
Son of a bitch.

1410
01:49:40,956 --> 01:49:42,875
-Get this to Ross.
-Yes, boss.

1411
01:51:16,552 --> 01:51:21,014
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr. Stark.

1412
01:51:53,463 --> 01:51:55,465
So? You got the files?

1413
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:59,011
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1414
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:01,388
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1415
01:52:01,555 --> 01:52:03,390
after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1416
01:52:03,557 --> 01:52:05,976
You're lucky
you're not in one of these cells.

1417
01:52:36,715 --> 01:52:39,468
The Futurist, gentlemen!

1418
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,054
The Futurist is here!

1419
01:52:42,137 --> 01:52:43,388
He sees all!

1420
01:52:44,431 --> 01:52:47,518
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1421
01:52:48,143 --> 01:52:49,144
Give me a break, Barton.

1422
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:51,855
I had no idea they'd put you here.
Come on.

1423
01:52:52,814 --> 01:52:55,108
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1424
01:52:55,234 --> 01:52:58,445
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.

1425
01:52:58,529 --> 01:53:01,073
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1426
01:53:01,156 --> 01:53:02,407
Criminals?

1427
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:05,452
Criminals, Tony.

1428
01:53:05,953 --> 01:53:08,288
Think that's the word
you're looking for.

1429
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:10,666
Right?

1430
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,418
That didn't used to mean me.

1431
01:53:13,502 --> 01:53:14,962
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1432
01:53:15,128 --> 01:53:16,839
But here we are.

1433
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,632
-Because you broke the law.
-Yeah.

1434
01:53:18,715 --> 01:53:19,758
I didn't make you.

1435
01:53:21,176 --> 01:53:22,719
You read it, you broke it.

1436
01:53:24,304 --> 01:53:26,515
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1437
01:53:26,557 --> 01:53:28,392
I don't understand,
why didn't you think about them

1438
01:53:28,475 --> 01:53:29,935
before you chose the wrong side?

1439
01:53:31,019 --> 01:53:32,938
You gotta watch your back
with this guy.

1440
01:53:34,273 --> 01:53:36,400
There's a chance he's gonna break it.

1441
01:53:37,901 --> 01:53:41,113
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1442
01:53:41,947 --> 01:53:43,365
Who are you?

1443
01:53:44,116 --> 01:53:45,826
Come on, man.

1444
01:53:47,244 --> 01:53:48,287
How's Rhodes?

1445
01:53:48,412 --> 01:53:51,373
They're flying him
to Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1446
01:53:51,415 --> 01:53:52,583
so fingers crossed.

1447
01:53:54,293 --> 01:53:55,836
What do you need? They feed you yet?

1448
01:53:57,921 --> 01:53:59,464
You're the good cop, now?

1449
01:54:00,132 --> 01:54:02,050
I'm just the guy who needs to know
where Steve went.

1450
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:03,760
You better go get a bad cop...

1451
01:54:03,844 --> 01:54:05,929
because you're gonna have to go
Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1452
01:54:06,054 --> 01:54:08,056
to get information out of me.

1453
01:54:08,182 --> 01:54:10,100
I just knocked the A out of their AV.

1454
01:54:10,225 --> 01:54:13,228
We got about 30 seconds before
they realize it's not their equipment.

1455
01:54:14,104 --> 01:54:15,147
What'd you do?

1456
01:54:15,314 --> 01:54:16,857
Get it back up!

1457
01:54:17,941 --> 01:54:18,567
Just look.

1458
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:21,361
Because that...

1459
01:54:21,528 --> 01:54:23,614
is the fellow who was supposed to
interrogate Barnes.

1460
01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:27,910
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1461
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:29,369
That's a first.

1462
01:54:29,453 --> 01:54:31,288
Cap is definitely off the reservation...

1463
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,831
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1464
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:35,709
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...

1465
01:54:35,792 --> 01:54:38,045
Hey, it's all right.

1466
01:54:45,802 --> 01:54:47,513
Look, I'll tell you...

1467
01:54:47,596 --> 01:54:50,641
but you have to go alone
and as a friend.

1468
01:54:52,226 --> 01:54:53,310
Easy.

1469
01:54:56,313 --> 01:54:57,189
Stark?

1470
01:54:57,856 --> 01:54:59,608
Did he give you anything on Rogers?

1471
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:00,609
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1472
01:55:00,692 --> 01:55:04,821
I'm going back to the compound
instead, but you can call me anytime.

1473
01:55:04,905 --> 01:55:06,490
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.

1474
01:56:16,143 --> 01:56:18,645
You remember that time we had to
ride back from Rockaway Beach

1475
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:19,938
in the back of that freezer truck?

1476
01:56:20,022 --> 01:56:23,525
Was that the time we used
our train money to buy hot dogs?

1477
01:56:23,567 --> 01:56:26,778
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1478
01:56:27,487 --> 01:56:28,488
What was her name, again?

1479
01:56:28,655 --> 01:56:30,407
Dolores. You called her Dot.

1480
01:56:30,908 --> 01:56:32,618
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1481
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:33,911
So are we, pal.

1482
01:56:43,712 --> 01:56:45,923
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.

1483
01:56:45,964 --> 01:56:48,383
Long enough to wake them up.

1484
01:57:29,925 --> 01:57:31,260
You ready?

1485
01:57:31,301 --> 01:57:32,302
Yeah.

1486
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:47,901
You seem a little defensive.

1487
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:50,362
It's been a long day.

1488
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:53,156
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1489
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:54,408
Then why are you here?

1490
01:57:55,492 --> 01:57:58,161
Could be your story's not so crazy.

1491
01:57:58,328 --> 01:57:59,162
Maybe.

1492
01:58:00,956 --> 01:58:03,750
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1493
01:58:04,835 --> 01:58:06,837
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.

1494
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:09,673
That sounds like a lot of paperwork.

1495
01:58:13,468 --> 01:58:14,803
It's good to see you, Tony.

1496
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:15,804
You too, Cap.

1497
01:58:17,514 --> 01:58:19,391
Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1498
01:58:19,474 --> 01:58:21,351
There's a truce here. You can drop...

1499
01:58:41,371 --> 01:58:42,831
I got heat signatures.

1500
01:58:42,873 --> 01:58:44,333
How many?

1501
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:47,211
One.

1502
01:59:05,938 --> 01:59:09,816
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.

1503
01:59:16,823 --> 01:59:19,868
Did you really think I wanted
more of you?

1504
01:59:21,078 --> 01:59:22,746
What the hell?

1505
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,374
I'm grateful to them, though.

1506
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:27,918
They brought you here.

1507
01:59:32,714 --> 01:59:34,466
Please, Captain.

1508
01:59:34,633 --> 01:59:36,552
The Soviets built this chamber
to withstand

1509
01:59:36,593 --> 01:59:39,012
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.

1510
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:41,056
I'm betting I could beat that.

1511
01:59:41,098 --> 01:59:42,933
I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark.

1512
01:59:43,433 --> 01:59:44,935
Given time.

1513
01:59:45,435 --> 01:59:47,020
But then you'd never know
why you came.

1514
01:59:47,187 --> 01:59:49,731
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?

1515
01:59:56,530 --> 02:00:00,117
I've thought about nothing else
for over a year.

1516
02:00:00,784 --> 02:00:02,578
I studied you.

1517
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:04,454
I followed you.

1518
02:00:05,372 --> 02:00:06,832
But now that you're standing here...

1519
02:00:06,999 --> 02:00:09,084
I just realized...

1520
02:00:11,211 --> 02:00:13,714
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

1521
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:18,594
How nice to find a flaw.

1522
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:20,762
You're Sokovian.

1523
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:23,432
Is that what this is about?

1524
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:27,102
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.

1525
02:00:27,144 --> 02:00:28,145
No.

1526
02:00:29,688 --> 02:00:32,649
I'm here because I made a promise.

1527
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,029
You lost someone?

1528
02:00:40,949 --> 02:00:42,993
I lost everyone.

1529
02:00:44,828 --> 02:00:46,747
And so will you.

1530
02:00:52,753 --> 02:00:56,340
An empire toppled by its enemies
can rise again.

1531
02:00:57,424 --> 02:00:59,510
But one which crumbles from within?

1532
02:01:01,053 --> 02:01:02,554
That's dead.

1533
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:04,806
Forever.

1534
02:01:13,649 --> 02:01:15,275
I know that road.

1535
02:01:17,569 --> 02:01:18,695
What is this?

1536
02:01:41,969 --> 02:01:43,554
Help my wife.

1537
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:46,974
Please. Help.

1538
02:01:52,563 --> 02:01:53,647
Sergeant Barnes?

1539
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,775
Howard!

1540
02:02:04,283 --> 02:02:05,367
Howard!

1541
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:44,364
No, Tony.

1542
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:54,791
Did you know?

1543
02:02:57,252 --> 02:02:58,587
I didn't know it was him.

1544
02:02:58,712 --> 02:03:01,131
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

1545
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,011
Yes.

1546
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:04,695
Get out of here!

1547
02:04:15,873 --> 02:04:16,623
It wasn't him, Tony.

1548
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,667
-HYDRA had control of his mind!
-Move!

1549
02:04:18,792 --> 02:04:19,835
It wasn't him!

1550
02:04:28,886 --> 02:04:30,304
Left boot jet failing.

1551
02:04:31,138 --> 02:04:33,223
Flight systems compromised.

1552
02:04:34,016 --> 02:04:34,850
Crap.

1553
02:04:48,739 --> 02:04:50,407
He's not gonna stop. Go.

1554
02:05:13,514 --> 02:05:14,515
Come on, come on.

1555
02:05:14,681 --> 02:05:16,308
Targeting system's knackered, boss.

1556
02:05:16,433 --> 02:05:17,267
I'm eyeballing it.

1557
02:05:35,953 --> 02:05:37,621
Do you even remember them?

1558
02:05:37,788 --> 02:05:39,498
I remember all of them.

1559
02:06:02,396 --> 02:06:04,356
This isn't gonna
change what happened.

1560
02:06:04,523 --> 02:06:06,024
I don't care.

1561
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:07,985
He killed my mom.

1562
02:07:09,379 --> 02:07:12,799
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?

1563
02:07:12,883 --> 02:07:14,843
I'm going to bed.

1564
02:07:14,885 --> 02:07:16,553
I love you.

1565
02:07:24,561 --> 02:07:27,022
I almost killed the wrong man.

1566
02:07:28,065 --> 02:07:30,192
Hardly an innocent one.

1567
02:07:30,359 --> 02:07:31,360
This is all you wanted?

1568
02:07:32,986 --> 02:07:35,405
To see them rip each other apart.

1569
02:07:39,368 --> 02:07:42,412
My father lived outside the city.

1570
02:07:42,913 --> 02:07:45,249
I thought we would be safe there.

1571
02:07:45,916 --> 02:07:47,793
My son was excited.

1572
02:07:47,918 --> 02:07:50,754
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1573
02:07:51,755 --> 02:07:55,092
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

1574
02:07:55,175 --> 02:07:59,096
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

1575
02:08:01,431 --> 02:08:03,809
When the dust cleared...

1576
02:08:04,643 --> 02:08:07,020
and the screaming stopped...

1577
02:08:07,729 --> 02:08:11,692
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

1578
02:08:14,027 --> 02:08:15,571
My father...

1579
02:08:16,405 --> 02:08:19,950
still holding my wife and son
in his arms.

1580
02:08:24,413 --> 02:08:26,415
And the Avengers?

1581
02:08:27,416 --> 02:08:29,209
They went home.

1582
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:33,463
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1583
02:08:33,505 --> 02:08:36,008
More powerful men than me have tried.

1584
02:08:38,302 --> 02:08:40,470
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...

1585
02:08:45,017 --> 02:08:47,686
I'm sorry about your father.

1586
02:08:48,228 --> 02:08:50,063
He seemed a good man.

1587
02:08:51,857 --> 02:08:53,400
With a dutiful son.

1588
02:08:58,197 --> 02:08:59,948
Vengeance has consumed you.

1589
02:09:02,659 --> 02:09:04,995
It's consuming them.

1590
02:09:08,916 --> 02:09:11,001
I am done letting it consume me.

1591
02:09:14,713 --> 02:09:17,132
Justice will come soon enough.

1592
02:09:20,385 --> 02:09:22,179
Tell that to the dead.

1593
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:29,436
The living are not done with you, yet.

1594
02:09:32,314 --> 02:09:34,650
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.

1595
02:09:35,901 --> 02:09:37,027
Analyze his fight pattern.

1596
02:09:37,194 --> 02:09:38,487
Scanning.

1597
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:44,326
Countermeasures ready.

1598
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:47,371
Let's kick his ass.

1599
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:02,469
He's my friend.

1600
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,263
So was I.

1601
02:10:11,228 --> 02:10:13,355
Stay down. Final warning.

1602
02:10:27,744 --> 02:10:30,038
I could do this all day.

1603
02:11:36,355 --> 02:11:38,649
That shield doesn't belong to you.

1604
02:11:40,234 --> 02:11:41,944
You don't deserve it.

1605
02:11:41,985 --> 02:11:43,987
My father made that shield!

1606
02:12:19,815 --> 02:12:23,360
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.

1607
02:12:25,779 --> 02:12:27,906
Raise your voice, zap.

1608
02:12:28,615 --> 02:12:30,701
Touch the glass, zap.

1609
02:12:30,868 --> 02:12:33,036
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1610
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:35,372
Please, step out of line.

1611
02:12:37,499 --> 02:12:38,959
So how does it feel?

1612
02:12:39,835 --> 02:12:42,296
To spend all that time,
all that effort...

1613
02:12:45,174 --> 02:12:49,469
to see it fail so spectacularly?

1614
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:54,600
Did it?

1615
02:13:20,918 --> 02:13:22,252
-It's just the first pass.
-Yeah.

1616
02:13:22,336 --> 02:13:24,463
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

1617
02:13:24,546 --> 02:13:27,216
Shock absorption, lateral movement.

1618
02:13:27,841 --> 02:13:28,926
Cup holder?

1619
02:13:29,009 --> 02:13:30,719
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

1620
02:13:34,556 --> 02:13:35,766
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1621
02:13:35,849 --> 02:13:37,518
No. Don't help me.

1622
02:13:53,575 --> 02:13:54,868
138.

1623
02:13:55,702 --> 02:14:00,290
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1624
02:14:00,457 --> 02:14:03,502
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

1625
02:14:05,504 --> 02:14:06,964
Because the fight needed to be fought.

1626
02:14:07,589 --> 02:14:09,174
It's the same with these Accords.

1627
02:14:09,758 --> 02:14:13,262
I signed because
it was the right thing to do.

1628
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:17,266
And yeah, this sucks. This is...

1629
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:20,352
This is a bad beat.

1630
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:24,064
But it hasn't changed my mind.

1631
02:14:25,691 --> 02:14:27,109
I don't think.

1632
02:14:37,578 --> 02:14:38,912
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1633
02:14:42,249 --> 02:14:45,252
Are you Tony Stank?

1634
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:49,715
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

1635
02:14:49,798 --> 02:14:51,633
Thank you for that!

1636
02:14:51,675 --> 02:14:53,677
Never dropping that, by the way.

1637
02:14:53,719 --> 02:14:56,972
"Table for one, Mr. Stank.
Please, by the bathroom."

1638
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:04,438
Tony...

1639
02:15:05,647 --> 02:15:07,691
I'm glad you're back at the compound.

1640
02:15:07,774 --> 02:15:10,903
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.

1641
02:15:10,986 --> 02:15:12,362
We all need family.

1642
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:17,618
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.

1643
02:15:18,368 --> 02:15:20,913
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1644
02:15:21,747 --> 02:15:26,376
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.

1645
02:15:27,961 --> 02:15:31,215
My faith's in people, I guess.

1646
02:15:31,298 --> 02:15:32,508
Individuals.

1647
02:15:33,467 --> 02:15:36,595
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...

1648
02:15:36,678 --> 02:15:38,263
they haven't let me down.

1649
02:15:40,307 --> 02:15:42,809
Which is why I can't
let them down either.

1650
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:50,108
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.

1651
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:54,238
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1652
02:15:54,321 --> 02:15:57,407
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...

1653
02:15:57,449 --> 02:15:59,910
I was sparing you...

1654
02:15:59,993 --> 02:16:02,621
but I can see now
that I was really sparing myself.

1655
02:16:03,163 --> 02:16:05,249
And I'm sorry.

1656
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:07,543
Hopefully one day you can understand.

1657
02:16:08,377 --> 02:16:11,839
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.

1658
02:16:11,922 --> 02:16:13,507
I know you're doing
what you believe in,

1659
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:15,092
and that's all any of us can do.

1660
02:16:15,175 --> 02:16:16,510
That's all any of us should.

1661
02:16:16,593 --> 02:16:18,720
Priority call from Secretary Ross.

1662
02:16:18,762 --> 02:16:21,306
There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.

1663
02:16:22,266 --> 02:16:24,059
Yeah, put him through.

1664
02:16:25,435 --> 02:16:26,770
Tony, we have a problem.

1665
02:16:26,854 --> 02:16:28,730
-Please hold.
-No, don't.

1666
02:16:31,608 --> 02:16:32,942
So no matter what...

1667
02:16:34,068 --> 02:16:35,361
I promise you...

1668
02:16:35,529 --> 02:16:37,239
if you need us...

1669
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:40,617
if you need me...

1670
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:45,621
I'll be there.

1671
02:18:44,907 --> 02:18:45,909
You sure about this?

1672
02:18:48,077 --> 02:18:49,871
I can't trust my own mind.

1673
02:18:52,749 --> 02:18:55,459
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...

1674
02:18:55,544 --> 02:18:57,963
I think going back under
is the best thing.

1675
02:18:58,754 --> 02:19:00,257
For everybody.

1676
02:19:22,446 --> 02:19:23,655
Thank you for this.

1677
02:19:26,366 --> 02:19:28,201
Your friend and my father...

1678
02:19:29,327 --> 02:19:31,205
they were both victims.

1679
02:19:32,664 --> 02:19:36,043
If I can help one of them find peace...

1680
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:41,673
You know, if they find out he's here...

1681
02:19:41,757 --> 02:19:43,842
they'll come for him.

1682
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:47,346
Let them try.

1683
02:26:29,915 --> 02:26:31,375
Who was it? Who hit you?

1684
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:32,835
Some guy.

1685
02:26:32,876 --> 02:26:34,503
So itchy, man, God.

1686
02:26:34,545 --> 02:26:36,338
What's "some guy's" name?

1687
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:37,548
Steve.

1688
02:26:37,589 --> 02:26:39,550
Steve? From 12-C?

1689
02:26:39,716 --> 02:26:41,718
-With the overbite?
-No, no, no.

1690
02:26:41,927 --> 02:26:44,471
You don't know him.
He's from Brooklyn.

1691
02:26:49,434 --> 02:26:51,228
I hope you got a few good licks in.

1692
02:26:51,395 --> 02:26:53,772
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.

1693
02:26:54,231 --> 02:26:57,609
His friend was huge. Like huge.

1694
02:27:00,028 --> 02:27:02,364
That's way better. Thank you.

1695
02:27:02,531 --> 02:27:04,950
Okay, tough guy.

1696
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:09,413
Love you, May.
Hey, can you shut the door?
