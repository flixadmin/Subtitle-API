1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,054
This season, on The Flash...

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:06,756
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay Garrick.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,051
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,391
Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,523
He will do whatever it takes
to ensure he's the only speedster.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,682
In any world.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,571
Never forget. I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:20,728 --> 00:00:23,277
I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Cisco? What did you see?

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,326
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,736
Who's the man in the iron mask?

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,495
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,283
What do you say you and I
give this a shot?

14
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:33,621
Yeah, I would like that.

15
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,957
I've always measured my success by
counting the number of victims I've had.

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,545
But now I think I'm gonna start counting
the number of Earths I conquer instead.

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,299
Earth-2 splitting in half.

18
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,712
Tell me I did notjust see
the end of the world.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,220
Dad? No! No!

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,350
And this is what's gonna make you
just like me.

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,762
Jay! No!

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,350
No!

23
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,853
Dad.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,646
Dad. Hey, hey, hey, look at me.

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,817
Look at me. Dad, don't leave.
Not again, not again.

26
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,533
Dad! Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, it's all right.

27
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,492
No. Dad...

28
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,139
No. Dad.

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,270
I told you family was a weakness.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,484
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,990
But now, the two of us are the same.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,200
No!

33
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,740
There you go, Flash!

34
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,366
Use your anger!

35
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,537
Just like I did.

36
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,917
I got you, Zolomon.

37
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,954
- I got...
- Barry, embrace your anger!

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,668
End me!

39
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,346
Let me do it for you.

40
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,263
So close, Barry.

41
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,109
Another Time Remnant.

42
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,020
See, Barry, there could be two of you.

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,610
You just have to be willing
to kill yourself.

44
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,824
Yeah. You're almost ready.

45
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,966
"And comfort us today
with the word of your promise"

46
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,426
"as we return our brother to the earth,"

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,346
"and leave us with the hope that one day,
we'll meet again."

48
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,401
Uh...

49
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,288
My father's...

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,713
I can't do this right now.

51
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,920
It's okay, Barry.

52
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,675
Henry Allen.

53
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,721
Henry suffered
two great losses in his life.

54
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,725
He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:28,735
He suffered guilt,
embarrassment, ridicule, shame,

56
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,649
and everything that comes with
being blamed for a crime he didn't commit.

57
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:37,451
Henry Allen was proof

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,204
that love can get you through
the darkest of days.

59
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:43,867
And that love will keep him alive
in all of our hearts.

60
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,639
I'm gonna find him, Dad.

61
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,146
I promise you, I'm gonna take from him
what he took from you.

62
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,624
Hey.

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,343
- Hey.
- I thought maybe you should eat something.

64
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,590
- I'm not hungry, thank you, though.
- Here.

65
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,476
Barry, um...

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,973
I had no idea that you were The Flash.

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,233
What you did for me,

68
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,394
all the things that you've done
for everyone,

69
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,733
this whole city...

70
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:58,362
And now this with your dad and Zoom.

71
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,824
I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,572
Thanks, Wally.

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,954
If there's anything you need,
you just say the word.

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,706
All right.

75
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,375
Guys, Zo0m's still out there.

76
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,759
We need to come up with a plan.

77
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,172
The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

78
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,509
Imean, if he can do that,

79
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,471
what else can he do
that we don't know about?

80
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,968
Right after he killed his Time Remnant,

81
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,396
he told me I was "almost ready."

82
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,149
- "Almost ready" for what?
- I don't know.

83
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,776
Yep, classic psychopath.

84
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,153
Why can't they ever just say
what they want to do?

85
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,478
We also have to figure out

86
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,149
why I keep vibing
Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

87
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,317
Seriously.

88
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,076
It's like I'm watching Transformers,
in 4D,

89
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,034
but, like, 10 times more realistic.

90
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,870
And with much better acting.

91
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,581
Look, if you can vibe the future,

92
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,997
we need to stop Zoom before that happens.

93
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,956
I'm gonna get some air, all right?

94
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,507
I got it.

95
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,190
When I was in the Speed Force,

96
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:26,870
I felt like I'd finally come to grips
with her death.

97
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,122
With not saving her when lwent back.

98
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:35,750
And then, the moment

99
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,963
where I'm finally at the place
I could move on,

100
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,216
my father's taken from me.

101
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,305
How am I ever supposed to
find peace with that?

102
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,595
I don't know, Barry.

103
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,393
But you're gonna have to
find a way to do that

104
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,523
or it's gonna tear you apart.

105
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,610
I just miss him so much already.

106
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,408
Zoom.

107
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,574
Barry, no!

108
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,413
Bad time, Flash?

109
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,922
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.

110
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,759
- This ends now.
- Not yet.

111
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,886
There's always more to take, Barry.

112
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,300
You're gonna stay away from them.

113
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,803
- That's completely up to you.
- What?

114
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,062
When we first met,

115
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,724
I told you that
Zoom needed to be the best.

116
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,735
You just didn't realize
I was talking about myself.

117
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,772
Is that what this is about?

118
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:45,533
A race, Barry, between you and me,

119
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,032
to see who's the fastest.

120
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,663
You win, this is over,
and you get to be the hero.

121
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,244
I'm not racing you.

122
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,830
Then your father
won't be the only person you love

123
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,461
that I'll take from you.

124
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,709
Think about it, Flash,

125
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,875
all lwant to know is
who's the fastest man alive,

126
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,960
on either world.

127
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,970
I'll be waiting.

128
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,556
So, Zoom wants to race you?

129
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,649
He's obsessed with being the best.

130
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,899
Why would we trust him?

131
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,811
He just wants to race.

132
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,604
You know, it actually makes sense

133
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,149
in a completely off-your-rocker
sort of way.

134
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,658
That can't be everything he wants.

135
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
It isn't.

136
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,743
This Magnetar that's being developed
by Mercury Labs,

137
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,157
turns out it can act as a pulsar.

138
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,325
Whoa.

139
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,369
What is a pulsar?

140
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,287
It's a power amplifier

141
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,003
with a highly magnetized,
dense rotating core

142
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,379
that could be easily weaponized.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,798
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

144
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,967
That's what happens to Earth-2.

145
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,428
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

146
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,720
That thing is powerful enough
to destroy a planet?

147
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,639
Well, more than just a planet
if it has the right power source.

148
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,524
- Like what?
- Like me.

149
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,192
That's why he wants to race.

150
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,525
He wants to siphon the energy
I create when I run.

151
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,530
He wants to siphon the energy
off both of you.

152
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,067
When Jay captured me,

153
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,951
he said that
he used to measure his success

154
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,113
by counting the number of victims he had.

155
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:14,746
But now, he was gonna measure it

156
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,625
by counting the number of Earths
he conquered instead.

157
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,874
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2,

158
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,789
he wants to take out
every other planet in the multi-verse.

159
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,299
- How many are there?
- Lnfinite.

160
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,168
Well, can he do that?

161
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,837
If he can create a breach to Earth-2
all on his own...

162
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,263
He can get to all of 'em.

163
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,595
One pulse to destroy them all.

164
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:35,802
I guess I don't have a choice.

165
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,389
I have to race him.

166
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,395
I have to win.

167
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,990
Barr.

168
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,494
Don't race him.

169
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,913
- It's not that easy.
- Yes, it is, you just say "no."

170
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,915
We find another way to stop him, together,
like we always do.

171
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,793
And do what, Joe?

172
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,746
Just sit around,
and wait for him to kill somebody else?

173
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,337
Wally? Iris? You?

174
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,418
- No. No way.
- He needs you, Barr.

175
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,587
He needs your speed again,
to get what he wants.

176
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,427
We have the advantage here.

177
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,101
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.

178
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,057
That saves the multi-verse.

179
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,268
This whole city, all of you.

180
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,690
I won't let another person I love die
when I can prevent it.

181
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,149
This isn'tjust about racing Zoom, is it?

182
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,865
You want to kill this guy.

183
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,780
Of course, lwanna kill him, Joe!

184
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,620
I wanna do a hell of a lot more
than just kill him,

185
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,534
lwant him to suffer
for everything that he's done.

186
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,625
- And he's going to.
- Come on, Barr.

187
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,088
Think about what you're saying.

188
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,254
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

189
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

190
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,298
And I can't talk you out of it?

191
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,966
Not this time.

192
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,802
Then I'm sorry, too.

193
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,581
What?

194
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,328
What are you doing?

195
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,422
Why did you put me in here?

196
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,510
Because you're too angry right now.

197
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,392
You can't race him like that.

198
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,972
Without a plan you... You'll lose.

199
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,226
Keeping me in here
is gonna get everyone killed.

200
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,317
I'm the only one that can stop him,
you know that.

201
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,774
You race Zoom on his terms,

202
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,152
you'll lose.

203
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,282
This is not your decision to make!

204
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,741
It is, this time.

205
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,028
We all made it together.

206
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,206
What?

207
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,200
All of you?

208
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:08,337
Bro, I went back and forth.
I was, like, a good 60-40 at first...

209
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:09,580
Ramon...

210
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,296
Yeah, yeah, we all made the decision.

211
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,047
Come on.

212
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,591
Allen.

213
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,220
Allen. This is for your own good.

214
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,804
Don't do this.

215
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,720
Guys, come on. Iris?

216
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,514
Cisco, come on, man.

217
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,932
You have to let me...
You have to let me stop him!

218
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,897
You have to let me...

219
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,023
Did we make the right call here?

220
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,235
Yeah, we did.

221
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,701
You okay, Joe?

222
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,212
Yeah, that wasjust a little harder
than I anticipated.

223
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,338
Yeah, and locking up Barry,

224
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,134
that was the easy part.

225
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,923
Using our plan
to take down Zoom without Barry,

226
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,465
that's gonna be the hard part.

227
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,975
But it's gonna be a lot easier
once we know where he is, Ramon.

228
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,807
Chill man, I'm working on it.

229
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,225
Work harder.

230
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,186
Got it.
He's at the industrial park on Leawood.

231
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,850
- Give me that. Mmm.
- Yep.

232
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,687
That is some serious
nerd love right there.

233
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,447
Snow, look,

234
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,072
everybody here would understand
if you don't wanna go through with this.

235
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,368
Jay may be a monster but there's a human
inside of him somewhere.

236
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,450
I've gotten to that part of him before,
I know I can do it again.

237
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,291
I want to stop him, Harry. For good.

238
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,956
Ramon.

239
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,091
So, let's go over the plan again.

240
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,006
Okay. Caitlin will distract Jay

241
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,047
so that you and Harry
can hit him with the boot.

242
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,138
Cisco's gonna open the breach
and we're gonna put him through it.

243
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,596
I'll disarm the Magnetar.

244
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,885
Destroy the Magnetar,

245
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,187
- save the multi-verse.
- Save the multi-verse.

246
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,894
One more thing, we need to agree.

247
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,808
We all made this decision together,

248
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,649
so, if anything goes wrong,
we stick with it.

249
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,071
Let's load up.

250
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

251
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,169
What's the matter?

252
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,342
You know, I've just been thinking.
You know, what's next?

253
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,470
What's next? We stop Zoom.

254
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,384
Right. Right, I guess...

255
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,677
- I don't know, I mean after that.
- I don't know.

256
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,852
I haven't really given it
much thought.

257
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,355
Yeah, I know, no, I know you haven't.

258
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,100
Guess I Just,
I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

259
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,187
You know, I see the way you are
with everyone here.

260
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,865
Caitlin and Cisco, Iris and Joe.

261
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,361
Barry.

262
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,368
Especially Barry.

263
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,120
You care about these people. A lot.

264
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:52,999
You know, but my friends,
they're all back home on our Earth.

265
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,831
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
you know, when this is all over,

266
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,134
I'm gonna go back home to live my life.

267
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,594
But if you need to stay here,
so that you can live yours again,

268
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:05,846
I get that.

269
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,591
- I understand, it's okay because...
- I...

270
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,682
No, Dad, seeing you happy...

271
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,561
That is all I've ever wanted for you.

272
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,832
Okay. In position.

273
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,710
Copy that. We got you.

274
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,042
Okay, Snow, you ready?

275
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,215
As ready as I can be.

276
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,179
Cisco? Cisco, you good?

277
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,508
Define "good."

278
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,933
Ramon, you're gonna be great.

279
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,222
- Snow, when you're ready.
- O kay.

280
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,775
You got this.

281
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,854
Here we go.

282
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,443
Jay?

283
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,577
Caitlin.

284
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,832
Jay!

285
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,756
How did you find me?

286
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,963
Doctor McGee said
the Magnetar was stolen from her labs.

287
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,298
I knew that it had to be you,

288
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,930
so, I tracked you here.

289
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,309
I tracked you here, Jay,
no one else knows.

290
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,973
Itold you, if you left me...

291
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:40,393
That if I betrayed you,
you'd show me no mercy. I know.

292
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,728
But I just wanna explain why I did that.

293
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,521
Please, Jay.

294
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:46,819
Talk.

295
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,200
Good job, girl.

296
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,818
Now draw him towards you.

297
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:51,820
I made a mistake.

298
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,162
I am so sorry that I abandoned you.

299
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
But you have to understand,

300
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,836
what you said to me,

301
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,213
that there was
a dark side of me, that I was...

302
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,297
I was more like Killer Frost than I knew.

303
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,753
I didn't wanna accept that.

304
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,423
I tried to lock the darkness inside of me.

305
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,269
But you knew that
that was already a part of me now.

306
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,268
And you're the only one who did.

307
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,363
And now,
I'm ready to accept who I really am.

308
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,817
Cisco, get ready.

309
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,489
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

310
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,906
But now I want to be the one
that only you know.

311
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,998
Please, Jay, let me try.

312
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,592
One more step.

313
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,212
I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

314
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,218
But it's too late.

315
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,226
Now! Ramon!

316
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,271
Damn it!

317
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,775
Tranq him! Tranq him!

318
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,366
Gun is jammed!

319
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,699
It's working.

320
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,121
Ah!

321
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,875
Dad!

322
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,900
Did you see my dad?

323
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,279
No, the vibe keeps changing.

324
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,032
It's like my brain is
channel surfing or something.

325
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,943
They must be on the move,
that's why the vibe's in flux.

326
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,950
Keep trying?

327
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,076
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

328
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,365
No, there's no messing with that thing.

329
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,376
Whatever he did to it,
we try and touch it, we try and move it,

330
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,003
this planet's done for.

331
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,419
Iris.

332
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,343
What's wrong?

333
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,970
Zoom took Dad.

334
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,142
What? How?

335
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,144
We tried to stop Zoom
by pushing him through the breach,

336
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,476
but he took Joe with him.

337
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,107
Well, where's Barry? Did he go after him?

338
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,314
He's not with us.

339
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,148
He's in a cell in the intake...

340
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,365
Wait, you... You tried to stop Zoom alone?

341
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,943
Long story.

342
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,915
Well, we have to get him back.

343
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,001
Wally, before Zoom took Dad,

344
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,663
we all agreed
that if we got him off this Earth,

345
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,047
we would close the breaches for good

346
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,506
and we would never open them again,

347
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,009
under any circumstances.

348
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,968
Why would you do that?

349
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,976
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

350
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,352
He made us all agree to it.

351
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,561
- Well, guess what? I didn't agree to that!
- Wally.

352
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:12,105
Iris, I already lost my mom.
If Dad...

353
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,531
I...

354
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:36,505
I will say, if anything, Barry sure has
an ample number of fathers to kill.

355
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,557
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

356
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:44,641
It doesn't matter,
you're not racing anybody.

357
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,728
Come on, Joe, you know Barry
better than that, you raised him.

358
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,892
He'll say yes
if he thinks he can save you.

359
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,402
Not this time.

360
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,403
I made sure of it.

361
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,319
Who is that?

362
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,241
It would just confuse you.

363
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,903
Try me.

364
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,458
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

365
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,702
When I got struck
by the dark matter and electricity,

366
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,166
I became Zoom, the fastest man alive.

367
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,258
It wasn't long
before I had this Earth on its knees.

368
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,880
But it wasn't enough.

369
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,419
Iwanted more.

370
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,050
I wanted to be faster.

371
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:22,761
So I created a speed drug.

372
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,183
Velocity Nine.

373
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,641
It made me faster
than I ever thought possible.

374
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,271
Fast enough
to break the dimensional barrier,

375
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,400
fast enough to run to other universes,
other Earths.

376
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,230
And then one day,
on one of those other Earths,

377
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,647
I discovered him.

378
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,406
He's another speedster?

379
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,442
Yeah, you could say that.

380
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:43,112
That was right about the time
I discovered something else, too.

381
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,785
All that V-Nine
I'd been injecting into my system

382
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,871
had a little side effect.

383
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:49,454
It was killing you.

384
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:53,547
I searched for a cure. I tried everything.

385
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,958
I even tried
to manipulate the Speed Force.

386
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,923
But let me tell you, the Speed Force...

387
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,133
The Speed Force does not like
its rules being broken.

388
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:04,096
Now it's been sending
its enforcers after me ever since.

389
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:07,435
So, you brought him here
to steal his speed.

390
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,431
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

391
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,646
But then the skies parted and I saw Barry.

392
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:15,810
And then I stole his speed.

393
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,192
I won.

394
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,446
I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

395
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,738
Then why keep him here?

396
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,365
A trophy-

397
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,074
And a little idea I had for fun.

398
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,836
You see,
I got so tired of being the villain.

399
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,164
So, I decided to be the hero, too.

400
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,259
I even borrowed his name.

401
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,628
Jay Garrick.

402
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,267
You know what's gonna be great, Detective?

403
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,847
After I beat Barry in the race

404
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,433
and prove that
I'm the fastest man alive on any Earth,

405
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,352
he's gonna rot in a cage
just like the one Jay's in now.

406
00:23:55,808 --> 00:24:00,609
And then I'll have a Flash from two worlds
to keep me company.

407
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,625
Look, everyone's gonna freak
when they find out I did this,

408
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,498
but I don't care.

409
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,336
We need your help, Barry.

410
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:28,933
Uh... Hey, guys, Barry's n0t...

411
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,766
- In his cell anymore.
- Wally!

412
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,895
Well, I wasn'tjust gonna stand here
and let this happen.

413
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,773
You let him take Joe?
What the hell were you thinking?

414
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,651
Allen, Allen,
there was nothing we could do.

415
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,902
You could have let me race him!

416
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,063
Allen, you're not racing Zoom!

417
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,990
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tranq me again?

418
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,569
Don't tempt me.

419
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,861
Look, I know you guys made a pact
to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

420
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,075
but you did that without me and Wally.

421
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,740
All right? You don't get to do that!

422
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,782
Barry, look at yourself right now.
You're not okay.

423
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,917
Cisco, my dad was just killed
in front of me!

424
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,249
Do you have any idea how that feels?

425
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,006
Watching someone you love die? Yes, I do.

426
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,336
- Cait...
- Look, Barry,

427
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,096
I know how cold and angry
and distant that can make you.

428
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,555
But when this happened to me,
you were the one who kept me in check.

429
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,138
You told me to stop and take a breath.

430
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,473
And that's all
we're telling you to do now.

431
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:14,933
I'm telling you, I'm good.

432
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,690
Really? You're good?

433
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,683
Because it seems to me
you wanna do more than stop Zoom.

434
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,568
It seems to me you want revenge.

435
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:24,357
If that's why you're doing this, Allen,
you will lose.

436
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,777
Look, you guys, I...

437
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,453
You may not think I can do this.

438
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,500
You may think I'm too angry,
but we're running out of time.

439
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,869
I have to beat him, and I'm going to,

440
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,880
whether I have your help or not.

441
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,957
So, which one is it?

442
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,085
So, how does this work?

443
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:47,505
It's the same way we took Iris
into the Speed Force.

444
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,642
Harry does his best Frankenstein,
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

445
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,552
All right, let's do it.

446
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,945
I'll do it.

447
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,316
Say when and where, I'll be there.

448
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,076
Cisco's learned
how to bring people into his vibes.

449
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:13,448
There's one condition. You bring Joe back.

450
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:17,288
But if he's harmed in any way, it's off.

451
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,451
I'll bring him.

452
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,496
But I won't release him
until after we race.

453
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,038
Deal?

454
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,458
Deal.

455
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:40,307
I tell you, Jay might be crazy pants,
but he can pick a venue.

456
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,396
Brought the whole crew with you, huh?

457
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,532
Can't say I blame you.

458
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,034
- Dad!
- LRIS: Wally.

459
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,786
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

460
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,070
Let him go.

461
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,531
After we race.

462
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,451
Cut the crap.
We know you plan to power up the Magnetar

463
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,836
so you can destroy the multi-verse.

464
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,417
Bravo, you've figured it out.

465
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,964
Almost.

466
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,843
I don't want to destroy all of it.

467
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,421
This Earth is at the center
of the multi-verse.

468
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:13,760
It's the access point
to every other Earth in existence.

469
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,682
One trans-dimensional shockwave and...

470
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,928
Poof.

471
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,272
Leaving just our Earth.
How generous of you.

472
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,521
Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

473
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,363
You might wanna say your goodbyes.

474
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,999
Don't worry, I'm gonna save your dad.

475
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,294
No, you're gonna save our dad.

476
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:45,087
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs, it's safer.

477
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,544
We're not going anywhere.

478
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,461
You got eyes and ears right here.

479
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,673
Either he goes, or we all die together.

480
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,299
We believe in you.

481
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,854
Wait.

482
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,435
Barry,

483
00:28:04,098 --> 00:28:05,476
kick his ass.

484
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,320
What are the rules?

485
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,234
One lap around the inside of this loop

486
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,529
will produce about one gigawatt of energy.

487
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:21,453
And I need 500-plus to
power the Magnetar enough to do the job.

488
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,710
Once it's full, I win.

489
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:26,046
Because there is no stopping it.

490
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,085
So, all I have to do to beat you
is stop you before that happens.

491
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,469
Yep, it's that simple.

492
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,882
But if at any point you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

493
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,558
dear old Dad number two is a dead man.

494
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,765
As well as your little fan club.

495
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,563
They're not my fan club,

496
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:46,316
they're the reason that I'm running.

497
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,977
Why I'm gonna beat you.

498
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,990
Let's see what you're made of, "Flash."

499
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,953
Just say when, Zoom.

500
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,498
Run, Barry. Run!

501
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,477
He's powering up the Magnetar.

502
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,315
Come on, Barry, catch up.

503
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,703
- Which one's Barry?
- Both ofthem.

504
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:50,705
- He made a Time Remnant.
- Time Remnant!

505
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,712
- Go, all right? Go!
- How are you...

506
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:58,925
I'll explain later, go!

507
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,973
A Remnant.

508
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,980
Stole my trick, Flash.

509
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,771
But you're too late.

510
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,648
Bye-bye multi-verse.

511
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,711
What's the Time Remnant doing?

512
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,580
He's creating his own pulse.

513
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:33,914
Why would he do that?

514
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,134
Because if that's out of phase,
it'll counteract that one.

515
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,263
Wait, his body can't handle that!

516
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,761
Then what's gonna happen?

517
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,597
He'll die.

518
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,535
No!

519
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,465
Do it.

520
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,892
You're a hero, Barry.
You couldn't kill me before.

521
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,760
You won't kill me now.

522
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,602
I don't have to.

523
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,268
Okay, so you ran back in time
and made a copy of yourself?

524
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,355
Well, uh... Basically, yeah.

525
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,644
It's called a Time Remnant.

526
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,531
It's not something
that I can do every day,

527
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,285
but I needed a way to draw
the Time Wraiths out of the Speed Force,

528
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,865
hoping they'd be more upset

529
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,701
at what Zoom had done
than they'd be at me.

530
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,000
Is that what I look like
when they start talking about science?

531
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,205
Pretty much.

532
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,871
Don't worry, Wally,
it'll get easier to understand.

533
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,005
Well, how does that even work?

534
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,750
Same way Zoom did it.

535
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,714
I ran back in time moments before I left.

536
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,547
It's the only way
I can be in two places at once.

537
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,467
Okay, so, the Time Remnant,
it's still you.

538
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,224
- Yeah.
- But he died.

539
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:53,512
I...

540
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,230
He was willing
to sacrifice himself for all of us.

541
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,068
That's how much he loved us.

542
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,901
You know what, we'll just...
We'll forget about it.

543
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,566
Uh, Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

544
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,201
You know what? In battle...

545
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:07,530
- Here.
- Choose your weapon wisely.

546
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,242
All right, some people choose a gun,
I choose a Phillips head.

547
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,031
- Screwdriver.
- Oh, I'm sorry, you're so particular...

548
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,917
Ramon, can you just, please!
Have you ever worked with a tool before?

549
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,544
- I'm working with one now.
- Are you ready?

550
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:19,798
One, two, and...

551
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,803
I don't know what's more annoying,

552
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:29,761
being in that thing
or listening to you two arguing about it.

553
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,105
Um...

554
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,113
You're...

555
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,111
I'm Jay Garrick.

556
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,029
The real Jay Garrick.

557
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,451
What?

558
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,578
I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry.

559
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,967
Barr.

560
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,137
He looks just like him.
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

561
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,398
I can't believe this. My dad told me...

562
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,652
He told me this, he said his,
his mom's maiden name was Garrick!

563
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,483
I just never thought that that meant...

564
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,487
- I never thought that meant...
- Hey, Barr. Barr.

565
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,648
He doesn't know that.

566
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,445
He doesn't know that
he's your dad's doppelganger, okay?

567
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,954
Do you want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

568
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,034
No. No.

569
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,324
Sure?

570
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,369
Yeah, I Just need a minute.

571
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,003
I'll be all right.

572
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,043
- That's why he wouldn't.
- Yeah.

573
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,177
- It's so smart because of...
- Yeah, there it is.

574
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:52,090
So, the reason you didn't have your powers

575
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,010
is because there was a dampener
in the mask. You see?

576
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,188
I don't wanna see this thing ever again.

577
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,273
So, your powers are back.

578
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:09,403
I see, Jay, excuse me, Hunter,
stole your color scheme, too.

579
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,534
He took a lot of things that were mine.

580
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,697
Except for that. That's, um...
That's all him.

581
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,831
He said it was his father's, from the war.

582
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:20,668
Ironically, on my... On our Earth,

583
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,291
this helmet stood for hope.

584
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,539
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

585
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,876
Maybe I can continue that sentiment.

586
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:33,382
Take something from him for a change,
make it my own.

587
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,101
It suits you.

588
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:44,938
Thank you, all of you,
for saving me from Zoom.

589
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,025
Especially you, Flash.

590
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,568
You're welcome, Flash.

591
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,706
Now all I have to do is find my way home.

592
00:35:58,864 --> 00:35:59,865
And where's that?

593
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,411
I think you would call it Earth-3.

594
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,380
Uh-huh. Well, I can get you to Earth-2.

595
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,757
My daughter and I
can help you with the rest.

596
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,083
We can?

597
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,251
Yes, we can.

598
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,222
We're going home.

599
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,141
Okay.

600
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,570
Snow, you're a tremendous scientist,

601
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,277
but you're an even better person.

602
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,442
Don't make me cry, Harry.

603
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:36,452
I've done enough of that already.

604
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,746
- Detective Joe West.
- Harry.

605
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,085
You have great kids,
you take care of them.

606
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,876
Same to you.
You take care of that beautiful girl.

607
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,289
Yes, sir.

608
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,295
Bye.

609
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,675
I'm a better man
than I was when I got here,

610
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,849
and it's 'cause of you.

611
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:03,554
I'm not the same, either.

612
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,436
Hey, uh, don't be surprised
if I project myself over to Earth-2

613
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,605
every once in a while, you know, just to
throw your stuff across the office.

614
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,864
I'll miss you, too, Cisco.

615
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,119
So, I guess I can't text you
from another Earth, huh?

616
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,291
Yeah, I guess not.

617
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,418
It's too bad.

618
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,342
Thank you, guys, seriously,

619
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:38,222
- for saving our home.
- Mmm-hmm.

620
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,764
Ready?

621
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:41,175
Yeah.

622
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,070
Can't stop thinking
about my dad's doppelganger,

623
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,702
seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

624
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:47,458
that should've made it easier.

625
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,081
Doesn't.

626
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,583
Just made me miss him even more.

627
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,003
I can't even imagine
how hard that must've been.

628
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,387
We just won. We just beat Zoom.

629
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:02,764
Why does it feel like I Just lost?

630
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,389
Because you've lost a lot in your life,
Barry, more than most.

631
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:13,184
But...

632
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,777
Maybe you and me,
seeing where this thing goes,

633
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,447
maybe that can give you something
for a change.

634
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,202
That's all I ever wanted to hear you say.

635
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,416
And lwish that I was in a place
where I could try that with you,

636
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,628
but I feel so hollowed out inside
right now.

637
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,806
I feel more broken
than I've ever felt in my life.

638
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:47,347
If I'm ever gonna be
worth anything to you,

639
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,103
I need to fix what's wrong with me.

640
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,143
I need to find some... Some peace.

641
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,280
Barry, listen to me,

642
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,902
you waited for me for years.

643
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,411
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

644
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:12,034
So, I am telling you,
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

645
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,371
Wherever you need to go,

646
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,916
whatever you need to do, do it.

647
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,050
And when you get back, I'll be here.

648
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:26,260
Okay.

649
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:28,425
I love you, Barry.

650
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,864
I love you, too.

651
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,579
And I always will.

652
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,059
That's why I'm so sorry.

653
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,557
But I have to do this.

654
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:30,570
No! Mom!

655
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,918
Run!

656
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,757
Barry! No!

657
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,934
You're not gonna kill her this time.

658
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,262
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

659
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,458
No.

660
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:22,706
I'm not gonna hurt you.

661
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,550
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

662
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,469
I'm not gonna hurt you. You're safe.

663
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,931
You're safe now.
