1
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,558
Come, Mitsah.

2
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,350
It's Buck!

3
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,891
Buck!

4
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,932
I'll be damned!
You remember old Charlie, huh?

5
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,557
You've aged too, poor Buck.

6
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,016
He's a puppy of yours. Here.

7
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,725
Did you come to die at Charlie's?

8
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:55,057
Die? Why?

9
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,350
Because when a wolf refuses food,

10
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:00,683
it is a sign that he is about to die.

11
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,433
Poor Buck.

12
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:14,308
No, Mitsah!
Stop it! Leave him alone.

13
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:17,932
He was born in the forest,
his mother is a she-wolf.

14
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,307
The teeth are wolf fangs.

15
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,600
They are white as snow.

16
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,516
Yeah, it's true.

17
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,100
We'll call him White Fang.

18
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,850
It hurts, huh? Poor little wolf.

19
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,057
Wolves like you are always hungry.
Here, eat.

20
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,891
Bravo, White Fang.

21
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:23,057
Mitsah!
Careful, no, it's dangerous!

22
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:24,432
Mitsah!

23
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:37,975
Mitsah, no, it's a wolf!
Come back!

24
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,182
Mitsah, get up immediately!

25
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,475
He's good! Didn't you see, daddy?
He's like a little dog.

26
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,141
You shouldn't have set him free.
It's dangerous.

27
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:02,100
No, White Fang is not dangerous.
We already love each other.

28
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,683
You, come here!

29
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,725
Come here!

30
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,891
Don't be afraid, White Fang!

31
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:17,557
You made him run away!

32
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,432
Listen, Mitsah.

33
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,100
He has the nature of a wolf,
he must live free.

34
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:33,100
You can't force him.
Do you understand?

35
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,432
A hunter like you should know that.

36
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,182
Yes, but we were already friends.

37
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,307
Come on, don't think about it.

38
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,433
Come.

39
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,975
Come on!

40
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:54,390
- Mr. Kurt Janssen!
- Charlie! Charlie!

41
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,850
Kurt! What are you doing
on this side of the river, huh?

42
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,975
Charlie, this is Jason Scott.

43
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,975
Nice to meet you.
Kurt's friend are my friend.

44
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,516
Do you have anything to warm us up?

45
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:12,683
Mitsah, bring a drink. Do you know
my puppy? His name is Mitsah.

46
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,933
Hi, Mitsah.

47
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,641
Does Mr. Scott
is into mining like you?

48
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,350
It's good, it's strong!

49
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,891
That's what it takes.

50
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:36,183
He's a miner too, in a way,

51
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:40,100
but he's not looking for gold.
He's trying to dig out the truth.

52
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,308
I am a writer and also a journalist.

53
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:49,808
I travel to find new things to tell.

54
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,933
People, facts,
anything that might be of interest.

55
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:57,100
You'll have lots of things to tell,
your people have gone mad.

56
00:10:57,308 --> 00:11:02,433
- All they think about is gold.
- Yeah, that's why he came here.

57
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,975
From New York to San Francisco
all they talk about is the Klondike.

58
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,766
Is there a boat to go up the river?

59
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:14,183
You're going to Dawson City.
It's a bad place.

60
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,725
A hunter like you
could make a fortune there.

61
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,808
All those prospectors must eat!

62
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,350
We have to go,
the weather is changing.

63
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:29,475
Dawson City is a corrupt city,
full of swindlers.

64
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,808
I'll never go there.

65
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:39,183
Even if the government
has forbidden to carry weapons,

66
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,890
I don't trust those people. Good!

67
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,975
Let's go.

68
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,975
How are you doing?

69
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,641
Come on.

70
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,183
Hall, we're slow with the gambling
at the saloon, get some ideas.

71
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,391
My motto will have to be...

72
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:21,391
"To entertain Dawson City,
there's only Beauty Smith."

73
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,225
Look at our reverend.

74
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:30,433
Listen, you filthy drunkard.

75
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:37,140
Do you know why
I let you pretend to be a priest?

76
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,390
Yes, because you have pity on me,
Beauty.

77
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,433
Sure, that's one reason,

78
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,808
but there's also another one.
I don't want a real priest around.

79
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:52,225
You're right, true words.

80
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,225
"Beware of nosy hypocrites",
said Abraham.

81
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:02,058
A real priest would make trouble
and you're a smart man, Beauty.

82
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,766
You know these things very well.

83
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:09,058
You smell like alcohol
when you preach to the parishioners.

84
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:14,016
You know how is going to end?
They'll kick you out of that mission.

85
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:18,433
No, Beauty, if you don't want
them to do it, they won't dare.

86
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:22,266
No, but I will, before they do.

87
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:26,016
If you want to keep pocketing
their offers

88
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:29,058
you will have to be
a man of all virtues.

89
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:32,350
The boat is coming.

90
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,975
The boat is coming!

91
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:38,265
Your place is not in that filthy bar.

92
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:43,015
Your place is down at the dock
to welcome your sheep!

93
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,350
- What the hell!
- Sorry, I didn't do that on purpose.

94
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:19,100
- Sorry.
- I don't care about your excuses!

95
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:26,225
- No need to get angry.
- What's it got to do with you?

96
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:30,016
She didn't bump you, I did.

97
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:33,265
I didn't see you.

98
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,475
You don't see well.

99
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:38,725
I'll tell you again, it was me.

100
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:42,765
And I did it on purpose,
because I don't like you.

101
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:51,765
- Thank you.
- Excuse me!

102
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:54,140
- Daisy?
- Yes, sister.

103
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,683
What is someone like you
doing in Dawson City?

104
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,975
What I do everywhere,
my mission is to heal the sick.

105
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:06,516
You have a lot of courage.
If I can help you...

106
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:11,016
- Are you a doctor?
- No, let's say a busybody.

107
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,433
My name is Scott.

108
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,308
- Jason Scott?
- Yes, Jason Scott.

109
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:23,350
- Where have you heard my name?
- It's printed on your books.

110
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,475
I've read a couple of them.

111
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,725
I hope I haven't shocked you.

112
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:33,433
No, not at all. You call things
with their real name.

113
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:36,140
I could have been even more clearer.

114
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,600
Hey, Jason!

115
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,058
- Give me a hand!
- I'll be right there.

116
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:48,058
Excuse me, miss... Oh, sister.

117
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:53,140
Mr. Scott?

118
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,433
- Do you want to give me a hand too?
- Yes, but how?

119
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,391
Telling everyone how
these poor people live.

120
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
It is scandalous to close our eyes
on prevarication and exploitation.

121
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,808
- Yes, but allow me one thing.
- Like?

122
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:12,183
To also talk about people like you.

123
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,933
Daisy!

124
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,475
Donate, brothers!
Donate to civic assistance!

125
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:27,640
Donate now because perhaps
you may need help someday.

126
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,016
Dawson City needs your help.

127
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,850
Thank you, madam. Thank you, sir.
God bless you always.

128
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:36,475
Give me.

129
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:40,641
Brother from faraway China,
a small offering. Thank you.

130
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,016
Brother, a small offering.

131
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:46,225
Father!
Hey, father!

132
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,266
- Father Oatley, to serve you.
- It is Heaven that sends you.

133
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:58,516
It is a pleasure to meet a servant
of the Lord. What brings you here?

134
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:02,100
An idea, a hope.
I want to start a hospital.

135
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,016
A hospital?
But... It will take the equipment.

136
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,891
I've everything that is needed.
Medicines, instruments...

137
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:12,933
E... Money, of course.

138
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,308
Yes.

139
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,600
Praise the Lord.

140
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,766
Just this morning
I said in my sermon

141
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:26,433
the need to have a hospital
here in Dawson.

142
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:30,850
Where will you place
this oasis of sanctity?

143
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:35,891
I don't know yet. I was counting
on the help of some generous soul.

144
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,891
Ah, there... Say no more, sister.
Say no more.

145
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:44,016
Hey, you sinners!
I am talking to you!

146
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,141
Come and take the baggage
of this holy creature.

147
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,558
Thank you. Thank you.

148
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,433
Follow me.

149
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,350
Help!

150
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,558
Help! Help!

151
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,850
White Fang! Where are you? Run!

152
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,850
Help! Help!

153
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
Help!

154
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:08,016
I have no more strength...

155
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,850
White Fang, where are you?

156
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:15,600
Help!

157
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:21,266
I'm drowning... I'm drowning...
I can't go on much longer.

158
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,016
White Fang... Help me...

159
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:35,016
Are you still here? Go away!
Go away, bad dog!

160
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,141
Go away!

161
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,808
Away!

162
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,058
Away!

163
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,058
Go! Mitsah! Mitsah!

164
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,975
What is it?

165
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:07,933
Is Mitsah in danger?

166
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:12,850
Is Mitsah in danger?
Hurry, take me there.

167
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,641
Run! Run! Run!

168
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:53,100
You.

169
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:57,266
Mr. Beauty Smith just went to rest.

170
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:01,100
The sound of the hammer
bothers him.

171
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:43,058
Take it down.

172
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:08,433
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

173
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:14,266
A disagreement?

174
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah, they don't like signs.

175
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,766
Me too. Mr.?

176
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:34,975
Jason Scott,
of the New York Daily Herald.

177
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,558
A nosy reporter.

178
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:41,391
 Yeah. May I know
who am I speaking with?

179
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,725
Mr. Smith.

180
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,516
Beauty Smith.

181
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,850
- Your reputation precedes you.
- Really?

182
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:52,058
Well... Sorry, if I woke you up.

183
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:54,100
Let's not talk about it anymore.

184
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:58,016
- Mr. Smith.
- Yes?

185
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,141
Two dollars, for my sign.

186
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:18,725
We'll find
a doctor in Dawson City.

187
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:25,308
The doctor will heal Mitsah,
the little big hunter.

188
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:55,058
No, Jason, that's not it.

189
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,516
Take a few more steps back.

190
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:02,433
There, okay!

191
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Nine feet!

192
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:23,641
Losing nine feet means giving away
at least 50,000 dollars!

193
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,475
He's right!

194
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:28,975
I won't let myself be robbed
by a damned inspector!

195
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:31,808
- It's theft!
- We won't let you take our land!

196
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,016
No one is robbing you.

197
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:38,308
The law says that no one
can exploit more than 500 feet.

198
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,350
Tell Beauty, but careful that
his dog won't bite your butt.

199
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:49,558
Beauty Smith doesn't make the laws,
the government does.

200
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,433
What government?

201
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:57,016
The government here
is Mr. Beauty Smith.

202
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:01,016
You have to do what he likes.

203
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,266
- Hello?
- What?

204
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,975
- Suppose I don't want to do that.
- You're not a miner.

205
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,141
Suppose I was one.

206
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:18,641
It would be a problem. No one
would buy an ounce of your gold.

207
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,475
If I wanted to buy your gold?

208
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:28,391
No one would sell it to you.
We have a contract with Mr. Smith.

209
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,600
- A contract?
- We sell him all the gold.

210
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:37,058
- All of it?
- Yes, and he pays us well.

211
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,683
- Cash.
- Sure, 10%.

212
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:44,308
What's left in bonds.
Every year we get the interest rate.

213
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,016
Sorry, but I can't waste
any more time with you.

214
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,933
Come on, back to work!

215
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,516
- Let's not waste any time.
- Come on, guys.

216
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,100
What do you say?

217
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,350
In so many years that I have been
living among these people,

218
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,225
I have seen very few get rich.

219
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,975
Do you need me
for the interview with Beauty?

220
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:58,141
I don't think so.

221
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,683
Bravo!

222
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:26,516
To what do I owe the honor,
Mr. Nosy?

223
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,391
Dawson City has ignited my curiosity.

224
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,516
Everywhere I turn I hear your name.

225
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,141
So I thought of coming
directly to the source.

226
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,683
- Please, come.
- Thank you.

227
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:46,100
No, no. Come on, be good.

228
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,308
Girls,
the gentlemen want company!

229
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,683
Nothing for this side?

230
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,266
Come.

231
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,141
You know that Beauty
does not want you to come here.

232
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,891
A respectable priest
can't go to a saloon.

233
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:26,391
I have to see you sometime,
you never come to the mission.

234
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,850
Dad. That's no place for me.

235
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,850
That's not true.

236
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
You are a good girl.

237
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,933
I know.

238
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,058
But people's prejudices...

239
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:48,225
You the tramp and me the saint.

240
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,433
It's funny, isn't it?

241
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:56,141
You may not be a saint,
but you're the kindest of devils.

242
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,058
Go, now.

243
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:15,475
You have talked to the miners.

244
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:19,516
Did somebody tell you that I
forced him to sign the contract?

245
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:22,308
Nobody.

246
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,475
You're someone.

247
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:29,475
You tell me that you have
stuck your nose into my business

248
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:32,266
and you found them clear as water.

249
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:38,100
You'd be complimenting me, instead
you wonder where the trick is.

250
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,766
I'm not that naive. I wanted to
warn you that I will try to find out.

251
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:46,475
There's nothing to find out.

252
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,308
Would you like a cigar?
A gallant man offers it to you.

253
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,308
A gallant man who takes
all the gold in the country

254
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:55,558
paying 90% of it with just paper.

255
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,808
Those pieces of paper
will be worth a lot more in a year.

256
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,100
How much will the cost of goods
increase in a year?

257
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,391
How do I know that?

258
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:09,433
You do the pricing.
All goods arriving in Dawson

259
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,600
pass through your hands only.

260
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:16,933
- You know that too.
- Yes, that too.

261
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:20,475
I suspect that they are not
of the highest quality,

262
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:25,266
except maybe the champagne.
- My private reserve.

263
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:29,016
- It's the only drinkable one.
- Then you drink it.

264
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,808
- Don't you want to have a drink?
- Why should I drink with you?

265
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,600
Well... Because you like me.

266
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,850
You say that.

267
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:52,225
Then I will have to find
another reason.

268
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:56,350
- Which one?
- I am a friend of your father.

269
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,433
- What do you want to say?
- Don't be afraid.

270
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:06,516
I am blackmailing you
to spend some time with you.

271
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:12,016
I have heard it all,
but I will not betray your secret.

272
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,683
Not even if you send me to hell.

273
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,266
Maybe I won't send you there.

274
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:28,683
Looking at you more closely...
I don't find you obnoxious.

275
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:32,391
Good. Let's go.

276
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,766
Jack?

277
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:23,933
Did you arrive with the last boat?
Are you a merchant?

278
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,558
No.

279
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:29,850
- A maker.
- A maker?

280
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,475
What will you make here?

281
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,433
Here, let's say...

282
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:38,725
Trouble.

283
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:42,100
I'm a government official.

284
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:46,225
Then you'll have fun.

285
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:59,308
Come on!

286
00:38:59,558 --> 00:39:01,308
Come here!

287
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,183
Come on!

288
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:16,641
Good job!

289
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,058
Come on!

290
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:28,808
There, you've done it.

291
00:39:30,308 --> 00:39:33,850
Come on up. There he is!

292
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:39,100
Bravo, White Fang...

293
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,766
Be good.

294
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:30,641
- Come here, Satan!
- Stop, White Fang! Be quiet!

295
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,975
Come here!

296
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:35,475
White Fang!

297
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,725
Calm down.

298
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:42,850
Be careful with that
stupid dog, dirty Indian!

299
00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:46,308
Sorry, he's not used to seeing
so many people.

300
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,391
- Is that your canoe?
- Yes.

301
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,266
You didn't bring any furs. How come?

302
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:57,391
I'm not here to sell.
He is very sick.

303
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:02,850
I'm sorry. No furs then.

304
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:06,641
I have a lot of furs across the
river, but now I want a doctor.

305
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:13,016
Listen, Indian, I find you a doctor
and you bring me the furs.

306
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:15,308
- Agreed?
- All right.

307
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:33,016
He's a healthy, strong boy,
he'll heal soon.

308
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,391
Sorry,
the dog can't stay here.

309
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,683
He won't bother,
he is Mitsah's friend.

310
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,558
Sorry.

311
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,516
Did you hear that, White Fang?
You can't stay here.

312
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,600
Come on, let's go.

313
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,516
Come on, be good.

314
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:04,558
Come on, let's go.

315
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:02,058
White Fang...

316
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,016
White Fang...

317
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,891
- White Fang...
- Mitsah!

318
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:55,475
Good boy. Good boy.

319
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:58,600
Let me see.

320
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:02,516
Is that dog yours, Indian?

321
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:04,600
Yes, sir.

322
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:07,391
He killed
Dawson's strongest dog.

323
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,266
White Fang can kill ten
like that, he's strong and brave.

324
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:14,891
- How much do you want for that dog?
- I'm not selling it.

325
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:19,016
- I asked you how much you want.
- And I answered you.

326
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:22,058
Two hundred dollars.

327
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,225
Three hundred dollars.

328
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,558
Four hundred dollars.

329
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,475
I don't want your money.

330
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:42,516
- Do you refuse four hundred dollars?
- Yes.

331
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,933
If you don't want my money,
too bad for you. I want your dog.

332
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:00,975
No, stop!

333
00:46:02,016 --> 00:46:03,725
Don’t...

334
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:15,433
Home, go! Everybody home!

335
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:18,766
It's nothing,
it's just a wounded Indian.

336
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,433
Come on!

337
00:46:20,683 --> 00:46:23,391
Let's not waste time on an Indian.

338
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,975
Home, quick!

339
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:32,641
Don't you have anything to do?
Come on!

340
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,683
Oh, my God!

341
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:56,975
Hey! Come here, quick!

342
00:46:57,183 --> 00:47:01,308
- What happened, father?
- I don't know... I didn't see it.

343
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:04,391
Careful.

344
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:07,766
Easy.

345
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,725
Bring me some bandages, quick.

346
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:22,350
Here.

347
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,975
Mitsah!

348
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,266
Treat him... well...

349
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:07,558
- Take care...
- Yes, of course.

350
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:10,933
Tell him I will come back

351
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,433
soon to pick him up
with White...

352
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:50,891
Old Charlie...

353
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,016
He shouldn't
have come to Dawson City.

354
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,225
His son... He's very sick.

355
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,766
Then the prophet Ezekiel
cried out....

356
00:49:40,975 --> 00:49:43,975
"Are you not ashamed
of this abomination?"

357
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:47,766
"Who do you think you are
because you have white skin?"

358
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:51,766
"Do you not know that God created
all races of all colors?"

359
00:49:51,975 --> 00:49:55,725
There is no difference between you
And a Klondike Indian!

360
00:49:55,933 --> 00:50:00,766
Although you, damn ignorant people,
don't even know where Klondike is.

361
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:06,141
And now I will repeat
the words of Ezekiel!

362
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,641
"The one among you who kills
an Indian is equal to Cain"

363
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:16,225
"who slew his brother Abel and
now roasts in eternal flames!"

364
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:20,933
"Therefore, you sinners,
you are warned!"

365
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:25,225
"Beware you,
not to end up in the grill"

366
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:27,475
"for all eternity."

367
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:41,058
Give me another one, Joe.

368
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:55,891
Bring a bottle.

369
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,516
The reverend will pay.

370
00:51:02,016 --> 00:51:05,391
I really liked
that passage from Ezekiel.

371
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,225
"Whoever kills a human being
of another race is like Cain."

372
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:12,225
Nice!

373
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:16,058
- You heard my sermon.
- Yes.

374
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:18,683
- Did you not see me?
- No.

375
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:22,808
But I also remember
the words of Isaiah.

376
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:28,850
"Whoever witnesses a crime
and does not report it"

377
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:33,183
"will be condemned to burn
in the eternal flames of hell."

378
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:36,641
Isaiah had the good fortune

379
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,683
of not living in such hard times

380
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:43,100
for those who do not keep
their mouths shut.

381
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:48,725
But a priest cannot keep silent.

382
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,433
What example would he set for others?

383
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:57,850
If someone were to say that
he saw you, that you were there?

384
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:01,766
Wouldn't that bite back conscience?

385
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:04,725
You preach a lot on divine justice,

386
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:08,016
but you forget that there is also
human justice.

387
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:12,891
You know who killed the Indian,
but you are afraid to say it.

388
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Afraid? Terror even.

389
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:23,141
An insane terror, my dear friend,
and I have reason to have it.

390
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,850
In this city
even the walls have ears.

391
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,016
At night remorse
doesn't let me sleep,

392
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:35,975
but I also try not to end up
too soon in hell.

393
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:44,100
Would you have the courage
to denounce the murderer?

394
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:47,058
Sure, if you provide me
with some evidence.

395
00:52:52,766 --> 00:52:55,725
I would like to be sure
that you won't get me in trouble.

396
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:57,391
You don't trust me?

397
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,850
Come with me.

398
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:11,683
I have something that will speak
for the two of us.

399
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:25,100
It's already arranged.

400
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:30,516
Doesn't the book of Isaiah say: "He
who is a champion of righteousness"

401
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:35,266
"risks being betrayed
by the man he seeks to defend"?

402
00:53:56,391 --> 00:54:00,183
Stop, Chester!
You don't stand a chance!

403
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,475
Let's go!

404
00:54:33,266 --> 00:54:37,266
Come on, Chester.
Isn't this your knife?

405
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:41,808
- This is the first time I see it.
- It's got your initials on it.

406
00:54:42,058 --> 00:54:44,308
How can you tell it's mine?

407
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:48,016
D and C could be Donald Carter

408
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:51,183
Or Doc Crockey or Dan Covansky.

409
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:55,600
All right, bring in
Carter, Crockey and Covansky.

410
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:04,766
- What does that mean?
- It's true.

411
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:10,058
The knife could belong
to one of them.

412
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,433
So I convinced them to tell us
what they saw

413
00:55:14,683 --> 00:55:18,683
to avoid trouble.
- You wanted to blame us, Chester.

414
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:34,308
You'll pay for this, damn you!

415
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:51,141
He's such a wild beast.
If we got him to fight,

416
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,391
people would bet
even the right arm on him!

417
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,558
Not a bad idea.

418
00:55:56,766 --> 00:55:58,766
But against whom?

419
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,558
Wait, I go it!

420
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:09,141
- Against the bear!
- What bear?

421
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:12,141
The one that the hunters
have brought for the circus.

422
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:16,266
The most nervous
and irritable beast I have ever seen!

423
00:56:17,516 --> 00:56:21,183
- A wolf against a wild bear.
- Yes.

424
00:56:23,725 --> 00:56:27,308
Sure, the bets
will go through the roof.

425
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:31,641
Of course I will decide who wins.

426
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:34,516
Ladies and gentlemen, this way!

427
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,308
Come! You'll witness the greatest
show you have ever seen!

428
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:41,725
Ladies and gentlemen, right this way!
Come on in!

429
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:45,475
A sensational match,
you can't miss it!

430
00:56:45,683 --> 00:56:48,725
The greatest show
you have ever seen!

431
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:51,850
Hurry up, we're about to start!

432
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:55,891
We have spread the word that the bear
will fight with a muzzle.

433
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,183
- Did they believe it?
- Everyone's betting for the dog.

434
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,600
Perfect.
Accept any bet on that beast.

435
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:07,391
- Jim.
- Thank you, sir.

436
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,558
- Accept any bets on the dog!
- All right!

437
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:43,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
citizens of Dawson City,

438
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,058
first city of the North,
capital of Klondike,

439
00:57:47,266 --> 00:57:50,433
I have the honor to present you
the fight of the century!

440
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:57,100
On my left,
the fiercest animal of its race:

441
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:59,641
the fighting wolf!

442
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:06,391
And today, for the first time
in the history of the world,

443
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,433
he will fight against the terror
of the forest: the wild bear!

444
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:27,641
Make the final bets, friends,
before the fight begins!

445
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:31,058
You know who
to bet your money on, huh?

446
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:35,433
He is a magnificent beast,
a true wolf.

447
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:38,850
I'm sure he's going to win,
I'm sure of it.

448
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:46,808
- That's not fair!
- He can't make it!

449
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:50,516
- He's a vicious animal!
- Come on, come on!

450
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,100
Father?

451
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,558
The key.

452
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,350
What key?

453
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:02,975
The key to the cupboard.
I've been looking for it all morning.

454
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,100
Sister Evangelina! Sister Evangelina!

455
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,975
What's going on?

456
01:00:09,933 --> 01:00:12,183
Come and see what's going on, quick!

457
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:14,725
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- Hurry up!

458
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,641
Oh, my God!

459
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:20,600
White Fang...

460
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,516
Oh, my God!

461
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,766
This is terrible!

462
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,350
Jason, look at that!

463
01:00:55,558 --> 01:00:58,266
- What shall we do?
- I have an idea, come!

464
01:00:58,475 --> 01:01:00,100
Yeah, right!

465
01:01:10,391 --> 01:01:13,433
Where is... White Fang?

466
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,100
Go, go!

467
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,225
Move!

468
01:01:53,683 --> 01:01:55,183
Faster!

469
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:27,933
Mr. Scott, what right do you have
to interrupt the match?

470
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,808
What right you had to set it up?

471
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,141
I bought that dog.

472
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:37,266
Yes, Mr. Smith, with a man's life.

473
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:54,308
White Fang...

474
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:57,558
Poor White Fang...

475
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:01,016
Mitsah, for the love of Heaven!

476
01:03:02,933 --> 01:03:05,266
He is dead!

477
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,266
- Put it away.
- Yes.

478
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:25,891
You can pet him now. Come.

479
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,183
Here we go!

480
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,183
- Go.
- Come on.

481
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:46,391
- Will he die?
- No, it's all in the past now.

482
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:52,433
Now go to sleep, you promised me.

483
01:03:52,683 --> 01:03:54,141
Krista!

484
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:57,516
Come.

485
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,391
Why did White Fang come back
without my father?

486
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:05,891
I don't know. When your father comes,
we'll ask him.

487
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:12,350
With these wounds
a man would already be dead.

488
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:18,558
He is strong, he'll be fine.
He'll need a master.

489
01:04:18,808 --> 01:04:21,808
- Mitsah is his master.
- Mitsah will need a father.

490
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,141
At his age

491
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:27,058
a mother is much more important.

492
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:36,808
He's here now. I'll take care of him.

493
01:04:37,725 --> 01:04:39,808
Go, Mitsah, go!

494
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:44,308
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

495
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:47,516
- Are you tired already?
- Yes, a little bit.

496
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:49,391
Come on, get in.

497
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,350
Let's go!

498
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:57,308
Go!

499
01:04:57,558 --> 01:04:59,558
Let's go.

500
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:15,558
- Go!
- Catch it!

501
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:17,808
Run, White Fang!

502
01:05:19,933 --> 01:05:22,516
Good boy! Come here!

503
01:05:22,766 --> 01:05:24,225
White Fang, over here!

504
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:27,100
Come on!

505
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:36,391
Good boy. Wonderful!

506
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:41,475
- Did you see that you healed?
- Did you see? You're healed.

507
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,475
He's back to full strength.

508
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,100
- The dam is almost finished.
- Yes.

509
01:06:22,308 --> 01:06:26,850
The miners are waiting for
our dam to work miracles.

510
01:06:27,058 --> 01:06:29,058
If the vein is exhausted,
it's useless.

511
01:06:29,683 --> 01:06:33,516
I heard that people are checking
the other side of the mountain.

512
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:37,266
Yes. I'm going to go and see

513
01:06:37,475 --> 01:06:41,100
before some uncontrolled voice
comes this way.

514
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:46,016
- Are you leaving?
- Just for a few days.

515
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,058
Now go with Sister Evangelina,
you need to rest.

516
01:07:05,266 --> 01:07:07,975
- No!
- What do you mean?

517
01:07:08,183 --> 01:07:11,558
A future Indian chief must know
how to obey if he wants to lead.

518
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:14,433
Look at White Fang.
White Fang, go to the dog house.

519
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:18,266
Then?

520
01:07:19,766 --> 01:07:21,641
Let's go.

521
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,850
I have to go, unfortunately.

522
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,100
I told you to knock!

523
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:47,308
Don't worry, I'll have the door taken,
so the problem is solved.

524
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:50,683
You'll have to solve another one.

525
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:54,433
You are not my type.

526
01:07:57,433 --> 01:07:59,975
This is a non-existent problem.

527
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:03,600
I am the one who chooses.

528
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:13,058
- Did you want to talk to me, Beauty?
- Later.

529
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:18,725
No, no, go ahead.
I have no secrets with her.

530
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:22,975
You need to get out
of my way. Is that clear?

531
01:08:25,308 --> 01:08:28,058
No, it's not clear at all.

532
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:30,433
All right.

533
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:35,558
Anyway, it's about her. She doesn't
have to go on the mission anymore.

534
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:37,975
I don't like her friendship
with the nun.

535
01:08:38,183 --> 01:08:41,266
Is that the friendship
that bothers you?

536
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:46,016
My daughter
will never come here again!

537
01:08:51,016 --> 01:08:52,308
We'll see.

538
01:09:29,183 --> 01:09:30,808
What's up?

539
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:47,808
Come here.

540
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:57,350
- Come here and punch me.
- But why?

541
01:09:57,558 --> 01:09:59,891
Punch me and run away!

542
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,100
White Fang, be good.

543
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:58,516
Shut up. What's the matter with you?

544
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:01,891
- Why is he barking?
- Maybe he senses danger.

545
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,683
Why are you nervous? You're here,
nothing can happen to us.

546
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:08,641
- What's the matter with you?
- Where is he going?

547
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:24,308
White Fang! Why are you doing this?

548
01:11:24,516 --> 01:11:26,975
Come on, be good.

549
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:35,725
No, White Fang!

550
01:14:35,975 --> 01:14:37,975
Not like that!

551
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,516
Stop! Stop!

552
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:43,850
Let him go, stay still!

553
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:48,641
Come here, let him go! Obey!

554
01:15:43,266 --> 01:15:46,933
It's for Kurt Janssen, the inspector
of the mines. Before I give it...

555
01:15:47,141 --> 01:15:49,516
You're not going to give it to him.

556
01:15:51,558 --> 01:15:53,558
Whatever you want, Beauty.

557
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:03,808
- It is useless for me to tell you...
- Rest assured, I won't talk.

558
01:16:04,016 --> 01:16:05,641
Mr. Hall.

559
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:17,391
"New..."

560
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,933
Don't strain your brain.

561
01:16:23,183 --> 01:16:25,058
New gold deposits

562
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:30,141
have been discovered in Nome,
on the west coast.

563
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:35,350
- Do you know what that means?
- Yes. The end of Dawson.

564
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,350
That's right.

565
01:16:41,016 --> 01:16:43,350
You are right, my dear friend.

566
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,600
When the news will spread

567
01:16:48,475 --> 01:16:53,058
this city will become a desert.
- We'll make sure no one will know!

568
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,933
Yes.

569
01:16:57,058 --> 01:17:01,016
It is possible,
until the boat arrives.

570
01:17:01,225 --> 01:17:02,933
Right.

571
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:05,350
When the boat comes it will be known.

572
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:10,350
- Nobody can stop it.
- So...

573
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:19,016
I'll leave Dawson with no regrets.

574
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:23,975
I squeezed
every last drop out of it.

575
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:30,600
Take care of the preparations,
there's no more time to lose.

576
01:17:31,558 --> 01:17:32,975
Wait.

577
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:38,016
I won't leave here without the thing
I'm most interested in.

578
01:17:39,433 --> 01:17:43,433
- Krista is not an object.
- They all are to me.

579
01:17:43,683 --> 01:17:48,433
I told Beauty that I won't work for
him anymore. He'll find a new singer!

580
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:56,516
Tell him I lost my voice.

581
01:17:56,725 --> 01:18:00,016
Don't be an idiot. If he wants
to see you, there's a reason.

582
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:03,100
Nothing can make me go to him!

583
01:18:04,683 --> 01:18:07,391
What if it's something
about Oatley?

584
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:12,058
- What about my father?
- Ask Beauty.

585
01:18:20,225 --> 01:18:22,225
I'm going out for a minute, sister.

586
01:18:23,516 --> 01:18:25,516
My respects, sister.

587
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,266
Mitsah?

588
01:18:37,225 --> 01:18:40,183
Go find Father Oatley,
tell him to come here immediately.

589
01:18:40,391 --> 01:18:42,016
Yes, sister.

590
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:49,433
Krista, it's warm and sunny
in California.

591
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,683
After all this snow my
proposal should make you happy.

592
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:59,808
All your proposals
have one thing in common,

593
01:19:00,683 --> 01:19:05,725
I'm not interested in them.
- Don't use that tone.

594
01:19:10,766 --> 01:19:12,350
Listen.

595
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:17,433
I have never in my life been
so patient with a woman,

596
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:20,558
I have never courted them,
never prayed to them.

597
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:22,766
It doesn't seem like it either.

598
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:29,475
I might as well, though.

599
01:19:34,266 --> 01:19:38,600
Save yourself this humiliation,
it wouldn't do any good.

600
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:41,558
Goodbye, Mr. Beauty!

601
01:19:46,891 --> 01:19:48,891
What does this mean?

602
01:19:50,683 --> 01:19:52,891
Since prayers don't help....

603
01:20:28,933 --> 01:20:31,516
Get up, you actress!

604
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:35,016
Get up...

605
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:44,016
Krista... Krista!

606
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,933
Let's get her to the mission
right away, to the nun.

607
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:52,016
You can't, Beauty. You shouldn't have
shown her that telegram.

608
01:20:52,225 --> 01:20:56,558
If she'd say that gold was found
in Nome, we're ruined.

609
01:20:56,766 --> 01:20:59,475
She won't be able to talk anymore,
she's dead.

610
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:02,058
She's dead...

611
01:21:16,058 --> 01:21:18,058
My baby girl...

612
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,058
That's why you killed her....

613
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:40,641
Because she wouldn't talk! For this!

614
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,516
Now she won't sing anymore
because she's dead!

615
01:21:46,725 --> 01:21:48,683
They killed her...

616
01:21:48,891 --> 01:21:50,975
They killed her!

617
01:21:51,183 --> 01:21:52,975
Do you know why?

618
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:57,975
They didn't want her to say
that someone found gold in Nome!

619
01:21:58,183 --> 01:22:00,350
They killed her because she knew!

620
01:22:00,558 --> 01:22:05,808
There is gold in Nome,
big veins of gold! Gold!

621
01:22:06,016 --> 01:22:09,016
Be cursed! There is gold in Nome!

622
01:22:09,266 --> 01:22:12,475
- Yes, there is gold!
- What do you say?

623
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:17,141
There is gold in Nome! New veins!
They have found gold!

624
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,933
- Is it possible?
- Run to Nome! Run to Nome!

625
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:24,975
I heard it from Beauty.
They hid it from you!

626
01:22:25,183 --> 01:22:28,808
You guys have been scammed,
you have always been robbed!

627
01:22:29,016 --> 01:22:31,350
There is gold in Nome!

628
01:22:31,558 --> 01:22:36,641
They killed my daughter
so she wouldn't say it!

629
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:40,100
There is gold in Nome!
There is gold in Nome!

630
01:22:40,308 --> 01:22:45,641
They found the gold! They wanted
to keep it a secret from you...

631
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:51,350
They killed my daughter
so that she wouldn't tell...

632
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,600
- Open up!
- Open the door!

633
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,641
- You must open up!
- Open up, come on!

634
01:23:04,183 --> 01:23:06,808
Our money!

635
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:10,683
Beauty said that the bonds
were like money.

636
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:14,266
Your money is tied up for one year.

637
01:23:14,475 --> 01:23:17,350
I'm out of here!

638
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:22,100
Let's leave, there's gold in Nome,
but first let's go to Beauty!

639
01:23:22,308 --> 01:23:24,391
Yes, let's go to the saloon!

640
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:44,100
- Have you heard?
- I want to know the truth.

641
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:48,350
For some it was an accident,
for others Father Oatley is right

642
01:23:48,558 --> 01:23:53,308
but he also says
that Krista was his daughter.

643
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:55,350
It's true.

644
01:23:56,725 --> 01:23:58,600
She was.

645
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,975
They escaped!

646
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:30,891
Go, White Fang!

647
01:24:49,266 --> 01:24:51,100
What do you want?

648
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,100
Mitsah!

649
01:25:27,683 --> 01:25:30,433
If they come in here,
I'll kill the kid.

650
01:25:36,516 --> 01:25:39,391
Silence! Silence, listen to me!

651
01:25:40,225 --> 01:25:43,683
- Please!
- Out of the way, this is man stuff!

652
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:47,350
You are right, but...
Please listen to me!

653
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:50,516
I too have come to Dawson City
from very far away.

654
01:25:50,725 --> 01:25:53,558
All of you have come here
looking for something,

655
01:25:53,766 --> 01:25:57,266
but only a few of you
have actually found gold.

656
01:25:57,475 --> 01:25:59,641
Most of the lucky ones,
unfortunately,

657
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:02,766
has been robbed by a criminal!

658
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:08,558
Yes, Beauty Smith has speculated
on you with evilness and cynicism.

659
01:26:45,808 --> 01:26:49,558
Please! Dawson City
shall not be remembered

660
01:26:49,766 --> 01:26:54,058
as a violent city. It is
a responsibility you do not deserve.

661
01:26:54,308 --> 01:26:56,308
You don't want to...

662
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:05,100
Mitsah!

663
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,933
White Fang...

664
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,141
White Fang, don't run away!

665
01:30:22,308 --> 01:30:24,725
Hall, dynamite, quick!

666
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,683
Send those people back, Scott!
Or I'll blow the dam!

667
01:30:43,933 --> 01:30:46,641
Drop the gun, Beauty, and surrender!

668
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:51,141
Scott, I'm not kidding!
I told you to send them away!

669
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:56,141
He is capable of doing it
and the water would devastate us all.

670
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:02,100
- I have to stop him.
- Jason, no, that's crazy!

671
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,808
If you care about your life,
stay where you are!

672
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:43,100
You got the trick, White Fang.

673
01:32:24,183 --> 01:32:27,891
- The fuse, Hall!
- Go, you beast!

674
01:32:28,141 --> 01:32:31,558
The fuse! We've got to tear it off!

675
01:32:36,058 --> 01:32:40,141
- Back up, get out of the way!
- Jason, get out of the way, run!

676
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:44,433
Back off!

677
01:32:45,016 --> 01:32:47,016
Go! Go!

678
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:35,808
Come on!

679
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,683
We made it!

680
01:33:52,058 --> 01:33:56,391
- Where is the dog?
- We didn't see any dog.

681
01:34:00,225 --> 01:34:03,558
I'm going to stay here with Mr. Kurt,
I want to wait for White Fang.

682
01:34:03,766 --> 01:34:08,516
It's no use, I told you,
he was swept away by the water.

683
01:34:09,433 --> 01:34:14,308
You'll return to your tribe and find
many children like you and many dogs.

684
01:34:14,516 --> 01:34:17,100
White Fang is not dead.

685
01:34:17,308 --> 01:34:20,725
- Goodbye, Kurt.
- Goodbye, Jason.

686
01:34:20,933 --> 01:34:24,558
Let's go.
An Indian chief never cries.

687
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:28,891
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

688
01:34:40,933 --> 01:34:43,350
Goodbye, Kurt. Goodbye.

689
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,183
I'll be back soon, I promise!

690
01:36:30,683 --> 01:36:34,891
Now you know the gold diggers,
they have a fever on them.

691
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:39,725
Someone finds gold
and everyone runs to the unknown.

692
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:42,308
I wrote to my order

693
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:46,975
that Nome
is going to need a hospital.

694
01:36:47,225 --> 01:36:49,808
Yeah, Nome.

695
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,725
White Fang!

696
01:37:01,141 --> 01:37:03,558
White Fang, come here!

697
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:31,725
Help him!

698
01:38:10,308 --> 01:38:12,891
Here I am, I'm coming!

699
01:38:28,808 --> 01:38:32,391
Come on! I'm coming!

700
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:40,975
Good job! Good job!

701
01:38:43,058 --> 01:38:46,558
Good boy! You are saved!
You are saved!

702
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:55,016
Good boy! Good boy!
