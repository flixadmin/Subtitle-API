1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,955
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,128
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,378
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,929
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,181
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,056
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,852
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,143
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,857
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,905
I didn't kill Clifford DeVoe.

12
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,315
Tricked ya.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,399
<i>Barry, they took a hostage.</i>

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,027
<i>- Who did he take?
- Your dad.</i>

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,281
I'm ready for my super-suit.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,492
This "tarp" is your super-suit.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,782
What is this? A puppy's raincoat?

18
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,577
Nice job, rookie.

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,161
I won't be a fugitive.

20
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,542
If I'm convicted, I'm not gonna run.

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,794
<i>We find the defendant guilty.</i>

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,403
We're losing control!
Deploy smoke grenades!

23
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,025
<i>Deploy smoke grenades!</i>

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,450
<i>We need backup!</i>

25
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,793
They're back in! Lock it down!

26
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,763
Let's move. Move out.

27
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,701
Fine. Just tell us what you want.

28
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,830
<i>I want you to back off
or I will detonate this thing!</i>

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,461
Okay, calm down.
Nobody needs to get hurt today.

30
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,296
<i>You just follow instructions</i>

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,550
and everybody here gets to live to
see the sunshine tomorrow, all right?

32
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,010
And I better not
see the Flash either.

33
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,595
All right!

34
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,551
First, I want a car!

35
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,269
Something eco-friendly.

36
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,972
Like a... Like a Prius.

37
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,892
- Okay, we can do that.
- Good.

38
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,569
<i>Right.</i>

39
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,812
<i>Now, second...</i>

40
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,449
I want a plane, okay?
A private plane.

41
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,239
<i>Okay?</i>

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,320
And a salad, all right?

43
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,155
- I'm counting calories.
- Okay.

44
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,116
It's gonna take us
an hour to arrange that.

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,246
You better hurry up,

46
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,578
'cause these hostages
don't have much time.

47
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,012
Should've gone with a steak, pal.

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,637
'Cause it's the last
decent meal you're getting

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,593
for the next five to 10 years.

50
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,689
Who the hell are you?

51
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,774
Your friendly
neighborhood superhero.

52
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,943
You can call me...

53
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,779
Mr...

54
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,028
One second.

55
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,736
Guys, this is a huge moment for me.
What's my name?

56
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
I was wondering where
you were going with that.

57
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,914
Hey, hey, where are my hostages?

58
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,255
Ah... Bathroom break.
They just couldn't hold it anymore.

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,003
Don't worry, though.
They're totally safe.

60
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get back, freak!

61
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,085
"Freak"?

62
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,638
Oh, sticks and stones
may break my bones, buddy.

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,762
Well, they used to. Not anymore.

64
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,138
I'll blow this whole city block.

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,187
Ah... You do realize
you're a part of that block, right?

66
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,230
Come on, man, it's a weekday.

67
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,309
People just wanna get off work,
go home, watch the boob tube.

68
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,644
So why don't you
take off that vest and...

69
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,894
Don't touch me!

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,536
Ralph, are you okay?

71
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,292
Yeah, just wicked heartburn.

72
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,761
<i>Let this be a lesson to all of you
would-be criminals out there.</i>

73
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,969
<i>Catching you won't be
too much of a stretch.</i>

74
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,814
<i>And so, our streets are safe again,</i>

75
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:39,861
<i>thanks to Central City's
funniest new hero, the Stretchy Man.</i>

76
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,229
<i>Okay.</i>

77
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,647
Embarrassing.

78
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,821
Cisco, next time
you're going with him.

79
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,820
Iris, a chicken needs to
leave its roost sooner or later,

80
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,873
especially when that chicken insists
on doing his own solo mission.

81
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,915
- This is bad.
- This is really bad.

82
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,785
"Stretchy Man."
That's a terrible name.

83
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,874
Also, now that
I'm gonna be on TV all the time,

84
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,796
this gray suit gotta go.

85
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,294
Hey. Easy, chickadee.

86
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,713
<i>No, Ralph, I meant you, okay?</i>

87
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,261
That bomb could've
torn you to shreds.

88
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,555
Or Joe, or any of the police outside.

89
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,221
Relax, ladies,
my cells are completely polygamized.

90
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,019
- Polymerized?
- Yeah, that.

91
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,689
Which means they can stretch
and take a bomb blast.

92
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,610
- Oh, my God.
- Dibny is in-dib-structible.

93
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,778
Okay, Ralph,
you are missing the point.

94
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,275
You need to be more cautious.

95
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,148
No, no, no.
You are missing the point.

96
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,781
What I really need, guys,
is a new superhero name.

97
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,821
Ramon, you've had all this time.
You can't come up with anything?

98
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,248
Patience, okay? I'm getting to you.

99
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,541
I've just been a little preoccupied,

100
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,584
what with Barry being in prison
and all!

101
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,340
You find anything that might prove
DeVoe framed Barry yet?

102
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,472
My dad and Cecile are meeting

103
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,425
with Judge Hankerson tomorrow
to go over his appeal.

104
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,853
We've been poring through the
evidence piece-by-piece, but...

105
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,639
Don't worry, Iris,
we're gonna get him out.

106
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,812
<i>Hey, has Barry joined a gang yet?</i>

107
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,311
I got some friends on the inside,
I can make some calls.

108
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,317
Shut up, Ralph.

109
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,942
Okay.

110
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,703
I will stop helping now.

111
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,587
You can watch the clock all you want,
but it won't go any faster.

112
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,883
You're Barry Allen, right?

113
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,135
Henry Allen's kid?

114
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,974
- I'm...
- Axel Walker.

115
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,890
You and your dad
kidnapped my dad once.

116
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,224
Yeah. Right.

117
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,107
Pudding?

118
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,434
Lunch lady gave me extra.
I think she has a crush on me.

119
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,815
Hey, word on the block is
you carved up some professor.

120
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,616
He give you a bad grade or something?

121
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,236
I didn't kill anybody.

122
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,824
Yeah, sure.

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,071
Everyone's innocent in here.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,741
Especially that guy.

125
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,660
Yeah, Big Sir.

126
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,293
He's really innocent.

127
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,958
This is grosser than usual.
Does pudding go bad?

128
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,293
Axel, what do you want from me?

129
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,798
To be murder buds.

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,096
You know,
we could share trade secrets.

131
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,095
I'd love to hear how you
carved up that college quack.

132
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,433
I don't need any friends in here.

133
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,440
Man, I do not feel good.

134
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,283
Get him up.

135
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,998
You got mud on my bright whites.

136
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,749
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

137
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,334
"Sorry" is right.

138
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,637
First week in Iron Heights
is often the hardest, Mr. Allen.

139
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,474
You've already seen what happens
when a few inmates try to revolt.

140
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,056
<i>Acclimating to your new life
will take time.</i>

141
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,644
<i>Always does.</i>

142
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,396
<i>In the meantime,</i>

143
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,110
do your best to stay clean in here.

144
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,774
Oh, and Mr. Allen?

145
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,658
Your 1:30 is waiting for you.

146
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,708
Hey.

147
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,877
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me, too.

148
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,217
How's it going?

149
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,507
It's not as bad as
I thought it would be.

150
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,801
And, hey, you're talking to
the newest member

151
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,136
of the Iron Heights janitorial staff.

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,471
I'm the fastest mop alive.

153
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,853
Well, we've been
surveilling the DeVoes 24/7.

154
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,154
I mean, they must have
made a mistake somewhere, right?

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,074
And I've been poring over
all of the evidence with Dad.

156
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,609
We are gonna get you
out of there, Barry.

157
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,947
I know you will.

158
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,205
How's the rest of the team?
I saw Ralph on TV.

159
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,700
Ralph is...

160
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,826
Getting a little cocky.

161
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,042
Yeah. I was when I started, too.
It happens.

162
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,297
Yeah.

163
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,960
Iris, it's okay.

164
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,256
I just can't believe
this is our new normal, Barry.

165
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,846
I don't want this to be our lives.

166
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,062
You're gonna find something.
I know it.

167
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,308
Closing time!

168
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,391
Wrap 'em up!

169
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,977
I just wish
I could touch your hand again.

170
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,447
You will.

171
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,946
I promise.

172
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,537
I'll see you tomorrow?

173
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,833
Every tomorrow.

00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,521
Walker here
spewed all over his cellmate.

176
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,398
Says he's got cramps.

177
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,239
Who are you? Where's Nurse Hill?

178
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,988
Out sick.
Looks like he ate the pudding.

179
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,320
Yeah. How do you know that?

180
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,247
Because I'm the one who sent it.

181
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,456
Come on, Axel. Let's go.

182
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,548
Mom?

183
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,559
Walker and the nurse
used tranquilizers

184
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,136
on two more guards on their way out.

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,847
And nothing tipped you off
that this nurse might be a criminal?

186
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,273
Her background check was clean.

187
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,691
She said her name
was Lindsay Fineheart.

188
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,518
<i>She was sent over
by our staffing company.</i>

189
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,151
I'm gonna need the hard drive
of the surveillance footage

190
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,278
from the security cameras
in the infirmary.

191
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,610
Well, unfortunately,
we're still analog here in gen pop.

192
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,740
It'll take a while to dub the tapes.

193
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,112
In the meantime,

194
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,822
I'm having Fineheart's file
brought down for you.

195
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,248
How's Barry doing?

196
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,710
He's a model inmate.
Just like his dad.

197
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,708
- Do you mind if I...
- No.

198
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,009
Let me check on that file.

199
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,922
<i>Barr.</i>

200
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,972
Joe. Hey!

201
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,392
What are you doing here?

202
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,600
Axel Walker escaped.
Some new nurse helped him get out.

203
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,732
He was in here
because of the pudding.

204
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,986
- How do you know that?
- He was complaining about the taste.

205
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,611
Hey, let me help with this,
all right?

206
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,783
- Barry.
- No...

207
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,533
Is Cisco having any luck figuring out
how to bypass the system?

208
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,910
Once he does that I can phase out
of here. I can help you track him.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,662
Barry, you need to stay put for now.

210
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,667
Trickster is just
a messed-up kid.

211
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,744
We can handle him.

212
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,875
No, I know, of course. I just...

213
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,339
I'm already tired of feeling useless,
you know?

214
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,759
The only thing you should focus on
in here is watching your back.

215
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,257
Pretty sure
cops can't touch inmates, so...

216
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,592
Otherwise, I'd give you a hug.

217
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,260
Stay strong, Barr.

218
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,766
Mmm-hmm.

219
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,768
- Detective.
- Sir.

220
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,025
Well, this is her.

221
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,480
This woman's name
isn't Lindsay Fineheart.

222
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,570
Her name is Zoey Clark.

223
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,734
James Jesse had a girlfriend?

224
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,660
Yeah. She called herself "Prank."

225
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,411
Back in the day,
she was Bonnie to Jesse's Clyde.

226
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,959
No matter what,
whether it was attempted murder,

227
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,833
arson, robbery,
she was always by his side.

228
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,758
Man! What were people wearing
back then?

229
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,087
Zoey Clark was the beneficiary
to Clarx Toys' empire.

230
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,798
Not much of an empire.
All those stores closed 20 years ago.

231
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,259
Looks like she has Bachelor's degrees
in Arts and Applied Sciences

232
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,889
as well as a Masters in Chemistry.

233
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,347
"Trickster and Prank were responsible
for a series of terrorist attacks

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,307
"across Central City,
including the destruction of...

235
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,902
"The Gadzooka Bubblegum Company."

236
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,444
I always wondered why my favorite gum
suddenly disappeared in the '90s.

237
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,858
I have it on my Earth.

238
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,118
- You do not.
- I just said we did.

239
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,411
- You do not.
- We do.

240
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,955
Anyway, after Jesse was arrested,
she disappeared.

241
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,452
She's been a fugitive ever since.

242
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,001
Looks like Axel was born nine months
after Zoey was last seen.

243
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,794
I bet she left town
to take care of her son.

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,212
And she came back
to bust him out of prison

245
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,540
and pick up where she left off.

246
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,465
Well, I'm digging into C.C.P.D. files

247
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,384
to see if she had
any other known associates.

248
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,587
I'll set the satellite
to do a search grid. Ramon.

249
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,513
Hey, how about you hook me up
with some of that gum?

250
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,716
- Why don't you breach yourself?
- Sounds like an insult.

251
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,800
Kind of was.

252
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,682
Hey, Ralph,
do you wanna go to your usual spots,

253
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,308
see if any of your contacts
have seen her?

254
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,766
Sure. Need a chaperone.
Caitlin, you're up.

255
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,146
It's happy hour. You're buying.

256
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,898
Come on.
Use Killer Frost's credit card.

257
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,729
- No way, Jose.
- You think Ralphy's made of money?

258
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,327
Where are you two hiding?

259
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,579
<i>Wow!</i>

260
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,742
What is this place?

261
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,669
- It's all that remains of Clarx Toys.
- Oh!

262
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,546
It's cold in here.

263
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,880
Oh, awesome!

264
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,420
<i>I made the news!</i>

265
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,928
Not "awesome."
Now the police are looking for you.

266
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,726
As soon as night falls,
we're out of Central City.

267
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,223
And then
we'll go meet up with Dad, right?

268
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,806
That's why you broke me out.

269
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,107
Because Dad wanted to see me, right?

270
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,775
Not exactly.

271
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,019
Axel, I wanted you back in my life.

272
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,613
Right, but what about Dad?

273
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,238
Well, he broke out a year ago,
and he hasn't come looking for you...

274
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,323
He doesn't care.

275
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,617
Of course he does.

276
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,495
Axel, your dad's a deadbeat.

277
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,376
He doesn't want to be a part
of this family and he never did.

278
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,086
Don't talk about him like that.

279
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,674
Honey, I'm sorry, it's just that...

280
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,721
You just don't know him like I do.

281
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,176
Do you know what it was like for me
when you were growing up?

282
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,980
While you were idolizing your dad,

283
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,648
I was the one making your dinner.

284
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,737
While you were watching him
terrorize the city on TV,

285
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,656
I was the one driving you to school.

286
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,280
I was the one making sure
you got your homework done.

287
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,407
I was the one packing
the lunches in the morning.

288
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,409
- I was there for you.
- I know. I know, Mom!

289
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,581
Okay? Now we can get him back.

290
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,208
I don't want him back.

291
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,245
I want us to go be free together.

292
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,250
I never wanted you
to end up like your father.

293
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,886
Well, it's too late for that, Mom.

294
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,549
I just need to get Dad's attention.

295
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,685
I'll show him that someone in
this family still has a funny bone,

296
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,141
Mom.

297
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,650
<i>...everyone walks away safe.</i>

298
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,734
<i>And so, Central City has a new,
sexier model of superhero.</i>

299
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,703
<i>Me, kids.</i>

300
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,663
And I know just how I'm gonna do it.

301
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,032
I'm the sexy model.

302
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,661
<i>Anyone want an autograph?
Autograph, anyone?</i>

303
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,792
No, Axel. Axel!

304
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,669
Axel!

305
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,758
Heard you had a little one-on-one
time with a badge this morning.

306
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,218
Oh, God.

307
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,891
First, you dirty up my shoes.

308
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,860
Now, you're snitching to the cops?

309
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,562
<i>You've had quite the first week,
haven't you?</i>

310
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,314
I don't want any trouble.

311
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,819
Too late.

312
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,587
This isn't over!

313
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,590
Thanks.

314
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,137
Hey, how's the search coming?

315
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,565
Harry and I
already set all the parameters.

316
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,189
Just got 300 square miles
to comb through. So...

317
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,268
Yeah.

318
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,610
- That's not good.
<i>- Hello, Central City!</i>

319
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,695
It's been far, far too long since my
beautiful face graced your screens.

320
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,452
This kid's got a face for radio.

321
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,580
Trickster's hijacking
the city's broadcasting signals.

322
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,583
Today, we're going to play
a little game I like to call,

323
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,381
"What does this do?"

324
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,130
<i>Looks like a regular old bouncy ball.</i>

325
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,882
But what does this do?

326
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,383
- Cisco.
- Tracing.

327
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,805
<i>Let's find out!</i>

328
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,599
If and when
you throw it hard enough...

329
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,360
<i>Kaboom!</i>

330
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,655
He's downtown.
Corner of Demeo and Bilson.

331
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,864
Bring me the Stretchy Man.
Or else you're gonna go "boom-boom."

332
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,996
My first supervillain
Thunderdome challenge.

333
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,702
This is awesome!

334
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,913
Ralph, you do not know this guy.
He's dangerous.

335
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,500
He's throwing bouncy balls
and wearing a bedazzled peacoat.

336
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,880
I got this.

337
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,589
Still haven't taken that off, huh?

338
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,216
I sleep in this.

339
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,886
You mind breaching me there?
It's a lot faster.

340
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,183
Where are you, Stretchy Man?

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,773
I've got plenty more
where that came from.

342
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,778
Nice suit, Fall Out Boy.

343
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,697
Yuck.

344
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,532
Yours could use some work.

345
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,906
Oh, look at that cutting wit.

346
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,029
You wanted me, here I am.

347
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,707
Great. Do want to play, uh, catch?

348
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,584
You're really blowing this
supervillain fight.

349
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,468
Well, it's my Central City
return party.

350
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,220
And your death will make me a star.

351
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,260
Child's play.

352
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,430
Okay. All right.

353
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,600
This is what I call
the "Hurty-Squirty Gun."

354
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,108
Tricked ya!

355
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,945
It's acid,
with a little ingredient X.

356
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,996
I call it "axid."

357
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,576
He's panicking.
His heart rate is off the charts.

358
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,751
Ralph, are you okay?

359
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,124
Help!

360
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,836
Burn, Stretchy Man. Burn!

361
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,553
Not today, Satan.

362
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,979
What the hell did he do to me?

363
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,402
What the hell was that stuff?

364
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,078
Looks like Axel
created some sort of super acid.

365
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,076
Yeah, it's got a pH level
in the negative 50s,

366
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,657
and all it did
was burn through your skin?

367
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,368
If it were anybody else, it would

368
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,452
melt right through them
like Xenomorph blood.

369
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,504
- Like in... <i>Aliens.
- Aliens.</i>

370
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,503
But you said my cells
were polymerized.

371
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,584
- No.
- You said nothing could hurt them.

372
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,794
Dibny, I didn't say that.

373
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,879
I said your cells were bonded unlike
anything I've ever seen.

374
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,805
I've never seen acid like this,
and so,

375
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,757
cannot be responsible for things
I have never seen.

376
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,600
- It definitely hurts.
- Mmm-hmm. Of course.

377
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,098
Well, now we know
what your Kryptonite is.

378
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,096
What the hell is Kryptonite?

379
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,564
- What?
- Aw, come on.

380
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,890
Think I'm gonna heal?

381
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,100
- Eventually.
- Probably.

382
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,184
"Probably"?

383
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,937
Well, you know...

384
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,980
I thought I was indestructible.

385
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,356
So did we.

386
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,066
- Get out.
- All right.

387
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,613
Okay, well, Caitlin, you can treat
the wound and manage the pain. Right?

388
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,906
- As needed.
- Okay. Well,

389
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,990
the most important thing is
that you're safe.

390
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,620
Ralph... Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

391
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,999
Um... Axel's still out there.
We should track him down.

392
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,255
Oh, my God.

393
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,249
This might sting a little.

394
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,641
Excuse me. My wife was supposed
to be here a half-hour ago.

395
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,021
Could you see if...

396
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,811
Cool.

397
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,571
Hey.

398
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,249
I was just wondering
why you helped me.

399
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,455
Because your dad helped me.

400
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,979
- Oh, are you okay?
- No, Mom. I'm not.

401
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,690
Stretchy Man's still alive.

402
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,520
All Dad's gonna see is that I failed.

403
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,601
He won't want to see me.

404
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,738
Who am I kidding?
I'll never be like him.

405
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,491
I think you can be
even better than him.

406
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,949
You don't see it, but I do.

407
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,536
You're the real Trickster, Boo-Boo.

408
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,625
What's gotten into you?

409
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,620
Okay, I didn't take my meds.

410
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,621
Mom!

411
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,997
You did that for me?

412
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,754
I would do anything for you, Boo-Boo.

413
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,381
Would you kill with me?

414
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,929
It's like riding a tricycle.
You never forget.

415
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,007
Let's paint the town red.

416
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,263
I know whose blood we should use.

417
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,562
We just need a new trick
to strong-arm Stretch Armstrong.

418
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,721
- No.
- No?

419
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,148
What we need is something better.

420
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,105
Because if there is one thing
I've realized,

421
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,191
it's behind every great trick

422
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,903
is an even better Prank.

423
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,657
Hey, guys.

424
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,075
Any luck finding Trickster?

425
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,952
Joe, geo-tracking is an art form.

426
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,251
It takes precision, it takes finesse,
it takes grace.

427
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,873
It requires none of those things.

428
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,330
Simply the fact that
he's not a meta-human.

429
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,915
Regular humans are harder to track.

430
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,841
Is there anything
you can't suck the fun out of?

431
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,084
Leaf peeping.

432
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,254
Trickster.

433
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,682
<i>Hello again, Central City.</i>

434
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,349
It's time for
the exciting new game show,

435
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,101
"Wheel of Misfortune."

436
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,935
<i>With prizes so amazing,
you'll think you died.</i>

437
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,394
<i>And if you play your cards right,</i>

438
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,898
<i>you just might.</i>

439
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:27,979
<i>Here's your host,</i>

440
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,609
<i>the murderous matriarch,</i>

441
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,445
Prank.

442
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,739
What do we have in store for tonight?

443
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,458
<i>Well, we have chills, thrills</i>

444
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,160
<i>and plenty of kills.</i>

445
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,916
<i>These guys are
absolutely nuts.</i>

446
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,499
So, why don't
we meet our first contestants?

447
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,421
Ta-da!

448
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,922
Ha-la!

449
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,263
They've got hostages.

450
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,557
<i>Shocking prizes are in store.</i>

451
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,807
But, Prank,
what about the grand prize?

452
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,272
Well, I'm so glad you asked.

453
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,977
Because we have an axid shower.

454
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Oh, no.</i>

455
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,198
Sorry, Mr. Beebo.

456
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,579
Oh...

457
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,659
<i>Beebo loves getting clean.</i>

458
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,711
<i>Beebo has an owie...</i>

459
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,466
- Cisco.
- Triangulating their signal.

460
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,846
We need a special VIP to come down

461
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,726
<i>for our special show.</i>

462
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,186
<i>So, if you're watching,
Stretchy Man,</i>

463
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,643
why don't you come on down
and spin the wheel?

464
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,399
<i>You have one hour</i>

465
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,481
or these nice people die.

466
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,442
There you are.

467
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,574
They're at the old Clarx Toys factory
in Lawrence Hills.

468
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,698
<i>Tick tock, Stretchy Man.
Time's a-wasting.</i>

469
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,873
<i>So let's</i>

470
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,044
spin that wheel!

471
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,667
I'm gonna have
C.C.P.D. create a perimeter

472
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,377
a few blocks away,
so they can't escape.

473
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,758
Harry, how are you coming with
the solvent for Trickster's axid?

474
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,307
Well, slowly. Very difficult
to neutralize a solvent

475
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,635
that hasn't existed until today.

476
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,687
- You got 59 minutes.
- All I need is 58.

477
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,931
Ralph, suit up.

478
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,527
Well, you wanted a new suit,
didn't you?

479
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,071
I even made it pocket-sized.

480
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,481
Is it axid-proof?

481
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,035
I can't do it, guys.

482
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,289
These people need our help.

483
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,460
Yeah. Sorry, but me getting melted,
that is a deal-breaker.

484
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,536
Were you only doing this

485
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,746
because you thought
you couldn't get hurt?

486
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,298
Yeah. Why the hell else
would I do this?

487
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,385
Ralph, last year, I thought
I was gonna die too.

488
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,095
But that didn't stop me.

489
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,136
Okay. Well, that's
the difference between us, then.

490
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,468
I'm not that strong
in the face of danger.

491
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,636
I'm out.

492
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,325
<i>Psst, Barry.</i>

493
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,915
Ralph, what are you doing here?

494
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,544
I'm breaking you out.

495
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,971
I mean, come on. You're a hero.

496
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,182
Slap on some tights, go be heroic.

497
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,854
Ralph, there are
cameras everywhere. Okay?

498
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,354
They would know within minutes
that I'd vanished.

499
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,060
So? A minute to us
is like hours to you.

500
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,737
Just vibrate through the walls,
go slap Trickster around

501
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,156
and you'll be back before

502
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,824
whatever passes
for dinner in this place.

503
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,446
- Trickster attacked again?
- Yeah.

504
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,994
He and his mommy want
to tussle with me,

505
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,787
but I have a rule
against fighting terrorists

506
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,989
with an Oedipus complex.

507
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,747
So, this looks like a job
for the F-L-A-S-H.

508
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,703
Sorry, why is this different?

509
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,706
You've done a good job
handling bad guys so far.

510
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,215
I got hurt.

511
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,059
Axel created some kind of acid that,

512
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,136
we're guessing,

513
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,680
can probably kill me.

514
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,391
I'm not ready to die.

515
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,614
Look, this job,

516
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,284
it has a way
of making you feel invincible.

517
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,035
But, every once in a while,
a little mortality check shows up.

518
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,542
I've been trying so hard
to ignore this feeling, but...

519
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,378
I'm not fearless like you are.

520
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,926
Ralph, I'm not fearless.

521
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,217
I mean, I wake up every day
in this cell

522
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,469
and feel like there's nothing
I can do to help anyone.

523
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,642
And, I mean, that terrifies me.

524
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,304
I used to be somebody who saved
and now I'm just Barry Allen,

525
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,230
inmate number 3562.

526
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,100
- So let me spring you.
- That's not my point.

527
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,947
Having the ability to help someone
but do nothing,

528
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,941
that is a far worse death

529
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,072
than anything
that Trickster has for you.

530
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,451
But rising above that fear
and saving those lives,

531
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,203
that's a greater life.

532
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,285
All right? So rise up.

533
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,086
I don't think it's a stretch for you.

534
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,505
- You really believe I can do that?
- Yes.

535
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,924
You just need to believe it yourself.

536
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,263
Hey, you know your way
out of here, right?

537
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,348
Yeah.

538
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,432
You got one hour.

539
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,493
Scans are reading some kind of
container on the roof. It looks new.

540
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,876
Galvanized steel. That's where
they're keeping the axid.

541
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,875
All right, I will neutralize it,
and you two guys,

542
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,006
you get the hostages out.
Oh...

543
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,003
We're gonna need the ice queen.

544
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,801
That's not how it works.
I can't just...

545
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,298
- Lexi LaRoche!
- Lexi LaRoche!

546
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,380
It's her childhood bully.

547
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,890
There's a lot of repressed anger
in there.

548
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,050
Let's go!

549
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,264
Oh, boy.

550
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,182
Here we go.

551
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,985
Thank you. Big Sir.

552
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,898
My dad saved your life in here,
didn't he?

553
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,358
That's why you helped me out.

554
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,025
How?

555
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,785
I had stomach pains for days.

556
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,628
<i>Your dad found me,</i>

557
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,131
figured my appendix
was about to burst.

558
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,962
Prison doctors are gone
for the night.

559
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,260
There's no way
they could've made it back in time.

560
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,924
But Doc Henry convinced Warden Wolfe
to do the surgery.

561
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,511
He operated and saved my life.

562
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,267
That's why you owed him.

563
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,099
Now we're even.

564
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,740
Big Sir.

565
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,215
Okay.

566
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:52,675
Remember, anything in here
that looks fun is probably lethal.

567
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,685
- Just like me.
- Nice. Okay.

568
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,979
<i>Let's deliver these delivery people
to safety.</i>

569
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,233
Or we could just leave them
and kill Trickster and Prank.

570
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,768
Remember that talk

571
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,478
about murdering your way
out of problems?

572
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,564
- Yeah, we don't do that.
- Yet.

573
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,109
I'm gonna get you out of here.

574
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,161
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

575
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,954
<i>Beebo likes to play.</i>

576
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,330
<i>Beebo.</i>

577
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,714
Tricked ya.

578
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,803
I'm guessing the plan didn't work.

579
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,842
Help!

580
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,687
Harry, it's a trap.
They've got Caitlin and Cisco.

581
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,557
- I'm on my way.
- No, you're not.

582
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,767
I am.

583
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,313
Then you're gonna need this.

584
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,495
Groovy.

585
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,338
Hey!

586
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,637
Leave him alone.

587
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,733
I told you you'd be sorry.

588
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,380
You won't get lucky twice.

589
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,601
Like father, like son, eh?

590
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,687
<i>Harry,
are you on the roof yet?</i>

591
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,940
Yes. And so is the axid.

592
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,357
All right.

593
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,156
You need to neutralize the axid.
We're running out of time.

594
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,581
<i>Yeah. Thank you. I'm aware of that.</i>

595
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,625
Oh-oh!

596
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,128
<i>Well, we asked for one hero.</i>

597
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,336
But now, we've got two.

598
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,046
<i>It's time
for our showcase showdown.</i>

599
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,130
<i>So let's spin that wheel</i>

600
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,763
<i>and see what fun prize
awaits our new friends.</i>

601
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:44,929
Harry?

602
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,522
<i>Tell me you got it.</i>

603
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,350
Don't got it.

604
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,236
Hurry up.

605
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,938
I haven't killed anyone in years.

606
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,067
<i>A tie?</i>

607
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,494
Hmm, I guess they die together.

608
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,848
Nice outfit.

609
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,718
Thanks. I've got a great tailor.

610
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,895
Now let everyone go, pranksters,
and no one gets hurt.

611
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,977
We thought you chickened out,
Stretchy Man.

612
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,983
Actually, I did.

613
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,856
See, I thought
I was pretty much invincible

614
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,562
until you
and your oversized water pistol

615
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,989
- put the fear of God in me.
- You're welcome.

616
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,233
And I was ready
to throw in the towel.

617
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,784
But then I visited a friend of mine.

618
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,114
And he helped me remember
that no one is fearless.

619
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,539
But real heroes,

620
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,829
they find a way
to rise above that fear

621
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,160
and make a difference anyway,

622
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,711
<i>even if it kills them in the process.</i>

623
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,585
<i>So, this is me,</i>

624
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,378
rising up,

625
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,842
hopefully without the dying part.

626
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,007
Now, let my friends go.

627
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,515
First of all, great speech.

628
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,682
So inspired. It melted my heart.

629
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,641
Thank you.
I worked on it on the way over.

630
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,102
Now let's melt yours.

631
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,562
<i>Shoot him.</i>

632
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,873
Oh! Boo-Boo!

633
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,213
I'd give up if I were you.

634
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,550
How about I melt
your friends instead?

635
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,629
<i>Harry, now.</i>

636
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,713
I don't got it.

637
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,797
<i>Harry?</i>

638
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,636
No!

639
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,774
Say goodbye to your little friends.

640
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,644
<i>Harry!</i>

641
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,072
It doesn't hurt.

642
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,200
It doesn't hurt!

643
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,911
I'm not dying.

644
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,789
Why am I not dying?

645
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,716
Because I got it.

646
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,341
Yes! Nice work, guys.

647
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,258
I'm gonna live! Whoo!

648
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,139
Don't even think about running.

649
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,764
- Anytime.
- Oh, yeah.

650
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,233
You got scissors anywhere?

651
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,772
You know what they say, Detective?

652
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,734
The family that slays together,
stays together.

653
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,069
- Yeah. In prison.
- Hey, come on.

654
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,903
You can't keep a Trickster
behind bars for long.

655
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:48,987
We'll see about that.

656
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,243
You were amazing.

657
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,995
Can we do it again in 10 to 15 years?

658
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,828
Boo-Boo, I'm gonna break us
out of here in two.

659
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,083
Get in the damn car.

660
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,301
Is it true that you took down
Trickster and Prank single-handedly?

661
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,007
<i>How long
have you been a superhero?</i>

662
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,433
<i>Are you single?</i>

663
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,102
Yes. About an hour. Oh, hell, yes.

664
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,596
Do you like shrimp?

665
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,767
No. But I'm sure the people
of Central City would love

666
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,397
to thank you, Stretchy Man.

667
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,354
That's not my name.

668
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,111
Then what should we call you?
I mean, you do stretch.

669
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,992
No, I don't stretch. I...

670
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,489
I contort.

671
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,788
I elasticize. I...

672
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,997
I elongate, man.

673
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,752
<i>"The Elongated Man"?</i>

674
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,834
<i>It was just an expression.</i>

675
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,424
It has a certain, <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to it.

676
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,967
I don't know.

677
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,045
- I like it, too.
- Well, I hate it.

678
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,631
Oh, maybe you should've let me
do the naming.

679
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,715
Exactly.

680
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,847
Don't worry. You'll get your chance.
There's no way this is gonna stick.

681
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,016
Probably gonna stick.

682
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,597
The Elongated Man?

683
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,933
Please. It's so literal.

684
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,189
You think Prince would have settled
for "Shorty Guitar Man"?

685
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,737
- Hey.
- No way. And like the Purple One,

686
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,692
I too need something that hints
at the true depth of my sexy nature.

687
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,698
- Like "The Flash"?
- Exactly.

688
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,496
He's a fast operator.
Gets the job done in seconds.

689
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,789
Or "Killer Frost."

690
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,832
What can I say?
When you got it, you got it.

691
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,201
You got it.

692
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,412
Hey, Joe.

693
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,626
Hmm?

694
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,873
What should I do?

695
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:28,512
Man, do whatever it takes
to keep this city safe.

696
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,635
Just like the rest of us.

697
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,345
I can live with that.

698
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,057
Guess I'll be looking out for you
a bit longer.

699
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,525
I didn't get involved
because I wanted a favor.

700
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,648
I just wanted to help.

701
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,193
Piece of advice. You want
to survive in here, find a friend.

702
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,783
Your father would be
very proud of you.

703
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,864
Thanks.

704
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,705
Did my dad call you Big Sir?

705
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,331
No.

706
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,582
He called me Dave.

707
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,964
Allen, you've got a visitor.

708
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,257
Well, whatever you said
to Ralph must've landed.

709
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,930
He risked his life to save Caitlin
and Cisco, thanks to you.

710
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,216
I just brought out
what was already inside him.

711
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,977
You seem to have that effect
on a lot of people.

712
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,727
What?

713
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,185
Just turns out being in here
isn't so different

714
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,395
from being out there.

715
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,864
Except we're not together.

716
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,239
And I can't touch you anymore.

717
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,235
Coffee? That's all I get
for being a hero?

718
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,321
What do you want, a cookie?

719
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,696
Don't mind if I do.

720
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,574
Come on, man.

721
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,750
The thing about wearing a mask is
no one even knows you're a good guy.

722
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,918
Them's the breaks, kid.

723
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,631
Aha! Yes. There's the delicious nectar.

724
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,587
Hey, thanks for getting this coffee,
by the way.

725
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,844
Who, me? I'm broke.

726
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,217
I didn't even bring my wallet
with me.

727
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,222
I don't even own a wallet.

728
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,020
- Are you serious?
- Allen always pays.

729
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,096
Oh, my God.

730
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,315
No worries.

731
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,357
The... Always pay it forward.

732
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,279
That's my motto, you know?

733
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,821
'Cause at any given moment, one of us
could need a helping hand.

734
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,700
Like now. You two total strangers,
you know, were short on cash

735
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,497
and then someone
just steps out of the blue

736
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,949
and helps out
in a totally random way. Am I right?

737
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,001
Uh-huh.

738
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,129
And, you know,
it's more than just karma.

739
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,457
It's the principle
of infinite consequence at work

740
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,041
in our lives.

741
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,092
And it's always expanding.

742
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,215
Creating positive sums
on an infinite basis.

743
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,640
Isn't that amazing?

744
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,760
Yes?

745
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,307
You know what's amazing?

746
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,355
- That shirt's pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

747
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,817
Thanks. Yeah. It's a classic.
<i>Oregon Trail.</i> I love this game.

748
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,314
Have a great day.

749
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,771
Okay.

750
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,901
A nice, beautiful girl
and Ralph Dibny doesn't offer her

751
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,361
a delicious crustacean buffet?

752
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,157
Mmm, I think she's too smart for me.

753
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,041
Self-awareness from Ralph Dibny?
I think there's hope for you yet.

754
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,291
That's a stretch.

755
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,835
Is that
where we freeze-frame?

756
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:54,859
