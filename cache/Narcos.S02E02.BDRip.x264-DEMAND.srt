1
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,148
Get down!

2
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,509
One!

3
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,652
- Rosa! Rosa!
- Quica...

4
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,153
Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them? Huh?

5
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,129
It had to be that whore
in the market. Please, Quica!

6
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,093
<i>Imagine this...</i>

7
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,530
<i>President of Colombia goes on TV
and tells the whole world</i>

8
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,432
<i>he'll never make a deal with you.</i>

9
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,964
<i>Now a normal person thinks,
I'm fucked.</i>

10
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,874
<i>But Pablo Escobar,
he thinks that's just your opening offer.</i>

11
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,101
<i>So the man finds a way to respond.</i>

12
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,210
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

13
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,453
Forgive me for the hood.

14
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,614
It's for security reasons.

15
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,591
- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

16
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,562
Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?

17
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,931
No, I'm fine, thank you.

18
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,593
Let's begin then.

19
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,641
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
- Absolutely not.

20
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:24,589
In fact, what I regret least
is having escaped.

21
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,252
The Special Forces came in
and opened fire.

22
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,989
I couldn't risk putting my life
in their hands, right?

23
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,795
However...

24
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,262
I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

25
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,702
I am willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

26
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,305
The most modest and the most humble.

27
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,144
But before that, I have to examine
the conditions they are going to put me in

28
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:53,983
because, look, it would be easy,
for example, for someone to rig a car bomb

29
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,852
that would explode when I arrived.

30
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,384
<i>And how did Gaviria take
Pablo's offer?</i>

31
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,459
<i>I think it's safe to say
that he didn't really care for it.</i>

32
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,990
<i>But it wasn't just Gaviria
Pablo was talking to.</i>

33
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,561
<i>In his mind, he was also negotiating
with the leader of the free world.</i>

34
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,734
It turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

35
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,406
It appears that I am very important

36
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,708
to the re-election
of the president of the United States.

37
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:26,377
<i>You see, the problem was,
George Bush had his own plans for Escobar.</i>

38
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,976
We will, for the first time,

39
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,218
make available the appropriate resources
of America's armed forces.

40
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:36,023
And for the drug kingpins,
the death penalty.

41
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:40,499
<i>And with a commander in chief
who used to be the head of the CIA,</i>

42
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,160
<i>well, you can use your imagination</i>

43
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,694
<i>as to what appropriate resources
might mean.</i>

44
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,565
<i>He started by appointing
a new ambassador.</i>

45
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,578
<i>Badass former Navy man,
Arthur Crosby...</i>

46
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:59,046
<i>who specialized in Latin American affairs
and counterterrorism.</i>

47
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,919
<i>Next, he dug into his old CIA Rolodex,</i>

48
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,427
<i>where there was no shortage of guys
who knew how to fight dirty.</i>

49
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,729
<i>And he sent us one of those too.</i>

50
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:20,731
<i>Lastly, and what Peña and I like to call
his own personal fuck you to us...</i>

51
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,105
<i>he sent us something
he thought we must need, a boss.</i>

52
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:31,714
<i>Now just how long that person
would be my boss remained to be seen.</i>

53
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:37,952
I will always be ready to pay for
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell

54
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,255
when my rights are respected

55
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:46,232
and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

56
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,931
Do you acknowledge that
you have committed crimes in the past,

57
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,133
or that you ordered someone's death?

58
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,781
That answer one could
only give to a priest.

59
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,910
In a confessional.

60
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,328
Marietta.

61
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,419
- What's up?
- What happened?

62
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,458
It looks like they killed them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

63
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,629
Who would do something so horrible?

64
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,115
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

65
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,317
Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humor.

66
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,782
I would say that I'm a happy man.

67
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,988
I've always been happy.
I've always been optimistic.

68
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,860
I've always had faith in life.

69
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,560
I always sing in the shower.

70
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,829
How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

71
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:06,571
Well, one can never know.
I can only hope for the best.

72
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,017
I would like to die on my own two feet.

73
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,889
In the year 3047.

74
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,555
My title might be ambassador,

75
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,223
but that's some bullshit
politician's word.

76
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,596
I know what it means
to be on the front lines.

77
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,401
And everybody in this room wants
the same thing, to take down Escobar.

78
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,905
Now as a veteran of numerous conflicts,
I learned one immutable truth.

79
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,844
The only way to succeed
is by working together,

80
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,782
by communicating,
by sharing intelligence and collaborating.

81
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,409
Understood?

82
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,790
This is Claudia Messina.
She is the new DEA country attaché.

83
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,088
She'll be taking over all DEA operations
in-country. Messina?

84
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,959
Thank you, Ambassador.

85
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:02,797
The DEA will be opening field offices
in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla.

86
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,303
As far as the Medellín team is concerned,

87
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:09,205
they will be housed out of
CNP headquarters until further notice.

88
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,903
But only after some personnel changes
have been made.

89
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,743
All right, now as far as
long-term intelligence is concerned,

90
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,808
that's under the purview of the CIA,
the station chief, Bill Stechner.

91
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,477
Bill, you have anything you'd like to add?

92
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,952
I'm good.

93
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,952
- All right, who's here from Centra Spike?
- I am, sir. Edward Jacoby.

94
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,326
All right, let's get Centra Spike
back in the air immediately.

95
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,456
I want to know every word
these assholes say

96
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,399
and all information flows through me
and I will disseminate as I see fit.

97
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,595
Yes, sir.

98
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,301
When Escobar sticks his fucking head out,
we're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

99
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,173
What about him? Other than
the fact that he wasn't here today.

100
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,441
Well, I suggested that he stay home.

101
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,009
You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

102
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,514
It means I'm making some changes.

103
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,919
Murphy's a good agent.
He's done a lot of good work down here.

104
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,082
Yeah.

105
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,025
Looks like it.

106
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,193
Do you have any idea
the strings that were pulled

107
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,963
to get that guy not to press charges?

108
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,335
Sounds to me like the guy
would've had a dog sniffing up his ass

109
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,464
before he got on the plane.
Maybe Steve did him a favor.

110
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,538
Was that a thank you?

111
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,139
Be straight with me, Agent Peña,
and I'll be straight with you.

112
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,981
I don't need a guy like that
making my life more difficult.

113
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,043
- And making the DEA look bad.
- Ma'am...

114
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,215
Messina. Or boss.

115
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,883
We've been down here a longtime.

116
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,983
You've been down here all of what,
two hours?

117
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,996
It may not make the front page, but...

118
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,033
a lot of the intel we have
is because of Steve.

119
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,997
He's a good man.
He's going through some shit right now.

120
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,900
You know, he was at the airport

121
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,979
to stop his wife from leaving the country
with their kid. He didn't make it.

122
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,209
Add that to watching Escobar
build a five-star prison

123
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,081
and then walking out the back door.

124
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,653
We both deserve to see this through...

125
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,155
boss.

126
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,530
Have you had anything to eat
in the last 24 hours?

127
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,169
This new boss... Messina...

128
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,237
what do you know about her?

129
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,712
Only what I've heard.
She's out of New York.

130
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,952
Doesn't put up with any shit.

131
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,115
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

132
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,350
Am I out?

133
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,390
I don't know.

134
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,531
Well, I ain't ready to go home yet, Javi.
I'll tell ya that.

135
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,435
Damn it! She's fucking...

136
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,032
Take a shower. Sober up.

137
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,305
Talk to you.

138
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,413
Look behind you.
Watch out for that guy.

139
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,479
That's it.

140
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,816
Smash the telephone booth.

141
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,253
Get the pipe.

142
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,228
I already know, Dad.

143
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,129
You have to get it.

144
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,663
And what's that, a woman?

145
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,828
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

146
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,100
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

147
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,642
Nora.

148
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,734
Boss, excuse the interruption.
One moment, please.

149
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,144
How do you...?

150
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,588
What about the laboratories?

151
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,424
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

152
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,362
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

153
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,435
There are police checkpoints everywhere.

154
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,368
We lost four men
trying to get through one.

155
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,707
Sons of bitches.

156
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,133
And what about Judy Moncada?

157
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,448
We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.

158
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,950
Find her.

159
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,114
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,522
And you, boys?

161
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,651
- Everything is good, boss.
- All good, boss.

162
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,027
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

163
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,895
- How are you feeling?
- Very good, boss.

164
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,728
- Comfortable?
- Thank you. Very good.

165
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,825
Good.

166
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,205
I'm going to teach you something.

167
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,209
There is nothing lower than a rat.

168
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:46,050
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

169
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,086
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

170
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,049
Give me one second. One second.

171
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,990
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

172
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,598
- Tell me, Fernando.
- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.

173
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,191
Palace wants to meet with me right away.

174
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,933
You heard that, brother? Hm?

175
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,198
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

176
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,507
No, brother, there's still one left.

177
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,843
But you already killed all the whores.

178
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,407
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

179
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,850
Why her?

180
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,221
- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

181
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah, it was those fucking whores.

182
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,194
She is someone I can trust, man.

183
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,598
You can trust her, but I can't.

184
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,065
Move it.

185
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,899
Quica.

186
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,436
I'm not going to tell you again, brother.
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.

187
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,480
- Good day.
- Good day.

188
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:52,108
I have a meeting with the president.

189
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,743
I am Fernando Duque.

190
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,250
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr. Duque.

191
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,556
How's that?

192
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,957
- With the vice minister then?
- No, sir.

193
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,628
The information I have here says
your meeting is with the attorney general.

194
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,138
My apologies, Mr. Duque.

195
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,178
<i>Now, Gaviria had made it clear</i>

196
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,409
<i>that the government
was not to negotiate with Escobar.</i>

197
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,919
<i>But Colombia Attorney General
Gustavo de Greiff</i>

198
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,614
<i>didn't give a shit
what the president wanted.</i>

199
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,785
<i>Unlike the US, where the attorney general
is appointed by the president,</i>

200
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,799
<i>in Colombia, the Supreme Court
chooses the attorney general,</i>

201
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,301
<i>whether the president likes it
or not.</i>

202
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:48,506
<i>And in the case of Gustavo de Greiff,
you bet your ass Gaviria didn't.</i>

203
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,133
Mr. Duque...

204
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,671
I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

205
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:03,150
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

206
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,228
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

207
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,330
He can't be hunted and killed
like an animal.

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,695
Mr. De Greiff,

209
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:21,797
everything you're telling me I find
fascinating.

210
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,875
However, I don't...

211
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,176
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

212
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,145
like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.

213
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,552
Then that means that...

214
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:44,028
you would consider
making a deal with Pablo.

215
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,930
I am saying that Colombia...

216
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,535
has been at war far too long.

217
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,564
Of course.

218
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,943
The Americans are bringing in new people.

219
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,580
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

220
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,714
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

221
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,750
Perhaps.

222
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,194
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

223
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,360
And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

224
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,530
confined to Carlos Holguín
and the embassy.

225
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,304
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground, gathering more support.

226
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,571
Everyone is helping him in Medellín.

227
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,275
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellín.

228
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,485
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

229
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,721
Do you think we'll succeed?

230
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,594
Listen, thanks for talking
to Messina, man.

231
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,773
I mean it. You saved my ass.

232
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,107
One more fuck-up, Murphy...

233
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,438
Oh, I know.

234
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,476
Is it gonna happen again?

235
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,419
I don't know.

236
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,152
<i>DEA politics weren't
the only thing we had to navigate.</i>

237
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,863
<i>The Pinzón plan was in full effect.</i>

238
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,934
<i>He was doubling down
on police presence.</i>

239
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:35,301
<i>Medellín was under martial law
and the base of Carlos Holguín</i>

240
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,035
<i>would look like Fort Apache.</i>

241
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,110
<i>Me and Javi were officially guests
of the CNP.</i>

242
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,307
<i>With all the comforts and amenities</i>

243
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,183
<i>that a guest of the National
Colombian Police could expect.</i>

244
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,119
<i>Which was zero.</i>

245
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,481
<i>And we weren't alone.</i>

246
00:19:55,327 --> 00:20:00,128
<i>The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike and the army,
all under one roof.</i>

247
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,899
<i>It was one-stop shopping
for all things Pablo Escobar.</i>

248
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,375
<i>After Gaviria announced a new
$1.4 million reward for Pablo's capture,</i>

249
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,541
<i>Colonel Pinzón activated
a new tip line.</i>

250
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,746
<i>And apparently he thought Javi and I
were just the guys to oversee it.</i>

251
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,915
<i>Forget about the fact
that my Spanish was for shit.</i>

252
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,722
<i>He was side-lining us and there was
nothing we could do about it.</i>

253
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,332
<i>Pablo would even have his men call in
just to fuck with us.</i>

254
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,866
Tip line. What do you want to report?

255
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,603
<i>I'm not sure what we expected.</i>

256
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,178
<i>To many people, Escobar was a hero.</i>

257
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,541
<i>It was like asking Chicago
to rat out Michael Jordan.</i>

258
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:55,178
<i>And those that didn't worship Escobar,
they were simply too scared to call.</i>

259
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,949
<i>But we had a system anyways.</i>

260
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,048
<i>One tip in a particular location
didn't mean shit.</i>

261
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,529
<i>A second call with the same information
still might not be worth acting on.</i>

262
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,567
<i>But three calls on the same location
from three different sources?</i>

263
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,226
- Agent Peña?
- Yeah.

264
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,637
<i>That had to be checked out.</i>

265
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,444
<i>Hey, I said it was a system.</i>

266
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,954
<i>I didn't say it worked.</i>

267
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,426
Fuck me.

268
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,326
Pansies!

269
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,059
<i>Our inability to catch Escobar
was frustrating.</i>

270
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,502
<i>But back in Bogotá,
it was becoming a real liability.</i>

271
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,075
Attorney General De Greiff.

272
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,672
They told me that you met
with Mr. Fernando Duque.

273
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,474
That's right.

274
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,244
The president was very clear

275
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,416
when he said that no one
was to communicate with Escobar's people.

276
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,689
Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

277
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,755
I work for the people of Colombia.

278
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,168
And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

279
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,433
And we are all working together,
in a united front, against Escobar.

280
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,477
- This isn't a single war...
- Are you afraid of what I might find

281
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,274
if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?

282
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,611
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

283
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,119
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

284
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:39,448
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

285
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,856
to transfer a prisoner?

286
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,963
Because were not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

287
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,297
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

288
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,168
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

289
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,298
I don't think that's true.

290
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,239
Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

291
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:04,908
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

292
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,145
At least, not yet.

293
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,556
But I'm going to open up an investigation
about the allegations...

294
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,589
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

295
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,668
You know what, Attorney General?

296
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,902
Eat shit.

297
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,507
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand, brother.

298
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,917
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

299
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:43,946
Hello, hello.

300
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,286
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

301
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:50,522
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

302
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,724
Ah, yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

303
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,095
Go ahead.

304
00:23:55,768 --> 00:24:00,296
Brother, let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back. Hm?

305
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,376
Are you afraid or what, Limón? Huh?

306
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,481
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

307
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,127
Mr. Alvarez.

308
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,128
Quica!

309
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,757
This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

310
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,995
Brother!

311
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,635
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

312
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,103
Good.

313
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,008
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

314
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:43,611
I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

315
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:55,257
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

316
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,804
Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

317
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,178
I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

318
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,548
She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

319
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,985
We'll come back later.

320
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,192
Fuck that, brother.

321
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,057
Quica!

322
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,905
Over there, brother.

323
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,652
I got something, brother.

324
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,065
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

325
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,670
I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

326
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,079
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

327
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,049
We'll come back later then.

328
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,417
If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

329
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,016
then we haven't won anything. Right?

330
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:41,630
Pablo, we have found a very good option.

331
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,132
Definitely.

332
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,266
If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

333
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,398
- and create some dissention in the ranks...
- Oh, Fernando.

334
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,740
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

335
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,941
You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

336
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,612
Pablo, you have to understand...

337
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:06,320
The moment... The position
that Gaviria is in right now...

338
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:12,057
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

339
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,665
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

340
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,232
And he's not thinking about

341
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:27,006
trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

342
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,780
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

343
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,855
And he has the autonomy to make deals.

344
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,457
Fine, okay.

345
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,694
Let's try it.

346
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:53,834
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

347
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,033
supports the legalization of drugs.

348
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,303
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

349
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:05,117
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time...

350
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,380
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

351
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,717
Fernando, excuse us.

352
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,657
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

353
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,058
- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,887
Thank you very much, Fernando.

355
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,823
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

356
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,062
Excuse me.

357
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,810
What's wrong?

358
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,150
We can't live like this, Pablo.

359
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,050
Running from one place to another, hiding,

360
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,921
hoping the government wants to negotiate.

361
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,153
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

362
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,528
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

363
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,170
How are you so calm, huh?

364
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:05,739
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

365
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,745
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

366
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,884
I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

367
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,857
No, nothing has changed.

368
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:34,395
My love, we have everything we need.

369
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,408
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

370
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,802
A place where we don't have to hide.

371
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,907
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

372
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,589
I promise you that.

373
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,839
Get ready to get your balls snipped.

374
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:20,245
So your wife left.

375
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,755
You're upset,
knocked a few back to numb the pain

376
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,453
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

377
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,623
Yeah, something like that.

378
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,366
Isolated incident?

379
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:37,765
Yeah.

380
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,131
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

381
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:51,843
Before that, you and Peña had
complete autonomy to call your own shots.

382
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,318
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

383
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,515
You don't trust me yet? That's fine.

384
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:01,293
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know that I can trust you.

385
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,625
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

386
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,692
Am I making myself clear?

387
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,563
Loud and clear.

388
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,726
Excellent.

389
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,836
You're dismissed.

390
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,686
Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

391
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,187
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

392
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,929
I got La Quica and toilet.

393
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,094
Not just any toilet.

394
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,367
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

395
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,842
All right, well, now, that I got.

396
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,378
We can't take that to Pinzón.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

397
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,176
We need more.

398
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:00,445
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

399
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,748
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

400
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,115
Maybe we can get Centra Spike
to do a flyover,

401
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,522
see what they come up with.

402
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,755
Be a lot better than the fucking tip line.

403
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,228
I'll be right back.

404
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,530
- A toilet?
- It's a long story.

405
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,534
- Give me the CliffsNotes.
- Look, just do me a favor

406
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,633
and ask them to sweep over
that specific area.

407
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:29,305
We're looking for any chatter
from Escobar's sicarios. Anything at all.

408
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,048
You recognize a voice, you come get me.

409
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,918
Duvall 1-4-4-3-6,
we heard some chatter at 1600 megahertz.

410
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,888
Be advised.

411
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,823
Baby, when are you coming?

412
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,394
You left me all alone.

413
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,930
I can't right now, It's too dangerous.

414
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,090
But you said you were coming.

415
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:51,261
Let things calm down a little bit.
I'll show you a good time.

416
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,168
That is definitely Velasco.
No ID on the girl.

417
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,838
What's the deal with the other call?

418
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,275
The quality's too poor
for voice recognition.

419
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,648
All right...
these were taken about two hours ago.

420
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,253
What's here is fincas, fincas.

421
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,764
Everything else is just smaller houses
here, here and here, and the outskirts.

422
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,994
You can probably eliminate
the smaller ones, not Escobar's style.

423
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,601
Which of the fincas have road access
both east and west?

424
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:29,998
This one here.

425
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,805
It's rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but it's drivable.

426
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,039
It's gotta be the one.

427
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,614
We'd have a good chance
if we came at him from both sides.

428
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,773
This is good.

429
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,613
Great. What about Pinzón?

430
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,816
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

431
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,782
Leave Pinzón to me.

432
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,024
Correct me if I'm wrong...

433
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,391
In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

434
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,801
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

435
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,840
That was based on
many different calls from the tip line.

436
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,347
This is the voice of Velasco.

437
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,647
Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

438
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,052
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

439
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,523
I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

440
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,027
And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you,

441
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,064
Colonel Carrillo.

442
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,929
He was exiled to Spain.

443
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,534
What did he say?

444
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,933
He said no.

445
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:45,713
Oh, she's not gonna last.
She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

446
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,411
<i>But Messina didn't give up easy.</i>

447
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,784
<i>She called Crosby...</i>

448
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,286
<i>Crosby called Gaviria...</i>

449
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,459
<i>and in less than 15 minutes...</i>

450
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,531
- I understand.
- <i>Pinzón was gettin' a kick in the ass.</i>

451
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,932
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

452
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,263
Excuse me, Colonel.

453
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,069
<i>I guess everybody works for somebody.</i>

454
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,737
General?

455
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,246
<i>Just because we could make
Pinzón dance</i>

456
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,375
<i>didn't mean we could call
the tune.</i>

457
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,118
<i>We would've gone in stealth.
Surround the fucker, then grab him.</i>

458
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,218
<i>Pinzón didn't do shit that way.
He liked kicking down the front door,</i>

459
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,990
<i>waking up the whole damn neighborhood.</i>

460
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,093
Move your asses! The police are coming!

461
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,899
Get the cars and the money ready
right now. They're close, now!

462
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,496
Boss!

463
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,006
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

464
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:47,977
Boss.

465
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,475
It's the police.

466
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,517
They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

467
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,089
Pablo. Pablo!

468
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,296
Sons of bitches.

469
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,491
They're coming from
the other side too, sir.

470
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,658
- What happened?
- We have to leave right now.

471
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,133
The police are coming.

472
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,326
- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

473
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,133
- Wait out back.
- Yes, boss.

474
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,298
Pablo!

475
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,934
Go get the kids.
We have to leave right now.

476
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:35,115
Come this way. Hurry up!

477
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,025
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.

478
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,469
Surround the house! Let's go!

479
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,578
They're gone, sir.

480
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:38,617
Colonel, nobody's in the house,
no signs of life, sir.

481
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,257
Shit.

482
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,789
At ease.

483
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,394
<i>Don't forget
that Pablo made a career</i>

484
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,095
<i>of staying ahead of the cops.</i>

485
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:57,138
<i>A lot of the fincas he used
had tunnels built just for this purpose.</i>

486
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,108
<i>Even though he didn't like using them.</i>

487
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,980
<i>I guess you could say that
he was paranoid, but then again,</i>

488
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:09,282
<i>if people are actually after you,
that's not paranoid. That's just smart.</i>

489
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,322
Peña! Messina!

490
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,171
He was here.

491
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,255
Go ahead, come in.

492
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,360
The bedrooms...

493
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,159
they're on the right.

494
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,982
Everything is okay, Tata.

495
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,452
No, Pablo.
This time everything is not okay.

496
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,956
Sweetheart, if Pablo
says everything is okay,

497
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,048
- it's because everything is...
- Was I talking to you?

498
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,656
I'm talking to my husband.

499
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,861
That was very close, Pablo.

500
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,868
And tomorrow, what?

501
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,302
Do you want your children
to watch those men kill you?

502
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,397
No one is going to die, Tata.

503
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,635
I am dealing with it.

504
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,907
How, Pablo?

505
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,079
Tell me how.

506
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,318
Negotiating?

507
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,753
Yesterday, they nearly killed you
for negotiating.

508
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,222
If you are going to fix everything,
fix it for good.

509
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,265
Don't worry.

510
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,847
<i>You know,
in all the years I chased Escobar,</i>

511
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,052
<i>I could count on one hand
the times we almost had him.</i>

512
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,356
<i>And each time, we forgot
the two most important things</i>

513
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,226
<i>we already knew about him.</i>

514
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,095
<i>Close doesn't count.</i>

515
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:38,226
<i>And Pablo is never more dangerous
than when you almost have him.</i>

516
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,631
<i>With all the cops on the street,
it was easy to forget...</i>

517
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,664
<i>this was still Escobar's town.</i>

518
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:21,301
<i>He tolerated it all
in the interest of negotiations.</i>

519
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,339
<i>Chasing a man and his family
out of their home</i>

520
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,179
<i>in the middle of the night?</i>

521
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,310
<i>That wasn't a negotiation.</i>

522
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,353
<i>To Escobar...</i>

523
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,315
<i>well, that was an act of war.</i>

524
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,357
Ready.

525
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,688
Boss, everybody is ready.
What's the order?

526
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,760
Do it.

527
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:44,863
Yes, sir.

528
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,974
- Huh? What's up?
- Ready.

529
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,475
- All right.
- Okay.

530
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,174
We're ready, sir.

531
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,206
Come.

532
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,945
Step on it!

533
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,430
Do it, brother.

534
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,735
It's cold, you fucking fag!

535
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,296
Kill him! Do it, bitch! Kill him!

536
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,383
Peña!
