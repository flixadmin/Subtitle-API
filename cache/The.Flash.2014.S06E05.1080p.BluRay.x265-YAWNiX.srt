1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,088
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,691
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must
be Gypsy. It's nice to meet you.

3
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,842
- Who are you?
- Daddy!

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:11,096
<i>You're a warrior who would
fight to protect the only person I love.</i>

5
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:12,222
<i>I wanna take the cure.</i>

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,434
You're the person that
I want to run this team when I'm gone.

7
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:20,146
Sorry I went all ice-daggery on you.
I still don't like you.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,606
Ramsey, don't do this.

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,401
<i>As long as I feed,
I could live forever.</i>

10
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,992
So, this is where you've been hiding.

11
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,291
Sometimes the truth is
the hardest lie to see through.

12
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,336
And when you can't put your faith
in the truth,

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,133
all you have left... is yourself.

14
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:51,302
You're under arrest, Ramon.

15
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,085
Barry,
we don't have to do this.

16
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,819
It's Tahiti, not Iron Heights.

17
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,197
I know, but we've got too much going on
right now to be taking a vacation.

18
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,534
Okay. Look, it's two days, all right?

19
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,953
Ramsey's been off the grid
for two weeks.

20
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:19,914
And Crisis is coming, no matter what.

21
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,834
Let me take you someplace special,

22
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,961
where we can have
fruity umbrella drinks,

23
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,963
and get sand between our toes.

24
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,007
I do like us.

25
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,719
And we're even better with mai tais.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,346
Take a look. It's in a book.

27
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,684
Hey, thought you guys
fathwoomed out of here.

28
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,620
Uh, we just wanted to make sure
you guys were okay

29
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,205
holding down the fort
while we were gone.

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,775
We're good. Rest easy, lovebirds.
"Team Leader" is my new middle name.

31
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:47,984
What was it before?

32
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,278
- Baracus.
- As in Barracas, Argentina?

33
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:55,283
No, as in Mr. T. What...
My mom was a big <i>A-Team</i> fan.

34
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,077
Wish mine was.
Could've been Hannibal Dibny.

35
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,747
Hannibal?
Please, you're Murdock on your best day.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,165
You guys have fun.

37
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,376
I'm gonna hold it down with a little
help from my friend, the B.A.R.I.

38
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,254
- "The Barry"? I'm standing right here.
- Not you, Barry.

39
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:12,717
B.A.R.I.
Barry Allen Replicated Intelligence.

40
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,052
Aw.

41
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,387
It's my decision-making algorithm.

42
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,973
So, if there's a problem,
this is gonna tell us what to do?

43
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,268
Yes, and since it's based on
his past leadership choices,

44
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,688
it'll tell me how to handle
any situation exactly like he would.

45
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,191
I'm flattered... I think.

46
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,070
Huh. What is Barry's favorite thing
that I make him for breakfast?

47
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,739
Uh, banana.

48
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,743
Oh.

49
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,662
Who's next?

50
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,207
Okay, computer,
what's Barry's favorite movie?

51
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,706
<i>Empire.</i>

52
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,255
Oh, thank God.

53
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:55,385
Actually, I mean, I love...
Loved <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> my whole life,

54
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,012
but now that I think about it...

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,267
Oh, God.
My favorite movie is <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

56
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,310
- There it is.
- How does it do that?

57
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,272
Fuzzy logic and AI intuition, my guy.

58
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,858
With the B.A.R.I. by my side,
it'll be like you never left.

59
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,777
Well, okay.

60
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,863
I guess we should, uh, get going.

61
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,197
Yes, we should.

62
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,867
- Send me a postcard.
- Hey, look, remember.

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,827
I'm leaving you in charge.

64
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,287
I'll see you when you get back.

65
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,288
Bye.

66
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,752
So, you got any marching orders,
boss?

67
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,131
The B.A.R.I. wants me to stay here,

68
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,050
and you to go with Frost,
to stake out Ramsey's lab.

69
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,012
I love it when a plan comes together.

70
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:51,774
Just so you know...

71
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,444
I let you follow me here.

72
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,487
Ah. I'll let you think that.

73
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,994
Captain Joe West, C.C.P.D.

74
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,955
So, uh, what brings you down here?

75
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:09,918
People with your face
usually have something to hide,

76
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,794
so when my son Barry told me

77
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,174
that there was a new Wells,
I started keeping tabs on you.

78
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,468
I don't know how new a Wells I am,

79
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,529
and, second, "keeping tabs,"
if that's what you mean by spying on me

80
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,764
from that nondescript sedan
parked up on Lake Avenue?

81
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:28,561
Well observed. So, why are you...
digging holes in the city?

82
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,982
Well, perfect stranger,

83
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,235
the reason I'm digging holes
underneath the city is... Oh, wait.

84
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,155
- You couldn't possibly understand.
- Try me.

85
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,238
Nah.

86
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,222
No, no, no!

87
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,918
You need some rest.

88
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,045
All those late nights
working on the B.A.R.I.,

89
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,256
- you've barely slept this week.
- Tonight, I'm gonna sleep like a child.

90
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,423
'Cause I got the B.A.R.I...

91
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,843
And I got my white noise,

92
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,553
and I got my boo.

93
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,349
Good night.

94
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,241
Babe, you okay?

95
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,493
No, not really.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,329
I just almost went Sweeney Todd
on myself.

97
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,583
Why would I do that?

98
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,877
Maybe I was sleepwalking?

99
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:38,006
Yeah, that's, um...
That's kind of your new thing.

100
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,257
Huh?

101
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:41,426
Yeah, you woke me up last night, too.

102
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,928
I heard the front door shut,
and you were standing there

103
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,812
with your keys in your hand
and your shoes on.

104
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,100
I was half asleep,
so I just put you back to bed.

105
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,310
- Okay, why didn't you say anything?
- Well, I didn't think it was a big deal.

106
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,230
Just like a one-off,
'cause you're so exhausted.

107
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,442
Well, it is a big deal,
and it's not a one-off anymore, is it?

108
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,193
That's twice now that's happened.

109
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,071
Babe, relax. Okay, you just launched
the B.A.R.I. today.

110
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,158
You need time to rest
that sexy brain of yours.

111
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:08,453
My brain is the Ryan Gosling
of genius intellects.

112
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:09,829
Okay.

113
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,996
Will you please let me know
next time that happens?

114
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,542
- Yes.
- And hide those scissors from me.

115
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,378
- Okay.
- Good night, babe.

116
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,462
Good night.

117
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,799
I love... I look...

118
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,763
forward to spending time
with you tomorrow.

119
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,392
Uh, thank you.

120
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,730
You're welcome.

121
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,944
Yeah, okay. Good night.

122
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:50,787
Oh, my God.

123
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,416
Uh.

124
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,842
It's okay. I know him.

125
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,636
He's my ex's dad.

126
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:11,974
Hey, Breacher,
long time no try to kill me.

127
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,062
What brings you to my bedroom... again?

128
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,483
Breacher?

129
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,153
Hey.

130
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,157
Josh.

131
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,411
It's Cynthia.

132
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,623
She's dead.

133
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,928
I can't believe she's gone.

134
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,598
And I never get to see her again.

135
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:57,103
Cynthia was tracking
a high-level hacker.

136
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,858
Goes by the name of, uh, Echo.

137
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,235
She mentioned him before.

138
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,613
Nobody's ever been able to figure out
who he really is, right?

139
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,365
We think Cynthia did.

140
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,201
How he got the jump on her,
we don't know.

141
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,079
I don't see her losing a fight
to anyone.

142
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,207
She won the fight.

143
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,042
Dying here just, uh...

144
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,671
triggered her Collector QT-net.

145
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,549
The quara-temporal containment barrier?

146
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,345
Gypsy once said these barriers
were like super-sized

147
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,182
vibe fields around a planet.
The collectors put them up

148
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,726
so a suspect can't breach away
to another world.

149
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,519
And only the Agency can lift it.

150
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,314
Meaning her killer is still here.

151
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,317
I'm going to avenge Cynthia's death.

152
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,154
And Vibe is gonna help me do it.

153
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,242
Cisco isn't Vibe anymore.

154
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,329
He decided to take the meta-human cure.

155
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,831
Weren't you worried
about breach psychosis?

156
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,919
It happens sometimes
when you suppress your powers.

157
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,421
It's really gnarly.

158
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:07,715
How gnarly?

159
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,929
Hallucinations, weird blackouts,

160
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,554
dry mouth.

161
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,849
My powers weren't suppressed.
They're gone.

162
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:20,019
Well, even without his meta-powers,
Cisco can still help you.

163
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,021
He's a genius.

164
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,654
What would Barry do?

165
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,333
The B.A.R.I. wants us to go
to the crime scene.

166
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,875
Listen, you don't have to go back there.
I'll go.

167
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,544
I'll come with you.

168
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,590
Kamilla, this could be dangerous.

169
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,260
I mean, we're dealing
with a killer here.

170
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,886
I can't ask you to come with me.

171
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,973
You didn't. I volunteered.

172
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,648
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

173
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,499
Okay.

174
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,800
You can dance around
with that thing all you want.

175
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,803
This place was a dead zone
long before that wall came down.

176
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,948
Well, it might eventually go through.
At least I'm trying to help.

177
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:38,930
What are you doing?

178
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,475
I'm getting us out of here,
that's what I'm doing. Stupid.

179
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,770
Well, I have a team
that could help us get out of here.

180
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,040
How? How are they gonna help us?
No one knows we're down here.

181
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,524
I am a precinct captain.

182
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,736
I have dozens of cops,
and a whole support staff

183
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,279
that depends on me 24/7.

184
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,049
If I don't show up for a couple
of hours, they're coming looking for me.

185
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,867
All right, somebody's overconfident.

186
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,178
You know what you don't have?
You don't have cell phone service.

187
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,454
You don't have Wi-Fi.

188
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,931
You have no way of telling anyone...

189
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,416
- What are you doing?
- That we're down here. Right?

190
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,626
- Put it away.
- This is our only option.

191
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,790
- I'm gonna get us out of here.
- What are you doing?

192
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,682
What is wrong with you?

193
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:24,769
Why did you not tell me
that this Earth's vibrational frequency

194
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,854
is calibrated at a molecular level?

195
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,065
- You're supposed to be the expert!
- Shush.

196
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,233
Shush me one more time,
we're gonna have a problem.

197
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,401
We already do.

198
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,155
It turns out that that fireball
sapped 80...

199
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,743
87% of the oxygen in this chamber,

200
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,997
which means that you and I have
42 minutes left to breathe.

201
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,350
You know, the idea was you'd call me
before he started killing people.

202
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,394
He showed up out of nowhere.

203
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,021
Rat and Pops tried to run for it.

204
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,898
They didn't get far.

205
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,486
Frost, that guy's next-level creepy.

206
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,863
I wouldn't go looking for him.

207
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,241
Smart move.

208
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,827
Especially without a partner.

209
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,455
How's business, Snake-shack?

210
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,250
Eh, had better days.

211
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:33,337
You mind giving us a minute?
Need to have a little chat with Frosty.

212
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,719
What are you doing here?

213
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,140
Looking for you. What happened
to staking out Ramsey's lab?

214
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,826
Norvok texted me.
He said he saw Ramsey here.

215
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,102
Frost, as your life coach,
going after Ramsey alone

216
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,812
is probably gonna put me out of a job.

217
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,980
This isn't a joke.

218
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,525
This is a fight, my fight,
so stay out of it.

219
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,820
We're a team. Your fights are my fights.

220
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,948
So, why don't you just take a breath
and try trusting a friend?

221
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,910
I knew from day one
not to trust this guy, but we did.

222
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,747
And now people are dead,
so I've gotta fix this.

223
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,875
Wasn't that long ago
that I felt the same.

224
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,003
Blamed myself.
Never asked anyone for help.

225
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,379
And you know where it got me?

226
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,174
Eyeball-deep in Gingold and self-pity.

227
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,968
So, believe me when I say
that life is better

228
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,053
if you have faith
in the people around you.

229
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,185
What?

230
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,480
I know who Ramsey has faith in.

231
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,024
I gotta go.

232
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,402
Did you hear anything I just said?
You can't go alone.

233
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,988
I know what I'm doing. And don't worry.

234
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,698
I won't be alone.

235
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,002
Listen, Kamilla,

236
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,005
there's something I've been wanting
to say to you.

237
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:01,008
I've been trying to figure out
how to say it,

238
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,054
but, I don't know, I think I should just
come right out and say it.

239
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,265
- Kamilla, I...
- Holy crap.

240
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,192
I thought C.C.P.D.'s crime scenes
were serious.

241
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,110
Yeah.

242
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:24,698
Earth-19 Collector Agents take
investigations to a whole other level.

243
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,825
Agent Zak Zeal.

244
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,204
Kamilla Hwang, Cisco Ramon.

245
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,122
Yeah, I heard you'd be coming.

246
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:37,878
I thought you'd be taller, you know,
from the way Gypsy talked about you.

247
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:41,257
Now that's funny.
She never mentioned you at all.

248
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,632
Hmm.

249
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:47,346
Hey, make sure Walker's updating
the dimensional output report.

250
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,431
Thanks.

251
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,892
You gotta keep on them constantly
when you're in charge.

252
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,853
Breacher understands.
Where is he anyway?

253
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,855
He already saw everything
he needed to see.

254
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,148
We're here in his place.

255
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,193
Well, the Agency authorized you
to join this investigation,

256
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,571
so I guess I'll just have to let you.

257
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,656
Is there a time of death?

258
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,035
Due to multi-dimensional signal speed,

259
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,872
our best guess is that it happened
sometime between 2:30 and 4:30 a.m.

260
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,041
That's a pretty good guess.

261
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,293
Yeah, I know.

262
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,795
And we found this.

263
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,968
301-H energy cartridge.
Standard issue. No prints.

264
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,848
Combine it with the Sigma baryon residue
we also found, and it looks like...

265
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,310
Echo killed Gypsy
with a transonic-demolecularizer?

266
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,810
Show us.

267
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,730
Now.

268
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,359
Her body, clothes,

269
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,070
even her communicator,
were all vaporized.

270
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,960
Me being like this...

271
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:06,050
I don't want you to think I'm still
hung up over Cynthia or something.

272
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,137
Cisco, someone you cared about died.

273
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,973
I'd be worried if you weren't sad.

274
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,484
So, earlier, when we first got here,

275
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,653
you were gonna say something.

276
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:37,748
Kamilla...

277
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,542
- We're locking down the area.
- For the love of God.

278
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,920
You two need to leave.

279
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,097
Ramon.

280
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,228
I just wanted to say again
how much I truly admired Gypsy.

281
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,481
I've got some big shoes to fill.

282
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,907
We're not seriously just gonna give up,
are we?

283
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,660
No, we're not.

284
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,706
Have you noticed he's the only one
who benefits from Cynthia's death?

285
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,207
So, what's the plan?

286
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,253
The B.A.R.I. suggests
a dual course of action.

287
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,715
First, we use the satellites to track
the weapon's unique signature.

288
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,966
- Can you...
- On it.

289
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,635
I've been paying attention. And second?

290
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,680
We're gonna have to do the impossible.

291
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,821
Man, sit down, relax.

292
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,573
We may live longer.

293
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,242
What evidence do you have
that anyone, literally anyone,

294
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,078
is coming down here to rescue us?

295
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,664
- I don't have any.
- No?

296
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,624
- But I do have faith.
- Ha!

297
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,543
Well done, Captain.

298
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,045
At least you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

299
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,964
Whoa.

300
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,261
- Ouch.
- Uh-huh.

301
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,680
Got light-headed, didn't you?

302
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,849
No.

303
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,605
You selfishly don't believe in anything
or anybody.

304
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,150
I used to be like that.

305
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,196
When my ex-wife left me
and my daughter...

306
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,616
I was broken.

307
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:41,580
So much so that I went somewhere
where I almost never go.

308
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,332
Church.

309
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,435
I didn't go there to pray or anything.

310
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,961
I went there to yell at the universe
for destroying my life.

311
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,381
Next day, I'm at home,

312
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,054
I'm so hurt that I can't even
cook dinner for my...

313
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,973
For my daughter.

314
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,769
Doorbell rings, I open the door...

315
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,066
to what looked like my whole
neighborhood standing on my lawn,

316
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,901
with cooked food for us.

317
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,991
You can have faith in anything,

318
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,495
but it was then I realized that...

319
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,583
I have faith in people.

320
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,404
According to B.A.R.I.,

321
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,764
we can use low-level
delta-wave vibrations

322
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,559
to stimulate harmonic resonance
in my prefrontal cortex.

323
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,769
If I think of memories with Cynthia,

324
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,938
we'll be able to absorb
the residual vibe energy

325
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,315
from the object that killed her.

326
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,402
Can this machine restore my vibe powers?

327
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,529
No. We're not the generators
of the vibe,

328
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,906
but we will be the receptors of it.

329
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,369
But I'm gonna have to see Cynthia die,
won't I?

330
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,169
It's the only way we have
of finding out who killed her.

331
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:18,552
My white noise machine
will stimulate our delta-wave patterns.

332
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:22,306
Add the shell casing as a trigger
and that'll do it.

333
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,729
B.A.R.I., initiate
artificial vibrational sequence.

334
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,904
If we want this to work,
we have to make physical contact.

335
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:38,928
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

336
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,113
- You murdered my daughter!
- No.

337
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,241
No, I didn't do it. I swear!

338
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,660
- Liar!
- You have to believe me!

339
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:07,783
Leave him alone!

340
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,330
Where did you get that?

341
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,083
In Cisco's workshop.
I don't know how it got there.

342
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,877
I do. He just murdered
my daughter with it.

343
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,214
No, Breacher, I don't care
what you think you saw, okay?

344
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,717
You know Cisco.
You know how much he cared about Gypsy.

345
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,301
There's gotta be another explanation.

346
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,179
- Babe, please...
- What about doppelgängers?

347
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:30,100
She's right. There's thousands
of other versions of me out there.

348
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:34,938
Yeah, and they're all pencil pushers.
None of them are scientists! Like you!

349
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:39,109
You had motive
and just enough guts to do this.

350
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,530
Breacher, I swear.
I don't know how this is possible.

351
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,618
Unless...

352
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,123
Unless breach psychosis.

353
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,005
Kamilla, what time did you find me
sleepwalking the other night?

354
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,341
I don't know. Maybe 4:00 a.m.

355
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,472
You're guilty!

356
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,269
But you're not in your right mind.

357
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,521
I didn't just lose a daughter today,

358
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:20,525
I lost a son, because...

359
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,363
I still respect the man you were.

360
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:32,079
Now, I'm gonna give you an hour
to get all your affairs in order

361
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,664
and then turn yourself in,

362
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,542
or I will end you.

363
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

364
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm gonna blow this blockade sky-high.

365
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,862
You do that, this whole thing collapses,
we're dead.

366
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,532
I do nothing and we're dead anyway.

367
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,451
Uh, we still have time
for my team to show up.

368
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:15,163
Enough! Enough about your team and you!

369
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,582
You know where I stand.

370
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,335
How can you have such faith?

371
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,756
Because someone or something
called the Monitor

372
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:27,509
says my son is destined

373
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,719
to die in some kind of Crisis

374
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,347
and the only way
I can stomach any of that

375
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:38,562
is have faith that his continuing life
or his death is for the greater...

376
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,440
The greater... The greater good.

377
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,027
You've seen Mar Novu?

378
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,324
Captain.

379
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:55,744
Captain.

380
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,441
Hey. Hey, I got you, big guy.
You're all right.

381
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,614
Oh, you got my text.

382
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,868
No. I called C.C.P.D. with a Ramsey
update and nobody had seen you.

383
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,320
Ran your plates,
tracked your car to a block from here.

384
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,623
Your notes had this tunnel marked.

385
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,499
I'm guessing...

386
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,461
because of him.

387
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,424
Lone Ranger.

388
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,550
Hi.

389
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,115
I see you got my message.

390
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,328
Cait...

391
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,626
You know, it's a bit weird
seeing you like this.

392
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:31,341
I guess both our looks are evolving.

393
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,718
Yes, I did get your message.

394
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,763
It reminded me of when we both
used to work for your mom.

395
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,599
Way back when I was a resident.

396
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,434
You were like
the daughter Mum never had.

397
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,520
Do you know, at first, I was jealous?

398
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,313
Over time,

399
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,359
I came to see you less as a rival,
and more like a sister.

400
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,405
And that's why I'm offering you a chance

401
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,658
- to join me.
- You wanna kill me, too?

402
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,078
I'm offering you life, Cait.

403
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:11,840
I've learned to control it,
discovered its secret beauty.

404
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,844
This is my final masterpiece, Cait.

405
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,264
Life eternal.

406
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:21,850
Immortality?

407
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:26,855
You see? I'm no monster.

408
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,522
I'm a miracle.

409
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,567
You're talking about reversing nature.

410
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,487
Nature never meant for us to fly,
and yet we've touched the stars.

411
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:38,783
And not by being slaves
to the shackles of the natural order,

412
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,952
but by transcending them.

413
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,331
Take a look at your own life, Cait.

414
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,375
How many times have you had to say
goodbye to people?

415
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:51,296
How many more have you not even
had the chance to do so?

416
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,466
My mum should be here.

417
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,177
Your father should be here.

418
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,765
Your husband should be here.

419
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,437
Join me and this is the end of goodbyes.

420
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:11,149
No one you love will ever die again.

421
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,819
I've seen your version of life.

422
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:17,822
It's a nightmare.

423
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,368
But you can still be your mother's son.

424
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,871
She had so much faith in you,
and so do I.

425
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,374
You just need to have faith in yourself.

426
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,466
Your words are madness.

427
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,060
Next time won't be a choice.

428
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,406
Look, we have to face the facts.

429
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,950
And I have to own up
to whatever it is that I did.

430
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,451
You're gonna turn yourself in?

431
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,871
I have to. I can't trust myself anymore.

432
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,498
Anymore?

433
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,126
You stopped trusting yourself
the moment Barry asked you

434
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,710
to take over as team leader.

435
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,438
I mean,
you've built this elaborate device

436
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,065
just so you wouldn't have to make
any decisions for yourself.

437
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,800
- That's...
- Let me make this decision for you.

438
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,468
You are innocent.

439
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,472
How can you be so sure?

440
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,100
Because I have faith in you.

441
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,166
The real question is, why don't
you have any faith in yourself?

442
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,940
Because Barry's gonna die!

443
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,485
What if I can't keep people safe
the way he does?

444
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,370
I'm not the Flash.

445
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:48,455
Babe...

446
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,542
Barry didn't choose you to be the Flash.

447
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,878
He chose you to be you.

448
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,720
All these doubts, they aren't you.

449
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,015
They're just noise in your head.

450
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,531
It's been in Wi-Fi mode this whole time.

451
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,161
What is it?

452
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,621
This code,

453
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,458
it's turned my white noise machine
into a micro neural impulse disrupter.

454
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:35,668
It could go all Wreck-it Ralph
on my brainwaves.

455
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,213
Might even look like breach psychosis.

456
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:40,048
Who'd be smart enough to code like that?

457
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,132
Me.

458
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,647
Sometimes the truth is
the hardest lie to see through.

459
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,691
And when you can't put your faith
in the truth,

460
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,487
all you have left... is yourself.

461
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,156
You're under arrest, Ramon.

462
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,370
I surrender.

463
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,793
I'm guilty.

464
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,795
Suspect is in custody.

465
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:23,299
Initiate QT-net removal, so the prisoner
can be transferred to Earth-19.

466
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,423
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Breacher,

467
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,762
that holo-cube will tell you
everything you need

468
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,014
to know about what happened to Cynthia.

469
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,225
<i>QT-net is off.</i>

470
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,893
QT-net's down, sir.

471
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,105
I'll cuff him.

472
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:53,580
I'm sorry it had to go down this way,
but I needed you to lift the net.

473
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,541
Re-engage the QT-net.

474
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:57,542
<i>That'll take four minutes.</i>

475
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,961
I don't care if it'll take four minutes.
Just get on with it!

476
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,010
I hate force fields.

477
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:11,681
- I know.
- Cisco, you think I'm gonna let the man

478
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,684
that murdered my daughter escape?

479
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,396
No, sir. And neither am I.

480
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:28,572
I'm here.

481
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,576
<i>There's no sign of him.</i>

482
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,787
His breach portal energy puts him
at the east end of the warehouse.

483
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,002
Game over, Echo.

484
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:45,214
Oh, no, you found me.
How did you find me?

485
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,925
I tricked the collectors
into lifting the QT-net.

486
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,471
When they did, I knew you'd jump
at the chance to get out of here,

487
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,805
and try to open a breach.

488
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,350
I just had to track the portal energy.

489
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,061
Babe, just get him back here
so the agents can take him down.

490
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,981
You have approximately two minutes
before my ride out of here boots up.

491
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:07,362
I go bye-bye, and you take my place
in an Earth-19 collector jail.

492
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,072
But you're the one with the gun.

493
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,822
So...

494
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:14,160
do you have it in you to stop me?

495
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,665
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

496
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,168
You are an anomaly.

497
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,133
Makes me wonder
why it was so easy to frame you.

498
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:33,596
Don't you wanna know how I did it?
You might learn something.

499
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,390
No, I pretty much figured it all out.

500
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,768
After you got here, you killed
the top agent in the Collective,

501
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,853
but you still needed a way out.

502
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,523
<i>So, you used your face to get
into S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

503
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:45,733
<i>and plant this gun in my workshop.</i>

504
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,907
- Is that right?
- So far so good.

505
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,076
But hacking my white noise machine

506
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,661
<i>to make me sleepwalk...</i>

507
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,708
That's when you tipped your hand.

508
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,711
I'd recognize that coding anywhere.

509
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,296
And since I didn't hack it,

510
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,633
I knew it had to be
some other version of me.

511
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,470
I'm not just some other version of you.

512
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,724
I specialize in hacking
multi-versal databases

513
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,600
to create new identities.

514
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,437
I could change your world...

515
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,188
in an instant.

516
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,233
You see, somewhere out there

517
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,863
is a Cisco Ramon
who isn't as lucky as you are.

518
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:36,826
Who doesn't have the job,
the mind, the life you have.

519
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,787
But if the price is right,

520
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:44,041
Echo can reverse those fortunes.

521
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,880
And you might just wake up tomorrow
living someone else's life.

522
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,107
Is that why you killed her?

523
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,384
So you could keep peddling
these fake identities to people?

524
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,720
I didn't kill Gypsy.

525
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:57,596
You did.

526
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,435
I'll give her this.

527
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,604
She was a formidable fighter,

528
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,939
but not even the smartest
guy in the room

529
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,649
could beat her in hand-to-hand combat.

530
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,237
But it didn't matter. Even though
she'd been chasing me for years,

531
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,824
she never even knew what I looked like.

532
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:20,995
So, when she caught me
and she saw my face,

533
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:24,415
all it took was
one moment of her flinching,

534
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,543
and that gave me the second I needed

535
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,589
to use that gun, the same gun
that's in your hands right now.

536
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,051
Do you need me
to spell it out for you, genius?

537
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:40,640
Gypsy is dead because when she saw me,

538
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,976
- she saw you.
- Stop talking.

539
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,313
She didn't have to die,
but she couldn't let me go.

540
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,608
She breached me to this Earth,
and I vaporized her!

541
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,735
- No.
- Yes.

542
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,310
Don't feel bad, Cisco.

543
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,606
You're just not wired like me.

544
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:38,781
You're right.

545
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,284
I'm a hell of a lot smarter.

546
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,582
I programmed that weapon to trigger
an anti-vibrational force field

547
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,208
around whoever fires it.

548
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,669
In this case...

549
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,171
that's you, genius.

550
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,458
Did you get my holo-cube message?

551
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:08,853
It took you long enough.

552
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:25,286
Echo is in an Earth-19 cell,

553
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,455
where he belongs.

554
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,916
I'm sorry I lost faith in you, Cisky.

555
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,003
You know what? It's okay.

556
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,131
Things were looking pretty bad there
for a second.

557
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,173
Yeah.

558
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:43,179
But what I don't get...
If she was dying, why come here?

559
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,105
Because she knew
you would bring Echo to justice.

560
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,777
She had to lure him here, to this Earth.

561
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,073
She never lost faith in you, Cisco.

562
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:13,125
Now that this is over with,
what am I gonna do?

563
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,252
Same thing I have to do.

564
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,964
We start healing.

565
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:21,342
I wanna invite you

566
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:25,888
to Cynthia's remembrance ceremony
on Earth-19.

567
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,308
You, too.

568
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,019
I'd be honored.

569
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,271
Cynthia would have liked you.

570
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,192
I do, too.

571
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,153
What's not to love?

572
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,201
Awkward.

573
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,288
I have to go now.

574
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,758
Well, I... Yeah, I, um...

575
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,387
Well, we haven't said it.

576
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,097
Yeah, I know.

577
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:12,435
So... Yeah. I, um...

578
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:18,190
Me, too. Big time.

579
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,483
Oh, thank God.

580
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,702
Please tell me you went home
at some point.

581
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,413
I knew I smelled SPF 90.

582
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,625
- How was it?
- Amazing.

583
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:39,128
Fifteen beaches in 24 hours.

584
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,213
One of the many perks
of marrying a speedster.

585
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,174
Yo.

586
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,303
Chester's energy level's
already up to 87%?

587
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:51,682
Yeah. Yeah. The, uh, M.A.C.'s gonna
be done cooking them up any day now.

588
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:55,978
So, the B.A.R.I. was a success?

589
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,439
Actually, I had to get rid of it.

590
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,816
I did use it.
I tried to use it at first,

591
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,529
but over time, I finally realized...

592
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:09,950
And you already knew
that was gonna happen.

593
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,674
It's just more proof that you're
the right person to lead the team.

594
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:13,746
Mmm.

595
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:18,751
Cisco, we got your message.
I'm really sorry to hear about Gypsy.

596
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,920
Some things you never get over.

597
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,591
Well, her service is next week.

598
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,843
You want us to come with you?

599
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,087
- Yeah, I mean, we loved her, too.
- Thank you.

600
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,723
Uh, Kamilla's coming with me, so...

601
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,811
I'm very lucky to have her.

602
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:43,025
Is it wrong to feel that way?

603
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,695
I mean, with everything
that just happened.

604
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:50,241
It's like I'm moving on.

605
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,369
What kind of person does that?

606
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,372
Someone who is very much in love.

607
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:01,919
It's funny.

608
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,131
Cynthia wasn't the person
I ended up with.

609
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,591
But, um...

610
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,888
I think she taught me
how to be the person I needed to be...

611
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,808
for when the right person came along.

612
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,104
And for that, I will never forget her.

613
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:27,945
Your vitals are good, Joe.

614
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,134
You know, with all the hubbub
of saving your keisters,

615
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,077
I never got to ask
what the hell you were doing down there.

616
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,496
Hey, 1940s, no one says keisters.

617
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,833
Nash, if you would just tell us
what you're looking for down there,

618
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,668
we might be able to help you.

619
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,840
All right, tomorrow morning,
nine o'clock, tunnels.

620
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,216
Bring your whole fancy team.

621
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,562
- Why should we do that?
- Because...

622
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,138
I know how to save Barry Allen.

623
00:41:54,162 --> 00:42:02,162
