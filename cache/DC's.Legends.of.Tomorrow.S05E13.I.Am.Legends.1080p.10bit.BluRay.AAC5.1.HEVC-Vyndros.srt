1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,756
All right, Legends. Let's get
this show on the road.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,092
Can't let this immortality buzz
go to waste.

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,678
For your convenience,
I started a countdown timer.

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,931
23 hours and 45 minutes to save
my brother. You're welcome.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,017
All right. You heard the lady.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,143
Clock is ticking.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,519
Yeah, let's get back to the ship

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,896
and fire up the loom
before it's too late.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,982
Has anyone seen Gary because
someone at your party

10
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,942
has stolen my Shadow Stone.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,361
So if you come
across a disembodied voice

12
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,323
floating around, crying out like a baby,
then that's your culprit.

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,159
Yeah, Gary went back to the ship.
His bunny has IBS.

14
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,536
Yeah, and serious gas issues.

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,208
Ooh!

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,420
Wow, that is some arctic breeze
blowing in.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,297
[Agent Sharpe] Why are we in England?

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,341
[Constantine] Where the bloody hell
is the portal?

19
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,552
Has anyone seen Astra?

20
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,237
How's your tummy, my bunny-wummy?

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,072
[smooching]

22
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,908
Gideon, can you do me a favor?

23
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,619
Can you fabricate more veggies
for Gary Junior ll?

24
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,207
Gideon? You there?

25
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:24,918
Huh.

26
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,922
[Gideon] Gary, the ship's compromised.
They're shutting me down. [distorting]

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,638
If Gideon is down, then...

28
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,307
-who's flying the ship?
-[bunny squeaks]

29
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,809
Oh, come on.
Are you lot off your trolleys?

30
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,270
I mean,
why would Astra steal the Waverider, eh?

31
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,981
I know we're "friends" with her now,
but maybe she wanted to use the Loom.

32
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,524
Or what if my sisters got to her?

33
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,317
If they get control of the Loom
before we do,

34
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,986
we'll never get a chance
to bring my brother back.

35
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,113
Okay. Let's all just keep our cool.

36
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,864
Gideon, what's going on?

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,284
Gideon?

38
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,288
- Okay, no Gideon.
- Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

39
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,205
We'll figure this out.

40
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,420
What just happened?
Did you have another vision?

41
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,756
Uh, no, it's, um.., it was nothing.

42
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,676
As in, you saw nothing or what?

43
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,305
It was just a flash,
and then it was nothing.

44
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,850
I think it's the Chalice. It's probably
messing with my powers.

45
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,477
So what? Now you're just blind?

46
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,229
- Mick, that's insensitive.
- That's not helpful.

47
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,230
[gasps]

48
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,733
Wait, wait, wait. I think I just came up
with an amazing plan.

49
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,194
Rip set up Time Bureau safe houses
all over the world,

50
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,115
some of which are still standing,
like the one in London.

51
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,826
Yes? We go there, we get a Time Courier,

52
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,785
he'll take us to the Waverider.

53
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,703
- Yes.
- Yes.

54
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,955
[Sara] Yeah, babe.
That is a perfect plan.

55
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,707
And you know what? We're gonna do it.

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,086
We're gonna go to London because
we are immortal superheroes.

57
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,547
- Except me.
- Except for Zari.

58
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,842
And nothing is gonna stand in our way.

59
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,682
We're immortal and we're superheroes,
and we have to wait for the bus.

60
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,641
Yeah.

61
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,644
Well, at least Constantine
got us these nice warm clothes.

62
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,564
- We're ready for anything, right?
- Yeah, like a pheasant hunt.

63
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,484
But in our defense,
we do look pretty good.

64
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,737
Okay, tell me this. How do you live here
and not have a car?

65
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,781
Never needed one, love.
Always bummed a ride.

66
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,616
So exactly how far is it to London?

67
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,287
Well, according to my phone,
it says 275.8--

68
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,873
- Miles or kilometers?
- Doesn't matter, it's far.

69
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,583
When is the bus supposed to get here?

70
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:33,505
According to the schedule, it'll be here
in either one minute or three hours.

71
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,881
Wait. Guys, is it a holiday?

72
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,799
[Nate] Is it a holiday?

73
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,634
-[vehicle approaches]
- Ah. Finally.

74
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,593
- Yes!
- There we go.

75
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,511
Okay.

76
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,941
Now, hold up. Who's paying the fare?

77
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,234
- Does anybody have any money?
- No.

78
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
Uh...

79
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,238
Sir, I know this sounds ridiculous,

80
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,865
but the fate of the world depends on us
getting on this bus.

81
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,243
I don't care who depends on who.

82
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,079
When I'm driving this bus,
everyone pays the fare.

83
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,456
Have it your way.

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,541
[screams]

85
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,335
Well, come on!

86
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,087
[grunts]

87
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,840
I really am so sorry, sir.

88
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,383
Believe it or not, we're the good guys.

89
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,723
Bollocks!

90
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,951
Thank you for delivering
this lovely Timeship.

91
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,997
And Atropos, thank you for shutting off
that aggravating talking computer.

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
She thought she was so witty.

93
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,960
[sighs] You don't have to thank me.
It's not like I had a choice.

94
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,881
- You called in your favor, after all.
- Everything comes at a price, Astra.

95
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,049
I gave you a shot
at killing John Constantine,

96
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,301
and you squandered that.

97
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,553
You drank from the Chalice of Dionysus.

98
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,889
You're immortal for a day
and can operate the Loom of Fate.

99
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,851
Are you asking me to work with you?
Because I'm not hearing a question.

100
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,148
Fine, I'll join you.
But I have some demands.

101
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,983
Demands? Really?

102
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,320
Yeah. Now I've experienced
life on Earth again,

103
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,779
some things have got to change.

104
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,199
Like prunes. Disgusting.
I want them gone.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,327
And dogs, they should
stay puppies forever.

106
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,163
Oh, and there's just one more thing.

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,541
I want to bring my mother back to life.

108
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,168
Let's kill her.

109
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,422
- I'm immortal. Remember?
- For now.

110
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,218
Astra's friends will be
searching for us by now.

111
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,720
Do something productive
and take care of them

112
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:50,099
while I chat with Astra
about this list of demands.

113
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,437
Now, tell me about these prunes.

114
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,272
[Agent Sharpe] Um...

115
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,816
Should I tell Mick that he's driving
on the wrong side of the road or just--

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,444
No, definitely not.
It'll just confuse him more.

117
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,446
- Okay.
- Speaking of driving,

118
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,073
maybe you should run point
on this mission.

119
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,158
What?

120
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,744
Is this because you're blind?

121
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,788
Because you totally
killed it at beer pong.

122
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,997
Thank you.

123
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,750
But now that I can't see the future,
you know,

124
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,253
just thinking maybe I'm more
useful as a foot soldier.

125
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,381
And plus, you're exactly who
the team needs right now.

126
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,553
Uh, okay, fine.
But this is only temporary.

127
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,971
Because as far as I'm concerned,

128
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,889
we are co-captains for life.

129
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,724
Always.

130
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,496
[incanting in ancient Greek]
Rise again, oh fallen souls.

131
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:02,839
We seek revenge.
Help conquer our foes.

132
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,178
Who's that?

133
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,871
[Nate] We're gonna get
your brother back.

134
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,042
We're just taking, you know,
the scenic route.

135
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,963
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

136
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,883
Oh, you must be joking.
What are you doing?

137
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,801
Oh, I'm just having a little chin wag
with an old friend.

138
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,220
- Come on, give it here.
- This is not your friend.

139
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,931
I thought you quit.
Why are you starting again?

140
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,391
Because I trusted Astra

141
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,478
and then she betrayed me
by siding with Charlie's sisters.

142
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,898
Once they use the Loom,
we're all as good as dead anyway.

143
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,901
This doomsday act is getting super old.

144
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,111
Look around. The sky hasn't fallen.

145
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,446
The world is still here.

146
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,157
And for whatever reason, the cabal
of mystical seamstresses

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,116
hasn't started spinning yet.

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,244
Which means we still have time
to stop them.

149
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,538
So, just don't do that.

150
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,582
- Fine.
- It's so gross.

151
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,211

-[tires screeching]

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,813
- Oh, damn, Mick, you killed her.
- No, I didn't.

154
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,691
- How do you know?
- She's moving.

155
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,031
Uh, uh, ma'am, maybe you should
just stay down. Are you okay?

156

-[roars]
- Whoa.

[screeches]

00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,039
Punch it! Punch it!

160
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,253
Nice one.

161
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,923
Oh, we've seen this before in the forest
where Atropos was chasing us.

162
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,009
My sister will do everything she can
to stop us.

163
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,971
Then we're probably gonna start seeing
a lot more of these zombies soon.

164
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,306
- Or now.
- Hmm?

165
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,440
[growling]

166
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,322
[growling]

167
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,240
Let's go!

168
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,410
[grunts]

169
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,448
Oh, come on, really?

170
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,413
What the hell, John?
Now you have a death wish?

171
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,790
Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

172
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,792
See, apparently, the good thing
about having a damned soul

173
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,460
is these zombies
aren't interested in me.

174
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,339
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

175
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,758
- Cool demo. Could you do something now?
- Yeah, okay. Watch.

176
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,221
[gurgles]

[both grunting]

178
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,904
[Agent Sharpe] All right, team.

179
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,863
We gotta stick to the plan.

180
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,533
Let's get this bus up and running
before more of these come back.

181
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,201
[sighs]

[chitters softly]

183
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,958
Maybe this cable
will get Gideon back online.

[whir]

185

Gideon?

186
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,798
Should have paid more attention
in computer science.

187

[gasps]

190
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,194
Are you an angel?

191
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,029
Am I dead?

192
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,699
Oh, you're not dead, Gary.
And I'm Gideon.

193
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,617
- You're Gideon?
- Mmm-hmm.

194
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
But you're so...

195
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,455
You're so...

196
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,166
human. Are you real?

197
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,587
Well, I could explain,
but it wouldn't matter one bit.

198
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,507
Now, listen to me very carefully because
you have a rather important job to do.

199
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,134
- I do?
- Yes.

200
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,845
You must hide those
very important and powerful rings

201
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,263
from those evil sisters.

202
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,265
The fate of the world depends on it.

203
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,893
Now, come on, Gary.

204
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,145
It's time to get to work.

205
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,106
Guys, come on. We gotta keep moving

206
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,233
before my sisters send
something else our way.

207
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,987
The engine's busted after the fight,
and the fuel pump's got no power.

208
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,572
Even if we fix the pump,

209
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,783
all this leaking fluid tells me
this is a lost cause.

210
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,869
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, relax.

211
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,163
Remember when we all worked together
to defeat a time demon?

212
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,874
We can make it to London
if we just work together.

213
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,459
All right. How long is it going to take
to fix the engine?

214
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,003
- An hour.
- Maybe two.

215
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,005
To be honest, I don't know
anything about mechanics, so...

216
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,632
All right. We're running out of time.

217
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,675
You live around here.
You must know someone with a car.

218
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,844
- Yeah, I might know a bloke.
- Great.

219
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,431
Wait, Zari. Shouldn't you stay with us?
You're not immortal.

220
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,350
Look, I can't just
sit here and do nothing.

221
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,352
Hey, hey, hey.

222
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,853
- I got her. It's fine.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.

223
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,356
Where are you guys going?
We're not supposed to split up.

224
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,815
That's not a part of the plan!

225
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,235
Astra, dear, we have been
very patient with you,

226
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,155
especially considering you betrayed us
without saying a word.

227
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,990
You betrayed me first.

228
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,409
Besides, I had to take my destiny
into my own hands

229
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,453
and try to bring my mother back myself.

230
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,413
And I appreciate your gumption.

231
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,960
But I'm afraid you don't
fully grasp what that means.

232
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,003
Right now, my mother is dead.

233
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,340
I would like her to be alive.
Fairly simple concept.

234
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,136
But as you know,
life as a human is very difficult.

235
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,556
If you insist on having
a normal life with your mother,

236
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,517
you will be bound
to the rules of nature,

237
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,477
which are not kind to humans.

238
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,521
See for yourself.

[gasping]

243
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,289
Why would you show me that?

244
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,835
Because that is what is going to happen
if you bring your mother back.

245
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,131
Life as a human
is a life of pain and suffering.

246
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,967
Constantine promised
to bring your mother back

247
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,802
as if it would solve all your problems.

248
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,387
But what he didn't tell you...

249
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,682
is you're just postponing
the inevitable.

250
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,019
Why bring your mother back...

251
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,106
only to lose her all over again?

252
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,236
[Zari] Look, I couldn't just sit
in that bus and do nothing.

253
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,946
[Constantine] Oh, I suppose it's good
to go through the motions.

254
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,073
At least it gives you
the illusion of control.

255
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah, I'm not just
going through the motions,

256
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,994
I'm actually doing something
to save my brother.

257
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,039
Yeah, and I was actually
trying to help Astra,

258
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,540
and look what happened there.

259
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,918
You may see no point in trying,
but I'm not giving up.

260
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,211
Have you ever considered the possibility

261
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,922
that your brother's fate
is doomed in every timeline?

262
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,675
Apparently, this bloke, Rip Hunter,
used to say

263
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,303
that certain things are just inevitable.

264
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,723
Go to hell, John.

265
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,225
You know,
I've been there and back, love.

266
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,603
Look, I'm just trying to save you
the disappointment, is all.

267
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,855
You know what?
Let's just walk in silence. Cool? Cool.

268
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,524
Yeah.

269
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,986
Real smooth, Johnny. Real smooth.

270
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,996
She's so intriguing.

271
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,082
Gary, she's positively evil.

272
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,335
But she's so talented
with those weird knives.

273
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,962
Well, never mind her many
splendid talents, Gary.

274
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,924
I must ask you to focus,
pay attention now.

275
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,720
Okay, but how are we gonna distract her
to grab the rings so she doesn't notice?

276
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,972
I've got an idea.

277
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,849
Wish me luck.

278
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,018
Good luck.

279
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,262
[Agent Sharpe sighs]

280
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,389
What's up?

281
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,101
I really don't think I should have
let John and Zari go.

282
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,353
What if we get the bus up and running
before they get back?

283
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,522
Or even worse, more zombies?
Then what am I supposed to...

284
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,067
Hey. Don't sweat it
if the plan falls apart.

285
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,362
Sometimes, the best solutions come
when there is no plan at all.

286
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,199
Besides, Legends are
all about improvisation.

287
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,744
It's kind of like, uh, free-form jazz.

288
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,662
Ugh.

289
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,873
- I hate free-form jazz.
- Yeah, me too.

-[vehicle approaching]
- Uh, sounds like we have company.

Whoa, I think those are soldiers.

292
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,006
- Maybe they can help us get to London.
- What did I tell you?

- Hey, guys, hi!
-[soldier] Hands up!

- Oh, we are so glad you found us.
- Stay where you are.

295
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,391
They've got blood on their clothes.
They might be infected.

296
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,018
- What? No.
- No.

[chuckling]

298
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,979
- It's not.
- No, no, no, we're not infected.

Ow.

304
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,958
My God. These zombies
can withstand headshots.

305
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,711
Since when do zombies talk, you idiot?

306
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,671
Super zombies have become sentient.

307
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,049
Round them up and take them
back to base camp.

where I can see them.

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,939
- Yes.
- The rings are gone.

311
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,901
I don't understand.

312
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,903
- How could this happen?
- There must be someone else on the ship.

313
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,825
You're right. Someone else is here.

314
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,460
And I know exactly who it is.

315
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,256
I got the rings.
We make an amazing team.

316
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,259
We should have our own spin-off.

317
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,221
<i>[singing] Gideon and Gary
Having adventures</i>

318
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,931
<i>Solving problems</i>

319
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,433
<i>And saving the world</i>

320
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,851
[chuckles] Brilliant song, Gary.

321
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,186
You must teach it to me
once you've managed

322
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,981
to wrestle control of the Waverider
from those pesky sisters.

323
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,066
- I know how we can do that.
- Mmm.

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,193
We'll blow up the ship.

325
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,822
Or, perhaps, we'll do something
just a smidge less suicidal.

326
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,782
Oh, that sounds like fun.

327
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,286
Let's track down a Courier, so we can
jump the rest of the Legends here.

328
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,871
Well, what are we waiting for?

329
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,334
Let's go to the lab and make
those Couriers ours.

330
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,754
Gary, you're making me blush. [chuckles]

331
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,047
[chuckles]

332
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,675
-[both chuckle]
- Let's go.

333
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,557
[Zari] This is charming.

334
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,560
How did you hear about this place?

335
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,188
Back in the day, old man Joe called
me about a demon-possessed '75 Fiat.

336
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,357
It was a right messy exorcism.

337
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,026
And a right crappy car.

338
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,777
Ah, now, there's a beauty.

339
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,156
All right, come on. We don't want to be
out here any longer than we have to be.

340
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,574
[growl]

341
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,534
What was that?

342
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,329
It is not a sound we want
to be waiting around for.

343
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,415
-[growling]
- Okay, let's go, this way, go.

344
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,419
[growling]

345
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,183
[panting]

346
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,436
- Okay, I'll go find the van keys.
- Yeah, all right, yeah. You do that.

347
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,239
Okay.

348
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
Thanks, Old Man Joe.

349
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,295
[howls]

350
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,935
Ugh. [gags]

351
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,937
What is that infernal racket?
Are you all right?

352
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,814
Yup. Yeah. I am fine. Just...

353
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,566
Filing this away for future therapy.

354
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,944
Ugh.

355
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,154
Okay.

356
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,620
We better leg it to that chip van before
you become zombie fodder.

357
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,956
John, there's too many
of them out there.

358
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,917
But they're not interested in you.

359
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
You need to take the van,
find the team and save Behrad.

360
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,172
No, no, no, no, no,
that is a terrible idea.

361
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,590
Why, because you didn't think of it?

362
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,592
Because I'm not leaving
you here to die, all right?

363
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,471
That's it.

364
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,265
Oh, now you're good with
leaving me to die?

365
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,558
Yes to death, no to leaving.

366
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,226
You see, there was
this spell that the ancient Egyptians--

367
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,103
I don't need the history lesson,
John, just do it.

368
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,605
Yeah, all right,
but it means stopping your heart.

369
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,483
And when I do that, we've only got a few
minutes before the rest of you stops.

370
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,528
It's risky and anything can go wrong.

371
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,532
You know what? This whole day
has gone wrong, so,

372
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,616
Why stop now?

373
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,286
Why, indeed?

374
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,332
You're making a huge mistake.

375
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,501
What sentient zombies
are this well-dressed?

376
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,046
Damn it. I promised Lita
I would never get locked up again.

377
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,715
This stays between us.

378
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,341
Okay, I am...
I am just gonna make up a speech.

379
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,385
About what? I don't know.
Just made up on the spot.

380
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,471
Ava's lost it, she's lost it.

381
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,722
- Shh, she's thinking...
- Okay.

382
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,390
You know what, guys? Um...

383
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,435
We are not wasting
any more time in this tin can.

384
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,104
Let's try to get creative and think
about what resources we have.

385
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,814
- Okay.
- Look, we've got

386
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,274
a guy who turns into steel.

387
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,319
We've got a shapeshifter, right?

388
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,905
That's friggin' amazing.
We've got a kickass blind assassin.

389
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,781
And a reformed thief
turned romance novelist.

390
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,700
Who you calling reformed?

391
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,784
Oh. Well...

392
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,785
Whoa.

393
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,786
Wait a minute.

394
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,914
I've been locked up
in one of these before.

395
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,831
[gasp]

396
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,501
There's a weak door...

397
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,628
down here somewhere.

398
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,171
[Mick tapping]

399
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,088
Ah.

400
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,090
Steel boy, punch.

401
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,092
I'd be honored.

402
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,305
Whoa, wait, what, so we're gonna
just jump out of a moving car?

403
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,683
Uh, you know, we're not going to die,
but it's really going to hurt.

404
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,897
- Okay, who's first?
- You!

405

-[Nate yells]
-[metallic scraping]

406
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,109
- Oh, God!
- Out of here, sucker!

407
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,611
[yells]

408
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,363
All right, then, come on, step right up.

409
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,656
- You got her?
- Yeah, got her. Yeah.

410
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,698
Whoo!

411
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,159
I'm actually glad I can't see
what's about to happen.

412
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,702
Ready? And jump!

413
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,828
[yells]

414
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,789
Gravity's actually
not a part of the plan!

415
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,748
[whoops]

416
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,214
- Ow!

- Ah.

-[all groan]
- Well, Ava,

419
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,180
as far as inspirational speeches go,
I give that a gentleman's 7.

420
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,683
You know what?
I will take it because now we are...

421
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,352
80 miles from London, which is...

422
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,146
-you know, closer than we were before.
- Yeah.

423
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,233
- We're never going to make it.
- Hey! Never say "never."

424
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,277
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Can you help us?

425
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,820
[grunting] Ow!

426
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,947
Don't stop, Wilbur! Zombies!

427
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,117
Damn it!

428
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,245
You're giving off a vibe.

429
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,580
Oh, man.

430
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,957
-[Sara] Come on, babe, we gotta walk!
- I'm coming.

[growling]

432
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,633
All right, love. Can you give me
a bit of room here, eh?

433
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,178
[clears throat] Sure.

434
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,639
Okay.

435
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,688
If I die, I can't believe the last thing
I'm going to see is your face.

436
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,065
Yeah, well, better than
those zombies out there, eh?

437
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,984
Debatable.

438
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,403
Yeah. All right, love.

439
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,698
Close your eyes now.

440
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,742
Okay.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

Don't do this to me!
Don't do this to me!

450
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,460
Come on, Zari, come on!

451
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,921
Come on, don't do this.

452

Come on, come back to me, love.
Come back to me.

[growling]

456
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,190
We need to get out of here.

457
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,161
- Got one!
- Smashing job, Gary.

458
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,579
Now, let's go get your friends,

459
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,706
so we can finish this adventure
once and for all.

460
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,874
Easy enough.

She means it. She'll skin you alive.

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,634
What are you doing, Astra?
Why are you working with them?

465
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,678
Now, give us the rings.
We know you have them.

00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,405
[Gideon] I can't, Gary.

474
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,199
I'm just a figment of your imagination.

475
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,785
But you must believe in yourself.

476
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,578
And don't give in,
no matter what they do.

477
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,251
How could I give you the rings
if they were never really here?

478
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,547
Trickery.

479
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,800
I may have been electrocuted
by Gideon's mainframe,

480
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,843
but I could still do
a simple obfuscation spell.

481
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,429
Time for more persuasive tactics.

482
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,389
[gasps]

483
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,022
Those headlights are coming in fast.

484
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,149
All right, everybody. Just be cool.

485
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,109
Yeah? try to act as
un-zombie-like as possible.

486
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,320
- Maybe Mick should stand in the back.
- Mmm.

487
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,327
Get in, losers, we're going looming.

488
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,246
[cheering]

489
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,265
Uh, hello?

490
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,810
Ex-Director Sharpe here,
who's manning this post?

491
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,786
Aha!

492
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,040
Well, cheers to this nightmare of a day
coming to an end soon.

493
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,083
[Sara] I'll drink to that.

494
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,002
Yeah, well, we're not out
of the woods yet, love,

495
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,962
but you can sign me up
for a beer anytime.

496
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,088
[sighs]

497
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,719
Yup, John was right.
We are not out of the woods yet.

498
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,137
Is it dead?

499
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,556
Yeah, how did you know?

500
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,768
Great, that's just great.

501
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,271
My brother's gone forever,
and the world's going to end

502
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,064
-because someone forgot to charge it.
-[slams table]

503
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,232
Great.

504
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,664
Smoke break?

505
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,917
Actually, uh...

506
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,336
I quit smoking.

507
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:16,922
Again.

508
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,008
Mmm, don't tell me you finally
found something to live for.

509
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,009
[grunts]

510
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,802
There's no point.

511
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,640
The Fates are literally against us.

512
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:31,019
I mean, how else do you explain
an overnight zombie apocalypse?

513
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,813
Or the fact that we're now
at the mercy of a charger?

514
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,609
You know, I gotta say,

515
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,403
all this doom and gloom attitude

516
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,863
really don't suit you, love.

517
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,867
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had
a monopoly on doom and gloom.

518
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,452
No, I'm just saying,

519
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,371
you stick to what you know best, is all.

520
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,040
Yeah, I'm not going to take advice
from a professional exorcist

521
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,375
with a savior complex.

522
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,502
[laughs] Come on,
I do not have a savior complex.

523
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,337
[chuckles] Are you serious right now?

524
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,006
"Oh, save me from my demons,
John Constantine!"

525
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,717
Oh, what about you, then?
You talk about savior complex,

526
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,970
what with all your self-help
and advice videos.

527
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,681
Saving your minions from a life
of drudgery.

528
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,016
I give my followers
something to aspire to.

529
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,851
Aspire to? Really?

530
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:16,439
What's that, then? Ah, oh, yeah,
it's being a superficial git.

531
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,109
If you think I'm superficial,
then why are you here with me?

532
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,610
Do you know what, I don't know,
I just think I haven't

533
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,070
had enough punishment for one day.

534
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,073
Punishment? You should just go, then.
Right now.

535
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,825
You want me to leave?
Because I will leave.

536
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,035
- I will go right now and not come back.
- Good, great.

537
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,745
Leave. I wouldn't wanna
be with you right now,

538
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,122
if you were the last man on Earth.

539
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,373
Well, good,
because I wouldn't wanna be with you

540
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,583
-if you were the last woman--
-[exclaims with frustration]

541
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,305
So, where should we start?

542
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,434
Head, shoulders, knees

543
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,060
or toes?

544
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,565
[voice trembles]
How about none of those things?

545
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,901
You can hand me those rings
or you can give me your hands,

546
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,028
it is that simple.

547
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,822
This isn't you. You're not like them.

548
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,949
[screams, gasps]

549
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,160
You don't know a thing about me.

550
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,537
I do know that when you had to choose
between staying

551
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,539
in hell or putting your trust
in the Legends,

552
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,459
you grabbed Ava's hand and took
a leap of faith.

553
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,341
That was a mistake.

554
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,010
A moment of weakness

555
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,471
when I still believed
I wanted to see my mother.

556
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,639
Wait.

557
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,017
You don't want your mother
to come back anymore?

558
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,311
Not if it means
losing her all over again.

559
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,606
Lachesis opened my eyes
and showed me her death

560
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,733
and what it would be like
if I brought her back.

561
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,194
You actually had to see your mother die?

562
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,782
Are you okay? Because if I were you,
I'd be a big puddle of--

563
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,825
Of course I am not okay.

564
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,953
It was bad enough losing her
when I was a kid.

565
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,414
But did this Lachesis lady
show you anything else?

566
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,125
Like, what about all the good moments?

567
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,418
Before she died.

568
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:01,461
Why bother?

569
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,880
Those memories would be

570
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,050
painful reminders of what I would
one day have to lose.

571
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,427
You must have some memories of your mom

572
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,429
when you were little
that make you smile.

573
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,847
Right?

574
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,060
Well, maybe,
instead of torturing me, you could...

575
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,355
I don't know, share one?

576
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,735
[door opens]

577
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,114
You guys good?

578
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,032
Yeah, feeling a little better.

579
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,867
Wow. Those yams?

580
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,078
- Horrible, aren't they?
-[groans]

581
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,539
Look, guys, I know today was...

582
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,166
-was rough. I mean...
- Oh.

583
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,918
You got shot in the head,
for Pete's sake.

584
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,336
Do you have to bring that up?

585
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,298
And if I could,
I'd spend every day like this.

586
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,676
Sitting around with my pals.

587
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,010
[Agent Sharpe] Aw.

588
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,973
Well, you could end every day any way
you like with the Loom of Fate, mate.

589
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,351
You know, after we best your sister,
any one of us might be called

590
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,562
to use the Loom,
and you got to ask the question,

591
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,522
what kind of temptations we'd have?

592
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,483
I'm actually pretty happy just...

593
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,154
flying through time with you guys,

594
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,655
and I got my lady.

595
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,574
I'm pretty happy-

596
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,285
Mmm. Same.

597
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,079
I'd be a criminal again.
The simple life.

598
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:24,878
You know, if Behrad were alive
and we were together and happy, I...

599
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,382
I don't know, I would use my talents

600
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,967
to make the world a more...

601
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,304
inclusive, better place, I guess.

602
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:42,896
Well, I, for one, would throw
a multi-continent rager. [chuckles]

603
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,356
- Would you really, though, John-o?
- I would, yeah.

604
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,567
[Charlie] There's nothing
a little deeper...

605
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,528
little closer to your heart?

606
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,201
Oh, you know, uh... [clears throat]

607
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,162
Even after everything that's happened...

608
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,166
I'd wanna do right by Astra, you know.

609
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,420
Make sure she was happy
growing up in a big house,

610
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,380
and I could keep an eye on her.

611
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,426
Sure is nice to dream.

612
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,844
I'll drink to that.

613
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,013
Cheers!

614
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,808
[Constantine chuckles]

615
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,033
Okay.

616
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,703
What are you not telling me?

617
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,455
Nothing.

618
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,456
[Scoffs]

619
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,666
Come on.

620
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,001
Let me guess.

621
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,212
You didn't really lose your powers.

622
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,255
Yeah?

623
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,923
You had a vision.

624
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,634
And you saw the future, and you don't
want to tell me about what happened.

625
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:55,718
Am I right?

626
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,179
The Courier is not going
to charge in time.

627
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,016
- In time for what?
- In time to escape

628
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,520
before that front door gets
busted down by what's outside.

629
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,148
Why'd you lie to me, babe?

630
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,820
[sighs] Because my vision ended
with me dying here.

00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,241
In this pub.

632
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,202
Sorry, what?

633
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,831
Oh, my God,
I can't really think straight. I just...

634
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,374
It's okay.

635
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,876
This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

636
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,089
I didn't want to distract you
from getting the team to this moment.

637
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,550
Okay, so you have been saying
goodbye and just

638
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,427
pushing me to take over this whole time?

639
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,764
[sighs] Yes, but it's a temporary
goodbye, all right?

640
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,934
Because you guys,
you're going to fix this,

641
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,477
and you're going to save the day.

642
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,645
Did you happen
to have some sort of vision

643
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,730
of how we saved the day, Sara,

644
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,398
because that would
be really helpful right now.

645
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,193
I wish, but, no, I couldn't see anything
past my death. That was it.

646
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,946
Okay.

647
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,115
And what if we don't succeed?

648
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,576
I have faith in you, babe.

649
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,453
And I have faith in this team.

650
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,622
And after I go,
you will fix it, I know it.

651
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,835
Um, I don't wanna freak you guys out...

652
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,088
but we're completely surrounded
by zombies.

[growling]

654
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,981
Looks like they're biding their time
until our immortality runs out.

655
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,068
Well, damnees,
the inevitable has arrived.

656
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,154
Kiss your immortality goodbye.

657
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,368

[roaring]

659
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,762
[Astra] It's strange the memories
you hold on to when someone's gone.

660
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,266
My mom loved strawberries.

661
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,979
And one year we went
strawberry picking at this farm.

662
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,817
And we just ate them right off the vine.

663
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,319
They didn't even make it to the basket.

664
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,281
We just spent the whole day
stuffing ourselves.

665
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,035
Sounds like a cool lady.

666
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,538
She was.

667
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,958
Think about all the strawberries
you could pick if you came--

668
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,376
Okay, enough wheedling.

669
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,795
Just show me how to use this damn thing,

670
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,089
so we can get help
and I can bring her back already.

671
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,384
Okay, yeah. So--

672
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,929
Congratulations. You're just as weak
as any other human.

673
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,974
Your immortality has run out. Time's up.

674
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,018
[gasps]

675
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,482
The rings.

676
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,152
Or join your friend on the floor.

[all grunting]

678

We just have to hold out
until the Courier charges.

680

The door's not going to hold.

681
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,921
Once they're inside,
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

682
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,805
Sara.

683

Co-captains for life.

684
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,142
Always.

685
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,817
Come on.

686
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,383
The bloody thing's still charging.

687
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,358
Hey, deadheads, over here!

688
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,428
[Sara grunts]

689
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,898
Sara!

[flesh ripping]

691
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,322
It's charged.

692
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,575
Charlie, you have to go.

693
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,118
Deal with your sisters and fix this.

694
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,203
- How?
- You've outsmarted them once before,

695
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,621
you can do it again.

Charlie, thank God you're here.

702
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,050
Your sisters took over the ship
and they somehow convinced Astra

703
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,218
to work with them, and then I convinced
her she was wrong,

704
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,928
which is how she ended up on the floor.

705
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,181
Where's everyone else?

706
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,932
There's no time to explain,
where are the rings?

707
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,476
Okay, yeah.

708
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,189
We have to be careful.
Your sisters were just--

What a pity.

711
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,539
You've come crawling back.

712
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,958
You're just in time, Clotho.

713
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,089
I'm done running.

714
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,635
Now, let's get to work.
