1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:01,804
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:04,749
After 6 months in hell, I
have been released from prison

3
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:06,700
and returned home with only one goal...

4
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:09,554
To save my city, but
things have changed.

5
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:11,089
Instead of operating outside the law,

6
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,325
I am now working alongside the police.

7
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:16,153
I am no longer inmate 4587.

8
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:19,109
I am once more the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,570
Previously on "Flash"...

10
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:23,534
Dr. John Deegan,

11
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:26,247
use this book to reshape the world

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,773
as you see fit.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,375
I can see everything.

14
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:33,944
Barry, are you okay?

15
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm Barry.

16
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,384
I'm Oliver Queen.

17
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,450
Maybe it's just Earth
1 that's been affected.

18
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:43,221
If we can get to Earth 38 and find Kara,

19
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:46,195
if she remembers us, then maybe she
can help fix whatever's happening.

20
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,585
Whoa, Lois. Wait, wait.

21
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,609
This is Barry and
Oliver. They're friends.

22
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:51,867
So you know that I'm
Oliver and he's Barry?

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,065
- Why wouldn't I?
- We could use your help.

24
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,101
I vibed somebody in the speed lab,

25
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,103
some guy with ridges on his head.

26
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,438
I know where to find him.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,898
So what's our next move?

28
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,042
We're going to Gotham City.

29
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,548
Ohh!

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,818
Okay. I know this sounds nuts
and completely unscientific,

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,852
but I think that freaking
lightning is following us.

32
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:17,121
- Focus, Curtis.
- This is me focusing.

33
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:18,824
These atmospheric anomalies
are playing all kinds

34
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:19,976
of hell on my equipment,

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,196
plus you don't want
that lightning to hit

36
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,968
when you're engaging Deathstroke's son.

37
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,170
I just had to say it.

38
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:33,960
Kane Wolfman, you're under arrest

39
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:36,207
for 19 violations of international law!

40
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,777
Really? Does that
include the murder of...

41
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,835
4 A.R.G.U.S. field agents?

42
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:44,679
Last chance! On the ground now!

43
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:11,143
This isn't personal. Just business.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,353
Son of a bitch.

45
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,021
Is that any way to greet your friends?

46
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:25,757
All I know is that whenever
the three of you show up,

47
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,260
it usually means we
have one huge problem.

48
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:39,507
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - 
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

49
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,039
So you're you.

50
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,477
And you're you.

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,734
An immortal Egyptian,
aliens, parallel earth Nazis.

52
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,638
I have no idea why I'm even
surprised at this point.

53
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:53,946
I'm still trying to
figure out if this is

54
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,200
more like "Freaky
Friday" or "Quantum Leap."

55
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:57,428
No. If this were like "Quantum Leap,"

56
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,790
I'd only look like myself in the mirror.

57
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,827
Yep. You are definitely
not Oliver Queen.

58
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,188
We think that the red skies

59
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,263
and these lightning
strikes have to be related

60
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,185
to whatever happened to
Barry and Oliver somehow.

61
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,721
We need you to solve the
somehow while we're in Gotham.

62
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,562
No problem. I mean, A.R.G.U.S. has

63
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,234
all the best analytic toys,

64
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,307
but what we really need is a
pattern recognition algorithm,

65
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,741
and, unfortunately, Felicity isn't...

66
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:17,990
- I called Felicity.
- Wait, wait.

67
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,110
- You called Felicity?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,046
Okay. Right. Well, I
guess that makes sense

69
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,750
because technically,
you are her husband.

70
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,578
I'm confused.

71
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,614
I've been summoned?

72
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:32,540
- Yes. Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

73
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,575
I mean, things might be
fraught between us, Oliver.

74
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:36,161
That doesn't mean I'm not gonna show up.

75
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,263
They are? They are?

76
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:43,813
They are. Yeah, which is... Sad.

77
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:48,545
So, um, this lightning thing.

78
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,060
Um, could you help me out with that?

79
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,486
Can I kind of show you
kind of what I'm thinking?

80
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,321
- Yeah.
- Okay.

81
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,950
Okay. So why didn't you tell Felicity?

82
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,087
Well, because we tried to tell
everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs,

83
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,555
and it didn't really go over so well.

84
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:04,900
Felicity and I have
enough problems as it is

85
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,580
without introducing body swapping.

86
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,056
We thought we'd just let
her think everything's

87
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:11,562
normal and that Barry and I are solving

88
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:12,727
another problem.

89
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,267
If you find out how this lightning thing

90
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,143
relates to whatever it is
that we're dealing with here,

91
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:19,412
can you please tell us?

92
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,947
Copy that.

93
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,917
Hey. This thing isn't
gonna be permanent, is it?

94
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,054
- I hope not.
- I hope not.

95
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,656
Jinx.

96
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:31,248
Oh. Barry, there's something
I'd like to discuss before we go.

97
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,185
- What's that?
- That you probably shouldn't go.

98
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,157
What?

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,826
Oliver Queen is a public figure

100
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,329
and an infamous vigilante.

101
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:38,908
If you are in Gotham
City, you're attracting

102
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,252
the type of attention
that we don't want.

103
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,048
No. If... if Gotham
can handle the Batman,

104
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,540
it can handle the Green Arrow.

105
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,415
The Batman's an urban legend.

106
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,118
Wait. You don't believe Batman's real?

107
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,712
He's not real. He's an urban legend

108
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,540
concocted by the
Gotham police department

109
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:52,978
to scare criminals.

110
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,780
And I'm the original vigilante, Barry.

111
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:56,354
Okay, if you guys are
done fooling around...

112
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:58,276
Actually, you know what?
Could you pull that thing up?

113
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,921
Because, unlike you, my
identity's not public,

114
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,057
and I'd like to keep it that way.

115
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,189
This isn't your real face!

116
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:03,618
It might end up being my real face

117
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:05,814
if we don't sort this
mess out, so could you?

118
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,025
- Happy?
- Ecstatic.

119
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,292
Apparently, you guys
aren't done fooling around.

120
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,762
Well, I guess I'm running alone.

121
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:30,368
Ho ho ho! That is so awesome.

122
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,543
So this is Gotham.

123
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,280
Doesn't look so tough to me.

124
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,509
Where's Oliver?

125
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,178
Huh. I don't know.

126
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,988
Guess he's still getting the hang of it.

127
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,189
Yeah.

128
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,306
Ha ha ha!

129
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,876
I'm still getting the hang of it.

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,642
All right. All right.

131
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,177
So how do we find two people

132
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,978
in a city of 1.6 million?

133
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:54,832
There is a radio personality
named Vesper Fairchild.

134
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:57,190
She knows everyone in
Gotham, and I know her.

135
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:58,794
She was doing an exposé
on white-collar crime

136
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:01,616
back in the day, and I
wanted to persuade her

137
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,586
that Queen Consolidated was above board.

138
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,288
So you slept with her, right?

139
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,654
No. I... I don't know.

140
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,549
Gosh. You really got around
back in the day, didn't you?

141
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,959
Oh. One time, Oliver
cheated on his girlfriend

142
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,103
with her sister.

143
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:16,532
- Barry!
- Oh, no! Ohh!

144
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:18,142
What? You did!

145
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,079
So, what, depending on this past
relationship with this woman,

146
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:23,084
we might have to come
up with a plan "B."

147
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:24,798
Is that what you're saying?

148
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,579
- Yeah.
- Guys!

149
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,282
Take a look at this.

150
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,940
You still think he's a myth?

151
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,643
Yeah! Let's go.

152
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,679
Batman's real.

153
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,290
If I remember right,

154
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:07,846
the radio station was this way.

155
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,186
I'm surprised they put it
in the bad part of town.

156
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,580
It's cute how you think
there's a good part of town.

157
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:21,510
Looks like the one percenters

158
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:23,428
bring the good part with them.

159
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:27,600
This is why nobody
talks about Gotham, okay?

160
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,869
City might as well be dead.

161
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,105
Sounds like you guys
aren't from around here.

162
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:34,007
Probably don't know,

163
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,809
but Gotham tourism bureau collects a tax

164
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,197
on out of towners,

165
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,061
so phones, wallets, watches now.

166
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:44,617
You know what, fellas? I...
we don't want any trouble,

167
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:47,287
so maybe we can just
talk this out, okay?

168
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,490
Ha ha ha! Talk it out.

169
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,559
Okay. I'll talk first.

170
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:03,336
Hey!

171
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,104
Agh!

172
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,288
Oh, great.

173
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,214
On the ground now!

174
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:18,818
All of you, on the
ground! Show me your hands!

175
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,420
Oh, crap.

176
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:24,457
I need SWAT at Nolan and Burton.

177
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,859
Green Arrow sighted at Nolan and Burton.

178
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:28,828
Sir, we don't want any trouble.

179
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,588
Yeah. Tell that to Oliver Queen here.

180
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,659
Oliver, stand down.

181
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,748
Pattern recognition algo
is locked and loaded.

182
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,002
Bringing it online now.

183
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,606
You realize that this
may not work, right?

184
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,785
Like, there may not be
a pattern to recognize.

185
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,772
Is there a suggestion bound
within that dose of pessimism?

186
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,112
Does the energy
discharge of the lightning

187
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,650
look familiar to you?

188
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,054
The quantum amplitude is consistent
with a dimensional breach.

189
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,564
Exactly. We're gonna need
Cisco's help on this one.

190
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,400
I've been summoned!

191
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,402
Okay. That was a disturbingly
coincidental entrance.

192
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,467
It wasn't coincidental.

193
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,371
We'd been getting the same red skies

194
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:13,931
and freaky lightning in Central City,

195
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,127
and I'll tell you this
much... It wasn't speed force.

196
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,577
Wait, wait. Hold up.
"We'd been," "wasn't,"

197
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,768
as in past tense?

198
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,729
Interestingly, the
atmospheric phenomenon ceased

199
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,588
the moment Barry and
Oliver left Central City.

200
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:26,257
It's like it packed up its
bags and followed them here.

201
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,525
That's why we came.

202
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,796
The phenomenon has to be
related to Barry and Oliver's...

203
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,823
- Okay, Caitlin. Okay?
- Body swap?

204
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:34,761
Ahem. Don't... Don't say... ahem.

205
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:39,465
I'm sorry. Body... body what?

206
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:44,404
You, uh... you didn't tell her?

207
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:49,876
Again, tell me... heh... what?

208
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:57,033
Um, excuse me, Officer.

209
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,228
Were you able to get in
touch with Laurel Lance

210
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,916
at the Star City D.A.'s office or...

211
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,809
Yeah. She said, uh, "I
think a night in jail

212
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,912
would do them some good."

213
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,481
Heh.

214
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,599
What were you thinking?

215
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:16,385
That you were about
to get yourself shot.

216
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:17,722
- You're welcome.
- I was deescalating

217
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:19,596
the situation, you know, like, uh...

218
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,822
- Like I would?
- Uh-huh!

219
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:21,579
Guess what, man.

220
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,260
I handled it exactly how you would!

221
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:26,041
Okay. You guys, maybe taking
on each other's personalities

222
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:29,212
worked for AMAZO, but you were not gonna

223
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,978
talk your way out of getting mugged,

224
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:33,822
and you escalated the
situation way too fast.

225
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,025
So what would you have done?

226
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,369
What I would have done is
supersped us right out of there.

227
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,740
All they would have
seen is a gust of wind.

228
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,862
I mean, hindsight is 20/20,

229
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,104
but we'll follow your lead next time.

230
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,331
Because there will really be a next time

231
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,761
when someone threatens
3 superheroes with a gun.

232
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,430
Good news.

233
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,150
Somebody posted your bail.

234
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,236
- Who?
- I don't know.

235
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,662
Guess someone wanted to
make you guys their headache

236
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,231
instead of mine.

237
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,751
We'll show ourselves out.

238
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,353
Please come with me.

239
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,389
I'm guessing this belongs
to whoever bailed us out.

240
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:22,883
I really think we've had

241
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:24,452
enough distractions for one night.

242
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:25,727
Yeah. I agree with my friend.

243
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,964
We appreciate the
early release, whatever,

244
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,041
but we're really fine on our own.

245
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,211
I'm afraid my employer insists.

246
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,081
Okay.

247
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,250
And you said it wouldn't happen again.

248
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,644
Bruce Wayne got us out of jail?

249
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,150
Doesn't sound like him.

250
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:09,688
No, it wasn't. Wayne
left Gotham 3 years ago.

251
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:12,351
Why? To go where?

252
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,787
No one knows.

253
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,656
So who's manning the shop now?

254
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:26,257
Apparently after he left,
Bruce's board of directors

255
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,166
went to town with a bunch of
aggressive get-rich-quick deals.

256
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,336
Yeah, but an abandoned building

257
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,374
didn't bail us out, right?

258
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:39,674
Whoa. That is definitely
not Bruce Wayne.

259
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,056
Oliver Queen.

260
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,587
Ahem.

261
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,890
Yeah, yeah. I'm Oliver Queen. Yeah.

262
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:53,430
- And you are?
- The rain on your parade.

263
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,733
If you're visiting Gotham
to compare grappling hooks

264
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,697
with Batman, you are out of luck.

265
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,099
No one's seen him in years.

266
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,119
Told you.

267
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,035
Myth.

268
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:07,373
I would never compare
myself to a total badass

269
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,658
like Batman.

270
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:12,777
What I think Oliver is trying to say

271
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,513
is thank you for getting us out of jail.

272
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:16,682
What Oliver's actually trying to say is

273
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:19,596
who are you, and why are you helping us?

274
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,419
Gotham has enough problems without a guy

275
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:24,490
in green leather showing
off his arrows to everyone,

276
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:27,560
so the faster you find
what you're looking for,

277
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,462
the faster you can get
the hell out of my city.

278
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,197
Uh, but, what... what
should we call you...

279
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,733
Rain, Ms. Parade?

280
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,868
Kane, Kate Kane.

281
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,119
You didn't tell her?!

282
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:47,412
Oliver... the actual
Oliver thought they had

283
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,515
enough problems with Felicity already.

284
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:52,333
Oh, and you didn't think to
loop us in on the fact that you

285
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,485
were keeping the "Freaky
Friday" situation on the hush?

286
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,255
I was thinking it was
more like "Quantum Leap."

287
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:57,443
No. If this were like "Quantum Leap,"

288
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:59,440
they'd only look like themselves when
they see themselves in the mirror...

289
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,209
It depends on what
type of quantum leap...

290
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,230
Shouldn't we concentrate on
what this lightning came from?

291
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,963
- Right?
- Right, but...

292
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:06,666
Oh. Ahem.

293
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:09,085
Ok, guys. You don't need
to tip-toe around me.

294
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:10,602
It's just a lot to process.

295
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,368
It's not every day that
you find out that your ex

296
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,686
is your husband and vice-versa.

297
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:17,063
Yeah. Iris was, pretty freaked
out, too, when she sussed it out.

298
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,166
Wait. Iris.

299
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,266
You know, actually, John...
right before you came in,

300
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,529
John was just saying that we need
to really handle that lightning...

301
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,668
Iris was able to tell that
something was off with Barry?

302
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,084
- No, not exactly.
- Oh, totally. I mean,

303
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,454
it was like lover's intuition.

304
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:30,129
That's how you can
tell these two were...

305
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:32,561
You know, Felicity, um, there's
something very strange going on here,

306
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,993
so I wouldn't take this as a commentary

307
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,579
on you and Oliver's marriage.

308
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,149
No. My marriage with Oliver is strained

309
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,032
by the fact that we've
become different people...

310
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:44,437
Quite literally in Oliver's case.

311
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,043
If the lightning strikes are
attempted dimensional breaches,

312
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:52,945
there might be a way to
stabilize the quantum flux

313
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:55,681
to allow whatever's trying to
get through to get through, right?

314
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,850
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

315
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:05,291
You guys try facial recognition?

316
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:07,760
One of Bruce's R&D guys
still works in the building.

317
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,426
I can give this to him.

318
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,082
Uh, we did try it,

319
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,451
so thank you, but no luck.

320
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,644
Besides, I'd think if Wayne's R&D's

321
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,935
in the same shape as this building,

322
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,716
it's not gonna really do us any good.

323
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,957
Suit yourself.

324
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,972
Seems strange, doesn't it,

325
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,142
that Bruce Wayne and Batman disappeared

326
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,777
from Gotham around the same time.

327
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,013
Well, when Batman left, the city went

328
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:28,356
to 5 different kinds of hell,

329
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,716
which for Gotham is
really saying something.

330
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,486
Took a toll on Bruce.

331
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:35,903
Is that why he left?

332
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,639
Still trying to figure that out.

333
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,042
Right, but you work for him,

334
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:40,692
and you don't know why he left?

335
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,040
Who said I work for him?

336
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,572
How'd it go with Vesper?

337
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,064
She hung up on me.

338
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,866
Apparently, I did sleep with her.

339
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,642
- Hmm.
- Okay. The building is

340
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,306
under renovation, so this is

341
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,009
the best place for you
guys to work out of.

342
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:58,275
Oh, and the, uh, Wi-Fi
password's "Alfred."

343
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:00,044
So if Vesper's not gonna help us,

344
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,306
we're just back at square one.

345
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,191
No, we're not. I lifted this off

346
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,749
of a computer at the precinct.

347
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,652
It should have the entire GCPD database.

348
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:08,287
You stole data from the police?

349
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,390
No. No. The Flash did it.

350
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,867
- It's not funny.
- I'm not laughing.

351
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,235
Did you lose the coin flip
on who has to come talk to me?

352
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,972
We didn't flip coins. We drew straws.

353
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:30,309
I'm kidding. Actually, I
wanted to come talk to you

354
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:33,079
because I think I've got a
little bit more experience

355
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,220
with alternate realities than you do.

356
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,103
So what words of wisdom
do you have for me?

357
00:16:37,106 --> 00:16:40,652
That Iris probably has a little
bit more experience, as well,

358
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,955
and maybe that's why she would have seen

359
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:44,824
something that you didn't.

360
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:47,159
As for Oliver keeping you in the dark,

361
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:51,197
when he and Barry tried to tell
us what was going on with them,

362
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,701
we knocked them unconscious
and locked them in the pipeline.

363
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:58,504
- Seriously?
- Wasn't our finest moment.

364
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:01,811
Look. I'm sure that that's the reason

365
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:05,845
that Oliver didn't want to
take any chances with you.

366
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,047
I appreciate you saying that...

367
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,115
But it's just another excuse
in a long list of excuses

368
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:14,453
for Oliver's behavior.

369
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,322
Oliver does love you, Felicity.

370
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:21,293
Yeah? Well, what's love
without respect or trust?

371
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,095
I don't know,

372
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:25,831
but as long as there is love,

373
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,134
you can't give up on it.

374
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,902
That's the one thing I do know

375
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:32,204
after everything I've been through,

376
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:34,106
everything I've suffered.

377
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:38,687
Thank you.

378
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,115
Well, one good thing
about what's going on

379
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:45,751
is that I have something to distract me.

380
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,286
Look at this.

381
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,259
- That looks like...
- A quantum flux anchor.

382
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:50,728
I'm pretty sure if we build it,

383
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,925
whoever's trying to
breach through will come.

384
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:55,728
Let's get to work.

385
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,751
You really know your
way with a computer.

386
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:02,154
Well, when I was first starting
out, I had to hold my own

387
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:05,158
before Felicity showed up.

388
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,384
Got him. John Deegan.

389
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:10,662
Oh. Illegal experimentation, torture.

390
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,373
Hmm. Seems like he was
conducting experiments

391
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,047
on his own patients' brains.

392
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,815
Sounds like a real charmer.

393
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,417
Well, he was acquitted. All the charges

394
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,919
were dropped on technicalities.

395
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,454
So where can we find him now?

396
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:23,720
- No known address.
- What about employment?

397
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,413
Well, he was fired, suspended

398
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,916
by the medical board for two years,

399
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,053
but that was... 5 years ago.

400
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:32,431
- So no idea where to find him.
- No.

401
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,099
Except somewhere in Gotham.

402
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,501
Needle in haystack.

403
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,829
- All right.
- Where you going?

404
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,517
I'm gonna put on my work clothes

405
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,079
and do an X-ray flyby of the city.

406
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:43,508
I don't think miss Kate
would be too thrilled

407
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,444
with us running around her city.

408
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,913
Well, unless she has some
kryptonite stashed somewhere,

409
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:49,715
I'm really not worried.

410
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:02,060
Heh. You lost?

411
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:08,167
No. No. Um, just needed
to clear my head for a sec.

412
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:09,835
Actually, you know what?

413
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:11,046
I'm sorry

414
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,739
about the third degree earlier.

415
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,640
I guess the name Bruce Wayne carries

416
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:19,382
a certain notoriety.

417
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,444
Oh, I know. Bruce Wayne's my cousin.

418
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,481
Your cousin?

419
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,751
That makes a lot of sense.

420
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,577
Actually, I'm in the process

421
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,615
of turning this building into
a real estate development firm,

422
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:37,195
so this is me hijacking his office.

423
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,640
My cousin's actually friends with Bruce.

424
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:42,538
Um, well, frenemies.

425
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,041
- Hmm.
- Heh.

426
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:49,408
Do you ever wonder if trying to keep

427
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,515
his private life from the public eye

428
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:56,487
just got to be too much
for him and he broke?

429
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,052
Heh. Sitting at that desk,

430
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:02,733
staring out that window,

431
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,137
watching this city that we grew up in

432
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,875
rot at its core,

433
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:11,311
you find a way to not break.

434
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,734
Bruce didn't leave
Gotham without a fight.

435
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,771
Hmm.

436
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:23,175
You know, I got to say, all the
corporate billionaires I know

437
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:27,613
wear Versace and have 500 fewer tattoos.

438
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:31,750
Hmm. Those are the
ones that you can see.

439
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,753
Well, that's a mystery.

440
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:39,325
Oh. Is this the... The
old bard himself? Ha!

441
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:45,764
Hey. You... you wouldn't happen
to know a John Deegan, would you?

442
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,167
I would, actually.

443
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:50,969
He's a doctor at Arkham Asylum.

444
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:53,147
Ah. I have to go tell the boys.

445
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,741
Uh, hey. Thanks for
the help and the chat.

446
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:29,678
What the hell is this?

447
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,148
No offense, but you'd need like

448
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,209
5 Ph.D.s for the dumbed-down version.

449
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:35,201
How about the very dumbed-down version?

450
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,647
It's a quantum flux anchor
that utilizes wave theory

451
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,816
to fire nano-particulates

452
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,451
across an Einstein-Rosen bridge

453
00:21:40,453 --> 00:21:42,987
to create a secure claxon field.

454
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,790
How about the very,
very, dumbed-down version?

455
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:48,100
Felicity made a magnet
that will draw whoever's

456
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:50,895
trying to breach through to us.

457
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:53,764
You could have just said that.

458
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:56,061
All right. Field's stable.

459
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,203
All readings are in the
green. You guys are good to go.

460
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,693
I'm reading multiple quantum surges.

461
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,713
I don't think this is working!

462
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,915
This is what working looks like!

463
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:18,856
Ca... you... Hear me?

464
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,662
You've got... to... get... the book.

465
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:23,060
Jay?

466
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:25,730
Only... book... make this right.

467
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:30,768
If you get the book, you can fix this.

468
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:38,576
Am I the only one who
thought that was very cool?

469
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,595
So we're sure he works here?

470
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,666
Well, it's probably too late
for him to still be at work,

471
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,168
but if we find his office, maybe

472
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,123
we can find his home
address or something.

473
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,890
Do you think you have enough
of a grip on your powers

474
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:54,314
to do a superspeed reconnaissance?

475
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:56,459
I don't think that we
should risk it if I don't.

476
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,584
Okay. Well, then, we break in,

477
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,220
do some old-fashioned snooping.

478
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,656
- Ohh!
- Aah!

479
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:03,192
Aah!

480
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,107
- Got new intel.
- Those lightning strikes,

481
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,826
they were a Flash from another dimension

482
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,038
trying to breach to us.

483
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,907
We think it was Jay Garrick

484
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,978
or a Jay Garrick.

485
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:13,381
He said to fix the situation,

486
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:16,097
we have to "get the book."

487
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,732
John Deegan was reading a book

488
00:23:17,735 --> 00:23:19,183
in the drawing Oliver drew.

489
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,420
Okay. So we find the book in there

490
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:23,834
or we find Deegan, and we
make him tell us where it is.

491
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:27,076
Wait, wait. Hold on. Another
Flash from a parallel universe

492
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,468
just lightnings in, tells us
to jump, and we ask, "how high?"

493
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,389
If we want to sort this
thing out, then yes.

494
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:34,265
I have no idea how we're gonna
break into a mental asylum.

495
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,133
I have some ideas.

496
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,459
Uh, how can I help you?

497
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:48,552
New patient transfer from
Gotham Central Hospital.

498
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:51,756
Dr. Danvers said Arkham was
the more appropriate place

499
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,678
to treat her... Condition.

500
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,014
What's the diagnosis?

501
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,988
Persistent subthermal homeostasis

502
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,092
with, uh, involuntary
gelid substantiation.

503
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,628
She gets cold and freezes stuff.

504
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:11,035
Yeah. We got a few of
those in here like that.

505
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:13,437
- Fill this out.
- Okay.

506
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,759
We'll take it from here.

507
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:15,916
Officer Allen, it really is very...

508
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:17,431
This is a GCPD-A.R.G.U.S. operation.

509
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,876
We don't need your help.

510
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,155
Whew.

511
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,946
Barry... I mean, Oliver, look.

512
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,216
John Deegan.

513
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:07,423
Oliver Queen! Ha ha! Whew.

514
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:10,334
It's a genuine pleasure
to meet you, sir.

515
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:11,821
He knows who you really are.

516
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,357
Gentlemen, I was thinking,

517
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,834
"Why did I not become the Flash?"

518
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:20,471
And it seems changing reality itself,

519
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:22,973
it's got a bit of a learning curve,

520
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:25,776
so, yeah.

521
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:27,857
This actually explains a lot.

522
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,214
You did this to us?

523
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,682
You can undo it.

524
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:34,529
That is true, but I
think the question is,

525
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:38,650
um... Why would I want to?

526
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:49,941
What the hell did he just do?

527
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,644
He bought himself some time.

528
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:02,397
What's happening?

529
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,133
Trouble.

530
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:10,672
The crazy bastard let all the other
crazy bastards out of their cages.

531
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:12,076
All right. Get the
patients back in their rooms

532
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:13,559
and find that book.

533
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:35,264
Finally, the inmates
are running the asylum.

534
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,999
Not for long!

535
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:50,245
Fries, fries, fries, fries.

536
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,247
Come on. Where is it?

537
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,582
Are you okay?

538
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:56,485
My cryostasis shut
off when the locks did.

539
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,421
I... I need to be cold.

540
00:27:01,158 --> 00:27:05,527
196 below zero. 196, he said.

541
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,926
How does this thing work?

542
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,463
Okay. Maybe you should
just take a step back.

543
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:10,032
Just get away from me!

544
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:15,317
Ohh. You cold bitch.

545
00:27:47,438 --> 00:27:48,670
Unh!

546
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:50,005
Aah!

547
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:51,677
Agh!

548
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,412
No sign of Deegan or the book.

549
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,771
What the hell are you supposed to be?

550
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:32,934
Nicely done. Floor it.

551
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:39,821
Aah!

552
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:04,146
Who's this badass?

553
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:06,615
Agh.

554
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:10,337
That's... Not Batman.

555
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,622
Kate Kane told you to get out of Gotham.

556
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:16,473
You should have listened to her.

557
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:21,082
Guys, I've been all over this place,

558
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:22,718
and I can't find anything.

559
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:40,015
Guys, I could use a little backup.

560
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,283
On it.

561
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:42,754
On it.

562
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,375
There you are.

563
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,082
Took the words right out of my mouth.

564
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:24,832
Slippery.

565
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:26,294
Listen to me.

566
00:30:31,068 --> 00:30:32,434
Caitlin.

567
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:39,074
Wait. No, Oliver.

568
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,909
Hey. Remember what
happened in Central...

569
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,056
Oliver!

570
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,168
Oliver!

571
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:51,018
Oliver's not here.

572
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,888
In fact...

573
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,257
No one's coming to save you.

574
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,819
No one's coming to save you.

575
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,965
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

576
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,601
You left me to die on Lian Yu.

577
00:31:12,603 --> 00:31:16,204
Unfortunately for you...
Heh heh... I didn't.

578
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:27,482
Does anybody copy?

579
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:39,435
Because... I think
we have a new problem.

580
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,353
Come on. You can do better than that.

581
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,887
You're a killer, a depraved monster

582
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,597
who found a way to channel his darkness

583
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,068
and pat himself on the back for it!

584
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,328
You'll never beat me.
Too slow, big heart.

585
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,298
Mama raised you right, so right,

586
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,533
you couldn't stop me from killing her.

587
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,771
Your father took the coward's way out,

588
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,440
and all these years, you
told yourself it was brave,

589
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,261
but he was a coward just like you.

590
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,558
A failure.

591
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:30,644
Selfish.

592
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:32,580
Slow.

593
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,783
Pathetic.

594
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,252
Pathetic.

595
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,112
Who the hell are you?

596
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:54,495
No. Seriously, who are you?

597
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:57,474
Your friends were exposed
to a powerful hallucinogen.

598
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,060
Are you guys all right?

599
00:32:59,063 --> 00:33:00,863
Define all right.

600
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,981
So how does a book make
people change bodies?

601
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,412
Deegan said he was using
the book to change reality.

602
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,916
Same question. How does
a book change reality?

603
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,617
We'll figure that out when
we get back to Star City.

604
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,784
Guys, we're gonna need
some help with this lock.

605
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,909
Good. Then you'll be leaving Gotham.

606
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,094
You guys have caused enough
problems for one night.

607
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,803
Hey. Would hitching a ride in the
Batmobile be out of the question?

608
00:33:21,806 --> 00:33:23,912
Get... Out.

609
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:25,314
Sure.

610
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,484
- She really is like Batman.
- Yep.

611
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:37,112
I don't do tearful good-byes.

612
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:40,348
No. I... i just wanted to wish you luck.

613
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,284
Wherever your cousin is,

614
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:46,921
I'm sure he's really proud of you.

615
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:49,324
X-ray vision.

616
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:52,127
You really do have a lot of tattoos.

617
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:55,864
Somehow, I feel like Kara
Danvers doesn't have a single one.

618
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,235
You know, it's such a shame I have to go

619
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:02,561
because I feel like we
would make a good team.

620
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:04,431
World's finest.

621
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:09,477
Heh heh.

622
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,160
Oh. Look who finally came back.

623
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,996
With what looks like
a fairly infamous book.

624
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,246
A book with a cryptographic lock on it.

625
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:21,559
Can you get to work
on opening it, please?

626
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,559
We don't have a lot of time.

627
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,417
Okay. Geek squad, form up on me!

628
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,240
Not much of a heartfelt reunion.

629
00:34:27,242 --> 00:34:28,842
She's getting used to everything.

630
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:31,511
Do you want me to talk
to her as, you know, you?

631
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:34,181
I think I'm in enough trouble
with Felicity as it is,

632
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,949
but no offense.

633
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,684
Hey. Can I talk to
you for a minute, then?

634
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:39,300
- Yeah. What's up?
- I just wanted to see

635
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:40,886
how you're doing.

636
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,789
I'm compartmentalizing.

637
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,438
I'll fix things with Felicity later.

638
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:46,726
I don't mean with Felicity.

639
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:49,729
We both saw some stuff back at Arkham.

640
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,032
I saw Evil Flash.

641
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:53,266
Eobard Thawne.

642
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,824
I saw Malcolm Merlyn.

643
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,134
- Oh.
- I knew you'd been

644
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,637
through a lot, but...

645
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,308
I don't know, man. I never realized.

646
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:00,777
I don't know how you do it.

647
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,035
I wouldn't be able to live

648
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:03,838
with the burdens that you carry.

649
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,207
Yes, you would.

650
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,379
Barry, I always thought
that you had it easy,

651
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:10,586
everything was just
sunshine and rainbows

652
00:35:10,596 --> 00:35:14,261
and... Everybody likes you.

653
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,459
You have real steel in you, my friend.

654
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:22,262
You can carry any
burden thrown your way.

655
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,894
Some unsolicited advice?

656
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,496
Hmm.

657
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:31,303
Don't wait to work
things out with Felicity.

658
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:34,107
Our line of work, you never
know how much time you got.

659
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:40,380
Not only is the lock cryptographic...

660
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:42,382
It's metaphysical. The readings
I'm getting off this thing

661
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:44,451
are nuts... and, yes,
that's a technical term.

662
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:47,120
Um, may I speak with
Felicity for a minute?

663
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:50,223
Sure thing, Barry... Oliver... Boliver.

664
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:52,589
Stop helping.

665
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,433
This must be strange for you.

666
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:56,230
Oh. What gave you that idea?

667
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:59,030
I don't know. Maybe it's
easier for you to hear this

668
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:02,227
coming from... Barry Allen.

669
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,137
- What a stupid...
- Hear what?

670
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:08,875
That we're gonna be okay.

671
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,811
People change, Felicity.

672
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,347
It means we're growing.

673
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:16,331
It means we're evolving,

674
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,533
except for one thing,

675
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,670
one thing that will not change...

676
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:24,925
Is how I feel about you.

677
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,762
Love is too small a word...

678
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:34,466
And no matter who you are

679
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,363
or... or what you become,

680
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:38,370
no matter who I am

681
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,974
or... or what I become...

682
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,611
You will always be...

683
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,788
You will always be the love of my life.

684
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,117
People change.

685
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,220
That never will.

686
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,994
Oliver, I...

687
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:10,996
Jay?

688
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:14,673
- No.
- Oh, my god. Dad?

689
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:18,044
My name is Barry Allen.

690
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,410
Hello, John.

691
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:20,679
Do... do I know you?

692
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:22,682
You're not wearing your ring.

693
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:24,589
Things must be different here.

694
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,363
Barry, where's there?

695
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,655
My earth, Earth 90.

696
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:32,058
I've traveled from there to warn you.

697
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,485
- Warn us about what?
- His name is Mar Novu,

698
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,297
but he calls himself the monitor now.

699
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,938
He's been unleashing the Book of Destiny

700
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:44,105
across the multiverse
to test different earths.

701
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,472
Test them for what?

702
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,542
A crisis that he believes is coming.

703
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:52,879
Novu thinks the elseworlds created

704
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:55,277
by the Book of Destiny approximates

705
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,518
the collision of realities
that we're facing.

706
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,042
Guys...

707
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:03,878
We got a situation.

708
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,058
Cisco.

709
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:10,230
That... that's him from the vibe.

710
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:17,537
Mar Novu,

711
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,205
you're gonna stand down.

712
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:22,300
You're gonna use that book
to help us set reality right.

713
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:24,010
Well, I certainly
wouldn't have placed it

714
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,949
in Deegan's hands if
that were my intent.

715
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:27,485
Enough.

716
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,382
You will not do to this earth

717
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:30,884
what you did to mine.

718
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:33,286
I admire your persistence, Barry.

719
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:41,026
He said you were testing us.

720
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,595
Indeed, and thus far,

721
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,130
I am unimpressed.

722
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:45,394
A crisis is imminent.

723
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,886
Someone is coming,

724
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:50,024
someone far, far more
powerful than myself.

725
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,766
I mean to prepare.

726
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,007
By giving a nut bar an all-powerful

727
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,577
reality-rewriting book?

728
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,478
I am testing universes
to find one, I hope,

729
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:01,047
strong enough to stand against him.

730
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,615
You're causing chaos,

731
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:04,150
and you're blaming everyone else!

732
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:06,052
In the hope of finding the champions

733
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,088
that would save the multiverse entire.

734
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,024
You are the first of those
I've placed under fire

735
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:14,427
who have managed to retrieve
the Book of Destiny...

736
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,600
For all the good it did you.

737
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:22,102
Enough of this. Kara?

738
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:24,270
Yeah. I'd love to.

739
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:28,875
You show potential.

740
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:30,511
Let us see if it's anything more.

741
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:32,381
What is he talking about, Barry?

742
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:40,336
I offered you godhood,

743
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,389
and you squandered it on a petty dream.

744
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,325
Do better.

745
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,360
Think bigger.

746
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:57,537
Ohh.

747
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:14,521
What the hell?

748
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:16,902
Where'd he go? What the hell?

749
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:19,297
He went to give Deegan the book... back.

750
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,927
How do you know?

751
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,472
He did it again. He rewrote reality.

752
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:26,902
How far do you think

753
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,722
the changes go this time?

754
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,035
- Freeze!
- On the ground!

755
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:37,637
Now!

756
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:41,714
Uh... Speed us out of here.

757
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:45,121
I can't. Can you?

758
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:47,986
Nope.

759
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,556
Oliver Queen.

760
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,863
I've been waiting to do this

761
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:57,093
for a long time.

762
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,866
Unh!

763
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:02,902
Aah!

764
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,376
Should I follow you? What...

765
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:11,811
Hey!

766
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:32,339
There's no place you can
run where I can't find you.

767
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:34,209
It's over.

768
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:41,290
