1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,421
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:04,016
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,130
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,078
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:08,523
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:10,070
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:12,115
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:13,350
like me.

9
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,094
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:16,863
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:18,898
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,334
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:23,803
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,439
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,801
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,476
The court orders that Mr. Allen

17
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:33,579
should be remanded to
Iron Heights Penitentiary.

18
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,692
- Get comfortable.
- I didn't kill anybody.

19
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:37,224
Yeah, sure. Everyone's innocent in here,

20
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,152
especially that guy: Big Sir.

21
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:41,087
12 markers, 12 metas.

22
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,454
Now that we know how many there are,

23
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:43,378
we can go right to them.

24
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,624
- I don't want any trouble.
- Too late.

25
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,184
Thanks. I was just
wondering why you helped me.

26
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:53,054
'Cause your dad helped me.

27
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:54,981
He operated and saved my life.

28
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,940
Cecile, are you sure we need a crib?

29
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:03,363
I used to plop Iris on some cushions

30
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:04,520
and call it a night.

31
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,312
Well, I'm glad to hear you
got all your parenting mistakes

32
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,708
out of the way with your first kid.

33
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,970
I think she's turned out pretty good.

34
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:11,417
Oh, babe.

35
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,920
I cannot believe I am so big already.

36
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:16,322
You know, I was barely showing
at this point with Joanie.

37
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,524
All right, best I
got. What do you think?

38
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:21,235
Mmhmm.

39
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:23,238
- Are they?
- Are they what?

40
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,046
- Too tight.
- Um...

41
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,499
Hey, you just said that you thought

42
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,546
my clothes were too tight,

43
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,717
- Do I look bad?
- What? I didn't say that.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,074
What do you mean when is
it gonna go back to normal?

45
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:37,743
I didn't say that either.

46
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:42,982
Look at me.

47
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:45,410
- My lips weren't moving.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:46,853
I heard you. I...

49
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,959
I can still hear you.

50
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,628
What the hell is going on?

51
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,397
Why can I hear what you're thinking?

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, my God, Joe...

53
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:03,129
I think I can read minds.

54

55
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,277
Heartrate's 170 BPM,

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,695
and there's no sign of dark
matter in the amniotic fluid.

57
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,582
So the baby's not a meta?

58
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,483
Nope, it's a perfectly normal baby...

59
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:20,486
Girl.

60
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,804
You were gonna say baby girl.

61
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,691
- I'm having another daughter?
- I'm gonna have a sister?

62
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:28,262
Well, I guess we can cancel
the announcement party.

63
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:30,096
Ha-ha-ha!

64
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:32,832
Boy, girl, that's 50-50.

65
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,201
Let's test your skills for real.

66
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,404
What number am I thinking of?

67
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,540
Three. 11.

68
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,957
25. Three again.

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,677
Bulbasaur.

70
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,180
- What the hell is a Bulbasaur?
- That's so weird.

71
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:49,496
Why would I be thinking about
Pokémon at a time like this?

72
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,250
Yep, definitely a telepath.

73
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:52,452
But how?

74
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,953
If the baby is not a meta,

75
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,655
then where did these powers come from?

76
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,710
Nope, I wasn't on the bus.

77
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:59,625
No, I was not abducted by aliens.

78
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,296
No, I didn't inherit a
mystic totem from my grandma.

79
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,668
Really, guys? Why are you
still thinking about Bulbasaurs?

80
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,233
He's the cutest one of all!

81
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:10,436
Okay, my best hypothesis is
this is actually triggered by

82
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:11,671
your latest phase of pregnancies,

83
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,535
and it's actually latent dark matter

84
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:14,907
that's been in your brain since...

85
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,310
maybe the first particle
accelerator explosion.

86
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:19,020
Think of it like gestational diabetes.

87
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,090
But it's not. You can
fix that with insulin.

88
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,481
Right, but it's temporary.

89
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:25,318
I mean, the symptoms should
recede after childbirth.

90
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,804
Okay, we'll give you guys a minute.

91
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,590
Joe, you are literally thinking,

92
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:37,597
"I'm worried about Cecile."

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,799
I just want you and the baby to be okay.

94
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,500
I know.

95
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:44,470
But hey, maybe... maybe this
will turn out to be a good thing.

96
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,873
I've always wondered what
goes on in that head of yours.

97
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,585
Cecile's a telepath?

98
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,010
Well, that's way more important

99
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,145
than getting Allen out of prison!

100
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,981
- Not!
- Sick burn, Hare.

101
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,315
Please don't encourage him.

102
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,484
As a former prisoner, I can tell you...

103
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,460
No, that was gorilla prison.

104
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,863
Gorilla prison is worse.
They throw their scat at you.

105
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,949
I can tell you that Allen
is sitting in his cell,

106
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,613
suffering, while this guy,

107
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,793
DeVoe, continues his plan unabated.

108
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:11,993
Harry, Cecile filed an appeal last week.

109
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,996
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

110
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,334
We have satellites on the DeVoes.

111
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,369
And they haven't made a move in weeks,

112
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:17,405
so that doesn't matter!

113
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,305
Well, Barry's in gen pop, so worst case,

114
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:21,107
he can always phase out,
or I can breach him out.

115
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,052
And then he'd be a fugitive.
And by the way, Ramon,

116
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,653
why do we not have eyes on him in there?

117
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,312
Hey, it's a pain trying to get into

118
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:28,881
an analog camera from here,
no matter how hard I hack.

119
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:32,018
Hack... harder.

120
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,486
We're nowhere.

121
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,921
This team is nowhere,
and this is the team

122
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,988
that got Barry out of a
pantemporal speed prison,

123
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,246
and we can't spring
him from a county jail?

124
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,762
Harry, we are working
just as hard as you, okay?

125
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,496
And yes, it kills me to admit it,

126
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,198
but we are at a roadblock,

127
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,046
so Barry is just gonna have to...

128
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,004
Hold on.

129
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,308
I mean, I can't even imagine
what he's going through.

130
00:04:58,212 --> 00:04:59,912
Read 'em and weep, boys.

131
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:01,580
That's it.

132
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:03,160
I'm dealing next round.

133
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:08,030
You know, there's something
fishy about you, Allen.

134
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,163
I'm fishy? You tried
to murder me in jail.

135
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,432
Well, if you can't play cards

136
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:12,805
with somebody who tried to murder you,

137
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,368
you'll never play cards in here.

138
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:16,538
I knew I'd regret
inviting you to this game.

139
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,426
You may be big, but
you got no poker face.

140
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,082
Deuces again?

141
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,053
Okay, I'm out.

142
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,823
- Hey, you can't take that.
- It's my last pudding.

143
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,184
Then you shouldn't have
thrown it in the pot, dumbass.

144
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,577
Dumbass?

145
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,797
Politician who gets
caught with his pants down.

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,001
Yeah. I'd say you're a dumbass.

147
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,403
Well, maybe I'll just
take the whole pot then.

148
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,715
- Guys, come on.
- Don't screw with me, Bellows.

149
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,410
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?

150
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,465
That's right. You
only shoot unarmed men.

151
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,768
What the hell are you looking at?

152
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,003
Is that really why you're in here?

153
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,471
You shot an unarmed man?

154
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:58,707
Yeah, I'm just another bad guy.

155
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,076
Now get the hell out.

156
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,278
If my dad really risked
his life to save yours,

157
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
then...

158
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,483
I doubt you're just another bad guy.

159
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:09,985
Hey...

160
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,087
why don't you just tell
me what really happened?

161
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,307
"Suspect was arrested last night

162
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,009
after a botched robbery.

163
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,444
While attempting to steal

164
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,912
from a Mercury Labs shipping crate,

165
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,668
David P. Ratchet, alias Big Sir,

166
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,050
allegedly shot and
killed a security guard.

167
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,319
An eyewitness called in the shooting."

168
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,088
You have the right to remain silent.

169
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,357
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

170
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,727
"Ratchet was previously
arrested for fighting..."

171
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,428
The only forensic evidence

172
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,921
were bullet casings from the scene

173
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:56,565
that matched the cartridge
of a gun you owned.

174
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,600
Okay, time to go.

175
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:01,770
Hey, firearm identification
like that can have errors.

176
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,271
It's practically junk science.

177
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,541
I said, time to go.

178
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,363
You didn't kill that guy, did you?

179
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,783
There was another guy.

180
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,496
My size, my frame.

181
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,955
I heard the shots.

182
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,357
I tried to save the guard.

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,661
Wrong place, wrong time.

184
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:28,862
Why didn't you just tell me that?

185
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:30,559
'Cause it doesn't matter, Allen!

186
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:32,034
It didn't matter to the cops,

187
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,436
not to my lawyer, or the jury.

188
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,171
They took one look at me,

189
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,407
and decided I was the guy.

190
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,155
That guy could still be out there.

191
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,611
If I was that guy,

192
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:45,781
I would've ditched this
crap town a long time ago.

193
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:51,987
Central City loves her heroes.

194
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,122
And I should know. I'm your new mayor.

195
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,857
But we all agree, doing
business in the city

196
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:58,827
with meta-humans can be a little risky.

197
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,027
Technology companies in Central City

198
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,566
are robbed at nearly 30
times the national average.

199
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,835
That's second only to Star City, folks.

200
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,316
Which is why I'm proud to unveil

201
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:13,909
Kord Industries' newest
advanced research facility,

202
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:17,512
designed to be the most
secure building of its kind,

203
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:20,415
complete with super-speed
motion detectors,

204
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,765
sonic vibration defenses,

205
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,419
and laser beams that don't freeze.

206
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,254
Believe me, no one is breaking into

207
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:29,424
this building anytime soon.

208
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,835
I hate this city.

209
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,872
Cecile, hey, babe.
What are you doing here?

210
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,240
Uh, I needed a helper, and,
well, she wanted to help.

211
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,711
Yeah. Cisco said you were working a case

212
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,313
about an R&D lab that vanished.

213
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,548
I figured maybe I could
help dig up some clues,

214
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,216
now that I'm a meta.

215
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,785
Babe, you're not a meta.

216
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:23,655
I can hear every one of these people.

217
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,924
Dark matter definitely
left its mark here.

218
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,559
I figured as much.

219
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,795
That patrolman, right there,

220
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,264
he is cheating on his wife.

221
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,724
Uh, never trust a
moustache, I always say.

222
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:35,930
I have a moustache.

223
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:39,571
No, you have a sexy goatee.
He has a creeper moustache.

224
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,990
Red tie... Oh, baby.

225
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:45,162
Red tie does not like
his boss very much.

226
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,365
She's been doing this
all the way over here.

227
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:49,281
- Hm.
- And that lady right there.

228
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,117
Joe? Joe, she is a thief.

229
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,885
Thief!

230
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,520
Staplers, she's been stealing them

231
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,574
out of her office for months now.

232
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:58,066
She damn near cleaned
out the supply closet.

233
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:58,774
- Baby?
- Huh?

234
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:00,110
I love you, and I think it's great

235
00:11:00,112 --> 00:11:02,149
that you have these new powers, but I...

236
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,595
Oh. You want me to go.

237
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,331
Uh, I... I don't...
I don't want you to go.

238
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,833
No-no-no, hey, it's just
'cause you wanna do your job.

239
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,835
I totally get it. Go. Stop crime.

240
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,740
- Love you.
- Love you.

241
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:18,276
I can hear everyone. It's so fun!

242
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,693
Hey. The closest security cam I can find

243
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,584
is from an ATM across the street.

244
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:28,887
The footage is choppy, but...

245
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,420
- Look at that.
- Did he just...

246
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,425
Pull a Chevelle out of nowhere.

247
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,659
I'm gonna run those plates,

248
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,894
see if I can get an ID on the dude.

249
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,796
Copy that.

250
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,132
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

251
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:42,334
Hey, Barry.

252
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,388
So, Barry asked you to ask us
to get this guy out of prison?

253
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,552
Barry had gotten close to this guy,

254
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:48,920
who says he's innocent.

255
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,809
It was a case of mistaken identity.

256
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,662
Well, from what I could
find out on CCPN's archives,

257
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:56,170
Big Sir's case does sound a bit suspect.

258
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,291
15 years ago, he was found
guilty of shooting a guard,

259
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,661
but there was no apparent motive.

260
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,463
- Only one eyewitness?
- Mm.

261
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,699
Studies have shown
that lineup composition,

262
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:06,976
verbal, and non-verbal cues,

263
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:09,635
can all lead to unintended
false identifications.

264
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,738
Look, this is all just fantastic,

265
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,884
but we're not really gonna do this.

266
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,175
Yeah, I mean, um, we've
already got a lot on our plate

267
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,844
just trying to free one innocent man.

268
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:19,002
We all want Barry to be free,

269
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,821
but I don't know that there's
much else we can do right now.

270
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,992
We kinda hit a wall.

271
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,078
Well, we're not gonna
get through that wall

272
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,454
- while we're working on this.
- It's just one case.

273
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:29,054
Yean, and it's a case
that we have to take.

274
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,042
Allen has made one request of us

275
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:32,044
since he's been incarcerated,

276
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,430
and the request doesn't
even involve himself.

277
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,895
We have to take this case.

278
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:37,464
It's unsettling how convincing

279
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,832
you can be sometimes.

280
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,766
I got a plate match on the Chevelle.

281
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,136
It's registered to a perp

282
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,844
who has multiple breaking
and entering priors:

283
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,814
Sylbert Rundine.

284
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,641
Why does every villain
in this city have a name

285
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,311
that sounds like it
came out of a comic book?

286
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,947
He must go by something for short.

287
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,860
Syl. Sylbie. Bertie.

288
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,518
What do we wanna do about this case?

289
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,157
Well, my dad, Cisco, and Ralph

290
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,989
are gonna question Rundine,
and I'm gonna call Cecile

291
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,592
and see if she can pull up
the case file on Big Sir.

292
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,394
You won't even have to say it.

293
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,396
Bertie? Were you for real with that?

294
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:11,865
Yeah, bet you five bucks it's Bertie.

295
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,301
You're on.

296
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:18,886
Hey.

297
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,634
Allen, you're stirring up my dust.

298
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,037
Oh. Sorry.

299
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,602
Um, I've got some news.

300
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,102
So, I have some friends

301
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,313
that I thought could
help with your case,

302
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:30,083
and... they've agreed to do it.

303
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,718
CCPD cop friends?

304
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,820
Not exactly,

305
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,855
but, um, if there's anybody

306
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,891
that can prove you
innocent, it's these guys.

307
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:40,527
'Cause they did a bang-up
job of clearing you.

308
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,990
That's not really...
I mean, my... my case...

309
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:44,197
Look...

310
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,232
just call them and tell them to stop.

311
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,434
Uh, look, I don't understand

312
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,537
why you're not excited about this.

313
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,540
What you're peddling, it's dangerous.

314
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,108
Wh... what's dangerous?

315
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,410
Hope.

316
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:00,480
I've been in here long enough
to understand that in prison,

317
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:04,360
hope is the most dangerous thing.

318
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,563
Wait, did you get that from "Shawshank"?

319
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:08,299
No.

320
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,457
I got that from being in prison.

321
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:12,325
Tell your friends...

322
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,294
to stop wasting their time.

323
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,352
Sylbert Rundine!

324
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,466
This is CCPD!

325
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,412
Are you Sylbert Rundine?

326
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,881
Bert... Rundine.

327
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:37,183
The E's silent.

328
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,685
So close.

329
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,787
I'm Detective Joe West.
These are my associates.

330
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,555
We're looking into a
robbery that took place.

331
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,457
Wanted to ask you some questions.

332
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,293
- Okay?
- Do you own a 1970s Chevelle?

333
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,130
- Well, I used to.
- Oh, my glob.

334
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:54,067
Is that a replica of DARPA's HTV-3X?

335
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,661
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

336
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,760
Don't you know not to mess
with another man's toys?

337
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,278
You mean figurines.

338
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:01,947
Yes.

339
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,616
Yes, he does.

340
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,211
Wow.

341
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:07,447
This is a perfect replica.

342
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,583
It even has a tiny automatic
navigation control system!

343
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:13,386
This is the reason I don't
have any money in my savings.

344
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,687
Oh, I get it.

345
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,456
Is this you?

346
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,825
Yeah, hard to believe.

347
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:21,427
15 years ago, I was a bit of a gym rat.

348
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,919
Hey, Joe, pretty nice figurine.

349
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:28,568
Well, gentlemen, I was
just about to head out,

350
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,638
so if you guys are good here...

351
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,139
15 years ago,

352
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,208
did you spend any time
around Mercury Labs?

353
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,114
Cisco! Get us to the alley.

354
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,028
Damn. He wasn't that quick, was he?

355
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,998
You guys check down there,
I'll check the streets.

356
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,473
Okay.

357
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,143
Guys, he's here!

358
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,646
Hey! Hold it right there!

359
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,550
Oh, that feels weird.

360
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,754
Joe, he's getting away!

361
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,523
Seems we've got bigger problems.

362
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,884
- This is...
- Ridiculous.

363
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:38,095
You okay, guys?

364
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,470
Are we doing okay?

365
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,583
Are we doing okay?

366
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:41,820
Does it look like we're doing okay?

367
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,548
We're two inches tall, Caitlin!

368
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,759
Yeah, I'm, like, Cisco's size now.

369
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:47,196
Is this how you always see the world?

370
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,342
Oh, that's really funny, man.

371
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,084
I guess your body just
finally shrunk down

372
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,346
to a size that's
proportional to your brain!

373
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:56,749
Ralph, have you tried just
stretching back to normal size?

374
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,317
Uh...

375
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,289
Ah! Oh! My back! Jeez Louise!

376
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,658
Okay, you know what, maybe
I can breach us out of here.

377
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,769
Really thought, uh...

378
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,738
I was gonna go farther than that.

379
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,790
How many fingers am I holding up?

380
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,126
Four fingers.

381
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:23,990
You're no less annoying at that size.

382
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:26,979
Hey, guys, I think I got something.

383
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:29,515
So, I wasn't able to pin
Ray Palmer or the Waverider,

384
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,751
but I was able to reach Felicity.

385
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:34,509
So, Ray uses dwarf star alloy

386
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,288
to power the shrinking capabilities

387
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,595
in the A.T.O.M. suit,

388
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,964
but on October 10th,

389
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,859
Palmer Tech's last depository of alloy

390
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:42,524
was stolen from Central City's facility.

391
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,396
October 10th,

392
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,148
that's the day Barry came
out of the Speed Force.

393
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,079
So he hits the facility,
then he hops on the bus.

394
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,768
So, dwarf star alloy plus dark matter

395
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,423
equals Rundine's shrinking powers?

396
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:55,340
N... not exactly. Nature
doesn't work to scale.

397
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:56,609
If the human body were to shrink,

398
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,619
we can't lift our skeleton.

399
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,644
So, Rundine's power
must be able to shrink

400
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,399
the space between atomic bonds.

401
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:03,448
Miniaturize tech so you can steal it,

402
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,718
and then make it big so you can sell it.

403
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,453
- Hey.
- Hey.

404
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:09,626
- Ratchet's trial records.
- Oh.

405
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,724
You really think the guy
who shrunk that building

406
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,693
is the same guy we need
to free Barry's friend?

407
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,495
Well... I mean, look.

408
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:17,963
Be easy to mistake them, right?

409
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,649
I mean, they certainly
had a resemblance.

410
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:20,918
Rundine hit up a warehouse

411
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,636
a month after they picked up Big Sir.

412
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,509
Still, that's a big coincidence.

413
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:26,355
I keep saying it:

414
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,108
There's no coincidences
when it comes to DeVoe,

415
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,610
and that includes Barry's cellmate.

416
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:31,344
Well, I can't sell that to a judge,

417
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,079
so if we wanna get Big Sir out,

418
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:36,048
we are gonna need a
confession from Dr. Shrinker.

419
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,650
Dwarfstar!

420
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:38,617
What the hell is that?

421
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,953
Oh, that's what I'm
naming him, see, Dwarfstar.

422
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,455
Oh, God.

423
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,724
Oh, it takes a long time to breach here.

424
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,727
Who spit gum on the floor?

425
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,696
I'm a gum-shoe!

426
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:51,432
Not gum on a shoe!

427
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:54,002
Oh, my God, get him off, get him off.

428
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,367
You guys are going in the hamster cage.

429
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,248
Hamster cage?

430
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:03,309
Eh, don't drop me. Don't drop me.

431
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,515
Harry...

432
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,083
this is not your fault.

433
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,153
Yeah, but it kinda i...

434
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:16,522
Don't read my mind, okay?

435
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,324
- What am I thinking now?
- Oh, God.

436
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,993
Great. Now, if you'll excuse me,

437
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,373
I'm gonna go build a reverse
polarity dwarfstar matrix.

438
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:25,539
Great name, Ray Palmer.

439
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:28,884
What, was electron-degenerate
sub-atomizer taken?

440
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:32,004
Electron-de...

441
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:36,675
Oh, you have no idea what
Harry was talking about,

442
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:40,246
or what anyone around
here is ever talking about.

443
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:42,314
I gotta call Barry.

444
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,516
Okay.

445
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,092
I can hear you, Iris,

446
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:50,222
and there is nothing
wrong with me and Joe.

447
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:53,225
Right, yes, totally.

448
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,860
It's just that if you ever,

449
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,929
you know, think there
is something wrong,

450
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,764
I... I know someone who could help.

451
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,332
That's all.

452
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:04,403
I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

453
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,539
Thank you for seeing us on short notice.

454
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,712
- Lucky us.
- Of course.

455
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,373
The reason that we're here today is,

456
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,681
I've been experiencing some
unusual pregnancy symptoms.

457
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,116
You know, the first time I was pregnant,

458
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,353
it was a really long time ago,

459
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:20,225
and things were very
different at that point...

460
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:23,222
"Eggs, bread, olive oil"...

461
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,957
I'm sorry, are you...

462
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,492
Are you making a grocery list?

463
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:28,761
Of course not.

464
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:31,130
I would not do...

465
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,766
So... tell me more about

466
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:36,202
the... the symptoms you're experiencing.

467
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:38,571
It's... it's almost as if

468
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:41,407
I have become aware

469
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,876
of Joe's thoughts.

470
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,479
- Like... like I read his diary.
- My diary?

471
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,647
Your pregnancy made
you read Joe's diary?

472
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,373
What do you mean you're taking his side?

473
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:51,673
I don't take sides.

474
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:53,586
You just think that I'm in the wrong.

475
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,920
I would never think...

476
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:56,956
- Maybe this was a bad idea.
- No-no-no, no-no-no, babe.

477
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,290
No, we're not... We're not done here.

478
00:20:58,292 --> 00:20:59,174
Therapy scares you,

479
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,052
and you don't like this woman
hearing all your business.

480
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:02,695
Cecile... I... that just...
That... that's not true.

481
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:03,555
And now you just wanna go.

482
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:04,806
You think this whole
thing is a waste of time?

483
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:05,556
Cecile, stop.

484
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,600
You're thinking about a
pink elephant over and over?

485
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,804
You're trying to block me out.

486
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,739
Can I just ask one question...

487
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,542
Really? A pink elephant?

488
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,611
Why were you hiding
your thoughts from me?

489
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:19,778
Because you're making me do it.

490
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,381
Wh...

491
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:24,583
Cecile, when we got back
together, I promised you

492
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:28,053
that I would never keep
any secrets from you again.

493
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,222
Except now, it...

494
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:31,857
It's like I have to.

495
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,079
Hey. They found him.

496
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:40,732
His name's Sylbert Rundine.

497
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:42,868
He's been arrested for a whole
bunch of crimes like yours,

498
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,738
and he used to look just like you too.

499
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,872
You're getting out of here.

500
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:49,041
Wow. You have a hard shoulder.

501
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:51,110
So, yesterday, I tell you what happened,

502
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:53,913
and today, you find the guy.

503
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,848
- It happened in a...
- Flash?

504
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,449
Snap.

505
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,251
You cops and your blinders.

506
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:01,453
Probably got the wrong guy again.

507
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,857
Well... technically, they
haven't gotten him yet.

508
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,193
You see? Something always goes wrong.

509
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,429
Why do you have to make this so hard?

510
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:13,432
It... it's okay to believe.

511
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:14,967
Yeah?

512
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,258
Why is it so easy for you to believe?

513
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,138
You know my dad was in here

514
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,440
for a crime he didn't commit, right?

515
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:23,042
Do you know what happened?

516
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:25,144
After 17 years,

517
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:28,080
the man that killed my mom confessed.

518
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:29,715
My dad got to go home.

519
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:34,653
Why shouldn't you get to go home too?

520
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:37,323
- 17 years, huh?
- Yeah.

521
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:40,297
You think they'll catch Rundine?

522
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,680
You really think it's gonna happen?

523
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:44,349
I promise.

524
00:22:44,352 --> 00:22:46,031
You're getting out.

525
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:50,641
So, in hindsight,

526
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:53,606
I can see how putting
you guys in a hamster cage

527
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:55,441
could be humiliating.

528
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:57,509
- You think?
- I'm sorry for that.

529
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,311
For the record, this is awesome,

530
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:02,448
but why do you guys have
a giant LEGO set anyway?

531
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,249
It is a three-dimensional model

532
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,751
of the place where I was predestined

533
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,019
to be brutally murdered

534
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,110
by a twisted future version of Barry.

535
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:10,437
That guy.

536
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,068
But what a difference... a year makes.

537
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:14,146
Whoa.

538
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,928
What did you do to my bazooka?

539
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,763
Well, I turned your bazooka

540
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,430
into an embiggening bazooka,

541
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,800
with the help of the dwarfstar alloy

542
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:22,688
we stole from Rundine's apartment,

543
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,738
and improving upon Ray
Palmer's amateurish schematics,

544
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,340
presto-chango, embiggening bazooka.

545
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,609
Now, if you'll just hold on...

546
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,811
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa,
we're gonna do this now?

547
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, yeah.

548
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,213
Rundine's in the wind.

549
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,805
These two are small. We
need to embiggen them,

550
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:38,341
and we need to free
an innocent man, so...

551
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:40,077
Okay, first of all,
"embiggen" is not a word,

552
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,780
and second of all,
shouldn't we test this first?

553
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:44,322
Hey!

554
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:45,791
I'll be a test subject!

555
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,593
Come on! Take me!

556
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,728
- Sure, why not?
- That's the spirit.

557
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,703
Here... here we go. And...

558
00:23:53,634 --> 00:23:54,900
- West?
- Hm?

559
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,135
You should probably, um...

560
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,504
Oh, God, yeah. Sorry.

561
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:01,073
And... three, two, one.

562
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,977
Nope. Still tiny.

563
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,556
Hey, are we supposed to be doing that?

564
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,193
- Oh, no.
- Their cells are exploding.

565
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:23,162
Whatever that embiggening
gun did to Ralph and Cisco

566
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,625
seems to have destabilized
them on an atomic level.

567
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:26,632
How long do they have?

568
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,709
At this rate, I would guess
complete cellular explosion

569
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,535
within... ten hours.

570
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,116
Oh, man, prison pudding

571
00:24:41,118 --> 00:24:43,184
is so much better than outside pudding.

572
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:45,553
Obviously.

573
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,349
Any news from your friend?

574
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,880
Um, no, not yet,

575
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:50,786
but they're probably just
busy tracking Rundine.

576
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,989
Seasoned criminal like that

577
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,527
knows how to not be found, you know?

578
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,030
Yeah, I get it, man.

579
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:58,266
Hey, um...

580
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,034
you have any plans for when you get out?

581
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:02,437
You know, I really haven't
thought about it very much.

582
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,472
Oh, come on, you've gotta have something

583
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,541
that you've dreamed of,
like opening a business

584
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:08,810
or, uh, climbing to the
top of Mount Everest,

585
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:11,079
- bungee jumping.
- This ain't the movies, Allen.

586
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:13,481
- This is real life, man...
- I...

587
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:16,618
Reality is, I ain't got nobody or nothing

588
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,153
waiting for me on the outside,

589
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:19,754
and even if I do get out,

590
00:25:19,756 --> 00:25:21,489
I'll probably end up
at the docks anyway.

591
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:23,291
Okay, look, I spent most of my life

592
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:25,460
in love with a girl who
was way out of my league.

593
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,362
Now she's my wife.

594
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:31,032
Sometimes, things do end
up like in the movies.

595
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:33,802
Jiaju.

596
00:25:33,804 --> 00:25:36,371
- Come again?
- Jiaju.

597
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,039
Tiny village in China.

598
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,175
Beautiful place. Very secluded.

599
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:42,911
Monks all take a vow of silence.

600
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,846
Inmate Allen...

601
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:46,448
a word?

602
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,249
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,689
I see you've made a new friend.

604
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:56,724
Yeah. I guess I have.

605
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:57,982
I find that interesting,

606
00:25:57,985 --> 00:26:00,076
especially since I was
just asked to turn over

607
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,474
Inmate Ratchet's case file

608
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,904
to the D.A. who represented
you for your trial.

609
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:05,600
Coincidence?

610
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:09,137
Not everyone that's in
here deserves to be in here.

611
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:12,307
You ever heard of the name Aaron Miller?

612
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,976
- No.
- Miller was a prisoner here

613
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:17,512
who took to studying at the law library.

614
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:19,814
One day, Mr. Miller decided to take on

615
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:22,517
the appeal of a fellow inmate's case.

616
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,123
When he was invariably unsuccessful,

617
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,026
that fellow inmate...

618
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:30,425
stabbed Mr. Miller to death.

619
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:36,397
Your friend may look like a man,

620
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,601
but he is unquestionably a monster.

621
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,474
Everyone here is a monster.

622
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,803
And if you insist on
continuing to bait them,

623
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:45,806
I guarantee you,

624
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,509
you will get mauled.

625
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:52,447
All right, coming in hot.

626
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:54,516
Oh, hey, you didn't have to do all that.

627
00:26:54,518 --> 00:26:57,127
Listen, I did not inherit my
dad's skills in the kitchen,

628
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,921
but a decaf herbal tea, that I can do.

629
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:02,123
So, if it's okay with you,

630
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,860
I just was wondering if I
could talk to you about Joe.

631
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:08,930
Um, yeah. Of course it's okay.

632
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:11,099
Oh, no, honey, it's...
it's not about that.

633
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,268
We have zero problems
in that department,

634
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,403
as you can tell.

635
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:17,205
Okay.

636
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,640
TMI, but okay.

637
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:21,142
I really thought being
able to read his mind

638
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:23,978
would make our relationship
stronger, not push us apart.

639
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,214
Well, how does my dad feel

640
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:27,882
about your new powers?

641
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:30,251
He thinks it's gonna take
a little getting used to.

642
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:32,576
Yeah, but how does he feel?

643
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,312
Look, we all know that my dad thinks

644
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,447
that he's this cool,
grounded man of mystery,

645
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,060
but we all know that
he's actually just...

646
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:41,663
- A big softie.
- A big softie.

647
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:44,032
But if you really want
to get closer to my dad,

648
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:47,569
you need to stop focusing
on what he's thinking

649
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:49,337
and find out what he's feeling.

650
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,108
Maybe we could use a
biochemical treatment

651
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,445
and target the pituitary glands?

652
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:56,509
Flood them with human growth hormones?

653
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,611
No, that will just accelerate their d...

654
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:00,648
It'll make things worse.

655
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,417
- Guys?
- What?

656
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,252
- Guys?
- Yeah?

657
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:05,853
- Guys!
- What?

658
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:11,993
Little Ralphie needs
to use little boys room.

659
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:13,695
Didn't you just go?

660
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:15,096
My bladder is literally the size

661
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:17,098
of a hummingbird's right now.

662
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,466
Come on, Caitlin.

663
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:20,268
Help a wee fellow take a wee-wee?

664
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,736
- Can you...
- Me?

665
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:24,005
Well, I'm not touching him.

666
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,607
Fine, I'll take you there,

667
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:27,175
but you have to find your own way out.

668
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,172
Thank you.

669
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,703
Could've just gone in the bushes.

670
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:32,905
Gross.

671
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:40,665
The embiggening bazooka
made us unstable, didn't it?

672
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,458
Yeah... no. What? No!

673
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:44,292
Wh... why would you say that?

674
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:46,461
I can see it all over your face.

675
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,529
- What?
- Your face is huge.

676
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:50,865
I'm watching your emotions on IMAX.

677
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:52,610
Yeah. Yeah, this...

678
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,469
This was supposed to
be an easy W, all right?

679
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,442
An easy victory.

680
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,070
All we had to do was capture Rundine.

681
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,640
Couldn't even do that for Allen.

682
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:01,031
- Okay, so, you tried.
- Yeah, and I failed,

683
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:03,044
because I'm stupid... all right?

684
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:04,746
Too stupid to help Allen's friend,

685
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:07,482
too stupid to fix you, or
too stupid to stop DeVoe.

686
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,747
Ow! Wh... what was that for?

687
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,453
Believe me, I'd punch
you in the arm if I could.

688
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:14,689
Ah!

689
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,858
Look, I know you're not
used to going up against

690
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,926
someone you can't outsmart, like DeVoe,

691
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:20,928
but you really are stupid

692
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,131
if you think you're too stupid.

693
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:25,700
You wanna help Barry?
You wanna free him?

694
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,953
Get out of your own way and unshrink us.

695
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:28,938
You weren't shrunk, all right?

696
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,250
That's not how his
powers work! His powers...

697
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:35,743
Work by not just...

698
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:37,311
removing the space between the atoms,

699
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:39,113
but also taking out
the gravity particles

700
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:40,448
and the dark energy,

701
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,238
so that when he embiggens an object...

702
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,586
He's refilling it with
the same combination

703
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:47,221
- of energy he extracted.
- Yes.

704
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:49,149
Harry... if you wanna fix us...

705
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:52,060
We need to put you back
in Rundine's line of fire.

706
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:56,899
Central City's Weather Services Agency

707
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,734
is always on the cutting-edge
of radar technology,

708
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:02,403
which is why I'm so excited
to show you the newest addition

709
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,072
to our stationary airship fleet.

710
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:06,607
Now, let's go take a closer look.

711
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,189
What do you mean we only have
20 minutes until we explode?

712
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:16,357
Actually, it's only 18 minutes

713
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,608
before your equilibrium
totally destabilizes.

714
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,944
You're gonna blow up
in under 20 minutes,

715
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:23,496
unless we re-expose you to
Rundine's energy blasts, okay?

716
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,124
Okay, so a facial recognition

717
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,800
just picked him up at
Weather Services Airfield.

718
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:27,827
I think he's trying to skip town.

719
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,042
Okay, I'm gonna stay here
and try and figure out a cure.

720
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,373
Hey. Sir, you need to leave.

721
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:35,164
The museum is closing for the day.

722
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,744
I know.

723
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:40,023
I just thought this would
look great on my shelf.

724
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:44,018
Red alert! Red alert! Everyone evacuate!

725
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,054
Gotta go faster. We gotta go faster.

726
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,223
Do you wanna drive this thing?

727
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:51,225
Kinda do. Ramon, remember,

728
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:53,193
when Rundine tries to shrink the van,

729
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,029
you've got to get in
the path of his blast.

730
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,491
- Do you understand?
- Copy that.

731
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:58,261
We're heading into the hanger now.

732
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,567
Uh, guys?

733
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,003
I think he sees us.

734
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:06,206
You're not getting big again.

735
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:20,685
I'll go left, you go right!

736
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,795
Harry, try flanking him.

737
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:30,200
We're gonna come around the other side.

738
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:31,231
Copy that.

739
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,770
Evasive maneuvers! Evasive maneuvers!

740
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,072
I know, I'm doing it.

741
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,775
Oh, boy.

742
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,994
We've gotta figure out how
to get him to fire at us.

743
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,769
- Abort!
- Ah!

744
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,537
- We're going too fast.
- Think light thoughts.

745
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,307
I'm thinking how you
nearly got us killed.

746
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,542
Think lighter!

747
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:01,281
Snow, tell me you got something.

748
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,378
The cure is not done yet.

749
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,088
Only one minute till
the boys go nuclear.

750
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,599
- I don't want to explode.
- What do we do?

751
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,235
We go to plan B.

752
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,554
I'm gonna shrink you down
to the subatomic level, boy.

753
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,154
Oh, is that right?

754
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,759
I'd like to see you try.

755
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:52,813
I'm big again!

756
00:32:52,815 --> 00:32:54,515
I'm big again!

757
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,304
Remind me to never again breach into

758
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,788
any of Harry's stankin' ass pockets!

759
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,561
Hey. Sorry again about stepping on you.

760
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,623
Hey, you saved me a
trip to the chiropractor.

761
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,626
Yeah, I guess so.

762
00:33:06,629 --> 00:33:07,929
You did it.

763
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:10,697
Yeah, I guess I did.

764
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,032
You have the right to remain silent.

765
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,787
Anything you say can and will be used

766
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,190
against you in a court of law.

767
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,495
You have the right to an attorney.

768
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:18,891
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

769
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,260
Hands behind your back.

770
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,843
Rundine...

771
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:25,746
15 years ago,

772
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:28,248
did you rob a Mercury Labs warehouse?

773
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,150
Give us your confession now,

774
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:33,069
and I guarantee the
D.A. will cut you a deal.

775
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:34,555
Mercury Labs...

776
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:38,459
That's the one that
Ratchet got fingered for.

777
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,966
I laughed so hard when
that guy got arrested.

778
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:48,135
You want a confession?

779
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,170
Find a priest.

780
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:52,873
I'd rather rot.

781
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,075
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

782
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,213
Hey, Joe, just hold
on a second, all right?

783
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,818
Ain't good news, is it?

784
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,823
Rundine won't confess.

785
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,419
My friends tried everything,

786
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:26,194
I mean, the... the D.A. offered
every deal she could, but...

787
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:28,830
I'm so sorry, man.

788
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,034
Look, you were right
about everything in here.

789
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:36,738
You know, I-I made you a promise and...

790
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,574
I let you down.

791
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:42,326
You damn idiot.

792
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:44,440
You did not let me down.

793
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:49,885
I forgot what hope felt like.

794
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,510
It's not a bad thing.

795
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,225
I'll see around, kid.

796
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,706
Hey, sorry.

797
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,204
It's okay, Bar.

798
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:11,540
I just wanna thanks for trying, you know,

799
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,268
and I'm sorry to send
you on this goose chase.

800
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,689
Barry, that place you're
in is full of walls.

801
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:18,057
When you hit one of those walls,

802
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,816
you find a way to get through it.

803
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,451
Don't lose your faith.

804
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,653
There's too many people counting on you,

805
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,222
out here and in there.

806
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:28,590
Yeah.

807
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,724
_

808
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:07,224
_

809
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,249
Nope.

810
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,685
Nobody leaves until
we're both good again.

811
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,154
Okay.

812
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,745
What do you want from me, Cecile?

813
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:38,877
I wanna know why me having these powers

814
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,061
is so upsetting to you.

815
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,530
You have the power. Just read my mind.

816
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,651
Uh-uh, no, no-no, me
reading your thoughts

817
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:45,967
is what got us into all of this.

818
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,263
I want to know how you feel.

819
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,216
Cecil, you being able
to read my... thoughts,

820
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,518
it...

821
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,776
It makes me feel vulnerable
in a way that I don't like,

822
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:10,458
you being able to hear every scared...

823
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,595
dumb thought of mine.

824
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,463
I just don't...

825
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,319
want you seeing me like that.

826
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,821
But I would never think less of you

827
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:20,424
for the thoughts that cross your mind.

828
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:22,037
How could you not?

829
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,674
Okay...

830
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:30,744
Joe, your grandma Esther's
noodles, they taste terrible.

831
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:32,287
Uh, no, they are terrible.

832
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,681
That woman had no business
ever messing with the wok.

833
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:35,919
Wow, okay. Wow.

834
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:38,150
And I think that I have
been using semi-colons wrong

835
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:40,560
for my entire life,
which leads me to believe

836
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:43,291
that I don't even know what
a semi-colon actually is.

837
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,263
Also, I would like to buy a
new pair of pants, 'cause...

838
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,461
But I haven't yet, 'cause I'm
afraid to go into the store,

839
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,331
'cause I think the
salesperson is gonna judge me,

840
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,190
because, truthfully, even I think

841
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:53,867
that I am just a little bit crazy

842
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:56,091
for having another baby at this age.

843
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:57,630
Oh, baby...

844
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:02,607
You're not crazy.

845
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,174
That speech you just
gave w... was a little...

846
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:07,347
You're not.

847
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,549
Those were my scared, dumb,

848
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,785
vulnerable thoughts.

849
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,486
You think any less of me?

850
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:15,955
- Of course not.
- Mm-mm.

851
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:17,757
Look...

852
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:20,693
I can't promise you that I'm
gonna stop reading your mind.

853
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:24,164
I... I don't even really
know how this all works yet.

854
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,943
But I can promise you

855
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:30,003
that nothing you ever think
will change my opinion of you.

856
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:34,073
And even when you're not thinking it,

857
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:36,109
I know...

858
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:38,724
that you are the brave, brilliant...

859
00:38:38,727 --> 00:38:41,481
Devastatingly handsome man that I love,

860
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:45,585
and the one thought I
hear you have the most

861
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:48,555
is that you love me too.

862
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:49,722
And I do.

863
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,724
Yeah.

864
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:01,300
Well, based on my scans,
Ralph and Cisco's cells

865
00:39:01,303 --> 00:39:03,770
have reformed and restabilized.

866
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:06,639
I can attest my bladder is
completely back to normal.

867
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,274
Fourth Big Gulp today.

868
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,843
I miss when we could just pick him up

869
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:11,911
and carry him out of the room. Right?

870
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:14,443
Hey, uh, you just
passed up a dig at Dibny.

871
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:16,012
Sure you're all right?

872
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,439
You know, we reopen a case
against an innocent man,

873
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:21,019
and, oh, somehow stumble
upon the actual culprit,

874
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:22,916
a culprit who, by the
way, has meta-human powers

875
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,193
that we are partially
responsible for, it's...

876
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,610
It's like you said:
There are no coincidences

877
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:29,914
when it comes to DeVoe
and these bus metas.

878
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:32,931
What's DeVoe doing?
What's his... motive?

879
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:35,101
Does he want Sylbert
Rundine incarcerated?

880
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,769
Or to have Big Sir set free?

881
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:40,206
Or for Cisco and I to become
itty-bitty meta-humans?

882
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,057
Well, whatever his plan is,

883
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,777
we'll figure it out.

884
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:47,447
- We're gonna stop him.
- And bring Barry home.

885
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:50,183
And bring Barry home.

886
00:39:55,824 --> 00:39:57,590
On your feet, Inmate.

887
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:01,194
Is there a problem, Warden?

888
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:02,595
As you know, Inmate Ratchet

889
00:40:02,597 --> 00:40:04,530
mysteriously disappeared last night.

890
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:06,499
Where do you think he went?

891
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,201
Well, I couldn't say.

892
00:40:08,203 --> 00:40:09,836
In an effort to locate Inmate Ratchet,

893
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,982
I reviewed the security camera footage.

894
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:13,640
Did you know the oscillating cameras

895
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:16,509
aren't the only ones in this wing? Hm?

896
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:17,677
Once you started stroking

897
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,445
Inmate Ratchet's hopes of freedom,

898
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,674
I had a camera installed
right by your cell...

899
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,087
And when I checked that camera,

900
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,957
I learned who you truly are.

901
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:33,593
Um, I don't know what
you're talking about.

902
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,929
Then let me be specific.

903
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:39,510
You are the Flash.

904
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,469
There's no use denying
it or trying to run.

905
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,271
You're clearly already
feeling the effects of

906
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,104
the drug cocktail I put in
that snack you so seem to enjoy.

907
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:54,113
Why? Why would you do this?

908
00:41:01,222 --> 00:41:02,789
I did warn you...

909
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:06,826
Everyone in here is a monster.

910
00:41:27,282 --> 00:41:28,614
That'll be all.

911
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:40,081
You said to call you when
I was ready to do business.

912
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:41,794
Hello, Warden.

913
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:44,163
Do you have another fish to sell me?

914
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:46,499
I do...

915
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:49,502
and it's a big one.

916
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:52,739
