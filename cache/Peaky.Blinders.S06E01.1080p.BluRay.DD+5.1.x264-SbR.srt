1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,481
<i>You've both met bad men before.</i>

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:07,801
The man we're about to meet
is the devil.

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,281
<i>My name's Mosley.
Oswald Mosley.</i>

4
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,001
You've come to my attention.

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,521
Michael Gray.

6
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,361
<i>You lost all your cousin's
money in America,</i>

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,281
<i>playing the fool.</i>

8
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,441
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

9
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,401
His wife has been seen
with another man.

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,281
Ah!

11
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:25,121
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

12
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,841
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

13
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:32,401
- I want to meet your family.
- No, you don't.

14
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,801
Mr Thomas,
it is the purest opium

15
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:38,641
that has ever arrived
in Europe.

16
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,321
£250,000.

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,041
All we have to do
is keep it here for a week.

18
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,201
I vote against it, Tom.

19
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:46,161
Those in favour?

20
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,081
Motion carried.

21
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,601
Agh!

22
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,841
We're talking about
an empty chair, Ada.

23
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,081
My chair. My throne.

24
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,561
<i>Someone wants my crown.
I think it might be Michael.</i>

25
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,001
Mr Shelby, my name
is Captain Swing.

26
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,241
<i>Michael, your kin,</i>

27
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,401
was making deals

28
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,041
<i>with the very men
who want you dead.</i>

29
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:05,841
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

30
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,481
It's time.

31
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,521
And you know it.

32
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,641
Let me guess.

33
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,361
Don't fuck
with the Peaky Blinders.

34
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,721
There will be a war,
and one of you will die.

35
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,761
But which one, I cannot tell.

36
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,201
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

37
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:25,721
Kill...and kill.

38
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,961
I have a job for you.

39
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,681
<i>I'm going to shoot
Oswald Mosley.</i>

40
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,921
<i>Kill the man, kill the message.</i>

41
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,721
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man.

42
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:45,281
The Chinese, the Italians...

43
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,921
Mosley knew nothing!

44
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,841
He knew nothing!

45
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,561
Who?!

46
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,281
Talk to me.

47
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,121
Maybe I've found him...

48
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,161
...Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

49
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,841
- Mosley.
- I don't know.

50
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,241
I don't fucking know.

51
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,201
Doesn't make sense.

52
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:20,961
Let's...

53
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,401
Let's go inside.

54
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:27,641
We'll work it out,
have a drink.

55
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:28,921
I need to walk.

56
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,481
The work's all done, Tommy.

57
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,161
It's all done.

58
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,481
We can walk away
from all of this.

59
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,201
It's so easy. It's so soft.

60
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,001
Such a small change.

61
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,841
Arthur took the bullets out.

62
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07,001
On the way back.

63
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,921
He said you stopped
at a crossroads to throw up.

64
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:23,081
You're not even a soldier
any more, Tommy.

65
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,801
You didn't check your weapon.

66
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,881
You're not a soldier,
you're a coward.

67
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,161
I heard you pull the trigger.

68
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,081
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye...

69
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,001
If you still need a way out...

70
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,441
...here are six of them.

71
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:50,121
Mother.

72
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,761
They let you pass through.

73
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:02,241
They wouldn't let me pass.

74
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,201
As if there were to be
another consequence.

75
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,361
Hello?

76
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,721
<i>Mr Shelby, I imagine
you're curious</i>

77
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,201
<i>as to who it was prevented
the assassination last night.</i>

78
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:14,361
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

79
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,801
<i>It's a unit of volunteers</i>

80
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,801
<i>bringing the bodies
of your dead to you,</i>

81
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,921
<i>to send to heaven
in your own way.</i>

82
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:24,961
<i>Last night's operation</i>

83
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:27,561
<i>was carried out by soldiers
from three Dublin brigades</i>

84
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,081
<i>of the Irish Republican Army.</i>

85
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:36,841
<i>We need to keep
Mr Mosley alive.</i>

86
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,921
That's all you need to know.

87
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,721
<i>Also, you should know
that saving Mosley's life</i>

88
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,161
<i>wasn't our only intervention
last night.</i>

89
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:53,961
We've made some changes

90
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,001
to the structure
of your organisation.

91
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,361
Ever since you began
to build your empire...

92
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,281
...you've had a crutch
to lean on.

93
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,121
Last night, we kicked
away that crutch.

94
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,241
<i>From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.</i>

95
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,241
<i>Please be aware, Mr Shelby,</i>

96
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,081
that the deaths
of your people...

97
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,561
<i>...are your own
responsibility...</i>

98
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,681
..because you consistently fail
to understand

99
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,321
your own limitations.

100
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:25,841
Mum...

101
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,921
...it was the ambitions
and strategies

102
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,401
of one man that caused this.

103
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,441
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God...

104
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,801
...no matter what it takes,

105
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:44,041
no matter how many lies
I have to tell...

106
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,641
...I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

107
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,641
Monsieur.

108
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,401
Monsieur!

109
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,161
J'arrive.

110
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:05,881
You want a drink?

111
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,841
I'll have a glass of water,
please.

112
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,681
Windows got broke

113
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:33,201
because a lot of people here
are drunk and angry.

114
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:36,481
You know?

115
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,801
Half the men on this island
made their living

116
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,921
bootlegging till today.

117
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,001
The other half
fixed their boats.

118
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,561
Maybe you should take
your water into the hall.

119
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,321
Yeah, I learned
a lot of things in France.

120
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:54,881
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

121
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,441
Closing our warehouses down.

122
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,481
Throwing men out of work.

123
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:12,561
Ten years our boat ran whiskey

124
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,161
down the President Roads
to Boston.

125
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,681
Now we have fucking nothing.

126
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,121
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

127
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,761
Is that meant to be a joke?

128
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:28,881
No.

129
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,161
I ordered water

130
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,681
because I no longer
drink alcohol...

131
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,521
...of any kind.

132
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:41,921
You, my friend...

133
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:46,521
...are going to drink a toast.

134
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,921
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

135
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,881
whose lives you bastards
have destroyed.

136
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,921
Drink it.

137
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,001
Hey.

138
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,281
Drink.

139
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,281
You're not leaving this bar

140
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,201
until you have raised a toast
to the people of Miquelon.

141
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:10,921
OK.

142
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,441
OK.

143
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,521
I understand that,
today of all days,

144
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,001
you would be angry.

145
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:29,161
But if you'd have read my card
instead of burning it,

146
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:30,801
you would realise

147
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,641
that this
is a misunderstanding.

148
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:37,321
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

149
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:41,041
but you need to sit down
and let me read my newspaper.

150
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,921
Il est bon, lui, hein?

151
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,201
Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

152
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,681
I will not drink your toast,

153
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,881
cos four years ago,
I forswore alcohol.

154
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:04,001
Putain.

155
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,001
No.

156
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,321
- Don't.

157
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,281
Since I forswore alcohol,

158
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,441
I've become a calmer
and more peaceful person.

159
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,281
Get in.

160
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,641
Sometimes,

161
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:31,801
in moments
of personal conflict...

162
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,361
...I can resort to my old ways.

163
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,041
If this were to happen now,

164
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:40,441
it would indeed be a black day
in Miquelon.

165
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,961
Now, my guests
will be arriving shortly.

166
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:46,481
I need to prepare the room.

167
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,841
Can you show me where?

168
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:02,521
Excusez-moi.
Où est L'Hôtel Robert?

169
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:10,081
They think we're distillery men
here to take our whiskey back.

170
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:13,081
We're late. He's always early.
Let's go.

171
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,121
<i>There will be a war,
and one of you will die.</i>

172
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:18,721
<i>But which one, I cannot tell.</i>

173
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:38,281
Hello, Tommy.

174
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,601
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

175
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,121
That was a misunderstanding.

176
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:45,441
Hello, Michael.

177
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,481
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

178
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,441
Oh, yeah?

179
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,041
What do you think?

180
00:23:57,161 --> 00:24:00,641
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

181
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:02,201
Tommy and I
haven't even spoken.

182
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:05,601
Well,
we've both been very busy.

183
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:08,961
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

184
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,081
You know, Michael,

185
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:12,921
when you're dealing
with a very powerful enemy,

186
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,201
taking revenge
sometimes requires time.

187
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,001
You have to...

188
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:19,441
...pick your moment.

189
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,041
That moment will come.

190
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,081
But now we have
a business interest in common,

191
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:34,761
and any bad blood will be
diluted by time

192
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,681
and a practical self-interest.

193
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,401
Well, Tommy, we're all keen
to hear what you have to say.

194
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:43,641
I'm very much looking forward

195
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:46,001
to working with you again,
Michael. You look very well.

196
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:47,401
You too.

197
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:50,681
How is the family?

198
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,001
Yeee-haaaw!

199
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:07,921
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin,

200
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,801
and he sent it all
the way from Hollywood.

201
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:11,601
Now sit down
and watch the film.

202
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,441
Oh, God. No.
Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

203
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,801
don't do that,
you're going to hurt yourself.

204
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:17,921
Yes, hi.
Is that the Bell Tavern?

205
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,521
If there's a Gypsy in there
called Johnny Dogs,

206
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:23,481
can you tell him to come
and round up his fucking kids?

207
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,801
It's Christmas.
A time for family.

208
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:33,401
Mum, I was watching that.

209
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:37,361
OK, everyone, OK.

210
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:39,761
When's he coming?

211
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,481
We're having
this Christmas party early

212
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:44,201
because tomorrow,

213
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:47,121
me and Charles and Ruby
are going on a big ship

214
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:50,241
to Canada,
to be with their daddy.

215
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,881
But we told Father Christmas
about the party...

216
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,321
...and he brought
you all presents!

217
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:56,681
- Oh!
- Yes!

218
00:25:58,761 --> 00:25:59,721
Race you!

219
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:02,121
Ada, where the fuck
is Father Christmas?

220
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,201
I don't know.

221
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:04,641
He was supposed to be here
by now.

222
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:05,681
Yeah.

223
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:07,521
Where the fuck are you, Santa?

224
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,161
Ohhh! Ohhh!

225
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,641
Ugh!

226
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,561
No!

227
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:20,241
Ugh!

228
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,761
You've got me!

229
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:25,521
I've got a gun.
You'd better run!

230
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,481
- You'd better run!

231
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:32,601
Gentlemen, today is
the last day of Prohibition.

232
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,601
But rather than see it
as the end of something,

233
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:36,321
I believe that,
for men like us,

234
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,881
it can present...

235
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:39,361
...a new beginning.

236
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:40,841
A new opportunity.

237
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:43,281
An opportunity
I would like to share

238
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,961
with people I know I can trust.

239
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,561
For the last 12 years,

240
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:49,081
the men of this island

241
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,521
have been making their living
from bootlegging whiskey,

242
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:54,201
from navigating the waters

243
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,521
and avoiding
American border patrols.

244
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:59,721
But now that whiskey is
about to become legal,

245
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:02,121
the trade will fall
back into the hands

246
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:05,881
of capitalists from New York,
Boston and Toronto.

247
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,081
But...

248
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,841
...when one door closes...

249
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,361
...another one opens.

250
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:16,241
We can take advantage
of the systems

251
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,121
that are in place
on Miquelon Island

252
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,601
and offer selected boat crews

253
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,081
the opportunity
to carry on working.

254
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:23,761
But this time
with a different cargo.

255
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,841
You want me to pour?

256
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,281
No.

257
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,641
Now it's all over
the fucking island.

258
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:54,121
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions -

259
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,561
just a load of fucking boats

260
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:57,561
with nothing to carry
and nowhere to go.

261
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,521
The reason why Miquelon
was used to run whiskey

262
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:01,641
in the first place

263
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:03,401
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

264
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:06,761
of both America and Canada.

265
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:09,001
Technically,
it's French territory.

266
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,201
The FBI, the RCMP
have no jurisdiction.

267
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,001
Where do you get this stuff?

268
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,321
I have established

269
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,081
a supply chain
over the last four years

270
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,641
with associates in Belfast.

271
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:26,321
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

272
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,841
That, my friend,

273
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,321
is the finest opium
in the world.

274
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:33,161
Delivered to my warehouse
in Liverpool

275
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:35,721
directly from Shanghai.

276
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,161
Michael...

277
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,801
When it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

278
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,081
I trust him.

279
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:45,161
What about the French police?

280
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,681
I have been in communication

281
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,841
with the Miquelon Prefet
des Gendarmes.

282
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,961
We fought in two of the
same battles in France.

283
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,201
We consider each other
comrades.

284
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:57,761
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

285
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:01,401
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

286
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:04,361
We will have to take
your proposal

287
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,841
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

288
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,161
Perhaps we can meet

289
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,881
after you've spoken
with Uncle Jack, Michael,

290
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,881
who I believe
is your wife's uncle,

291
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,041
Jack Nelson.

292
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,801
Hey!

293
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,801
The guy knows things
that can get him killed,

294
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:20,881
and he says them out loud.

295
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,281
I have a high regard
for Mr Nelson.

296
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:26,361
He has a history
not unlike my own.

297
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,441
Jack Nelson's past
is forgotten.

298
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:31,201
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

299
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,241
No, not gone,

300
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:34,441
just erased from the records,
like my own.

301
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,041
Give him my regards, will ya?

302
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,561
You haven't touched your drink,
Tom.

303
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:56,041
You know, since we last met,
Michael...

304
00:29:58,081 --> 00:29:59,761
...well, I've become
a better man.

305
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,641
I now realise that whiskey
is just fuel

306
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,521
for the loud engines
inside your head.

307
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,921
Catch yourself on!

308
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:14,401
What is this guy,
a fuckin' poet? Eh?

309
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,521
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

310
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:23,001
They say the fog
is going to get worse.

311
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,401
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

312
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,961
Just understand -

313
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:33,321
Uncle Jack decides everything,
OK?

314
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:36,841
And I decide
when a meeting is over.

315
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,801
So sit down till I say.

316
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:00,641
Maith fear.

317
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:07,841
Put some fuckin' hair
on your chest, huh?

318
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,321
Good boy.

319
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:23,921
Now, give us all a poem
before we go.

320
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:27,881
Want to hear a poem?

321
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,241
Want to hear a poem?

322
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,641
What about you, Brainbox?

323
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:54,121
I was angry with my friend

324
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:55,921
I told my wrath

325
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,041
My wrath did end

326
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,241
I was angry with my foe

327
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,681
I told it not

328
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,081
My wrath did grow.

329
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:22,481
It's from <i>The Poison Tree</i>
by William Blake.

330
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:23,841
You won't have heard of him.

331
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,281
Meeting over.

332
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:30,641
Oh, and by the way,

333
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:33,361
my friend,
the Police Commissioner,

334
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:37,561
told me that he'd spoken to
his FBI liaison officer,

335
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:40,001
and he told him

336
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,721
that there is an informant

337
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,761
in your organisation
in South Boston.

338
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,081
I tell you this

339
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:48,121
in the spirit
of corporate hygiene.

340
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:50,601
Here you are, Michael.

341
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:59,001
Beware the man
with a bleeding heart tattoo...

342
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,921
...with "Maria" written in red.

343
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:06,921
Have a good day, gentlemen.

344
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,641
This time, don't burn it.

345
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,681
Arthur...

346
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:10,281
Come on, come on.

347
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:11,401
God.

348
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:14,201
Oh, God,
if Polly was still here,

349
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,201
she'd never have let it
get this bad.

350
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,921
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

351
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,801
Arthur!

352
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:22,001
I am not Polly,

353
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:24,281
but I am still
your fucking sister.

354
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,561
You swore to me
you would stop using.

355
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,121
It's Christmas Day, Ada.
Christmas Day.

356
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,841
Yes, it's Christmas.

357
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,041
So where the fuck
are the fucking presents?

358
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:37,521
I'll be all right in a bit...

359
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,521
Great.

360
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,961
My brother
off his face on junk.

361
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,761
- Every day,

362
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,681
there's a question
without an answer.

363
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,641
A leak without a bucket.

364
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:54,081
Me without a clue what to do.

365
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,081
Fuck.

366
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,401
I love you, Ada.

367
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,801
Children!
Father Christmas has been!

368
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,401
Father Christmas!

369
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,161
What did you ask for?

370
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,681
- What have we got?

371
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,401
Father Christmas got stuck up
the chimney again, did he?

372
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,041
Mm.

373
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,201
What ship are you on tomorrow?

374
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:28,721
Oh, the best,
the most expensive one.

375
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:30,561
And then we'll get there,

376
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:32,081
and Tommy will say,

377
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:33,441
"Hello, Lizzie.

378
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:36,041
"Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

379
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:39,601
Come on, Lizzie,
he'll be on holiday.

380
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,881
Being away might change him.

381
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:45,641
Even on holiday, Ada,

382
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,241
even on top
of a rocky mountain,

383
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:49,521
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

384
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:51,961
No more Polly...

385
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,681
...no more whiskey,

386
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:56,001
no more Tommy.

387
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,521
Yeah, I'm calling
from Miquelon Island,

388
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:28,841
from the police station.

389
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:30,721
There is a boat leaving
the island now,

390
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,961
heading across the border.

391
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:35,401
When it docks at St John's,

392
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,201
a man named Michael Gray
will board a ferry to Boston.

393
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:41,281
Listen very carefully.

394
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:44,441
He's wearing a dark coat,
a blue suit

395
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,561
and carrying a black briefcase.

396
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:48,041
Inside the briefcase

397
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:51,321
is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

398
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:53,961
Concerned citizen.

399
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,081
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

400
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,081
Yes, I do.

401
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,441
But I don't drink any more.

402
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:23,201
I have business.

403
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,801
I need to get off this island.

404
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:32,321
You shouldn't be in here, Karl.

405
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,641
Are you going to answer it?

406
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,961
No, I don't work for him
any more.

407
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:51,921
It might be important.

408
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,241
That's why I don't
want to answer it.

409
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,121
Can I answer it?

410
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,401
No.

411
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,481
Hello?

412
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:10,681
Mm-hm.

413
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:13,681
Fuck.

414
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:48,641
Do you know who this man is?

415
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,401
All right, come on, Arthur.

416
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,721
Hiya...

417
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,041
Hey, that tickles.

418
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,961
His brother, Thomas Shelby,

419
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:30,081
says don't serve him opium
ever again,

420
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,201
or someone will write

421
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:32,961
Arthur Shelby's name
on your chest

422
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,401
with a bayonet.

423
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:27,961
So...what the fuck?

424
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:30,681
I can't talk about anything
in here.

425
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:33,561
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

426
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,081
Tommy Shelby steps back
into your life and, right away,

427
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,321
this is what happens?

428
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:38,921
No names in here.

429
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:42,201
Sorry. Let's just call him
the devil.

430
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:43,321
Take a seat.

431
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:47,761
How is Laurence?

432
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:51,641
Oh, you know.
Missing his father.

433
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:54,601
What the fuck happened,
Michael?

434
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:56,641
- It's in hand.
- Whose hand?

435
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,481
No, really.

436
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:02,401
Whose fucking hand, Michael?
Hmm?

437
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,841
Like everything else
in this city,

438
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:14,241
it's in the hand
of your Uncle Jack.

439
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:17,121
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

440
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,841
I already talked to him.

441
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:21,281
He told me
what the devil proposed.

442
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:25,521
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

443
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:28,001
He wants to take on Boston?

444
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,161
No-one is taking on anyone.

445
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,121
It's in hand.

446
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,281
There are deals being made
at a high level,

447
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,881
but there are some people
at the middle level

448
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:37,361
and lower levels
who cannot be trusted.

449
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:38,401
Michael,

450
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,241
- this sounds fucking...
- Shut up and listen.

451
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,841
It was Tommy himself
who warned us of the informant.

452
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,481
We're guessing
that the informant

453
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,761
was the one that tipped off
the police about me.

454
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:52,841
Then the devil's plan
has already begun.

455
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:54,721
What's the point
of ships and planes

456
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:56,681
if you can't get away?

457
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:59,841
Gina, in today's paper,
you will read about a man

458
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,401
being fished out
of the Boston Harbour

459
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:02,801
with a bleeding heart tattoo

460
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,601
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

461
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,321
Single shot to the head.

462
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,641
Yeah, I know,
I read it already.

463
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:13,121
His death will lead to others.

464
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,961
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

465
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:20,081
And while the clean-up
is being carried out,

466
00:42:20,201 --> 00:42:22,121
you must keep things
to yourself.

467
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:25,441
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

468
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,201
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

469
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,761
Do you understand?

470
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:36,001
Michael, I just want the truth.

471
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,601
No, fuck that -
I <i>need</i> the truth!

472
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,121
Why are you doing business
with him again?

473
00:42:42,241 --> 00:42:44,881
Gina,
tell me what you're thinking

474
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,401
of getting Laurence
for Christmas.

475
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:48,841
There are plenty of men
who can supply powder

476
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:50,161
all over the world -
I don't understand

477
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:51,441
why it needs to be <i>him.</i>

478
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,601
Some of my business

479
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:03,401
with Tommy Shelby
is unfinished.

480
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:07,081
This is my opportunity
to finish it.

481
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:13,081
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

482
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,881
- Oh!

483
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,081
Hello?

484
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:37,161
Who?

485
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,761
Sure.

486
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:42,441
Why the hell not?

487
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:04,201
I heard you were in town
and I thought, "Well, hey."

488
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:08,681
Little man
hitting the big time.

489
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:09,881
You like jazz?

490
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,361
No.

491
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:18,561
What do you want? Whiskey?

492
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:19,881
Water.

493
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,921
I don't have any water.
What else do you want?

494
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,921
I have a message
for your Uncle Jack.

495
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,881
Tommy, relax.

496
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:32,641
Have a fucking drink.

497
00:44:34,401 --> 00:44:35,601
You know my uncle's planning

498
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:37,681
on buying the
United States import licence

499
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:41,001
to all the best Scotch
and Irish whiskey distilleries.

500
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:45,921
He's on his way to London
right now to make those deals.

501
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,761
Every drop in every state

502
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,921
will be another dime
for Uncle Jack.

503
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,401
Yeah.

504
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:54,281
He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

505
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:57,041
I've only seen photographs -

506
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,321
when he was young,
police mug shots,

507
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:02,601
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

508
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:05,161
I think
this represents progress.

509
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:06,281
Yeah.

510
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:11,201
And before you tell me
what you want me to tell him,

511
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,241
I have a message
from him to you.

512
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:15,841
No deal.

513
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:20,401
Hmm.

514
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:25,681
In England, when someone gets
this close to Tommy Shelby,

515
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:27,281
it's, oh, the horror.

516
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:30,761
Oh, the desire...

517
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:35,241
...to fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

518
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:36,681
"Yes, sir.

519
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,481
"Please, sir."

520
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:47,201
So it's Uncle Jack
you fall on your knees for, eh?

521
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:48,641
Not Michael.

522
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:53,001
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

523
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:58,881
You smell of jail, Gina.

524
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,401
- And you drink too much.

525
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:05,001
Yes, but booze is legal.

526
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,721
Your white powder's not.

527
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:09,681
Jack has friends
in the government now.

528
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,961
Do you have any idea
how far he's risen?

529
00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:16,721
All the way to the fucking top.

530
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:20,521
Can't have white powder
on his shiny black boots

531
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:21,601
when he's on his way

532
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,441
to meet the President
of the United States

533
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:25,521
cos, yeah,

534
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:27,041
that's where he goes now.

535
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:31,361
So he can't really be
taking such a big risk

536
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:32,681
on such a little deal.

537
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,361
Go home, boy.

538
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:40,801
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

539
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:44,601
Yeah, you have another whiskey,
Gina.

540
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,921
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

541
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,001
You mind if I smoke?

542
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:50,761
If it's legal, it's OK.

543
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:54,161
Before I go...

544
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:57,481
...you should know...

545
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:00,441
...that it was me

546
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:03,641
who tipped off
the border police

547
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:05,921
about the contents
of Michael's suitcase.

548
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,921
I'm the reason he's in jail.

549
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,521
I wanted to give your uncle
a dilemma.

550
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:20,921
His favourite niece's
husband...

551
00:47:22,041 --> 00:47:23,401
...banged up in Boston...

552
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:26,241
...for smuggling opium.

553
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:29,481
What does he do?

554
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:32,161
If he intervenes
and has him released,

555
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,641
how will that play
in the Oval Office?

556
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,801
If he does nothing,

557
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,841
how does that play
in South Boston?

558
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:39,401
Oh, fuck you.

559
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:45,281
Fine.

560
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,601
Stay here.

561
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:48,801
Deal here.

562
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:50,921
Die here,
for all I fucking care.

563
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:58,721
Die at whose hand, Gina? Eh?

564
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:04,721
My message to your uncle
is this.

565
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:08,041
If he doesn't want
to buy my opium,

566
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:10,681
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

567
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:18,401
Oh, baby.

568
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:22,401
Do you want to start
a fucking war?

569
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:25,081
With that amount of opium,

570
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:28,521
the balance of power
between the Irish,

571
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:32,081
the Jewish and the Italians

572
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,881
would shift heavily
in favour of the East.

573
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:38,001
I have excellent contacts

574
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:40,761
with the family
that runs East Boston.

575
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:42,681
The Solomons family.

576
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:44,401
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

577
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:48,761
Once you people have accepted

578
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:51,161
that you must treat us
as equals...

579
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:57,641
...then I think our families
will work together very well.

580
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:01,921
Have a good day, Gina.

581
00:49:23,401 --> 00:49:24,521
Yep?

582
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,121
Yes, I'll accept the call.

583
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:39,961
<i>Hello, Lizzie.</i>

584
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:41,121
Tommy...

585
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:44,441
It's Ruby. She's not well.

586
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:49,481
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

587
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:51,201
What did he say?

588
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,361
<i>He says he thinks it's flu,</i>

589
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:55,441
but he's going to come later
to check on her.

590
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,001
She's been coughing and...

591
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:06,801
Tommy, he said it's not
a good idea for us to travel.

592
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:10,281
<i>We can't board that ship
to Boston today.</i>

593
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,841
That's all right, Lizzie,
don't worry.

594
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:15,921
Don't worry, you just stay
there for now

595
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,121
and get her better and, er...

596
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:20,201
Can I speak to her?

597
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,201
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

598
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,761
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

599
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:26,081
Let her sleep.

600
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:30,561
Lizzie, I've a bit more
business to do here.

601
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:33,961
<i>Look, you just book
a new passage</i>

602
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:35,321
when Ruby's feeling better.

603
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:36,721
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

604
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,001
just as long as you get here,
right?

605
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,801
<i>And then I'll get
this business done,</i>

606
00:50:41,921 --> 00:50:44,641
you get here
with the children...

607
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,121
...and then no more.

608
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:50,241
And it'll just be us
and the clean air

609
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:51,721
out in the West.

610
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:54,201
<i>I've found a place
in the mountains.</i>

611
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,721
<i>There'll be snow.</i>

612
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:58,601
Tell Ruby... Tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

613
00:50:58,721 --> 00:51:00,041
Hmm.

614
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:03,441
<i>How long has she been coughing?</i>

615
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,081
<i>A few days.</i>

616
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:07,881
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

617
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,561
out in the cold by the river.

618
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:15,641
Are you OK, Tommy?

619
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:19,121
Your voice,
it sounds different.

620
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,721
<i>It's just cold.</i>

621
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:23,201
I'll get this business done
in Boston...

622
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:26,001
...and that'll be
the end of it.

623
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:29,201
And then I just want to...

624
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:32,681
...I just want to pick Ruby up

625
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:34,361
and hold her in my arms,
y'know?

626
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,761
I miss the weight
of carrying her.

627
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:39,321
<i>I gave her her presents early.</i>

628
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,161
She loves them.

629
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,041
But last night,
she was burning up.

630
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,801
She was delirious.

631
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:49,361
She kept talking.

632
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,241
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

633
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:55,881
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

634
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,401
Yeah.

635
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:00,561
When she was delirious,

636
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,361
she kept saying
these Gypsy words, er...

637
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:09,521
<i>"Tickner maura,
tickner maura, o beng, o beng, "</i>

638
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:10,841
<i>over and over again.</i>

639
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,241
What? Lizzie, what...?

640
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,761
What did you say?
What did Ruby say?

641
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:19,681
Tickner, tickner maura.

642
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:21,721
<i>- Something like that.</i>
- Did she say any...

643
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:23,681
Did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

644
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,001
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

645
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:30,361
No, Lizzie, did she say
any other words in Romany?

646
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,681
Fucking listen to me!

647
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:33,241
I don't know Romany words,

648
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:34,761
<i>Tommy. I don't think so.</i>

649
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:37,241
Just "tickner maura"
and "o beng"?

650
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:38,201
Yes.

651
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,321
Could she see anything
when she was burning up?

652
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:42,281
<i>- What could she see?</i>
- Oh, fuck.

653
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:43,961
Lizzie, please, just answer
the fucking question!

654
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:46,761
She said she could see a man.

655
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,881
A man with green eyes.

656
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:50,641
<i>She was delirious.</i>

657
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:52,441
<i>She was burning up.</i>

658
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:54,041
What the fuck is the matter?

659
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:55,201
All right, listen, Lizzie,

660
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:56,281
- I'm coming home.
<i>- Tommy,</i>

661
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:57,881
- it's just a fever, love.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

662
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,801
I'm coming home. I'll be
on the next steamer back.

663
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:01,321
<i>You keep her out of school.
You hear me?</i>

664
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:02,721
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

665
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:04,801
- Tommy...
<i>- Keep her away from the river.</i>

666
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:06,841
<i>Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.</i>

667
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:08,921
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives

668
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,721
the words
that Ruby has been saying.

669
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:12,881
<i>Do you hear me?
Tell Johnny's eldest wife</i>

670
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:14,961
to put a Black Madonna
around her neck.

671
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,041
You listen to Esmeralda

672
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:18,041
the same way you listen
to a fucking doctor.

673
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,081
<i>You hear me?</i>

674
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,401
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

675
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:24,121
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

676
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:25,721
<i>- And you get Curly there.</i>

677
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:28,521
<i>Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses.</i>

678
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:29,601
And you do everything

679
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:31,641
that Johnny Dogs
and his wives fucking tell you.

680
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:32,841
Do you understand me?

681
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:36,201
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

682
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:38,041
<i>OK!</i>

683
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,761
I'll do it.

684
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,161
All right, I'm coming home.

685
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,641
Polly?

686
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,121
Polly?

687
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,441
They know
I'm trying to get out.

688
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:03,921
Pol...

689
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:06,761
...they're coming for me.

690
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,001
You son of a fucking bitch.

691
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,561
You sound American, Michael.

692
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:52,961
I have to go back
to England early.

693
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,801
Let's make this quick, eh?

694
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:57,201
You just fuck people up
and you run away.

695
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:58,401
No, this business
will continue.

696
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,641
Jack Nelson is also travelling
to England.

697
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:03,641
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licences.

698
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:06,201
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

699
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:08,481
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

700
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:10,001
Of his personal correspondence.

701
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:11,761
Letters from the President
of the United States,

702
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:13,401
and his many mistresses.

703
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:16,161
I have contacts
in his organisation.

704
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:20,241
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

705
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,721
You're dead, Tommy.

706
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,721
You're out
of your fucking depth.

707
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:28,641
You're dead already.

708
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,801
You threatened
to sell to the Jews.

709
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,681
And I have contacts
in this prison.

710
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:37,521
These boys here will look
after you during your stay.

711
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,481
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

712
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:40,921
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

713
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:41,961
Oh, yeah?

714
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:43,521
Is he?

715
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,121
This is a letter.

716
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,081
Here, give him this letter,
will ya?

717
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:49,561
This is a letter

718
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,881
from the President's
personal secretary,

719
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,281
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

720
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:56,201
Just until the press
lose interest, Michael.

721
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:00,961
Fuck you.

722
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:02,761
You'll be released eventually.

723
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,961
And then you can execute
your business with me...

724
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:07,361
...as before.

725
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:12,361
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

726
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:15,081
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

727
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,521
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

728
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,841
So, you didn't learn.

729
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:27,161
When my mother died
at the hands of your ambition,

730
00:56:27,281 --> 00:56:29,641
you didn't learn
your limitations.

731
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:33,361
I have no limitations.

732
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,321
Oh, and by the way, Michael...

733
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,001
...according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

734
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:46,641
he bought passage
for five people

735
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:48,161
from Boston to Liverpool.

736
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,241
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

737
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:54,561
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

738
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:57,481
...and Gina Gray.

739
00:56:59,961 --> 00:57:01,561
Gina's coming to London,
Michael...

740
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,481
...where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

741
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:07,921
Fuck! You fucking bastard,
Tommy!

742
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,001
- Spirits, Boston Irish...
- You're the devil!

743
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:11,681
- ...and Uncle Jack.
- You're the fucking devil!

744
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:13,281
I'm ready for the conversation.
