1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,360
<i>Mario could've lived a normal life.</i>

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,840
- Jim didn't have to kill him.
- James Gordon is one of them.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,800
When I get out of here,
he'll be the first that I judge.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,880
<i>Now, the Court's readying
a weapon</i>

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,120
<i>- that could destroy the city.
- It's the virus, I'm sure of it.</i>

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,600
<i>I have just discovered someone
has been deceiving me.</i>

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
I need you to kill him.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,480
<i>You've never
left that alley, Bruce.</i>

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,040
And for you to accept
what I have to teach, you need to.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,000
Selina, wait. This city
has been judged.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,400
- You need to leave Gotham today.
- And why are you telling me?

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,680
- Because I care about you.
- You're not even a real person.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're awake!

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,120
- Selina, where are you going?
- To kill someone.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,920
- What is this mysterious Court?
- Ed went on television

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
and voilà, he disappears.

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,120
- Oswald, drop it.
- No can do.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,200
You cannot do this to me.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,800
I demand to speak
to the person in charge!

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Oswald.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,680
You're alive?

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,560
How did you survive?

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,800
In shooting me, Ed,

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
you gave me something to live for.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
Revenge.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,160
Yes...

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Unless...

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
- What?
- Just making sure you're real.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Wow, you are difficult to kill.
More cockroach than penguin.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,400
But don't you
dare call me "Ed."

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,680
I'm...

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,920
The Riddler.

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,800
And I became him when I killed you.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,880
News flash, Ed!

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not dead!

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
That's true...

38
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
For now.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,560
I came back from the dead
to kill you, Ed.

40
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,600
And ended up a prisoner yourself.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,880
You really think a little steel
and concrete is gonna stop me?

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,960
The way I see it,

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,280
I have you just where I want you.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
Perhaps.

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
But not for long.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Selina.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
How?

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,040
I came here to do one thing.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
And it ain't answering questions.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,360
Strange as it sounds,
I'm glad you're alive.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
That is strange.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Because you pushed me
out a four-storey window!

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
What choice did I have?

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,080
You were gonna tell Alfred about me.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,800
You mean how you're a freak?

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,840
How you're just the cheap

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
knock-off

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
who kidnapped
the real Bruce Wayne?

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
Selina!

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
Selina, stop!

61
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,840
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,720
Oh, dear god. Selina! Selina.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,280
She, she attacked me, Alfred.
She's out of her mind.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,040
- She needs a doctor.
- You saw her, she... She was crazy.

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,600
Put the iron down, Bruce.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
I said, put the iron down!

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Alfred...

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
You're cut.

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
You don't feel a thing, do you?

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
Do you?

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,920
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely,

73
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,920
or I swear to god, you're gonna feel
a whole lot of pain.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
Where is Bruce?

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,880
Bruce is serving
a greater purpose than himself.

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,120
As am I.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Last time!

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
Where is Bruce?

79
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,680
You were always kind to me, Alfred.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,000
Even when you thought I wasn't Bruce.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
Please. Please.

82
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
Just tell me where Bruce is.

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
Welcome home, Bruce.

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
{\an5}Lee.

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
{\an5}Lee.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
{\an5}Wake up.

87
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,280
{\an5}Mario.

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,040
{\an5}Are you okay?

89
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,880
{\an5}- I was having the worst dream.
- Really? Tell me about it.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,640
{\an5}God, there was this virus
that was loose in the city.

91
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,960
It brought out a person's darkness,

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
whatever they had buried inside

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,160
{\an5}- and you had it.
- Really?

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,400
{\an5}And what dark part of me
did it bring to light?

95
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,400
- You were jealous of Jim.
- Come on.

96
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
Me, jealous of Jim Gordon?

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,920
- I'm sorry. You were.
- But I'm taller than he is.

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,840
- Hey. What is it?
- On our wedding night...

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
He shot you.

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,200
{\an5}God, it was so real.

101
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,160
{\an5}I lost you.

102
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,320
{\an5}You didn't lose me.
I'm right here.

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
{\an5}Now, take your medicine

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,400
{\an5}and then off to bed.

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,520
{\an5}- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

106
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
Now, drink.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
{\an5}Think about it, Harvey.

108
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
{\an5}The Court's been around
since the last century.

109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,520
{\an5}It makes sense
they have secure locations,

110
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
{\an5}safe houses all across the city.

111
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,120
{\an5}And that's where they're hiding
the virus bomb? Makes sense.

112
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,320
{\an5}Yeah, so I dug deeper
into Kathryn's holdings.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
She owns a tenement building
near Miller Harbor.

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,680
{\an5}But there's a discrepancy

115
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,840
{\an5}between the square footage
listed in the city records

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,200
{\an5}and the blueprints...

117
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
{\an5}Over 2,000 square feet.

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,280
You're saying,
they got a secret room there.

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,000
{\an5}Okay, but by your logic,
there could be dozens of secret rooms

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,800
{\an5}throughout the city
and the virus bomb

121
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,840
{\an5}could be in any one of them.
You're in the club now.

122
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,520
{\an5}This Kathryn broad trusts you.
Why not just wait for her to call?

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
{\an5}Because if I can do it quietly,
she'll never know.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
{\an5}And if the bomb is there,
I can end this.

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,480
{\an5}Okay, where in this building
is the secret room?

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
- Lucius says the basement.
- Oh, Lucius says, the basement.

127
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,320
Then, I guess we should
check out the basement.

128
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,440
- What is your issue with him?
- He's smarter than me.

129
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,640
How come no one
ever hides something

131
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,280
in a place I actually,
would like to search?

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
You know, like a brewery
or a strip joint.

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,920
- Or a casino.
- Exactly.

134
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,640
All I'm asking for
is a little consideration.

135
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600
This is more like it.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080
What's this?

137
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
There's a crease in the wall.
Think it's a door.

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
Let me hit the lights.

139
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,280
Just need to find a way in.

140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
I meant to do that.

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
Jeez.

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't see a bomb anywhere.

143
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
Yeah.
Why would it ever be easy?

144
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
What's that?

145
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,480
Looks like an owl.

146
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Made out of...

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Crystal.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
It's Gotham.

149
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,520
That must be us.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,840
- That lower corner right there.
- Yeah.

151
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,120
What do you think
the white markers are?

152
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,160
- Secret locations of the Court?
- Makes sense.

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
If so, that could be
where the bomb is.

154
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,240
- Holy mother of saints!
- Down!

155
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
I see you haven't lost a step, Jim.

156
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,440
Can't say the same for Bullock.

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,520
Remember I promised you'd
be punished for your crimes?

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,280
Well, I've come here
to keep that promise.

159
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
No, I said, Gordon.
Detective Jim Gordon.

160
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Well, have him call me

161
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
the minute he gets this message,
all right, you Nancy?

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
You should see a doctor.

163
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,280
Fine, whatever. Listen.

164
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Think. Can you remember
anything else?

165
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,840
Only what I already told you, Alfred.
The clone came to me.

166
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,000
Talking about how Gotham's
gonna be judged and,

167
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,960
a lot of people are gonna die.

168
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,360
It's the bloody Court of Owls,
isn't it?

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,200
I warned you.

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,000
Warned you what would happen
if you poked the tiger.

171
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,720
What, do you want a medal, dear?

172
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,760
All that matters
is they've got Bruce.

173
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,520
- Wait, you think he's still alive?
- My boy is still alive!

174
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
And you...

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,400
You are gonna help me find him.

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, don't, don't do that.

177
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,400
Then what?
You're still angry with Bruce

178
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,960
because he never told you
your mom was a wonky con artist?

179
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,840
That boy has been loyal to you,
he's been good, he's been a friend

180
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,000
and now he's in trouble
you're not gonna lift a finger?

181
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,520
I don't know what good it'll do me.

182
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,400
You're a disgrace.

183
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,400
You're like your mum.

184
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Go on, then. Run away.

185
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
And don't you ever come back here.

186
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,240
I, I'm good, thanks. I'm good.

187
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,280
Bullock, got a kid
who saw Barnes flee the scene.

188
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
All right, kid, talk.

189
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,120
I saw some guy in leather,
had an ax attached to his arm,

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
drove off in some delivery truck.

191
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,840
- What kind?
- For chopping stuff.

192
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,240
- What kind of truck?
- Oh, right.

193
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,000
Genovese Meats.

194
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Put a BOLO out on that truck.
Barnes has Jim.

195
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,080
He's taken him somewhere.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,640
You're making your blade too thin.

197
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
It's gonna snap off
when you try to stab me.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,280
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we, Edward?

199
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,640
I told you not to call me that.

200
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
What? Edward?

201
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,600
But that's your name, Edward.

202
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Edward, Edward, Edward...

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,960
Enough!

204
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
You're pathetic, you know that?

205
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,840
At least, I'm in here

206
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,240
because I was trying to figure out
who runs Gotham.

207
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
You're here because what?

208
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,440
I didn't love you back?

209
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Get over it.

210
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,680
No.

211
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,800
You did not love me back,

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
but that's not why I'm here.

213
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm here because you destroyed
the empire I built.

214
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm here because you shot me.

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,280
And no one does what you did
and lives.

216
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Well, good luck exacting revenge
when I'm gone.

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh, please.

218
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
Make one move to escape
and I call the guards.

219
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,960
I assumed as much,

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,560
which is why I bribed the guards
to poison your coffee.

221
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,360
- You're lying!
- Yes, I am,

222
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,720
but I did steal a dart

223
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,440
from the guards a couple days ago.

224
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,560
Was planning on using it
on them, but...

225
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,400
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that...

226
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Help.

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Help. Help.

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,720
What are you doing? Stop that! Stop!

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,920
Okay. Come on.

230
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,640
Stop that.

231
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,320
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

232
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,760
- No, no, no.
- You don't understand.

233
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,640
I shall set you free, Bruce,

234
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,480
free from the blinding rage
of your darkest memory.

235
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,800
There is one final step to take.

236
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,400
My parent's murder.

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,320
You want to take away
the pain of that night.

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480
Yes.

239
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,960
But you must be willing.

240
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,880
I cannot take what you will not give.

241
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,360
My mother's pearls.

242
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Lock them away
and be free of the pain.

243
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
Become strong.

244
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Become the protector Gotham needs.

245
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
I want to...

247
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,000
I just can't.
I... I can't.

248
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
Then, I think it's time...

249
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,120
I told you the truth.

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
You made a fool of me, Jim.

251
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,640
It's a shame.

252
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,000
I had such high hopes.

253
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,920
You could've played a pivotal role
in Gotham's future.

254
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,440
- Listen to me...
- Don't insult me further by lying.

255
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,560
I know you took my key card
to Professor Strange's lab.

256
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
Odd that Strange said nothing.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,200
He and I will be having words.

258
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,400
Who else have you brought
into your confidence?

259
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,720
- Harvey Bullock, obviously.
- What is this, an exit interview?

260
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,400
If you like.

261
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
Who else have you spoken to?

262
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,960
Who else have you spoken to?

263
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,760
The Court ordered
my father murdered.

264
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,360
You drove my uncle to suicide.

265
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
You can go to hell.

266
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,640
And what are you now, their lapdog?

267
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,920
I know you're a lunatic.
At least you used to stand

268
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,040
- for something.
- Your attempts to turn

269
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,760
Captain Barnes against me
are tiresome.

270
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,000
He was following you not because
I asked him to, but because he knows,

271
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,240
as I do...

272
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,200
That you are an enemy of Gotham.

273
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,000
You Gordons always were stubborn.

274
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,120
But I am sad you won't see the end
of our little story,

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,960
when the clock stops...

276
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,400
And Gotham falls.

277
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Captain.

278
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,960
He's all yours.

279
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,840
Let the record show that the trial
of James Gordon has begun.

280
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Nathaniel Barnes
presiding as judge, jury...

281
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
...and executioner.

282
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
Twinkle, twinkle, pretty doctor,
how I wish I could unlock her.

283
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,480
Here in Arkham, what a wonder.

284
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
Too bad her husband's six feet under.

285
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,560
Clever.

286
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,520
How is life in the nuthouse?

287
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,360
Oh, you know, it has its ups
and downs.

288
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,560
Forgive me for saying this,
Leslie, dear,

289
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,080
but you don't look yourself.

290
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,040
Have you been sleeping?

291
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,600
Or are you plagued by nightmares?

292
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,640
You want to hear
the funny thing, Jervis?

293
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,040
Oh, do tell.
I do so love funny things.

294
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,720
I never really blamed you
for infecting Mario. I just thought,

295
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,160
"Why blame the lunatic?"
So, I blamed Jim.

296
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,920
Wise...
Though hardly sidesplittingly funny.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
Why did you infect him?

298
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Oh, Doctor, is that the question
that's been ruining your sleep?

299
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,320
You wanted to hurt Jim.
Why not infect me?

300
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,840
Why make Mario suffer?

301
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,320
Do you remember our tea party
at your lovely home?

302
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,520
- When you shot Valerie Vale.
- Yes! Good memory.

303
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,520
Well, I saw the way
that you looked at James Gordon.

304
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,040
You loved him.

305
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,680
And that love doomed Mario.

306
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,840
- That doesn't make sense.
- It makes perfect sense!

307
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,160
Jim Gordon does not deserve love!
Jim Gordon does not get love!

308
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,840
I infect your husband.

309
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,560
You blame Jim.

310
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,560
Your love for him becomes hate.
It makes perfect sense.

311
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,960
And it worked.

312
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,040
But you know the funny thing?

313
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,920
There's poor Mario,

314
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,640
cold in the ground...

315
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,720
And here you are, blaming Jim,
even blaming me,

316
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,840
but guess who's really to blame?

317
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
I am.

318
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Now, see, that's funny.

319
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,760
My lockpick was confiscated!

320
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,000
Now, we're both stuck
in this unnaturally damp hellhole.

321
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,440
I hope you're happy.

322
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,440
Did the guards club you?

323
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,160
You know they did.

324
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Then I'm happy.

325
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,800
Why are our captors
keeping us here, anyway?

326
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,600
- Why not simply kill us?
- I don't know.

327
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
Since my first meeting...

328
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,680
With some woman named Kathryn,

329
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,640
I've had no contact
with upper management.

330
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,640
But according to the guard's gossip,

331
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,920
Court's planning
some attack on the city.

332
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Fine.

333
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
You want to kill me,
I want to kill you.

334
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,000
But being locked in these cages
does neither of us any good.

335
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,880
We have to escape.

336
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,520
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

337
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,560
We work together.

338
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,400
There have to be rules.

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,680
- No sabotage.
- Of course.

340
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
- And no murder on the premises.
- Agreed.

341
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,920
Also, there needs
to be a six-hour window, post-escape.

342
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,120
If I get outside
and I'm worrying about you

343
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,120
stabbing my neck,
I won't be able to concentrate

344
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,040
- and that's not good.
- Agreed, reluctantly.

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Then, we help each other escape,
together,

346
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,160
so that we may be free
to murder each other outside.

347
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Deal.

348
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,120
What are you going to show me?

349
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,760
The truth, Bruce.

350
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
My truth.

351
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,640
This isn't one of my memories.

352
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
It's one of yours.

353
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,280
We had no choice.

354
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,680
The laws are clear.
And you were gone.

355
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Thomas and Martha Wayne
were leaders of Gotham.

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
The city honored them.
I honored them.

357
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,160
- He threatened exposure.
- What of their boy, Bruce?

358
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
Their son.

359
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,320
- He was not harmed.
- That, at least, is something.

360
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,280
All this time, Bruce,

361
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,000
the Court was never more
than a means to an end,

362
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,160
allowing us to maintain order
in Gotham.

363
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Us?

364
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
Who are you?

365
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,040
One thing at a time, Bruce.

366
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,960
The point is,
the Court's day is over.

367
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,280
And they must finally pay
for their crimes.

368
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,440
- My parent's murder.
- Exactly.

369
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,760
This is your chance, Bruce.

370
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,280
Will you help me?

371
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,080
Things could've gone
so differently, James.

372
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,400
We could've cleaned
this town up together.

373
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,400
But when the moment came,
you stood against me.

374
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
You stood against Gotham.
Against justice.

375
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,480
- How do you plead?
- If you're asking

376
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,240
did I shoot your crazy ass
and send you to Arkham, then, yeah.

377
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm guilty.

378
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,320
The sentence is death by beheading.

379
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,920
To be carried out immediately.

380
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
You do know your new masters

381
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,680
are nothing but a pack of murderers,
don't you?

382
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,200
They're gonna unleash
the virus in a mass attack.

383
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,920
Infecting both the innocent
and the guilty.

384
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,320
You still think this virus
is a curse?

385
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Tell me.

386
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,960
What about strength is a curse?

387
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,120
What about clarity is a curse?

388
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,480
You're just like Lee Thompkins.

389
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
What are you talking about?

390
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,360
She came to me, just after
you blew her husband away.

391
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,080
She wanted to know
if he would've killed her.

392
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,920
I told her that the virus is a gift.

393
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,080
Just like you, she didn't understand.

394
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,360
If she did come to you,

395
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,680
the only thing she took away

396
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,040
is that Mario was totally
and completely insane.

397
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,000
Any last requests?

398
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes! My badge.

399
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,280
If I'm gonna die,

400
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,240
I want to die wearing it.
I deserve that.

401
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,520
One soldier to another.

402
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,600
One soldier to another.

403
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,760
Fire in the hole, Captain.

404
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,240
You fool! James Gordon.

405
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,680
I hereby...

406
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,720
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

407
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,280
- I got you, buddy.
<i>- He's running!</i>

408
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,960
Alvarez, any word on Barnes?

409
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,080
Nothing yet.

410
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,840
There's a nutjob running around
in a leather jumpsuit

411
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,160
with an ax for an arm!

412
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,160
Now, I know this is Gotham,
but come on, people, do something!

413
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,840
Jim.

414
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm heading over
to Kathryn's townhouse.

415
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,200
Maybe I can get there
before she realizes I escaped.

416
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
In case, I run into Barnes.

417
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
This is Bullock. What?

418
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,640
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

419
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,240
That was O'Toole.
Strike Force beat you to it.

420
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
They're bringing Kathryn in now.

421
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,560
Finally some freaking
good news, right?

422
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,960
<i>Gordon!</i>

423
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,240
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

424
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,680
Alfred. What's happened?

425
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,840
It's Bruce. He's been abducted.

426
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,840
Oh, why? Why can't anything be easy?

427
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,880
Don't know how,
but he's definitely gone.

428
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
And you're not gonna believe this,
but the people responsible

429
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,800
are this shadowy organization
that run the whole of Gotham,

430
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,960
- they're, they're called...
- The Court of Owls.

431
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,600
We've been investigating the Court

432
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,000
and a woman named
Kathryn Monroe for months now.

433
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,680
Until this morning,
I was working undercover

434
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,000
inside the organization.

435
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
Did they ever mention Bruce?

436
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,560
Never. Why would they want
to kidnap him?

437
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,560
Well, we might've had a, a bit of a,
a run-in early on in the year.

438
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,760
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

439
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Could be several days, several weeks.

440
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,560
Weeks? How can the kid
be missing for weeks?

441
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,040
- That's your one freaking job.
- Don't you think I know that?

442
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,240
They replaced him,
all right? With a...

443
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,040
With an exact clone,
created in Indian Hill.

444
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,240
Hold on a second.
Wait, back up,

445
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,640
I, I thought I heard you say,
"clone."

446
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,200
That's because I did.

447
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,600
I got to sit down.

448
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,840
All right, let's think this through.
Alfred.

449
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,480
Is there anything
you and Bruce could've done

450
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,000
that would've drawn attention
from the Court?

451
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,960
Well, we did break in
to one of their houses

452
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,640
to try and find something to give us
leverage against the Court

453
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,560
and all we found
was this ridiculous...

454
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,840
Crystal owl thingamajig
which I managed to break.

455
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Crystal owl?

456
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,480
Is there any way
it could be reassembled?

457
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,320
- Why?
- We found another owl this morning.

458
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,280
When you shine a light through it,
a map of Gotham appears.

459
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,280
We think this map indicates
the secret hideouts of the Court.

460
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
So, Bruce could be in one
of those hideouts, right?

461
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,840
So, where's your bloody owl?

462
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,520
Well, due to circumstances
totally beyond our control,

463
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,880
the owl went kaboom.

464
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,560
But if we could reassemble
the owl that you stole,

465
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,840
maybe we could find Bruce
and the bomb.

466
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,560
Do you still have the pieces?

467
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
You're having a laugh, ain't you?

468
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
After all the bloody trouble

469
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,160
I went through to get it,
of course I do.

470
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,400
Right. I'll be back in a minute.

471
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,120
Help!

472
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,040
Help!

473
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,640
Let me out of here,
or I kill him! Now!

474
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,880
Easy.

475
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,200
What are you doing? Open my cell!

476
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Shoot him! What are you waiting for?

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Never mind.

478
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Back. Get back.

479
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,480
- Wait. Is that Jell-O?
- Surprise.

480
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,600
Your death scene
was quite convincing.

481
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,760
Well, I've had some practice,
haven't I?

482
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
All right, if you see anything,
let me know, okay?

483
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,280
Yeah, you got it.

484
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,280
Detective Gordon.

485
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,960
I suppose,
I really shouldn't be surprised.

486
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,240
No, you shouldn't.
Put her in the box.

487
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
I've seen the map.

488
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,880
I know the Court has secret
locations across the city.

489
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,800
Where are you hiding the bomb?

490
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,040
What bomb?

491
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,000
What does Bruce Wayne
have to do with all of this?

492
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,480
Why did you kidnap him?

493
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

494
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,760
They're not all powerful, you know?

495
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,240
The Court, they can't keep you safe.

496
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,080
Besides,
what are the members gonna think

497
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,040
when they see
their leader behind bars?

498
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,760
You think, I'm the leader?

499
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,800
All this time and you really
don't know anything, do you?

500
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Right.

501
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Here we go.

502
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,840
Wait, this is the owl?
What the hell happened to it?

503
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,720
Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits

504
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
when he broke into the Manor,
didn't he?

505
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,680
- Can you put it back together again?
- I can't even do a jigsaw puzzle.

506
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,600
I just smash the pieces in
with my fists till they fit.

507
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,400
But wait a second, we have,
we have a guy here

508
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
who makes molds of murder
victim's faces out of clay.

509
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,480
- I'll give him a call.
- All right.

510
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Where's Gordon?

511
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
He's interrogating Kathryn Monroe.

512
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,440
- The woman from the Court of Owls?
- Yeah.

513
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,640
- Right...
- I mean, no! No.

514
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,520
Not the woman from the Court of Owls!
Oh, god. No. Not her.

515
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
Right.

516
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,440
Tell me where Bruce Wayne is,
or I guarantee you'll regret it.

517
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,040
- Alfred, I've got this.
- Good cop, bad cop.

518
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,880
That routine's a bit tired,
isn't it, gentlemen?

519
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah, but I'm not a cop.
Am I?

520
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm a butler.

521
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,920
Ladies and gentlemen...

522
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,080
Who is this guy?

523
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,400
Court is now in session.

524
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,120
Alfred? Alfred!

525
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,600
- Alfred, that's enough.
- Is he out

526
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,880
- of his freaking mind?
- It's his play.

527
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,440
Now, you tell me
where Bruce Wayne is,

528
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,200
you evil old trout,
or I will gut you!

529
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
Or maybe I should try the other hand.

530
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,760
Alfred...

531
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,080
What the hell's going on?

532
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Damn.

533
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,320
- Easy, easy!
- All right, I'm all right.

534
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,440
Hey, hey, you two, stop it right now.
We got a bigger problem.

535
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,680
Barnes is out there.
He tore up the precinct,

536
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,960
used some kind of knockout gas.
I got to get you

537
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,360
and her out of here right now.
Let's go!

538
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
- Take her.
- Get up. Up!

539
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,560
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

540
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,240
<i>You.</i>

541
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,840
<i>You corrupted this house.</i>

542
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,280
<i>All of you, with your weakness,
your compromise.</i>

543
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,800
<i>This place was a church to me.</i>

544
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,600
All right, that's enough of this.

545
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,040
Bullock, you and Alfred take Kathryn
out through the garage.

546
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

547
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,880
All right, Alfred, you do it.
She's the key to finding Bruce.

548
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,200
Captain! Captain!

549
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,120
- Help me!
- Shut up!

550
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,880
Barnes, this is your last chance!
Give yourself up.

551
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,600
<i>You dare threaten me?</i>

552
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,640
<i>You destroyed the thing
I care most about.</i>

553
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,680
<i>And for that, the sentence is death.</i>

554
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,200
- I don't think he's giving up.
- Yeah.

555
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
Hey Cap...

556
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,680
Captain!

557
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,480
Captain, stop this nonsense
and take me out of here now!

558
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Nonsense?

559
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,240
Nonsense?

560
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,640
This is justice.

561
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,360
No!

562
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Barnes!

563
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,160
It's fitting, Jim.

564
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,160
That you should meet your end here.

565
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,280
The word will go out.

566
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,000
No one will escape

567
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,760
from the executioner's blade.

568
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
No.

569
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
No!

570
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
You will face judgment.

571
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,240
You will be judged!

572
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,920
You know what, Captain?

573
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
This place is a church.

574
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,080
Mine.

575
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,160
Our agreement still holds
for five hours.

576
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,800
I am aware.

577
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,880
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

578
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,720
Barbara Kean runs the underworld.

579
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,080
We have the gangs. You have...

580
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,200
Yourself.

581
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,600
Actually, I have an army

582
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
of Hugo Strange's monsters
at my command.

583
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,640
But even if I were alone,

584
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,120
you wouldn't stand a chance.

585
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
I suppose we'll see.

586
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,640
I suppose so.

587
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,240
<i>- Let me know if you need anything.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

588
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
Lee?

589
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,400
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to get some things.

590
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,960
You saw me, you thought
I'd heard about Barnes

591
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,400
and I came to help?

592
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,360
Is that such a crazy idea?

593
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,440
It's just bad timing.

594
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,920
And if I had heard
I wouldn't have come.

595
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,240
- I'm done with this place.
- So you keep saying.

596
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,080
You know, Barnes loved the GCPD.

597
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,920
- But today he tried to destroy it.
- It was the virus.

598
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,760
Or maybe he finally discovered
the truth.

599
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,080
There is no justice here.

600
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,640
Look at you, you still haven't paid
for the pain that you've caused.

601
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,280
But I guess that's the difference
between the two of us.

602
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,920
I'm willing to pay
for what I've done.

603
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,880
What are you talking about,
what've you done?

604
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

605
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,840
Hey, Jim, my guy worked on the owl,
says, he's gonna need another hour.

606
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,320
- What did Lee want?
- I have no idea.

607
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,200
But, Harvey, if we do find
the location of the sites,

608
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,000
we've got to be ready to move.

609
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,040
Kathryn's killing is only
gonna energize the Court,

610
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,960
- force their leader to act.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,

611
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,240
there's someone above her?
Who?

612
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,640
I don't know.

613
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,640
Go on, Bruce.

614
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,000
The Court of Owls
must pay for what they did.

615
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,200
It's the only way.

616
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,680
Thank you.

617
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,240
Tell me,

618
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
how do you feel now,

619
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,840
when you think
of your parent's murder?

620
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I feel...

621
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Nothing.

622
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,800
Talons have served
the Court since its inception.

623
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,520
The Court culls them from orphanages.
Trains them.

624
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,760
What I did to you, the Court has
done with them for 200 years.

625
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,680
But the process does
more than remove all feeling.

626
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,600
Cut off the smallest finger
of your left hand.

627
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,320
Shall I tell him to eat it?

628
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,600
He will, if I say so.

629
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,880
Bandage that.

630
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,000
You see, Bruce,
the pain of our memories

631
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,080
can scar us,
but it also defines us.

632
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,720
Take away that pain

633
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,400
and your mind becomes clay
for me to mold.

634
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,640
I told you the truth.

635
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,120
We will destroy the Court of Owls.

636
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,920
And in so doing, you will become
the perfect weapon.

637
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,720
For you will do whatever I say.

638
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,080
Won't you?

639
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Yes.

640
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,600
See? I told you it would work.

641
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,200
This is it, Alfred.
We can find Bruce and end this.

642
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,080
Alvarez, call Strike Force.

643
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,080
I want every cop
on the roster in uniform

644
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,440
and ready to roll in half an hour.

645
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,240
What are you waiting for?

646
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,920
I was coming to tell you.
I just got word from Arkham.

647
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,920
Barnes escaped his transport.

648
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
Took out three guards.
He's in the wind.

649
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,320
We just busted that dude
five minutes ago.

650
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,560
There's more.

651
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,920
What is this doing in here?

652
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,640
It's supposed to be
in Lucius's office.

653
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,480
He must have moved it. He said,
he needed to run some tests.

654
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,440
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange...

655
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,040
- It's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

656
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,480
You're the only two
with the combination, right?

657
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,640
Yeah.

658
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,600
No. Lee has it, too.
