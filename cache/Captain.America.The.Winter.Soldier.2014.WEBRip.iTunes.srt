1
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,300
On your left.

2
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,271
On your left.

3
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,355
On my left. Got it.

4
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,488
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,156
-On your left.
-Come on!

6
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,542
Need a medic?

7
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,963
I need a new set of lungs.

8
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,383
Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

9
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,467
I guess I got a late start.

10
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,179
Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.

11
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,890
You should take another lap.

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,184
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

13
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,894
What unit you with?

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,437
58th Pararescue.

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,189
But now I'm working down at the VA.

16
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,482
-Sam Wilson.
-Steve Rogers.

17
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,860
I kind of put that together.

18
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,447
Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,033
It takes some getting used to.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,576
It's good to meet you, Sam.

21
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:58,994
It's your bed, right?

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,163
What's that?

23
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,748
Your bed, it's too soft.

24
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,583
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,668
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,963
Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...

27
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,340
Lying on a marshmallow.

28
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,050
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

29
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,719
How long?

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,054
Two tours.

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,556
You must miss the good old days, huh?

32
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,976
Well, things aren't so bad.

33
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,562
Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,939
No polio is good.

35
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,232
Internet, so helpful.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,858
I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.

37
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,989
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.

38
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,617
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

39
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,744
I'll put it on the list.

40
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,088
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,673
If that's what you want to call running.

42
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,882
That's how it is?

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,967
-That's how it is.
-Okay.

44
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,971
Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome

45
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,474
in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.

46
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,268
-I'll keep it in mind.
-Yeah.

47
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,857
Hey, fellas.

48
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,775
Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?

49
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,235
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

50
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,653
That's hilarious.

51
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,701
-How you doing?
-Hey.

52
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,453
Can't run everywhere.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,538
No, you can't.

54
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,506
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,716
the Lemurian Star.

56
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,135
They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,

57
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,095
93 minutes ago.

58
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,014
-Any demands?
-Billion and a half.

59
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,891
-Why so steep?
-Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

60
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,020
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

61
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,688
I'm sure they have a good reason.

62
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,607
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

63
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,650
Relax. It's not that complicated.

64
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,943
How many pirates?

65
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,529
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

66
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,825
Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

67
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,911
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

68
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,748
Before the French demobilized him,
he had 36 kill missions.

69
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,583
This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.

70
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,043
Hostages?

71
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,004
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

72
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,881
They're in the galley.

73
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,507
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

74
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,593
All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.

75
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,261
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

76
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,223
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

77
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,183
get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.

78
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,434
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.

79
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,658
Secure channel seven.

80
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,867
Seven secure.

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,494
Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?

82
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,081
Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,832
so, no, not really.

84
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,126
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.

85
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,338
You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

86
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,215
That's why I don't ask.

87
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,718
Too shy, or too scared?

88
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,846
Too busy!

89
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,890
Was he wearing a parachute?

90
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,100
No.

91
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,768
No, he wasn't.

92
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,177
Hey!

93
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,133
Don't move.

94
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,305
Thanks.

95
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,516
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

96
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,897
What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?

97
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,023
She seems kind of nice.

98
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,692
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

99
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,527
I'm multi-tasking.

100
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:25,904
I told Batroc...

101
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,531
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

102
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,867
...start sending them bodies now!

103
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,745
I have a bullet for someone...

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,123
You want a bullet in your head?

105
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,916
Move that foot - you want
a bullet in the head...?

106
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,803
I don't like waiting.

107
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,055
Call Durand.

108
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,392
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

109
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,109
Start the engines.

110
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,569
Okay.

111
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:07,905
Hey, sailor.

112
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,717
Shut up.

113
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,304
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

114
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,063
All right, I've waited long enough...

115
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,651
Hey!

116
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,735
Find Batroc...

117
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,778
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

118
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,112
...I start killing them!

119
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,364
I'll find him.

120
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,290
Two minutes.

121
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,074
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

122
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,496
Targets acquired.

123
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,248
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

124
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,417
Natasha, what's your status?

125
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,087
Status, Natasha.

126
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,213
Hang on!

127
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,439
Engine room secure.

128
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,157
Time is up.

129
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,160
Who dies first...?

130
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,621
You!

131
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,705
Get that one.

132
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,250
On my mark.

133
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,045
Three...

134
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,546
Two... One.

135
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,972
I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

136
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,061
The line just went dead.

137
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,812
I've lost contact with them...

138
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,495
Hostages en route to extraction.

139
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,748
Romanoff missed
the rendezvous point, Cap.

140
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,292
Hostiles are still in play.

141
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,837
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

142
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,089
Circle back to Rumlow
and protect the hostages.

143
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,091
Natasha.

144
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,296
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

145
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,020
Let's see.

146
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,339
Well, this is awkward.

147
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,010
What are you doing?

148
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,386
Backing up the hard drive.

149
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,846
It's a good habit to get into.

150
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,389
Rumlow needed your help.

151
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,849
What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,646
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

153
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,022
Whatever I can get my hands on.

154
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,565
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

155
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,526
No, that's your mission,

156
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,362
and you've done it beautifully.

157
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,323
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

158
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,866
I think that's overstating things.

159
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,010
Okay.

160
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,887
That one's on me.

161
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,265
You're damn right.

162
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,254
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

163
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,380
I didn't lie.

164
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,756
Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.

165
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,758
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

166
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,468
I'm not obliged to do anything.

167
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,095
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

168
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,891
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

169
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,185
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

170
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,978
Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.

171
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,398
Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.

172
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,777
Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.

173
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,071
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,448
I can't lead a mission

175
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,366
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

176
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,203
It's called compartmentalization.

177
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,080
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

178
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:33,957
Except you.

179
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,254
You're wrong about me.

180
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,298
I do share.

181
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,092
I'm nice like that.

182
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,222
-Insight bay.
-Captain Rogers does not have

183
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,598
clearance for Project Insight.

184
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,267
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

185
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,977
Confirmed.

186
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,357
You know, they used to play music.

187
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,025
Yeah.

188
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:03,820
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

189
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,323
Granddad worked in a nice building.

190
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,699
Got good tips.

191
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,412
He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

192
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,914
He'd say, "Hi."

193
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,999
People would say, "Hi" back.

194
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,169
Time went on,
the neighborhood got rougher.

195
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,295
He'd say, "Hi."

196
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,840
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

197
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,133
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

198
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,094
Did he ever get mugged?

199
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,015
Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"

200
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,934
What would he do?

201
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,269
He'd show them.

202
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,314
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

203
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,153
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

204
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,365
But he didn't trust them very much.

205
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,873
Yeah, I know.

206
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,458
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

207
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,204
This is Project Insight.

208
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,581
Three next-generation helicarriers

209
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,417
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

210
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,419
Launched from the Lemurian Star.

211
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,589
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

212
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:50,677
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

213
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,179
Stark?

214
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,472
He had a few suggestions

215
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,891
once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.

216
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,144
These new long-range precision guns

217
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,772
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

218
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,193
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

219
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,445
We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats
before they even happen.

220
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,573
Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.

221
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,157
We can't afford to wait that long.

222
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,867
Who's "we"?

223
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,287
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

224
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,790
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

225
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,876
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

226
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,547
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.

227
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,217
You know, I read those SSR files.

228
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,094
"Greatest Generation"?

229
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,471
You guys did some nasty stuff.

230
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,223
Yeah, we compromised.

231
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,559
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

232
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,311
But we did it
so that people could be free.

233
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,689
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

234
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:47,276
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.

235
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,446
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.

236
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,283
Don't hold your breath.

237
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,887
Welcome to the Smithsonian.

238
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,599
Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.

239
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,776
A symbol to the nation.

240
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,696
A hero to the world.

241
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:39,953
The story of Captain America
is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.

242
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,377
Denied enlistment due to poor health,

243
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,838
Steven Rogers was chosen
for a program

244
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,175
unique in the annals
of American warfare.

245
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:59,097
One that would transform him
into the world's first Super-Soldier.

246
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,813
In this rare footage,

247
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,274
everyone's favorite war hero,
Captain America...

248
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,943
Battle tested,

249
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,110
Captain America

250
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,656
and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.

251
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,865
Their mission:

252
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,869
taking down HYDRA,
the Nazi rogue science division.

253
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,208
Best friends since childhood,

254
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,462
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers
were inseparable

255
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,548
on both schoolyard and battlefield.

256
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:37,970
Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life

257
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,722
in service of his country.

258
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,396
That was a difficult winter.

259
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,816
A blizzard had trapped half
our battalion behind the German line.

260
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,903
Steve, Captain Rogers,

261
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,739
he fought his way
through a HYDRA blockade

262
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,450
that had pinned our allies
down for months.

263
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,829
He saved over 1,000 men.

264
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,456
Including the man who would...

265
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,711
Who would become my husband,
as it turned out.

266
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:14,381
Even after he died,
Steve was still changing my life.

267
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,886
You should be
proud of yourself, Peggy.

268
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,354
I have lived a life.

269
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,484
My only regret is that
you didn't get to live yours.

270
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:38,780
What is it?

271
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:44,995
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

272
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,749
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

273
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:56,006
And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.

274
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,508
Serve.

275
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,804
It's just not the same.

276
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,806
You're always so dramatic.

277
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,647
Look, you saved the world.

278
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,903
We rather mucked it up.

279
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,571
You didn't.

280
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,867
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

281
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,702
Hey.

282
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:32,835
The world has changed,
and none of us can go back.

283
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,213
All we can do is our best.

284
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,634
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

285
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,142
Peggy.

286
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,941
Steve.

287
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:57,860
Yeah?

288
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:00,779
You're alive.

289
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,575
You came back.

290
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,784
Yeah, Peggy.

291
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,582
It's been so long.

292
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,586
So long.

293
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,214
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

294
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:21,466
Not when she owes me a dance.

295
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,891
Secure office.

296
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,693
Open Lemurian Star's
satellite launch file.

297
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:42,446

Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

301
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,627
Override denied. All files sealed.

302
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,295
On whose authority?

303
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,672
Fury, Nicholas J.

304
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,346
World Security Council.

305
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,764
Confirmed.

306
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,644
If Nick Fury thinks
he can get his costumed thugs

307
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,105
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.

308
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,482
This failure is unacceptable.

309
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,275
Considering this attack took place

310
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,194
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

311
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,821
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

312
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,865
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

313
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,159
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

314
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,328
A breach like this
raises serious questions.

315
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,247
Like how the hell did a French pirate

316
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,334
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

317
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,545
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

318
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,214
I can draw a map if it'd help.

319
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,259
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

320
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:49,012
But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.

321
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,432
Really? I don't.

322
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,436
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

323
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,357
If this Council is going to fall to rancor

324
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,110
every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,

325
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,363
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

326
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,074
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

327
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,246
Excuse me.

328
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,873
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

329
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,708
Depends on your definition.

330
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,553
I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

331
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,847
A nuclear war would do it, too.

332
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,224
You busy in there?

333
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,934
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

334
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:41,231
I'm here to ask a favor.

335
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,901
I want you to call for a vote.

336
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,236
Project Insight has to be delayed.

337
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,822
Nick, that's not a favor,

338
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,532
that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.

339
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,367
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

340
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:55,204
I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.

341
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,413
But if it's something?

342
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,416
Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.

343
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:02,544
Fine.

344
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:06,757
But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.

345
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,592
Thank you, sir.

346
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,637
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

347
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,516
The thing is,

348
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,101
I think it's getting worse.

349
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,605
A cop pulled me over last week.

350
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,106
He thought I was drunk.

351
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,778
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

352
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,948
I thought it was an IED.

353
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,118
Some stuff you leave there.

354
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,496
Other stuff you bring back.

355
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,624
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

356
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,962
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

357
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,214
It's up to you.

358
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,758
-I'll see you next week.
-Definitely.

359
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:54,096
Look who it is, the running man.

360
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,391
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

361
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,561
Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.

362
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,479
Guilt,

363
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,147
regret.

364
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,275
You lose someone?

365
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,319
My wingman, Riley.

366
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,363
Flying a night mission.

367
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,907
Standard PJ rescue op.

368
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,159
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

369
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,955
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

370
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,375
Nothing I could do.

371
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,003
It's like I was up there just to watch.

372
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,047
-I'm sorry.
-After that,

373
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,843
I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?

374
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,097
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

375
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,518
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

376
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:42,728
So, hell yeah.

377
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:44,897
Are you thinking about getting out?

378
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:46,899
No.

379
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,110
I don't know.

380
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,198
To be honest, I don't know
what I would do with myself if I did.

381
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,699
Ultimate fighting?

382
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,911
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

383
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,538
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

384
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,540
What makes you happy?

385
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,169
I don't know.

386
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,381
Activating communications
encryption protocol.

387
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,884
Open secure line 0405.

388
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,385
Confirmed.

389
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:17,846
This is Hill.

390
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,848
I need you here in D.C.

391
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,726
Deep shadow conditions.

392
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,603
Give me four hours.

393
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,230
You have three. Over.

394
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,206
Want to see my lease?

395
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,308
Fracture detected.

396
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,897
Recommend anesthetic injection.

397
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,947
D.C. Metro Police dispatch
shows no units in this area.

398
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:23,287
Get me out of here.

399
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,291
Propulsion systems offline.

400
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,417
Then reboot, damn it!

401
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,814
Warning. Window
integrity compromised.

402
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,482
You think?

403
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:56,945
How long to propulsion?

404
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:57,988
Calculating.

405
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,328
Window integrity 31%.
Deploying countermeasures.

406
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:05,662
Hold that order!

407
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,499
Window integrity 19%.

408
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,792
Offensive measures advised.

409
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,169
Wait!

410
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,341
Window integrity 1%.

411
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:18,509
Now!

412
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,562
Propulsion systems now online.

413
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,939
Full acceleration! Now!

414
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,373
Initiate vertical takeoff!

415
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,541
Flight systems damaged.

416
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,543
Then activate guidance cameras!

417
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:56,964
Give me the wheel!

418
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,848
Get me Agent Hill.

419
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,224
Communications array damaged.

420
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:08,976
Well, what's not damaged?

421
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,270
Air conditioning is fully operational.

422
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,157
Traffic ahead.

423
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,200
Give me an alternate route.

424
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,077
Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge.

425
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:28,537
All vehicles stopped.

426
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,165
17th Avenue clear in three blocks,
directly ahead.

427
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,805
Warning. Approaching intersection.

428
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,941
Get me off the grid!

429
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,860
Calculating route to secure location.

430
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,521
So sweet. That is so nice.

431
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,481
Hi.

432
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:43,941
I got to go, though.

433
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,943
Okay. Bye.

434
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,737
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

435
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,448
Yeah.

436
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,117
Hey, if you want...

437
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,537
If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.

438
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,288
Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.

439
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,624
Yeah? What's it cost?

440
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,293
A cup of coffee?

441
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,714
Thank you, but

442
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,967
I already have a load in downstairs,

443
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,969
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

444
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:16,223
I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...

445
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,391
Well, I'll keep my distance.

446
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,685
Hopefully, not too far.

447
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,273
And I think you left your stereo on.

448
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,317
Right. Thank you.

449
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,527
Yeah.

450
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,074
I don't remember giving you a key.

451
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,120
You really think I'd need one?

452
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,707
My wife kicked me out.

453
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,543
I didn't know you were married.

454
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,255
A lot of things you don't know about me.

455
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,966
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

456
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:51,068
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

457
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,743
Who else knows about your wife?

458
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:03,580
Just...

459
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,918
My friends.

460
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:09,711
Is that what we are?

461
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,755
That's up to you.

462
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:33,777
Don't trust anyone.

463
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,823
Captain Rogers?

464
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:40,909
Captain,

465
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,203
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.

466
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,496
Kate?

467
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,249
I'm assigned to protect you.

468
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,625
On whose order?

469
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:50,878
His.

470
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,634
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

471
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:58,802
I need EMTs.

472
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,554
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?

473
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,514
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

474
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,201
Is he gonna make it?

475
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,702
I don't know.

476
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,789
Tell me about the shooter.

477
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,083
He's fast. Strong.

478
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,337
Had a metal arm.

479
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,885
Ballistics?

480
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:26,014
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

481
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:27,474
Soviet-made.

482
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,434
Yeah.

483
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:31,728
He's in V-tach.

484
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,605
-Crash cart coming in.
-Nurse, help me with the drape.

485
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:34,940
-BP's dropping.
-Defibrillator!

486
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,236
I want you to charge him at 100.

487
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,821
Don't do this to me, Nick.

488
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,239
Stand back.

489
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:43,615
Three, two,

490
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,576
one. Clear.

491
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,412
-Pulse?
-No pulse.

492
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:49,830
Okay, 200, please.

493
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,039
Stand back!

494
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,458
Three, two, one. Clear!

495
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:54,626
Get me epinephrine!

496
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:56,920
Pulse?

497
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,005
Negative.

498
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,634
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

499
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:23,989
What's the time?

500
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,115
1:03, Doctor.

501
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,995
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

502
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,117
I need to take him.

503
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,174
Natasha.

504
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,022
Natasha!

505
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:41,984
Why was Fury in your apartment?

506
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,112
I don't know.

507
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,780
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

508
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,407
Yeah, give me a second.

509
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,533
They want you now.

510
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,202
Okay.

511
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,499
You're a terrible liar.

512
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,215
S.T.R.I.K.E. team,
escort Captain Rogers

513
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,759
back to S.H.I.E.L.D.
immediately for questioning.

514
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,386
I told him.

515
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,895
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

516
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:20,731
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

517
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,664
Captain Rogers.

518
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,124
Neighbor.

519
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:42,920
Captain.

520
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,379
I'm Alexander Pierce.

521
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,423
Sir, it's an honor.

522
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,674
The honor's mine, Captain.

523
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:50,302
My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.

524
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,097
That photo was taken
five years after Nick and I met,

525
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,725
when I was at State Department
in Bogota.

526
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,394
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

527
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:03,815
and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.

528
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,486
Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

529
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,946
and he comes to me with a plan.

530
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:11,031
He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.

531
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,951
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

532
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:18,580
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

533
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,916
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

534
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,543
They find it empty.

535
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:25,629
Nick had ignored my direct order,

536
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:29,132
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

537
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,969
and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,

538
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,345
including my daughter.

539
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,138
So you gave him a promotion.

540
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,890
I've never had any cause to regret it.

541
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,144
Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?

542
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,316
I don't know.

543
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:48,944
Did you know it was bugged?

544
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,155
I did, because Nick told me.

545
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,117
Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?

546
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,083
I want you to see something.

547
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,210
Who hired you, Batroc?

548
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:06,503
Is that live?

549
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,299
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

550
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,553
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

551
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,556
No, no. It's more complicated than that.

552
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,350
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

553
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:24,021
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

554
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,650
and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.

555
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,069
The last one going to
a holding company

556
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,488
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

557
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,990
Am I supposed to know who that is?

558
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,201
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

559
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:40,329
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

560
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:44,374
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

561
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:49,338
Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?

562
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,507
The prevailing theory

563
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,385
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

564
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,971
and sale of classified intelligence.

565
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,559
The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.

566
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:08,524
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

567
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:11,860
Why do you think we're talking?

568
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,033
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

569
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,995
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

570
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:27,751
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

571
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,963
to build a really better world

572
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,883
sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.

573
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,554
And that makes enemies.

574
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,725
Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts

575
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,687
to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.

576
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,774
And the idea that those people
could be happy today

577
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,653
makes me really, really angry.

578
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:00,951
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

579
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,036
I don't think that's an accident.

580
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,205
And I don't think you do, either.

581
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:09,251
So, I'm gonna ask again.

582
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,461
Why was he there?

583
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,633
He told me not to trust anyone.

584
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:21,138
I wonder if that included him.

585
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,186
I'm sorry.

586
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,645
Those were his last words.

587
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:31,481
Excuse me.

588
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,403
Captain,

589
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,615
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

590
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,076
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

591
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,829
Anyone.

592
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,167
Understood.

593
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,144
Operations Control.

594
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:10,687
Confirmed.

595
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:14,358
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

596
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,776
-Understood.
-Yes, sir.

597
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:17,194
-Forensics.
-Confirmed.

598
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,529
Cap.

599
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:19,905
Rumlow.

600
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,251
Evidence Response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see.

601
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,044
You want me to get the tac team ready?

602
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:35,754
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

603
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,047
Right.

604
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,561
What's the status so far?

605
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,397
-Administrations level.
-Confirmed.

606
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:55,399
Excuse me.

607
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,909
I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.

608
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:08,078
It's messed up, what happened to him.

609
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,621
Thank you.

610
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:29,600
Records.

611
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:30,934
Confirmed.

612
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:48,619
Before we get started,

613
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:51,330
does anyone want to get out?

614
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,282
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

615
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:43,882
Whoa, big guy.

616
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:47,678
I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!

617
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:00,607
It kind of feels personal.

618
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,577
Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!

619
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,762
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

620
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:32,639
You have nowhere to go!

621
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,577
Are you kidding me?

622
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,746
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

623
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:10,385
Stand down, Captain Rogers.
Stand down.

624
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,013
Repeat, stand down.

625
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,009
Eyes here.

626
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:53,303
Whatever your op is, bury it.

627
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:54,555
This is Level One.

628
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:56,807
Contact DOT.

629
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:58,517
All traffic lights in the district go red.

630
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:01,144
Shut all runways at BWI,

631
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:03,230
IAD and Reagan.

632
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:06,024
All security cameras in the city
go through this monitor right here.

633
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,318
Scan all open sources,

634
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,279
phones, computers,

635
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:11,864
PDAs. Whatever.

636
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,907
If someone tweets about this guy,

637
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,158
I want to know about it.

638
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,411
With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

639
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,330
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

640
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:22,291
Because he lied to us.

641
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:27,421
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

642
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:29,506
He refused to share it.

643
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,676
As difficult as this is to accept,

644
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:37,055
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

645
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,709
-Where is it?
-Safe.

646
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,503
-Do better.
-Where did you get it?

647
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:08,962
Why would I tell you?

648
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,215
Fury gave it to you. Why?

649
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:12,799
-What's on it?
-I don't know.

650
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,009
Stop lying.

651
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,636
I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.

652
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:18,597
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

653
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:23,060
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

654
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,478
I'm not gonna ask you again.

655
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:27,564
I know who killed Fury.

656
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,987
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

657
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,032
The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.

658
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,243
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

659
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,328
in the last 50 years.

660
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,288
So he's a ghost story.

661
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:46,750
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

662
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:49,253
Somebody shot out
my tires near Odessa.

663
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,713
We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.

664
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,215
I pulled us out.

665
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,259
But the Winter Soldier was there.

666
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,303
I was covering my engineer
so he shot him

667
00:52:58,637 --> 00:52:59,680
straight through me.

668
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,598
Soviet slug.

669
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,768
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

670
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,146
Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.

671
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,443
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

672
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,822
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

673
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:23,620
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

674
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,956
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

675
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:27,875
To any reasonable person,

676
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,586
that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.

677
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,004
You know what makes him a traitor?

678
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:34,506
Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.

679
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:37,009
Nick Fury used your friendship

680
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,262
to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.

681
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,681
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

682
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,976
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

683
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,478
Are you calling for my resignation?

684
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,063
I've got a pen and paper right here.

685
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:52,816
That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.

686
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,527
But you do want to have a discussion?

687
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,654
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

688
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:03,118
This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.

689
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,748
If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.

690
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:17,174
First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.

691
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,260
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

692
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,682
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

693
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,809
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

694
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:28,936
How much time will we have?

695
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,605
About nine minutes from

696
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,274
now.

697
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:41,198
Fury was right about that ship.

698
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:43,534
Somebody's trying to hide something.

699
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,702
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

700
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:48,288
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

701
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:50,082
Can you override it?

702
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,835
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

703
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:54,628
Slightly.

704
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:06,682
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

705
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,393
This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

706
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,936
to track hostile malware,

707
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:13,897
so if we can't read the file,

708
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:15,732
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

709
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,276
Can I help you guys with anything?

710
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:21,697
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

711
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,824
Right. We're getting married.

712
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,742
Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?

713
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:29,288
New Jersey.

714
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:35,919
I have the exact same glasses.

715
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:38,505
Wow, you two are practically twins.

716
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:40,174
Yeah, I wish.

717
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:41,675
Specimen.

718
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,428
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

719
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,512
Thank you.

720
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,309
-You said nine minutes. Come on.
-Relax.

721
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:52,644
Got it.

722
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:57,941
You know it?

723
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,568
I used to. Let's go.

724
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:02,946
Standard tac team.

725
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:04,448
Two behind, two across,

726
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,283
and two coming straight at us.

727
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,161
If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.

728
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,288
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

729
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:12,748
-What?
-Do it.

730
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:22,007
Negative at the source.

731
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:23,175
Give me a floor rundown.

732
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,843
Negative on three.

733
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:26,303
Negative on two.

734
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,847
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

735
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:37,898
-Kiss me.
-What?

736
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,108
Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.

737
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,443
Yes, they do.

738
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,496
You still uncomfortable?

739
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:54,915
It's not exactly the word I would use.

740
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,176
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

741
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:08,679
Nazi Germany.

742
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:11,139
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

743
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:18,939
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

744
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:20,524
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

745
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:21,942
-you're kind of answering it, you know.
-What?

746
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,653
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

747
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:26,572
-That bad, huh?
-I didn't say that.

748
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,365
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

749
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,575
No, I didn't.

750
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:31,535
I just wondered
how much practice you've had.

751
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,370
-You don't need practice.
-Everybody needs practice.

752
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,831
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

753
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:37,916
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

754
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,043
Nobody special, though?

755
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:43,380
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

756
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,757
to find someone with
shared life experience.

757
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,384
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

758
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,803
-What, like you?
-I don't know.

759
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:51,096
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

760
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,640
It's not all things to all people,
all the time.

761
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:55,976
Neither am I.

762
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:57,978
That's a tough way to live.

763
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:01,231
It's a good way not to die, though.

764
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:03,567
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,

765
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:05,235
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

766
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:07,404
Yeah.

767
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:11,742
Who do you want me to be?

768
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:13,702
How about a friend?

769
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:21,251
Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.

770
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,393
This is it.

771
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,563
The file came from these coordinates.

772
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:44,066
So did I.

773
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:53,700
This camp is where I was trained.

774
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:57,829
Change much?

775
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,750
A little.

776
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,086
Pick up the pace, ladies!

777
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:05,879
Let's go! Let's go!

778
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:07,965
Double time!

779
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:11,260
Come on, Rogers, move it!

780
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:16,598
Come on, fall in!

781
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:18,684
Rogers!

782
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:20,352
I said fall in!

783
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:23,856
This is a dead end.

784
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:26,817
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

785
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:31,113
Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.

786
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,074
What is it?

787
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,076
Army regulations
forbid storing munitions

788
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:38,161
within 500 yards of the barracks.

789
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:40,998
This building is in the wrong place.

790
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,223
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

791
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,018
Maybe where it started.

792
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,829
And there's Stark's father.

793
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,789
Howard.

794
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:25,375
Who's the girl?

795
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:47,064
If you're already working
in a secret office,

796
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,243
why do you need to hide the elevator?

797
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:54,673
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

798
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,663
Y-E-S spells yes.

799
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,669
Shall we play a game?

800
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:35,672
-It's from a movie that was really...
-I know, I saw it.

801
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:43,847
Rogers, Steven,

802
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,600
born 1918.

803
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,481
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,

804
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,525
born 1984.

805
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,026
It's some kind of recording.

806
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,612
I am not a recording, Fräulein.

807
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:00,989
I may not be the man I was

808
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,451
when the Captain took me
prisoner in 1945.

809
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:06,537
But I am.

810
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:09,831
You know this thing?

811
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:16,213
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

812
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,673
He's been dead for years.

813
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,175
First correction, I am Swiss.

814
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:22,928
Second, look around you.

815
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,722
I have never been more alive.

816
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,561
In 1972,
I received a terminal diagnosis.

817
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,564
Science could not save my body.

818
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:37,985
My mind, however,
that was worth saving,

819
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:41,905
on 200,000 feet of databanks.

820
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:45,742
You are standing in my brain.

821
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,120
-How did you get here?
-Invited.

822
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,998
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

823
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:54,793
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited
German scientists with strategic value.

824
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:57,129
They thought I could help their cause.

825
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:59,214
I also helped my own.

826
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:00,924
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

827
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:05,012
Cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.

828
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:06,847
Prove it.

829
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,100
Accessing archive.

830
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:13,979
HYDRA was founded on
the belief that humanity

831
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:17,357
could not be trusted
with its own freedom.

832
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:20,235
What we did not realize was
that if you try

833
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:23,238
to take that freedom, they resist.

834
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:25,616
The war taught us much.

835
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:29,536
Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.

836
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:33,415
After the war,
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,

837
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:35,709
and I was recruited.

838
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,128
The new HYDRA grew.

839
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:42,633
A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

840
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,676
For 70 years,

841
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:50,474
HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,

842
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,352
and when history did not cooperate,

843
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,854
history was changed.

844
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:58,357
That's impossible.
S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

845
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:01,318
Accidents will happen.

846
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:05,739
HYDRA created a world so chaotic

847
01:05:05,948 --> 01:05:09,785
that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom

848
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,120
to gain its security.

849
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:16,166
Once a purification process
is complete,

850
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,087
HYDRA's new world order will arise.

851
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,881
We won, Captain.

852
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,552
Your death amounts to
the same as your life.

853
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,136
A zero sum.

854
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,642
As I was saying...

855
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:35,519
What's on this drive?

856
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:39,022
Project Insight requires insight.

857
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:42,025
So, I wrote an algorithm.

858
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,694
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

859
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:46,280
The answer to your question
is fascinating.

860
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:50,784
Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.

861
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,041
Steve, we got a bogey.

862
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,043
Short range ballistic.

863
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:02,045
-30 seconds tops.
-Who fired it?

864
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,130
S.H.I.E.L.D.

865
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:07,050
I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.

866
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:08,594
Admit it.

867
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:11,054
It's better this way.

868
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:12,598
We are, both of us,

869
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,225
out of time.

870
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:40,143
Call in the asset.

871
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:57,786
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

872
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:00,122
You need anything before I leave?

873
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:04,168
No... It's fine, Renata, you can go home.

874
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,503
Okay. Night-night.

875
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,380
Good night.

876
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,928
Want some milk?

877
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,356
The timetable has moved.

878
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:30,277
Our window is limited.

879
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:36,408
Two targets, Level Six.

880
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,120
They already cost me Zola.

881
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:42,538
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

882
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,585
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

883
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:48,377
I forgot my

884
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:49,712
phone.

885
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,888
Renata, I wish you would have knocked.

886
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:23,580
Hey, man.

887
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:27,167
I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.

888
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:28,961
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

889
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:33,423
Not everyone.

890
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,109
-You okay?
-Yeah.

891
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,494
What's going on?

892
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:09,209
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

893
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,966
But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.

894
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:23,932
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

895
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:30,480
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

896
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:33,442
There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.

897
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:39,823
I owe you.

898
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:42,367
It's okay.

899
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:45,162
If it was the other way around,

900
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:47,831
and it was down to me to save your life,

901
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,583
now you be honest with me,

902
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:53,629
would you trust me to do it?

903
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:56,798
I would now.

904
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:01,553
And I'm always honest.

905
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,014
Well, you seem pretty chipper

906
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:05,933
for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.

907
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,521
Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.

908
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:12,356
I made breakfast.

909
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,984
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

910
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:18,904
So, the question is,

911
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,073
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

912
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,201
Pierce.

913
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,079
Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.

914
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:28,455
But he's not working alone.

915
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:30,916
Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.

916
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,585
So was Jasper Sitwell.

917
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:39,550
So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people

918
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,719
in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

919
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,389
The answer is, you don't.

920
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,100
-What's this?
-Call it a résumé.

921
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,355
Is this Bakhmala?

922
01:11:53,564 --> 01:11:54,940
The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?

923
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:58,068
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

924
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:01,989
-Is this Riley?
-Yeah.

925
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,408
I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.

926
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:05,868
What did you use? A stealth chute?

927
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:06,952
No.

928
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:09,162
These.

929
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:15,377
I thought you said you were a pilot.

930
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,004
I never said pilot.

931
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,759
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

932
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,761
You got out for a good reason.

933
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,513
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

934
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:28,265
There's no better reason to get back in.

935
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,687
Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?

936
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,022
The last one is at Fort Meade.

937
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:38,567
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

938
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:42,738
Shouldn't be a problem.

939
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:46,033
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

940
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,994
because I got
some constituency problem

941
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,121
and I got to press the flesh.

942
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:53,624
Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?

943
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,584
No, not really.

944
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,462
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

945
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,214
Real hot, you know?

946
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:02,549
Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.

947
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:03,759
Who listens at that point?

948
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,594
Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.

949
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,846
Really? Because she's killing my back.

950
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:10,599
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

951
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:11,808
This is a nice pin.

952
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:15,187
-Thank you.
-Come here.

953
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,397
Hail HYDRA.

954
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,402
-See, it's right there...
-Yeah, I just saw that.

955
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,821
-Should I get it checked?
-I think you should.

956
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:34,790
I need a minute.

957
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,667
Bring the car around.

958
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:41,463
Yes, sir?

959
01:13:41,505 --> 01:13:43,173
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?

960
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:46,009
I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.

961
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,177
Who is this?

962
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:50,013
The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o' clock.

963
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,225
Your other 10 o' clock.

964
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,103
There you go.

965
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,482
What do you want?

966
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:02,484
You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.

967
01:14:02,693 --> 01:14:05,195
There's a gray car two spaces down.

968
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,197
You and I are gonna take a ride.

969
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:09,116
And why would I do that?

970
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:11,869
Because that tie looks really expensive,

971
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:14,329
and I'd hate to mess it up.

972
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:25,132
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

973
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:27,259
Never heard of it.

974
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:28,385
What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?

975
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,137
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

976
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:38,562
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

977
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,064
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

978
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:43,358
You're right.

979
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:45,235
It's not.

980
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:46,778
It's hers.

981
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,285
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

982
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:55,704
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

983
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:56,955
Yeah, she's cute.

984
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:58,540
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

985
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:12,429
Zola's algorithm is a program

986
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,265
for choosing

987
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:16,975
-Insight's targets.
-What targets?

988
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:18,435
You!

989
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:21,813
A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defense,

990
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:24,441
a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,

991
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:26,610
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

992
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:28,612
to HYDRA.

993
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,572
Now, or in the future.

994
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,616
In the future? How could it know?

995
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:37,287
How could it not?

996
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:42,709
The 21st century is a digital book.

997
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:45,879
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

998
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:49,967
Your bank records,

999
01:15:50,384 --> 01:15:51,802
medical histories, voting patterns,

1000
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:54,388
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1001
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:59,309
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1002
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,436
to predict their future.

1003
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:02,813
And what then?

1004
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,985
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1005
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,653
What then?

1006
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,325
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1007
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:19,371
A few million at a time.

1008
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:28,088
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1009
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:29,965
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1010
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:31,425
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1011
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:32,676
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1012
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,761
I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1013
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,346
and access the helicarriers directly.

1014
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:37,598
What? Are you crazy?

1015
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,225
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1016
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:25,103
Shit!

1017
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:37,908
Hang on!

1018
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,220
I have her. Find him.

1019
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:27,494
Go! I got this!

1020
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,203
Taking fire above
and below expressway.

1021
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:11,830
Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.

1022
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:18,712
I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.

1023
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:19,963
Rendezvous, two minutes.

1024
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:46,448
Get out of the way!

1025
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,617
Stay out of the way!

1026
01:23:35,641 --> 01:23:36,683
Bucky?

1027
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,685
Who the hell is Bucky?

1028
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:08,882
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1029
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,509
Get on your knees!

1030
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:13,303
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1031
01:24:13,387 --> 01:24:14,513
Down!

1032
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,056
Don't move.

1033
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:24,314
Put the gun down.

1034
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:26,483
Not here. Not here!

1035
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:43,000
It was him.

1036
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:49,756
He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.

1037
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,010
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1038
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:54,428
Zola.

1039
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,221
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1040
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:58,307
Zola experimented on him.

1041
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:00,767
Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.

1042
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:03,812
They must have found him and...

1043
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:05,772
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1044
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,153
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1045
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:16,200
We need to get a doctor here.

1046
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:17,367
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1047
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:18,869
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1048
01:25:27,085 --> 01:25:29,588
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1049
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:33,759
Who is this guy?

1050
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:46,563
Three holes. Start digging.

1051
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:15,592
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1052
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:17,010
Maybe two.

1053
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:19,221
-Let me take her.
-She'll want to see him first.

1054
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:31,316
About damn time.

1055
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,945
Lacerated spinal column,

1056
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:36,905
cracked sternum,

1057
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:38,574
shattered collarbone,

1058
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,367
perforated liver,

1059
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:42,286
and one hell of a headache.

1060
01:26:42,536 --> 01:26:43,912
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1061
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:45,414
Let's not forget that.

1062
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:47,249
Otherwise, I'm good.

1063
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,751
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1064
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,962
Tetrodotoxin B.

1065
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:54,131
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1066
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:56,133
Banner developed it for stress.

1067
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:58,969
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1068
01:26:59,136 --> 01:27:01,013
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1069
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:03,473
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1070
01:27:03,974 --> 01:27:06,185
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1071
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:07,644
Besides,

1072
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:10,397
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1073
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:27,289
Sergeant Barnes.

1074
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:30,459
Bucky, no!

1075
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:37,216
The procedure has already started.

1076
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:44,806
You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

1077
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:46,183
Put him on ice.

1078
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,570
Sir.

1079
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:00,822
He's unstable.

1080
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:02,699
Erratic.

1081
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:17,047
Mission report.

1082
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:21,885
Mission report now.

1083
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,108
The man on the bridge.

1084
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:40,487
Who was he?

1085
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:44,157
You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.

1086
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:48,579
I knew him.

1087
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,840
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1088
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,510
You shaped the century.

1089
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:06,722
And I need you to do it one more time.

1090
01:29:07,973 --> 01:29:11,643
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1091
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:14,521
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1092
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:18,859
But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.

1093
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:23,405
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1094
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:27,993
But I knew him.

1095
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:36,084
Prep him.

1096
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:38,837
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1097
01:29:39,046 --> 01:29:41,048
Then wipe him and start over.

1098
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:26,343
This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1099
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:30,347
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1100
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:32,891
it was a responsibility.

1101
01:30:33,892 --> 01:30:37,187
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1102
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:39,189
We have to stop the launch.

1103
01:30:40,148 --> 01:30:42,860
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

1104
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:46,446
What's that?

1105
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:49,533
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1106
01:30:49,575 --> 01:30:52,911
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponized.

1107
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:55,330
We need to breach those carriers

1108
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:58,041
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1109
01:30:58,166 --> 01:30:59,126
One or two won't cut it.

1110
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:01,879
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1111
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:05,382
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1112
01:31:05,591 --> 01:31:07,384
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1113
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:10,762
We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.

1114
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:13,223
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1115
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,518
And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...

1116
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:17,728
We're not salvaging anything.

1117
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:19,188
We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.

1118
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:20,397
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1119
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,773
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1120
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:24,193
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1121
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:26,320
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1122
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:28,322
HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.

1123
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:31,700
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1124
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:33,744
How many paid the price
before you did?

1125
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:38,540
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1126
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:40,083
Even if you had,
would you have told me?

1127
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:43,545
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?

1128
01:31:43,754 --> 01:31:46,548
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1129
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:48,008
it all goes.

1130
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:49,760
He's right.

1131
01:31:55,516 --> 01:31:56,600
Don't look at me.

1132
01:31:56,767 --> 01:31:58,644
I do what he does, just slower.

1133
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:04,024
Well...

1134
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,699
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1135
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:25,796
We looked for you, after.

1136
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:29,132
My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.

1137
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:32,886
I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1138
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:35,389
How was it?

1139
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,349
It was okay.

1140
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:39,726
She's next to Dad.

1141
01:32:41,228 --> 01:32:42,479
I was gonna ask...

1142
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:44,356
I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...

1143
01:32:45,524 --> 01:32:47,025
We can put the
couch cushions on the floor

1144
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:48,777
like when we were kids.

1145
01:32:49,444 --> 01:32:51,947
It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1146
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:53,991
maybe take out the trash.

1147
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:00,497
Come on.

1148
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,920
Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.

1149
01:33:07,713 --> 01:33:11,508
The thing is, you don't have to.

1150
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:16,430
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1151
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:21,143
He's gonna be there, you know.

1152
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:22,227
I know.

1153
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:26,440
Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,

1154
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:29,318
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1155
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,944
He's the kind you stop.

1156
01:33:33,614 --> 01:33:35,199
I don't know if I can do that.

1157
01:33:35,532 --> 01:33:37,534
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1158
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:39,203
He doesn't know you.

1159
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:40,913
He will.

1160
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,000
Gear up. It's time.

1161
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,712
You gonna wear that?

1162
01:33:49,004 --> 01:33:52,382
No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.

1163
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,725
Oh, man.

1164
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:04,561
I am so fired.

1165
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:31,755
We are in final launch sequence.

1166
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,259
We are go on guidance.

1167
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:39,304
All personnel to launch stations.

1168
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:41,265
And how was your flight?

1169
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:42,516
Lovely.

1170
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:45,102
The ride from the airport, less so.

1171
01:34:45,227 --> 01:34:47,688
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1172
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:49,773
Including Captain America.

1173
01:34:53,235 --> 01:34:55,779
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1174
01:34:55,988 --> 01:34:58,907
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1175
01:35:02,828 --> 01:35:03,996
I've been parking there for two months.

1176
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:05,789
-But it's his spot.
-So where's he been?

1177
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:07,291
I think Afghanistan.

1178
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:09,334
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1179
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:10,836
Well, he could've said something.

1180
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:13,797
Must be the dish.

1181
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:17,259
I'll check it out.

1182
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:21,054
Triskelion command request
we clear the area for launch.

1183
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:25,726
Excuse us.

1184
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:28,270
I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,

1185
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:32,065
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1186
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:35,319
Finally, we're here.

1187
01:35:36,028 --> 01:35:37,988
And the world should be grateful.

1188
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:40,657
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

1189
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:42,618
this is Steve Rogers.

1190
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:46,622
You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.

1191
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:49,875
Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.

1192
01:35:50,626 --> 01:35:53,504
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1193
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:58,800
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1194
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:00,677
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1195
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:03,514
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1196
01:36:07,643 --> 01:36:09,978
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.

1197
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:11,188
I don't know how many more,

1198
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:13,524
but I know they're in the building.

1199
01:36:15,317 --> 01:36:17,194
They could be standing
right next to you.

1200
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,405
They almost have what they want.

1201
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:23,283
Absolute control.

1202
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:25,160
They shot Nick Fury.

1203
01:36:26,245 --> 01:36:27,371
And it won't end there.

1204
01:36:27,913 --> 01:36:30,123
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1205
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:32,292
HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.

1206
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:36,964
Unless we stop them.

1207
01:36:40,968 --> 01:36:42,094
I know I'm asking a lot.

1208
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:47,224
But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.

1209
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:49,810
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1210
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:54,982
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1211
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:58,402
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1212
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:06,410
Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?

1213
01:37:06,994 --> 01:37:08,620
You smug son of a bitch.

1214
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:13,750
Arrest him.

1215
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:18,255
I guess I've got the floor.

1216
01:37:25,095 --> 01:37:28,015
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1217
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:33,937
Is there a problem?

1218
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:40,027
Is there a problem?

1219
01:37:40,235 --> 01:37:41,278
I'm sorry, sir.

1220
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:52,206
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1221
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,251
Captain's orders.

1222
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,669
Move away from your station.

1223
01:37:58,086 --> 01:37:59,129
Like he said...

1224
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,339
Hold it right there.

1225
01:38:00,422 --> 01:38:01,757
Put the gun down!

1226
01:38:01,924 --> 01:38:02,925
Captain's orders.

1227
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:06,762
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1228
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:10,182
Depends on where you're standing.

1229
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,019
Close the bay door!

1230
01:38:56,228 --> 01:38:57,437
Close the bay door now!

1231
01:38:57,938 --> 01:38:58,897
Close the bay door!

1232
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,002
They're initiating launch.

1233
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,774
Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?

1234
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:44,443
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1235
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:18,810
Hey, Cap,

1236
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:21,063
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1237
01:40:21,104 --> 01:40:22,105
You okay?

1238
01:40:24,274 --> 01:40:25,776
I'm not dead yet.

1239
01:40:32,783 --> 01:40:34,493
Let me ask you a question.

1240
01:40:36,995 --> 01:40:40,123
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1241
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,585
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1242
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:46,547
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1243
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:52,302
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1244
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:53,679
Wouldn't you?

1245
01:40:53,887 --> 01:40:55,514
Wouldn't you all?

1246
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:58,892
Not if it was your switch.

1247
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:24,668
I'm sorry.

1248
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:32,634
Did I step on your moment?

1249
01:41:34,178 --> 01:41:36,471
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1250
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:38,557
Falcon, status?

1251
01:41:38,849 --> 01:41:40,017
Engaging.

1252
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:05,375
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1253
01:42:07,753 --> 01:42:08,795
Oh, shit.

1254
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:40,786
Eight minutes, Cap.

1255
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:42,704
Working on it.

1256
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:52,089
What are you doing?

1257
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,757
She's disabling security protocols

1258
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:55,592
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1259
01:42:55,759 --> 01:42:57,386
-Including HYDRA's.
-And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1260
01:42:58,679 --> 01:42:59,763
If you do this,

1261
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:01,682
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1262
01:43:04,768 --> 01:43:07,271
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1263
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:09,022
as you really are?

1264
01:43:09,773 --> 01:43:11,191
Are you?

1265
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:28,500
Alpha lock.

1266
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:31,962
Falcon, where are you now?

1267
01:43:32,129 --> 01:43:33,005
I had to take a detour.

1268
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:07,206
Oh, yeah!

1269
01:44:13,212 --> 01:44:14,296
I'm in.

1270
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:19,718
Bravo lock.

1271
01:44:21,512 --> 01:44:22,846
Two down, one to go.

1272
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,600
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1273
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:30,103
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1274
01:45:12,563 --> 01:45:15,232
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1275
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,109
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1276
01:45:17,317 --> 01:45:19,278
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1277
01:45:42,926 --> 01:45:44,052
Did you get my flowers?

1278
01:45:46,763 --> 01:45:48,432
-I'm glad you're here, Nick.
-Really?

1279
01:45:50,392 --> 01:45:52,269
Because I thought you had me killed.

1280
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:53,937
You know how the game works.

1281
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,690
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1282
01:45:56,773 --> 01:45:58,108
Because you were the best,

1283
01:45:58,275 --> 01:45:59,735
and the most ruthless person
I ever met.

1284
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:02,279
I did what I did to protect people.

1285
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:05,115
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1286
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:08,368
Disorder. War.

1287
01:46:09,369 --> 01:46:11,705
It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1288
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:14,082
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1289
01:46:15,626 --> 01:46:17,044
Diplomacy?

1290
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:19,546
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1291
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:23,425
And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.

1292
01:46:25,135 --> 01:46:27,846
You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.

1293
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:33,352
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1294
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:35,687
by sacrificing 20 million.

1295
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:39,191
It's the next step, Nick.

1296
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:40,526
If you have the courage to take it.

1297
01:46:40,734 --> 01:46:42,819
No. I have the courage not to.

1298
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:49,243
Retinal scanner active.

1299
01:46:50,702 --> 01:46:53,080
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1300
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:55,207
I know you erased my password.

1301
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:57,334
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1302
01:46:57,876 --> 01:47:00,712
But if you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,

1303
01:47:04,716 --> 01:47:07,678
you need to keep both eyes open.

1304
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,600
Alpha level confirmed.

1305
01:47:14,142 --> 01:47:15,936
Encryption code accepted.

1306
01:47:16,144 --> 01:47:17,271
Safeguards removed.

1307
01:47:17,688 --> 01:47:20,691
Charlie carrier is
45 degrees off the port bow.

1308
01:47:26,363 --> 01:47:27,447
Six minutes.

1309
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:30,075
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1310
01:47:30,951 --> 01:47:32,619
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1311
01:47:35,247 --> 01:47:36,456
I just did!

1312
01:47:54,224 --> 01:47:56,143
You know, you're a lot heavier
than you look.

1313
01:47:56,351 --> 01:47:57,436
I had a big breakfast.

1314
01:48:00,063 --> 01:48:01,398
Steve!

1315
01:48:31,845 --> 01:48:33,263
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1316
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:35,098
Yeah, I'm here.

1317
01:48:35,641 --> 01:48:36,683
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1318
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:39,394
-Where are you?
-I'm grounded.

1319
01:48:39,978 --> 01:48:42,314
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1320
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:45,025
Don't worry. I got it.

1321
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:48,570
Emergency evacuation alert.

1322
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:51,740
All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.

1323
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:55,202
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1324
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:03,001
Sir, the Council's been breached.

1325
01:49:03,335 --> 01:49:05,712
-Repeat, Dispatch.
-Black Widow's up there.

1326
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:07,297
Headed up.

1327
01:49:09,466 --> 01:49:10,759
-Falcon?
-Yeah.

1328
01:49:10,926 --> 01:49:12,135
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1329
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:13,178
I'm on it.

1330
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:25,524
People are gonna die, Buck.

1331
01:49:27,651 --> 01:49:29,152
I can't let that happen.

1332
01:49:37,578 --> 01:49:38,954
Please don't make me do this.

1333
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:49,942
Done.

1334
01:50:51,193 --> 01:50:52,194
And it's trending.

1335
01:50:59,826 --> 01:51:01,703
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1336
01:51:01,745 --> 01:51:02,871
I'd put that gun down.

1337
01:51:05,582 --> 01:51:07,543
That was armed the moment
you pinned it on.

1338
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:42,452
Drop it!

1339
01:51:43,036 --> 01:51:44,079
Drop it!

1340
01:52:04,558 --> 01:52:07,811
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1341
01:52:14,526 --> 01:52:16,153
This is gonna hurt.

1342
01:52:17,404 --> 01:52:20,490
There are no prisoners with HYDRA.
Just order.

1343
01:52:20,699 --> 01:52:22,910
And order only comes through pain.

1344
01:52:24,328 --> 01:52:26,705
-You ready for yours?
-Man, shut the hell up.

1345
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:29,875
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1346
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:32,002
65 seconds to satellite link.

1347
01:52:32,085 --> 01:52:35,088
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1348
01:52:39,092 --> 01:52:40,177
One minute.

1349
01:53:00,072 --> 01:53:01,657
30 seconds, Cap.

1350
01:53:03,242 --> 01:53:04,409
Stand by.

1351
01:53:07,496 --> 01:53:09,081
Charlie...

1352
01:53:18,382 --> 01:53:19,675
We've reached 3,000 feet.

1353
01:53:20,717 --> 01:53:21,718
Sat link coming online now.

1354
01:53:24,221 --> 01:53:25,305
Deploy algorithm.

1355
01:53:27,015 --> 01:53:28,100
Algorithm deployed.

1356
01:53:29,393 --> 01:53:30,853
We are go to target.

1357
01:53:49,913 --> 01:53:51,248
Target saturation reached.

1358
01:53:51,665 --> 01:53:52,666
All targets assigned.

1359
01:53:52,749 --> 01:53:53,750
Fire when ready.

1360
01:53:56,253 --> 01:53:57,421
Firing in...

1361
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:58,630
Three,

1362
01:53:58,922 --> 01:53:59,965
two...

1363
01:54:01,133 --> 01:54:02,509
One.

1364
01:54:05,137 --> 01:54:06,221
Charlie lock.

1365
01:54:06,638 --> 01:54:07,639
Where are the targets?

1366
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:10,184
Where are the targets?

1367
01:54:10,767 --> 01:54:12,019
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1368
01:54:29,453 --> 01:54:30,454
Fire now.

1369
01:54:31,496 --> 01:54:32,789
-But, Steve...
-Do it!

1370
01:54:33,498 --> 01:54:34,708
Do it now!

1371
01:55:05,197 --> 01:55:06,198
What a waste.

1372
01:55:06,406 --> 01:55:09,618
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1373
01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:12,829
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way.
Come on.

1374
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:14,831
You're going to fly me out of here.

1375
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,252
You know, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1376
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,711
You already did.

1377
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,839
You will again, when it's useful.

1378
01:55:35,185 --> 01:55:36,353
Romanoff.

1379
01:55:37,062 --> 01:55:38,188
Natasha.

1380
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,025
Natasha! Come on!

1381
01:55:49,032 --> 01:55:50,576
Those really do sting.

1382
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,068
Hail HYDRA.

1383
01:57:20,499 --> 01:57:21,959
You're out of your depth, kid.

1384
01:57:25,671 --> 01:57:27,172
Son of a bitch!

1385
01:57:39,309 --> 01:57:40,936
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1386
01:57:41,728 --> 01:57:42,813
Sam, where are you?

1387
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:45,566
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1388
01:57:45,774 --> 01:57:47,317
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1389
01:57:47,484 --> 01:57:48,610
Not an option!

1390
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:05,586
41st floor! 41st!

1391
01:58:05,878 --> 01:58:09,256
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1392
01:58:10,632 --> 01:58:13,135
Hill! Where's Steve?
You got a location on Rogers?

1393
01:58:29,568 --> 01:58:30,694
You know me.

1394
01:58:32,446 --> 01:58:33,739
No, I don't!

1395
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:44,583
Bucky.

1396
01:58:46,084 --> 01:58:47,544
You've known me your whole life.

1397
01:58:55,093 --> 01:58:59,056
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1398
01:58:59,223 --> 01:59:00,474
Shut up!

1399
01:59:09,191 --> 01:59:10,651
I'm not gonna fight you.

1400
01:59:14,655 --> 01:59:15,948
You're my friend.

1401
01:59:22,955 --> 01:59:24,373
You're my mission.

1402
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:28,627
You're my mission!

1403
01:59:32,005 --> 01:59:33,006
Then finish it.

1404
01:59:36,468 --> 01:59:38,637
Because I'm with you
to the end of the line.

1405
02:01:50,352 --> 02:01:51,687
On your left.

1406
02:02:42,696 --> 02:02:45,073
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1407
02:02:45,282 --> 02:02:46,366
and nothing but the truth?

1408
02:02:46,575 --> 02:02:47,951
I do.

1409
02:02:49,953 --> 02:02:51,663
Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?

1410
02:02:54,416 --> 02:02:56,293
I don't know what there is
left for him to say.

1411
02:02:56,502 --> 02:02:58,378
I think the wreck in
the middle of the Potomac

1412
02:02:58,587 --> 02:02:59,755
made his point fairly eloquently.

1413
02:02:59,963 --> 02:03:00,923
Well, he could explain how

1414
02:03:01,131 --> 02:03:03,675
this country is expected to maintain
its national security

1415
02:03:03,884 --> 02:03:07,971
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1416
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:10,349
HYDRA was selling you lies,
not intelligence.

1417
02:03:10,557 --> 02:03:13,435
Many of which you seemed to have had
a personal hand in telling.

1418
02:03:13,644 --> 02:03:14,853
Agent, you should know

1419
02:03:15,062 --> 02:03:16,730
that there are some on this committee

1420
02:03:16,939 --> 02:03:19,024
who feel, given your service record,

1421
02:03:19,233 --> 02:03:20,984
both for this country and against it,

1422
02:03:21,735 --> 02:03:23,487
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1423
02:03:23,654 --> 02:03:25,656
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1424
02:03:27,574 --> 02:03:29,159
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1425
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:34,039
You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?

1426
02:03:35,499 --> 02:03:36,875
Do enlighten us.

1427
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:38,502
Because you need us.

1428
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:41,922
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,

1429
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:44,299
and yes, we help make it that way.

1430
02:03:44,842 --> 02:03:47,594
But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.

1431
02:03:49,263 --> 02:03:51,181
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1432
02:03:52,266 --> 02:03:53,934
You'll know where to find me.

1433
02:04:29,386 --> 02:04:32,222
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1434
02:04:32,723 --> 02:04:34,308
You get used to it.

1435
02:04:37,019 --> 02:04:39,188
We've been data mining HYDRA's files.

1436
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:41,523
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1437
02:04:43,066 --> 02:04:44,401
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1438
02:04:45,402 --> 02:04:46,653
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1439
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:49,406
There's something I got to do first.

1440
02:04:50,365 --> 02:04:52,910
How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.

1441
02:04:53,911 --> 02:04:55,662
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1442
02:04:56,747 --> 02:04:58,540
All right, then.

1443
02:05:03,170 --> 02:05:07,382
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

1444
02:05:09,176 --> 02:05:10,761
You should be honored.
That's about as close as he gets

1445
02:05:10,928 --> 02:05:12,596
to saying thank you.

1446
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:14,806
Not going with him?

1447
02:05:15,307 --> 02:05:16,600
No.

1448
02:05:16,767 --> 02:05:18,769
-Not staying here.
-Nah.

1449
02:05:19,603 --> 02:05:21,647
I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.

1450
02:05:22,022 --> 02:05:23,023
That might take a while.

1451
02:05:23,524 --> 02:05:25,108
I'm counting on it.

1452
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:28,445
That thing you asked for,

1453
02:05:28,862 --> 02:05:31,114
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1454
02:05:34,117 --> 02:05:36,870
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

1455
02:05:37,287 --> 02:05:38,455
She's not a nurse.

1456
02:05:38,664 --> 02:05:40,499
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1457
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:43,544
-What was her name again?
-Sharon.

1458
02:05:44,294 --> 02:05:45,295
She's nice.

1459
02:05:57,766 --> 02:05:59,476
Be careful, Steve.

1460
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:02,104
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1461
02:06:13,657 --> 02:06:15,409
You're going after him.

1462
02:06:15,826 --> 02:06:17,035
You don't have to come with me.

1463
02:06:17,244 --> 02:06:18,328
I know.

1464
02:06:20,289 --> 02:06:21,456
When do we start?

1465
02:08:20,826 --> 02:08:24,454
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1466
02:08:25,163 --> 02:08:26,498
Everything he knows about.

1467
02:08:27,124 --> 02:08:28,959
Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1468
02:08:29,126 --> 02:08:30,961
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1469
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:32,838
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1470
02:08:33,839 --> 02:08:36,717
Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.

1471
02:08:40,512 --> 02:08:42,014
What we have

1472
02:08:44,099 --> 02:08:46,685
is worth more than
any of them ever knew.

1473
02:08:49,313 --> 02:08:53,066
We've only scratched
the surface and already,

1474
02:08:55,819 --> 02:08:59,656
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA's good work around the world.

1475
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:04,286
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1476
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,330
and keep them off our scent.

1477
02:09:06,496 --> 02:09:08,790
What about the volunteers?

1478
02:09:08,999 --> 02:09:10,501
The dead will be buried so deep

1479
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:12,836
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1480
02:09:14,963 --> 02:09:16,173
And the survivors?

1481
02:09:18,342 --> 02:09:19,843
The twins.

1482
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:26,517
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1483
02:09:28,685 --> 02:09:30,646
It's not a world of spies anymore.

1484
02:09:30,854 --> 02:09:32,814
Not even a world of heroes.

1485
02:09:33,815 --> 02:09:36,527
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1486
02:09:38,362 --> 02:09:40,697
There's nothing more horrifying

1487
02:09:41,532 --> 02:09:42,658
than a miracle.
