have final authority.

She killed all three of her children.

held their heads under till they died,

then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

She ate a meal there

To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

Not a trace.

161
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,984
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

162
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,863
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

163
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,161
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

164
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,879
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

165
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,966
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

166

that the truth never gets through to her?

she's in a mental institution, right?

Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

172

So, she left here barefoot?

173

That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

476
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,372
A husband.

477
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,834
Just trying to make ends meet,

478
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,504
lead a normal life.

479
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,758
It says in your file that

480
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,303
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

481
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,764
Congratulations.

482
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,767
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

483
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,230
Do you know what she was afraid of?

484
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,067
You.

485
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,402
(LOUDLY) Could you stop that? Please?

486
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,781
Stop that!

487
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,075
Please! Stop!

488
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,327
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

489
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,620
No! No.

490
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,747
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

491
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,832
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

492
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,544
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

493
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,422
PETER: Go back. I wanna go back.
TREY: Come on, Peter.

494
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,632
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

495
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,510
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

496
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,353
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

497
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,691
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

498
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,527
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

499
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,115
But you seem quite normal.

500
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,410
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

501
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:23,122
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

502
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:27,918
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

503
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:29,753
Ah.

504
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,631
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

505
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:37,553
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

506
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,057
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

507
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,810
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

508
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,520
(CHUCKLES)

509
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,983
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

510
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:55,779
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

511
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:01,201
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

512
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,871
(CHUCKLES)
I hear enough voices already.

513
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,583
What can you tell us about Rachel?

514
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,294
Um...

515
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,672
Not much. She keeps to herself.

516
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,176
She believed her kids were alive.

517
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,304
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

518
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:25,351
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

519
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,977
Deliverymen.

520
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,606
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

521
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,276
Yes. He talked about anger.

522
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,240
Tell me about him. What's he like?

523
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,744
Uh, he's, uh...

524
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,123
Okay. Nice.

525
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,919
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

526

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

527
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,175
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

528
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,638
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

529
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,349
Um...

530
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,310
(STAMMERING) Could I have
a glass of water, please?

531
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,812
No problem.

532
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,995
- Thank you, Marshal.
- CHUCK: Sure.

533
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,086
TEDDY: I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

534
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,634
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

535
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,888
No.

536
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,933
(VOICE BREAKING) Never heard of him.

537
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,023
TEDDY: <i>She was coached.</i>

538
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,193
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

539
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,697
- like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who's Andrew Laeddis?

540
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,622
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

541
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,624
(SIGHS)

542
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,921
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

543
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,882
We just met, Chuck.

544
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,886
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

545
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:28,390
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

546
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,603
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

547
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,564
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

548
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,446
When this case came over the wires,

549
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,325
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

550
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,951
Why?

551
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,914
Andrew Laeddis,

552
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,917
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

553
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,169
where my wife and I lived.

554
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,463
Okay.

555
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,342
He was also a firebug.

556
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,764
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

557
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,436
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

558
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,112
GUARD: Let them out!

559
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,118
CHUCK: What happened to Laeddis?
TEDDY:He got away with it.

560
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,621
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

561
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,707
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

562
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,295
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

563
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,840
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

564
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,052
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

565
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,887
said voices told him to do it.

566
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,598
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

567
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,892
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

568
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,729
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

569
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,190
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

570
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,567
Or he could be dead.

571
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,236
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

572
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,905
Lot of places to hide a body here.

573
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,617
Only one place
no one would really notice.

574
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,258
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

575
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,261
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

576
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
No.

577
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,682
Come on, boss.

578
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,104
She wrote it.

579
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:59,625
Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

590
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,640
So if Laeddis is here,

591
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,102
- what are you gonna do about it?
- Mmm.

592
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,147
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

593

If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.

00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,460
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

633
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,465
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

634
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:03,970
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

635
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:08,516
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

636
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,728
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

637
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,565
- And you found him.
- Yeah, I found him.

638
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:18,151
Well, he's a mess.

639
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,863
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

640
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,073
What?

641
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,200
They're experimenting on people here.

642
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,702
I don't know, boss.

643
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,248
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

644
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:36,586
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

645
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,838
I stood at Dachau.

646
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:43,760
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

647
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,429
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

648
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:51,393
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

649
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,188
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

650
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:59,693
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

651
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,028
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.

652
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,072
That's it.

653
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,366
Wait a minute.

654
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,744
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

655
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,246
waiting for a chance to get out here,

656
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,915
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

657
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,877
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

658
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,964
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

659
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,716
The world doesn't work that way.

660
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,094
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

661
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,305
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

662
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,059
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

663
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:37,731
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

664
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,816
- What if they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

665
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,027
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

666
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,611
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

667
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,573
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

668
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,824
There's no way they could've known

669
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,284
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

670
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,704
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

671
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,999
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

672
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,876
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

673
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,466
McPHERSON: (ON MEGAPHONE)
<i>Marshals, are you out here?</i>

674
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,885
<i>This is Deputy Warden McPherson.</i>

675
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,636
<i>Marshals!</i>

676
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
How about that? They found us, huh?

677
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,308
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

678
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

679
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,066
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

680
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,489
- Come on!
- Go, go!

681
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,418
McPHERSON: Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

682
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,589
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

683
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:54,099
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

684
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,976
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

685
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,523
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

686
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,274
So...

687
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,070
This is our only choice, huh?

688
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,198
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

689
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,201
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

690
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,996
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

691
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,332
be placed in manual restraints.

692
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,752
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

693
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,462
NAEHRING: That would take
a lot of flooding.

694
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:25,505
CAWLEY: We're on an island

695
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,215
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

696
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,968
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

697
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,387
DOCTOR 1 : It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

698
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,721
There's a backup generator.

699
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,516
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

700
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,311
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

701
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,398
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

702
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,482
NAEHRING: Oh, you're quite right.

703
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,735
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

704
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,573
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

705
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,783
This is 24 human beings.

706
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,743
And you can live with that, can you?

707
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,914
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B

708
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,332
in manual restraints as well.

709
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,294
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- CAWLEY: Marshal.

710
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,921
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

711
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,214
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

712
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:11,301
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

713
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,094
"The law of four." I love that.

714
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,723
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

715
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,145
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

716
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,898
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

717
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:28,818
Nothing?

718
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,827
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

719
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,371
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

720
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,917
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

721
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,586
That is correct, yes.

722
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,467
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

723
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:56,346
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

724
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,349
But I'm afraid we don't.

725
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:01,893
(CHUCKLING) This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

726
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,145
We're doing our goddamn job.

727
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,148
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

728
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,151
(SIGHS) No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

729
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,570
Rachel's been found.

730
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,989
She's here.

731
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,659
Safe and sound.

732
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,381
(SOFTLY) There's not a mark on her.

733
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,427
Who are these men?

734
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,391
(WHISPERING)
Why are they in my house?

735
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,979
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

736
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,692
Ma'am.

737
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,658
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

738
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,660
passing out literature.

739
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,663
Here?

740
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,500
In this neighborhood?

741
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
Yes, I'm afraid so.

742
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:14,299
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

743
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,509
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

744
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,387
Yes, um...

745
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,474
Well, I, um...

746
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,230
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

747
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,317
and then I

748
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,404
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

749
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,744
Then I sent the children off to school.

750
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,416
And then

751
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,585
(CHUCKLES)

752
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,884
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

753
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:05,975
I see.

754
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,230
And after that?

755
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,487
(SNIFFS) Um...

756
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,740
After that,

757
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,168
I thought of you.

758
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:42,136
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

759
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,101
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

760
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,149
You're gone.

761
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,863
You're dead.

762
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,787
I cry every night.

763
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,456
(SOBS)

764
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:16,003
How am I supposed to survive?

765
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,673
God.

766
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,353
Rachel, it'll be all right.

767
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,650
I'm so sorry, but every...

768
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,196
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

769
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,575
I buried you.

770
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,538
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

771
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,125
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

772
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,007
My Jim's dead, so who the fuck are you?

773
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,095
(SCREAMING) Who the fuck are you?

774
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,972
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

775
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,640
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

776
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,226
(SHRIEKING) Let me go! No!

777
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:16,022
- TREY: Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

778
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:17,607
(TREY SHUSHING SOOTHINGLY)

779
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,233
(THUNDER CRASHING)

780
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:22,236
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

781
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,655
I thought she might tell you something.

782
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,659
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

783
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,912
We've no idea how she got out, but...

784
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,372
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

785

01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,187
INMATE: Please, please.

945
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,402
MAN: (WHISPERING) I see you all.

946
01:11:21,153 --> 01:11:24,531
Laeddis.

947
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:33,623
You told me I'd be free of this place.

948
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,626
You promised.

949
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,671
You lied.

950
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,548
Laeddis.

951
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,388
Laeddis?

952
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,433
(CHUCKLES) That's pretty damn funny.

953
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,396
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

954
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,816
After all the talks we had?

955
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,777
After all the lies you told me?

956
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,654
Let me see your face.

957
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,115
They say I'm theirs now.

958
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,577
They say I'll never leave here.

959
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,997
Your match is about to go out.

960
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,336
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

961
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:21,213
So you can lie to me more?

962
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,299
- This isn't about the truth.
- Yes, it is.

963
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,969
- It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

964
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,763
And Laeddis.

965
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,058
That's all it's ever been about.

966
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:37,854
I was incidental. A way in.

George... George Noyce.

968
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,490
No. It's not possible. You can't be here.

969
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,950
You like it?

970
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,578
Who did this to you, George?

971
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:54,913
You did.

972
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,873
What the hell do you mean?

973
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:01,127
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

974
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,797
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

975
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,048
(STAMMERING)
However this happened, I...

976
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,092
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

977
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:11,054
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

978
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Just tell me how they got you here.

979
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,809
They knew! Don't you get it?

980
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,271
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

981
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,733
This is a game. All of this is for you.

982
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:28,905
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

983
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,491
Georgie...

984
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:35,245
- George, you're wrong. You're wrong.
- Oh, really?

985
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,331
Been alone much since you got here?

986
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,668
I've been with my partner.

987
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,087
You never worked with him before,
have you?

988
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,883
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

989
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,803
(INSISTENTLY) You never worked
with him before, have you?

990
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:58,476
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

991
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,442
Then they've already won.

992

(SOBBING)

994
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:17,329
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

995
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,790
They're gonna cut into my brain.

996
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,877
And I'm only here

997
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,545
(SHOUTING) because of you!

998
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,965
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

999
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:31,301
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

1000
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,137
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

1001
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,807
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

1002
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:41,227
- I'm not here to kill anyone.
- Liar!

1003
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,397
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

1004
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,024
She's dead.

1005
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,735
She... Let her go.

1006
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,613
Let her go.

1007
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,867
DOLORES: Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

1008
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,247
GEORGE: You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

1009
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,375
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day

1010
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,336
- you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

1011
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,839
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

1012
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,801
She's fucking with your head.

1013
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,761
And I told you it was from happiness.

1014
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,305
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

1015
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,603
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

1016
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,440
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

1017
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,401
I can't! I can't.

1018
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,827
Then you'll never leave this island.

1019

Dolores.

1020
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,426
He's not in this ward.

1021
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:59,639
He was transferred out of here.

1022
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:06,646
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

1023
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,070
The lighthouse.

1024
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,495
Hey,

01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,499
God help you.

CHUCK: Boss, we got problems.

1027
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:39,262
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

1028
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,097
They heard an orderly went bat shit
on a patient.

1029
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:44,058
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

1030
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,019
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

1031
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:51,357
Just keep going. We belong here.

(BOTH PANTING)

1034
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,994
What happened to you?

1035
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,704
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

1036
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,623
where were you?

1037
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:11,753
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

1038
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,963
Did you ever find Laeddis?

1039
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,965
No. No, I never found him.

1040
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:18,968
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

1041
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,179
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

1042
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:24,974
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

1043
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,726
Here. Take a look.

1044
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,895
I'll look at it later.

1045
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,190
What's the matter, boss?

1046
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,568
I'll look it over later, that's all.

1047
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:40,907
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

1048
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,369
I'm going to that lighthouse.

1049
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,788
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

1050
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,345
TEDDY: There it is.

1051
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,183
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

1052
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,477
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

1053
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,229
There could be a way
behind those trees.

1054
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,399
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

1055
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,525
- Boss...
- Come on.

1056
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,986
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

1057
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,863
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

1058
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:22,782
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

1059
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,452
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

1060
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,498
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

1061
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,876
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

1062
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

1063
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,047
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

1064
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,551
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

1065
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:45,138
You brought me into this, boss,

1066
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,558
and now we're trapped here on this rock,
on this island,

- and now you're acting like...
- Like what? Like what?

How am I acting?

01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:03,615

in those cells, Ted?

1101
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,824
if you don't mind.

1102
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,076
Fine by me.

1103
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,462
You're...

1104
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,715
You're Rachel Solando.

1105
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,718
The real one.

1106
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,349
Did you kill your children?

1107
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,977
I never had children.

1108
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:27,438
I was never married.

1109
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,526
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1110
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
You... You were a nurse?

1111
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,034
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1112
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,164
You think I'm crazy.

1113
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,876
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1114
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,505
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1115
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,841
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1116
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,430
People tell the world you're crazy,

1117
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,434
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1118
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,188
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1119
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:11,774
Once you're declared insane,

1120
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,361
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

1121
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:21,033
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1122
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,702
Survival instincts are

1123
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:25,162
defense mechanisms.

1124
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,208
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1125
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,753
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

1126
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,715
What happened to you?

1127
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,969
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1128
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,804
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1129
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,597
Psychotropic drugs.

1130
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,351
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1131
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,564
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1132
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,818
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1133
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,738
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1134
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,992
pull out some nerve fibers.

1135
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,872
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1136
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,290
Tractable.

1137
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,251
It's barbaric,

1138
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,754
unconscionable.

1139
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:19,508
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1140
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,219
Depends on where you're hurt?

1141
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:24,847
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1142
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:27,266
The brain controls pain.

1143
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,480
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1144
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,609
What if you could control it?

1145
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:40,112
- You mean the brain?
- Recreate a man

1146
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,368
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1147
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,371
A man who can't be interrogated,

1148
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:51,165
because he has no memories
to confess.

1149
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,421
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1150
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,634
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1151
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,386
during their brainwashing experiments.

1152
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:06,889
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1153
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,058
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1154
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,395
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1155
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,815
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1156
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,567
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1157
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:21,362
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1158
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:26,575
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1159
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,120
is where it all began.

1160
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:33,999
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1161
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,295
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1162
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,632
No, they won't.

1163
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,592
No.

1164
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,180
You do understand

1165
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,018
that they can't let you leave.

1166
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,647
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1167
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:03,112
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1168
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,824
Didn't matter.

1169
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:13,581
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1170
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,208
Yes.

1171
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,462
But why would that matter?

1172
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,839
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1173
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,425
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1174
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:29,889
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1175
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,891
"Of course he cracked.

1176
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,143
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1177
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,729
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1178
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,773
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1179
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,822
- How's your head?
- My head?

1180
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:50,326
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1181
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:56,874
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1182
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,250
Jesus.

1183
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:04,048
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1184
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,300
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1185
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,679
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1186
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:14,141
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1187
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:17,144
No.

1188
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,230
No.

1189
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,690
No, I haven't.

1190
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,527
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1191
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:27,196
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1192
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,824
Palsy comes first,

1193
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,204
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1194
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,292
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal? Huh?

1195
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,756
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1196
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:47,967
Tell me.

1197
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,761
Brain surgery.

1198
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:55,891
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1199
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,311
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1200
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,857
That's where they create the ghosts.

1201
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:09,154
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1202
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,741
Everyone.

1203
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,537
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1204
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:20,416
- They couldn't possibly know...
- (FIRMLY) Everyone.

1205
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,894
You can't stay here.

1206
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,813
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1207
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,899
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1208
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:48,360
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1209
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,619
I'm gonna come back for you.

1210
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:59,663
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1211
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:02,082
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1212
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,084
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1213
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,213
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1214
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,216
You'll never leave here.

1215
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,353
I had a friend.

1216
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:24,938
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1217
01:31:26,065 --> 01:31:27,733
Have you seen him?

1218
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,235
Marshal,

1219
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,906
you have no friends.

1220
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:40,329
(GRUNTING)

1221
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,773
There you are.

1222
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,278
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1223
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,448
Have a seat.

1224
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,200
Come on.

1225
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,505
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1226
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,634
I was just looking around.

1227
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:41,014
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1228
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:43,976
- What?
- God's gift.

1229
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:47,479
The violence.

1230
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:54,695
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1231
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,615
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1232
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,661
God loves violence.

1233
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,167
- I hadn't noticed.
- (CHUCKLES) Sure you have.

1234
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,503
Why else would there be so much of it?

1235
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,213
It's in us.

1236
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:15,090
It's what we are.

1237
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,844
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1238
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,472
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1239
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,476
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1240
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,106
I thought God gave us moral order.

1241
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:34,193
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1242
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:38,363
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1243
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:41,158
can my violence conquer yours?

1244
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,957
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1245
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,503
You're as violent as they come.

1246
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:56,799
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1247
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:59,051
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1248
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,804
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1249
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:05,265
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1250
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:08,811
Wouldn't you?

1251
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,024
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1252
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:15,984
but I know different.

1253
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,362
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1254
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:21,073
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1255
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,409
We've known each other for centuries.

of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

You know, I've built
something valuable here,

you couldn't find time to look at it.

I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner, huh?

Where's Chuck? Where is he?

01:49:27,937 --> 01:49:29,647
Let's try this another way.

1421
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:32,275
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1422
01:49:32,358 --> 01:49:33,776
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1423
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,737
I'm afraid I have to.

1424
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,949
Notice anything
these four names have in common?

1425
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:41,659
It's your rule of four.

1426
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:43,244
Andrew, what do you see?

1427
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,330
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1428
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:48,833
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1429
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,336
The names have the same letters.

1430
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:56,632
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1431
01:49:56,716 --> 01:49:58,926
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1432
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:01,095
The names are anagrams
for each other.

Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

You came here for the truth. Here it is.

Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

Bullshit.

1438

You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1439

Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1440
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:23,284
so you invented another self.

(STAMMERING) Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

1444
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:33,044
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1445
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:37,173
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1446
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,758
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1447
01:50:38,841 --> 01:50:42,386
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

1448
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:44,514
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1449
01:50:44,597 --> 01:50:45,890
My name is Edward Daniels.

1450
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:50,228
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1451
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,271
Patient 67, the storm,

1452
01:50:52,355 --> 01:50:55,566
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1453
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,069
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1454
01:50:59,821 --> 01:51:01,072
(SIGHS)

1455
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:05,785
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

1456
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:07,328
I really do.

1457
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,414
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1458
01:51:10,498 --> 01:51:12,792
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1459
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,169
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1460
01:51:15,253 --> 01:51:17,171
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1461
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:19,507
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1462
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,467
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1463
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:23,636
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1464
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:26,097
Because he called you Laeddis,

1465
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:29,225
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1466
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:32,895
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1467
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:37,024
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1468
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:41,445
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1469
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:43,406
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1470
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,868
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1471
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,078
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1472
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:51,163
You almost killed him.

1473
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,626
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1474
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,420
It's been decided

1475
01:51:57,503 --> 01:52:00,339
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

1476
01:52:00,631 --> 01:52:01,924
right now,

1477
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:05,636
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1478
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,476
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1479
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:18,649
Yeah, I understand.

1480
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,694
I understand just fine.

1481
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:26,407
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1482
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:29,619
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1483
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,454
But what about my partner?

1484
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:36,000
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1485
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:39,337
Hello, boss.

1486
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:59,357
(SOFTLY) What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

1487
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:01,525
Huh?

1488
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:05,488
You working for him?

1489
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:07,823
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1490
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:10,826
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1491
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:15,831
You been watching me, huh?

1492
01:53:16,791 --> 01:53:18,876
Watching me every minute.

1493
01:53:19,794 --> 01:53:21,087
Who are you?

1494
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:22,922
Who are you? Tell me.

1495
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,591
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1496
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:30,721
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1497
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,182
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1498
01:53:39,647 --> 01:53:42,316
- I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
- I know.

1499
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,653
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1500
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:49,365
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

1501
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:52,201
- I know, boss.
- We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1502
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,329
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1503
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:59,333
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1504
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:01,669
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1505
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,130
I thought that if we let you play this out

1506
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,509
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1507
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:12,054
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1508
01:54:12,138 --> 01:54:15,433
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1509
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:17,309
The satanic ORs?

1510
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:34,493
Andrew, listen to me.

1511
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:36,787
If we fail with you,

1512
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:41,459
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1513
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:46,756
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

1514
01:54:47,506 --> 01:54:50,384
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1515
01:54:57,308 --> 01:55:00,019
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1518
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:08,110
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1519
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:09,403
My initials are on the side.

1520
01:55:09,487 --> 01:55:11,781
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1521
01:55:11,864 --> 01:55:13,991
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1522

CAWLEY: Then blast away.

1523

you're ever getting off this island.

01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:38,682
My gun.

1526
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:47,858
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1527
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:50,444
It's a toy, Andrew.

1528
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:55,032
We're telling you the truth.

1529
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:58,786
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1530
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:02,540
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1531
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:03,749
You moved to that lake house

1532
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:06,961
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1533
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:08,337
- You were...
- (SCREAMING) You're lying!

- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1535
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:13,801
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1538
01:56:20,224 --> 01:56:21,517
I never had any children.

1539
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,646
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1540
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,941
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1541
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:31,318
every night.

1542
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:32,570
I never had a little girl.

The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1544
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:38,242
saved them all.

1545
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:40,786
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1546
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:43,747
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1547
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,250
Andrew, are you?

DOLORES: (WHIMPERING)
I'm so sorry, baby.

1549
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:18,073
I told you not to come in here.

1550
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:22,494
I told you this would be the end of you.

I'm back!

We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1562
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:29,895
Dolores?

1563
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:56,463
Baby,

1564
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:00,384
why are you all wet?

1565
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,263
I missed you.

1566
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,314
I wanna go home.

1567
01:59:16,442 --> 01:59:17,943
You are home.

1568
01:59:23,115 --> 01:59:24,950
Where are the kids?

1569
01:59:27,578 --> 01:59:28,579
Hmm?

1570
01:59:28,996 --> 01:59:30,748
They're in school.

1571
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
It's Saturday, honey.

1572
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,299
School's not in on Saturday.

1573
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:44,553
My school is.

1574
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,443
Oh, my God.

1575
02:00:01,737 --> 02:00:03,197
Oh, my God!

1576
02:00:16,335 --> 02:00:19,046
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1577

(GASPING)

1578
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:24,802
Oh, my God, no.

1579
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:29,890
Come on, come on.

1580
02:00:44,196 --> 02:00:47,324
No. No. Please, God.

1581
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:50,828
Please, God, no!

1582
02:00:51,036 --> 02:00:54,081
No!

No.

1586
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:07,845
No.

1587
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,432
Baby.

1588
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,745
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1589
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:18,790
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1590
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:23,378
They'll be our living dolls. Huh?

1591
02:02:27,424 --> 02:02:30,177
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1592
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:37,142
If you ever loved me, Dolores,

1593
02:02:38,519 --> 02:02:40,062
please stop talking.

1594
02:02:46,276 --> 02:02:47,778
I love you.

1595
02:02:56,495 --> 02:02:58,080
Set me free.

1596
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,169
Oh, baby.

1597
02:03:07,631 --> 02:03:09,550
We'll give them baths.

1598
02:03:12,803 --> 02:03:16,014
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1599
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,891
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1600
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:18,976
I love you. I...

1601
02:03:19,059 --> 02:03:20,352

Andrew.

1606
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:56,680
Andrew, can you hear me?

1607
02:03:56,972 --> 02:04:00,851
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

1608
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:04,396
Rachel?

1609
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:08,358
Rachel who?

1610
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:13,322
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1611
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,241
My daughter.

1612
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:21,580
Why are you here?

1613
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:26,335
Because I killed my wife.

1614
02:04:26,418 --> 02:04:28,545
And why did you do that?

1615
02:04:32,049 --> 02:04:35,218
Because she murdered our children,

1616
02:04:38,138 --> 02:04:39,681
and she told me to let her go.

1617
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:46,897
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1618
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,693
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1619
02:04:51,777 --> 02:04:55,739
- Why?
- CAWLEY: We need to hear you say it.

1620
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:05,540
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1621
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:09,544
Dolores told me she...

1622
02:05:10,504 --> 02:05:14,758
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1623
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:21,473
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1624
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:25,769
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1625
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:31,233
She told me that.

1626
02:05:32,693 --> 02:05:35,529
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1627
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:41,535
I loved her so much, you know.

1628
02:05:42,953 --> 02:05:44,579
CAWLEY: Why did you make them up?

1629
02:05:47,207 --> 02:05:51,128
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1630
02:05:54,965 --> 02:05:56,299
And I...

1631
02:05:58,802 --> 02:06:03,306
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1632
02:06:07,519 --> 02:06:09,146
I killed them.

1633
02:06:13,942 --> 02:06:15,068
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1634
02:06:15,152 --> 02:06:18,363
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1635
02:06:18,447 --> 02:06:19,448
and then you regressed.

1636
02:06:21,992 --> 02:06:25,328
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1637
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:28,623
You reset, Andrew.

1638
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:33,170
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1639
02:06:34,421 --> 02:06:35,881
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1640
02:06:35,964 --> 02:06:39,092
to stop it from ever happening again,

1641
02:06:39,176 --> 02:06:42,679
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1642
02:06:49,186 --> 02:06:51,938
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1643
02:06:53,815 --> 02:06:57,694
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1644
02:07:09,498 --> 02:07:12,375
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1645
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:22,844
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1646
02:07:47,577 --> 02:07:49,579
How we doing this morning?

1647
02:07:50,163 --> 02:07:53,416
- Good. And you?
- Can't complain.

1648
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:05,303
So what's our next move?

1649
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:08,056
You tell me.

1650
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:15,105
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1651
02:08:16,273 --> 02:08:17,566
Get back to the mainland.

1652
02:08:17,649 --> 02:08:20,610
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1653
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:36,626
(INAUDIBLE)

1654
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:45,552
(WHISPERING) Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1655
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:54,144
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1656
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,397
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1657
02:09:13,038 --> 02:09:15,790
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1658
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,418
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1659
02:09:19,377 --> 02:09:21,338
Which would be worse,

1660
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:23,840
to live as a monster

1661
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:26,426
or to die as a good man?

1662
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:37,437
Teddy?
