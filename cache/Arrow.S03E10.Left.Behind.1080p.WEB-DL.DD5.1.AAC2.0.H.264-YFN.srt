I killed Sara.

But not from you.

Chien na wei
is located,

And we have more

We find her, we find tatsu,

We get them both
out of wherever they are.

If only it were
that simple.

We've learned that
the bio weapon

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,160
Is actually
comprised of
two components.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,790
The omega she has is
harmless without its
counterpart, alpha.

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
And where's that?

70

Currently

Oh, so it's safe.
Far from it.

73
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,470
The only way to secure
the counterpart alpha
is to destRoy it.

74
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,070
And by the time we do,
my wife will be dead.

75
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,780
Alpha is being
kept here,

It's tagged
with a gps tracker,

80
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,890
Which you'll need
to disable before
extraction.

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,920
And what about tatsu?
Stop ignoring me!

you, Mr. Yamashiro.

No.

off in the future,

41 counts
of attempted murder,

Including 16 counts
of attempted murder
of a police officer.

126
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,300
So no bail
is what you're saying?

Vigorously,

vigorously moves
to dismiss all charges.

129
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,880
Mr. Fisher's apprehension
was not affected by the police,

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,110
But rather by vigilantes.

131
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,650
The circumstances
of Mr. Fisher's arrest
are irrelevant.

Produce the arrow
as an eyewitness
and we'll find out.

133
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,750
That won't be necessary.

No sign of Oliver.

Well, he'll tell us
when he gets back.

144

Until then, we should focus
on keeping the lights on.

I've been trying to find
the one that got away.

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,890
Anton is attached
to a new crew
working the glades,

The head of which
is this gentleman.

I know that guy.
That's Danny Brickwell.

he was in iron heights.

He was.
Until a week ago.

And then the case
against him imploded.

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,280
So they kill witnesses
in order to get
brick out of prison,

159
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,720
And then shoot
a cop to do... What?

160
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,360
That's what
we have to find out.

161
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,890
I'll hit the streets.

162
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,960
[inhales, exhales]

163
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,670
You have that look
you always get

164
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,130
Right before you tell
Oliver something...

165
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,370
Sagely.

166
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,440
Yes, and this is
about Oliver.

167
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,010
You think I'm in denial.

168
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,040
I think four
days ago,

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,310
Oliver
challenged
the world's

170
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,010
Greatest
assassin
to a duel.

171
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,510
He survived Lian Yu.

172
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,980
And Hong Kong,
and god knows what else.

173
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,520
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn
and Slade Wilson.

174
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,290
You have to believe in him.

175
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,660
Oh, I do believe
in him, Felicity.

176
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,730
It's just,
I'm preparing myself
for the possibility

177
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,330
That things didn't
go Oliver's way.

178
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,000
Not this time.

179
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,840
You need to prepare
yourself, too.

180
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,320
[sharp inhale] please,
Oliver, where are you?

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,990
[wind blowing]

182
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,390
[groaning, gasping]

183
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,560
Y'all best step off.

184
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,960
Brick is a friend
of mine.

185
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,860
You're more than
a friend,Anton.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,400
You're like a brother.

187
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,610
Always had my back.

188
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,140
Always loyal.
Stand up.

189
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,740
So when they told me

190
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,610
Someone ignored
my orders to lay low;

191
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,020
When they told me one
of my crew shot a cop...

192
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,190
I beat the man
who said it was you.

193
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,030
Danny, that cop?

195
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,460
It was a mistake.

196
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,000
What we're planning here
requires two things.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,200
No mistakes,
and the cops not
knowing anything.

198
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,710
They still don't.
Fisher's not going
to say anything.

199
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,180
Was this side job
his idea or yours?

200
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,490
It doesn't have
to be like this.

201
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,790
Bro!

202
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,330
I dropped
my first body
with that piece.

203
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,560
You know the deal;

204
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,040
You take me
down first,
you walk out alive.

205
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,010
[grunting]

206
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,590
He actually
tagged me.
[chuckles]

207
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,000
All yours, boys.

208
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,400
Your attorney doesn't
have your best interests
at heart, Mr. Fisher.

209
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,070
Otherwise,
you'd be walking
out of here a free man.

210
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,640
Yeah, more like
a dead man.

211
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,480
Do you think
you scare me more
than brick does?

212
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,180
Think again.

213
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
You have
a real nice day now.

214
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,380
No, he didn't flip.
He likes breathing
too much.

215
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,520
[both grunting]

216
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,860
When your opponent
is the mountain,
you must be the sea.

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,430
When he is the sea,
you must be the mountain.

218
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,200
Poetic.
Switch your attacks.

219
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,930
Never do the same move
more than twice.

220
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,440
Otherwise, your opponent
will learn to read you.

221
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,880
Something like that?

222
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,020
[cell phone vibrates]

223
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,090
Well, I wouldn't
recommend texting
during a real fight.

224
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,060
Sorry.

225
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,560
I... I thought
it might be Ollie.

226
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,430
He hasn't been home.
He hasn't returned
any of my calls or texts.

227
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,030
I didn't realize
his absence was
weighing on you.

228
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,770
It's not weighing,
it's worrying.

229
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,140
If you like,

230
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,070
I could have
some of my
old associates

231
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,310
Look into Oliver's
whereabouts.

232
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,540
Would you?

233
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
Of course.

234
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,910
He's family.

235
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,620
According to Laurel,
Fisher's lawyer called brick

236
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,890
With the time and the place
of the outgoing call.

237
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,050
Can you trace that call
back to where brick is?

238
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,290
At least where
his phone is.

239
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,520
His burner phone,
to be exact.

240
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,490
It's at a warehouse
in the glades.

241
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,330
I'll have to talk you
in from palmer tech.
I'm crazy-late.

242
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,870
This is the only
vulnerable entrance.

243
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,370
Because it's not
actually an entrance.

244
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,740
Not until
we make it one.

245
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,470
I'll shoot out
the glass.

246
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,310
You get in
and find the alpha.

247
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,850
We won't have much time
once we breach.

248
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,510
Two minutes max before
the alarms draw attention.

249
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,150
Head directly for the lab.

250
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,690
I'll be right behind you.

251
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,020
You ok?

252
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,420
Waller said
when we get
this done,

253
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,330
She'll get
tatsu back.

254
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,560
She's lying.

255
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,160
[gunshot]

256
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,690
Ahh!

257
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
[groaning]

258
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,400
On the move!
30 seconds.

259
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,540
John: Copy that.

260
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,910
I've got eyes
on the target warehouse.

261
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,340
But no signs of life.
Felicity, you seeing
something I don't?

262
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,180
The warehouse
doesn't have any
security cameras,

263
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,710
But someone disabled
all the traffic cams
on that block,

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,220
Which probably
means you're in
the right place.

265
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,480
Roy: You sure ditching
the arrow suit was a good idea?

266
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,690
Only if I need
to move or shoot.

267
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,060
In position.

268
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,300
John: Clear.

269
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,570
Yeah, I got
something.

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,570
It's not big enough
to be brick.

271
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,010
Yeah, I know.

272
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,540
What's this?

273
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,780
[sighs] they burned
their burners.

274
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,050
Yeah,
torching evidence,

275
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,320
Tying up loose ends.

276
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,220
Evidence of what?

277
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,560
I don't know.
These just look
like numbers.

278
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,430
I found this.

279
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,900
What looks like
some industrial blueprints.

280
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,940
Hmm. These numbers look
completely random.

281
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,370
I can run a pattern
recognition algorithm.

282
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,580
Oliver?

283
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,820
Oliver?!

284
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,620
Malcolm: Could you
put the gun away?

285
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,790
They don't scare
so much as annoy me.

286
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,660
I've only come
here to talk.

287
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,500
Would it be possible
to do that?

288
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
Talk about what?

289
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,840
Oliver.

290
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,040
I need to know...

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,140
Is he still alive?

292
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,340
He's alive.

293
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,880
Have you heard
from him since
he went off to face

294
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,420
Ra's al Ghul?

295
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,650
He's alive.

296
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,120
If he were, I suspect
you would have heard
from him by now.

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,160
Unless Ra's
took him prisoner,

298
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,730
And demon's head does
not take prisoners.

299
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,570
What are you doing?

300
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,170
I'm running
the pattern analysis

301
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,540
On that list of numbers
you guys found.

302
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,940
No, I mean, what's the point?

303
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Malcolm Merlyn didn't
tell us anything
we don't already know.

304
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,320
Nothing has changed.

305
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,550
You're right,
Felicity.

306
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,050
He didn't tell us
anything new.

307
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,120
But he may have been
right all the same.

308
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,890
I know you guys
think I'm in denial.

309
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,590
But if there's one
thing Oliver taught
me... he taught us...

310
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,330
Is that sometimes,
all you can do

311
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,130
Is keep pushing
forward.

312
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,330
All right.

313
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,300
I've got the m.E.'s report.

314
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,570
Did they id
the body?

315
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,570
JoseAnton.

316
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,070
Career criminal with ties
to Danny Brickwell.

317
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,480
I think brick severed
those ties pretty thoroughly.

318
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,820
Is everything ok?

319
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,950
Where's Oliver?

320
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,690
He went to fight
the head

321
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,920
Of the league
of assassins.
What?!

322
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,890
And we haven't
heard from him
since he left.

323
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,690
There's something else...

324
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,800
Malcolm Merlyn stopped by
for a little chat.

325
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,570
He says Oliver's dead.

326
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,000
And you guys believe him?

327
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,200
Look, Laurel,
Merlyn said...

328
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,540
There isn't one thing
that Malcolm Merlyn can say

329
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,880
That any of us should believe.

330
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,310
This isn't the first time

331
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,080
That I've heard
that Oliver was dead.

332
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,650
He's been back before.

333
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,950
He'll be back again.

334
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,540
[grunts]

335
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,510
[beep]
clear.

336
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,800
[beep]

337
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,270
Found it!

338
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,840
Aah!

339
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,380
Hong Kong military?

340
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,920
Triad.

341
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,980
Chien na Wey's men.

342
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,390
Any luck?

343
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,290
The number pattern
is consistent with
cataloguing numerics.

344
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,790
What kind of catalog?

345
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,890
If I knew,
I would be
telling you.

346
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,830
I'm sorry to interrupt.

347
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,770
We really need
to change the locks.

348
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,770
The league conducts
matter of significance
such as duels

349
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,870
On grounds sacred
to its beliefs.

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,910
I went there.

351
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,510
And found this.

352
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,520
It's Ra's' custom
to leave behind

353
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,460
The instrument
of death

354
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,230
As a memorial
to honor
the fallen.

355
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,700
Merlyn, did you see...

356
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,660
Oliver's body?

357
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,130
It fell into
a ravine.

358
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,130
His remains were
unrecoverable,
I'm afraid.

359
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,370
Then how do we know
that's Oliver's blood?

360
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,540
Because
after I leave,
you'll test it.

361
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,940
And after you
confirm that
it is his blood,

362
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,550
You'll exhaust
yourself with
conspiracy theories

363
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,850
As to how I planted it
or how it's all a lie.

364
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,290
And after enough
time passes,

365
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,620
You'll be left with
one inescapable truth...

366
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,830
That Oliver Queen
is dead.

367
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,000
This is your fault.

368
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Oliver went there
because of you...

369
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,330
Because of what
you did to Thea.

370
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,470
You made her a target
for the league so he would have

371
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,710
To challenge Ra's
just to save her.

372
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,380
You killed him.

373
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,610
You are right.

374
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,850
And I will live
with that guilt

375
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,450
For the rest of my days.

376
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,120
I am truly sorry.

377
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,320
I can see how much
you loved him.

378
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,830
Save it, Merlyn.

379
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,760
You're enjoying this.

380
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,530
Miss Smoak
is correct.

381
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,170
I orchestrated
the matter

382
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,200
To eliminate
the death warrant

383
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,070
Ra's placed
on my head.

384
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,670
Oliver was that way.

385
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,980
His death
means my own.

386
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,850
Good.

387
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,760
[beep]

388
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,490
What's that?

389
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,160
The blood analysis
on the scimitar.

390
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,400
It's Oliver's.

391
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,470
99.997% match.

392
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,980
If Merlyn's lying,
he's being thorough about it.

393
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,380
Felicity...

394
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,280
Thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

395
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,820
I got to go to work.

396
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,020
You really don't.

397
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,960
It's fine.

398
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,230
I'm glad we know now.

399
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Run for the exit!
I'll cover you!

400
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,840
What about you?

401
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,180
You get the alpha out of here!
But...

402
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,750
Away from them! Go!

403
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,380
You had him.
Why didn't you
take the shot?

404
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,820
We need to get out of here.

405
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,290
Now.

406
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,260
You know, it's weird.

407
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,740
I don't think
I've ever actually
seen you drink alone.

408
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,840
You ok?

409
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,970
Yeah.

410
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,340
I just got some bad news
about a friend.

411
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,880
Anyone I know?

412
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,850
How are you doing?

413
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,280
Still freaking
out, actually.

414
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,590
Worried about Ollie.

415
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,590
I was going
to ask you a favor,

416
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,820
But it doesn't seem
like the right time.

417
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,760
Well, it depends.
What's the favor?

418
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,360
You and the arrow, you're...

419
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,760
You're close, right?

420
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,200
I mean, that's you
I've been seeing
on the news

421
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,630
In the red hood?

422
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,470
Thea...

423
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,200
Look, I haven't seen him,

424
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,370
I haven't heard from him,

425
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,110
He's not answering
any of my phone calls.

426
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,710
I'm actually starting
to get really worried.

427
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,880
So... I thought
maybe the arrow

428
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Could look for Oliver?

429
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,450
I just thought maybe
if you saw him,

430
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,290
You could ask.

431
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,920
Thank you.
You're the best.

432
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,730
Look, I...
I better go check
the stock room.

433
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,870
Thea just asked me
to talk to the arrow

434
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,710
About finding Oliver.

435
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,340
And what'd you
tell her?

436
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,610
What else? I lied.

437
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,880
Oliver didn't want
Thea to know.

438
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,050
That was then.
But now, what's the point?

439
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,120
I keep asking myself
the same question, Roy.

440
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,850
Then why do you keep
going over the case evidence?

441
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,460
Because it helps me keep
my mind off of Oliver.

442
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,660
Doing this
without him

443
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,390
While we're waiting
for him to come back
is one thing,

444
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,100
But doing all
this without him,
without him?

445
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,730
That's a whole
other situation.

446
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,170
What do you want me
to tell you, Roy?

447
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,700
I can only see one inch
in front of me

448
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,700
And this is the only thing
in front of me right now.

449
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,110
I keep looking
at this file, and...

450
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,110
Something about it
feels familiar.

451
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,420
Yeah. Felicity did say
that Fisher andAnton
were connected with brick.

452
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,950
No, it's more
than that.

453
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,730
I've seen
this file
somewhere...

454
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,990
Else.

455
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,660
What are the chances
that's a coincidence?

456
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,700
Hey, there's only
way to find out.

457
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,200
What are you
doing?

458
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,440
Bringing up
the case numbers

459
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,270
On the all guys
we've put away over
the past eight months.

460
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,410
Some of these are guys
that we caught.

461
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,280
Yeah. And others
were apprehended
by the authorities.

462
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,910
There's a pattern here.

463
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,680
All these guys
are awaiting trial

464
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,090
For assault... assault
with intent, murder,

465
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,990
Attempted murder.

466
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,560
Street enforcers.
Muscle.

467
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,230
Why would brick
have a list of
these case numbers?

468
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,330
[cell phone vibrates]

469
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,440
Ah, I'm sure you're wondering
if I ever go home.

470
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,140
Unfortunately
for my assistant,
the answer's no.

471
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,710
Any luck with our
nanite problems?

472
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,180
Yeah, it's the transplex
interface, isn't it?

473
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,280
I knew my designs were off.

474
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,680
It won't... Work.

475
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,590
Yeah, well, you've only
been at it for a day, so.

476
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,260
Not the chip.

477
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,590
Not your suit.

478
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,230
Your plan.

479
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,360
It won't work.

480
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,000
Using an enhanced exoskeleton
to fight crime and save the city

481
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,470
Is a loony tune idea.

482
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,540
It won't
bring her back.

483
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,640
Anna.

484
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,380
Your fiancé.

485
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,480
I know who she is.

486
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,380
She's not coming back.

487
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,190
When we lose...
Someone,

488
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,360
When someone dies,

489
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,430
They're gone.

490
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,430
Forever, and there
is nothing...

491
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,830
There is nothing

492
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,870
Nothing that we can
do that is going
to bring them back.

493
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,340
So you have to stop.
You have to stop,

494
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,170
Because it's not
what anna would
have wanted. It's...

495
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,710
You're upset.
I can see that.
And if you want,

496
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,480
We can talk about it.

497
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,980
But never tell me again

498
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,350
What anna would have wanted.

499
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,950
You don't get to do that.

500
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,130
I am sorry.

501
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,360
I shouldn't...

502
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,000
Be here right now.

[cell phone vibrates]

505
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,980
What?

506
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,540
John: We got
something on brick.

507
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,250
Roy: The blueprints
we found?

508
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,210
They're schematics

509
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,510
For the warehouse
where the police

510
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,350
Store all their
physical evidence
and active cases.

511
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,150
And brick has a list
of case numbers.

512
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,220
We think he might be looking
to steal or destRoy evidence

513
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,920
To get those cases
thrown out of court.

514
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,620
Yeah. I'll call
lance, tell him.

515
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,600
A lot of these cases
are on guys who were put away
within the past eight months.

516
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,030
This is everything
we've been doing since
we took slade down.

517
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,670
This is everything
Oliver was working for.

518
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,140
I'll be right there.

519
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,330
Three minutes.

Give me a two block

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,450
John, shooter at your five.

525
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm out!

526
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,390
Here, use mine.

527
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,120
So here's the deal...

528
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,860
You take me down,
you walk out alive.

529
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,330
I don't fancy
your chances,
though.

Nobody thinks
about going

I'm pinned down!

Felicity!

Any... Last... Words?

540
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,080
Or are my hands too tight
around your neck?

541
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,290
I guess arrows work
a little better on

Yeah, I will be,
after we find
the son of a bitch.

Oh, my god, john!

It's ok, it's all right,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

548
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,190
Brick?

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,390
Got away. They put
one guard in the hospital

On the way out, but he's
going to pull through.

551
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,560
If that door hadn't
shut, we would
have had him.

552
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,530
Just bad luck.

553
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,900
Unless it wasn't.

554
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,040
You were pinned down.
You both were. They
were going to kill you!

Felicity...

556
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,910
They had machine guns.
You had a bow and arrow.

557
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,880
You let him
get away?

558

I saved your lives.

559
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,180
Felicity, it wasn't
your call to make.

560
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,120
It wasn't my call
to let Oliver go
challenge Ra's al Ghul

561
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,390
To a fight
to the death, either!

562
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,390
Brick has who knows
how much evidence,
Felicity.

563
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,930
And it was either that
or the two of you.

564
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,930
My friends being killed.
So I made my choice.

565
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,670
I chose not
to let anyone else
I care about die.

566

We've been in
tough spots before

To come out on the other side.

568
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,870
No.

569
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Oliver did.

But he's not here
anymore,

571
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,710
Because he's dead.

572
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,750
Ok.

573
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,350
The point is,

574
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,050
If we're going to do this
without Oliver,

575
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,520
Felicity, we have
to trust each other.

You don't get it.

577

There is no "this"
without him.

And I'm sorry.

You want to tell me
what had you so upset?

I lost a friend of mine.

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,210
He was more than
a friend, actually.

I'm 25 years old.

I'm over my quota where
losing my friends are concerned.

596
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,730
And you're a friend.

00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,140
So if you want
to go out there;

598
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,840
If you want to commit suicide,

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
I can't stop you.

But I don't have to help you.

Without
the evidence,

to let them go.

I know you don't want
to believe it, Laurel.

God knows I don't, but...

612
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,850
He's not coming back.

Are you coming back?

I don't know.

For the first time
since I met Oliver Queen...

617
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,380
I don't know what happens next.

618

I know it's silly, but I...

619
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,520
Still like to think of myself
as Oliver's bodyguard.

620
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,120
I just couldn't protect him.

621

It's funny.

622
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,980
He was worried something
would happen to me.

623
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,660
I could have killed you!

624
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,700
Heh. It's cute
that you think so.

625
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,400
Did you hear anything
about Ollie?

626
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,770
I'm afraid not.

627
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,240
[sighs] then what
are you doing here?

628
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,270
We're in danger,
Thea.

629
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,240
We need to leave
Starling city
and never return.

630
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,880
Thank you all
for coming.

631
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,280
But seeing
as I'm the reason

632
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,650
None of you are
sitting in a prison
cell right now,

633
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,120
I figure
it's the least
you can do.

634
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,760
I know I'm the guy that
made all the evidence
against you go away,

635
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,690
But as you can see,

636
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,800
It didn't go too far.

637
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,430
You are all part
of my crew now.

638
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,740
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

639
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,970
I can send a gift wrapped
package to the d.A.

640
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,380
Together, not only will
we make a lot of money,

641
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,250
We will make history.

642
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,450
Together,

643
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,720
We are going to take
over the glades.

644
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,060
You think brick's crazy?

645
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,060
Take over a whole
section of town?

646
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,000
I know he's crazy.

647
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,300
I don't know what
he's got planned,

648
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,030
But whatever it is, I'm in.

649
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,770
[alarm shrieking]

650
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,450
Who the hell are you?

651
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm the justice
you can't run from.

652
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,890
Well done, Mr. Queen.

653
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:32,620
I'm glad to know my
investment in you hasn't
entirely been for naught.

654
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,490
Although I was
disappointed to read

655
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,500
Agent pierson's
after action report.

656
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,230
You let one
of chien na wey's
men get away.

657
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,640
I hesitated.
It was a mistake.

658
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,240
It really was.

659
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,440
Now we have no one
to interrogate.

660
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,080
You mean torture, right?

661
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,420
I saw you with that man.

662
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,150
You didn't
hesitate.

663
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,230
You chose
not to shoot him.

664
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,560
I put the gps from the vial
in his pocket.

665
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,170
And now he is going to lead us
right to tatsu.

666
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,100
You're going to get
her back, maseo.

667
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,470
I promise.

668
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,270
Oliver...

669
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,310
What you've done,

670
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,610
I will be forever
in your debt.

671
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,390
[gasping]

672
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,760
Don't move.

673
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,500
You'll pull out the sutures.

674
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,160
Oliver.

675
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,330
Tatsu.

676
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,300
Maseo: I asked her
to come here...

677
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,740
So she could
bring you back to life.
