Why would I go with you?

793
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,517
Because, unfortunately,

794
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,884
I need you,

795

my entire world needs you.

And bonus, he's actually
wearing a costume

836
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,114
like he's not embarrassed to be

837
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:45,513
in a superhero movie for once.

838

I don't understand.

839
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:48,414
You said my universe is dying

00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:50,879
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

841

- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

842
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,980
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

843
00:32:58,014 --> 00:32:59,980
with this?

844
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:02,579
I wouldn't have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

845
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,611
But you have outdone yourself

846
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:06,846
and brought me
the worst Wolverine!

847
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:08,113
What do you mean, the worst one?

848
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:09,612
Mr. Wilson.

849
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:13,611
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

850
00:33:13,645 --> 00:33:16,013
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

851
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:17,280
And what he did,

00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:18,678

beyond forgiveness.

Okay.

How do I... How do I make
this right? I'll do anything.

856
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:30,577
I gave you
a chance at greatness.

857
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,211
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

858
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,711
Clearly not special
in a good way.

859
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:35,778
Apparently you have some

860
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,979
important future purpose
to serve.

861

With Thor. He holds me.

862
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:40,944
But I did my duty.

863
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,011
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

864
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,011
And instead of
accepting my offering

865
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:47,510
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

[sighs] It looks great.

867
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,544
And you decimated
dozens of my men

868
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,178
with the exhumed corpse
of a hero.

869
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:54,543
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

870
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,910
What are you, the Internet?

871

The humane thing to do

is to make it quick.

of vaporizing my universe

877

making you peckish?

I wanna talk to your boss.

I want you to get him
on the phone

01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,474
what, two days ago?

1738
01:10:26,507 --> 01:10:28,808
[Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.

1739
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,574
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1740
01:10:31,608 --> 01:10:32,742
[Wolverine chuckles]

1741
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:35,008
Look, there's...
there's strength in numbers.

1742
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,141
All right? Us...

1743
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:37,506
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1744
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,808
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1745
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:41,507
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1746
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,075
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1747
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:45,341
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1748
01:10:45,373 --> 01:10:46,908
It's like you're holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1749
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:48,274
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1750
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:50,040
to save your universes.

1751
01:10:50,074 --> 01:10:52,242
But you can avenge them.

1752
01:10:52,274 --> 01:10:53,573
It's what Johnny
would have wanted.

1753
01:10:53,607 --> 01:10:56,640
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1754
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,673
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1755
01:10:58,707 --> 01:11:00,673
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1756
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:03,307
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1757
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,640
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don't know that.

1758
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:06,874
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1759
01:11:06,907 --> 01:11:09,673
If he survived that,
he is prayin' for death.

1760
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:11,340
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1761
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:13,539
- Spill it!
- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1762
01:11:13,572 --> 01:11:14,740
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1763
01:11:14,773 --> 01:11:16,439
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1764
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:17,739
Look.

1765
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:20,205
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1766
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,005
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1767
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:24,173
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1768
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:27,139
while the soil greedily drank
his blood. It was horrible.

1769
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:28,938
He was like a brother to me.

1770
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:32,105
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1771
01:11:32,138 --> 01:11:33,173
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn't

1772
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,639
save your worlds, but...

1773
01:11:34,672 --> 01:11:37,404
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1774
01:11:37,438 --> 01:11:39,905
I don't give a shit
about your world, but

1775
01:11:39,938 --> 01:11:42,873
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1776
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:44,805
we can get back in
and take her down.

1777
01:11:44,838 --> 01:11:47,805
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>

1778
01:11:47,838 --> 01:11:49,805
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1779
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:51,704
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1780
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:53,771
Now, I know Magneto's dead.

1781
01:11:53,805 --> 01:11:56,403
But I'd venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1782
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,470
- around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1783
01:11:58,503 --> 01:11:59,670
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1784
01:11:59,704 --> 01:12:01,670
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don't play.

1785
01:12:01,704 --> 01:12:03,136
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1786
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:04,804
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1787
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:06,704
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

1788
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:07,971
but he works for Cassandra.

1789
01:12:08,004 --> 01:12:09,502
[Deadpool] Juggernaut's
helmet. That's it.

1790
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:11,203
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off

1791
01:12:11,237 --> 01:12:12,636
without that dome
gonna come off wit'it.

1792
01:12:12,669 --> 01:12:13,937
[Deadpool] I'm so sorry,
beautiful.

1793
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:14,837
I want this to be gentle.

1794
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:17,136
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1795
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:20,435
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1796
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:24,604
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1797
01:12:25,637 --> 01:12:27,669
Let's face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1798
01:12:27,703 --> 01:12:29,501
Or never learned about us.

1799
01:12:29,536 --> 01:12:30,969
The heroes we were.

1800
01:12:31,002 --> 01:12:32,302
Lives we saved.

1801
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:33,702
Or wanted to save.

1802
01:12:33,735 --> 01:12:35,769
Maybe these two are our chance.

1803
01:12:35,803 --> 01:12:37,102
[gurgling]

1804
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:38,869
To be remembered.

1805
01:12:38,902 --> 01:12:39,969
The way we deserve.

1806
01:12:41,102 --> 01:12:42,169
[Deadpool] Yes.

1807
01:12:42,202 --> 01:12:44,001
An ending.

1808
01:12:44,034 --> 01:12:45,236
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1809
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:46,735
Yes! Let this man cook.

1810
01:12:46,768 --> 01:12:48,269
This is what I'm talking about.

1811
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:50,268
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1812
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:51,501
Everybody working together.

1813
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:53,367
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1814
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,535
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1815
01:12:55,568 --> 01:12:56,835
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1816
01:12:56,869 --> 01:12:57,802
I ain't know my daddy,

1817
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:59,801
but I'm sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1818
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,734
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1819
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,701
Yeah. He was layin' them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1820
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:05,735
and I shot out there
and I said, "What's up, Doc?"

1821
01:13:05,768 --> 01:13:08,201
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1822
01:13:08,235 --> 01:13:10,500
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1823
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:11,767
The name's Laura.

1824
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:14,600
- Let's fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let's fucking go!

1825
01:13:14,633 --> 01:13:15,868
It's on like chicken and corn.

1826
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:17,399
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We're doing this.

1827
01:13:17,433 --> 01:13:18,500
You're all fuckin' dead.

1828
01:13:18,534 --> 01:13:20,867
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

[exhales]

1831
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,832
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin'
for company. Get out of here.

1832
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,499
You remind me of him.

1833
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:40,365
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1834
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:42,565
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1835
01:13:44,364 --> 01:13:45,967
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1836
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,866
Couldn't help it.

[sighs]

You might not know it, but...

1839
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:56,866
you're a good man, Logan.

1840
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:57,899
[chuckles]

1841
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:00,565
You might not know it,
but apparently,

1842
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:01,998
I'm the worst Logan.

1843
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,732
I got to have a life
because of you.

1844
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:10,364
I got to grow up because of you.

1845
01:14:12,363 --> 01:14:13,930
A lot of kids did.

1846
01:14:13,964 --> 01:14:16,098
A lot of kids didn't grow up
because of me.

1847
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:19,898
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1848
01:14:21,231 --> 01:14:23,297
That suit says different.

1849
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,463
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1850
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:29,030
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1851
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:33,897
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1852
01:14:35,963 --> 01:14:37,997
All of them.

1853
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:41,763
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn't.

1854
01:14:41,797 --> 01:14:45,096
Told 'em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1855
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:49,696
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1856
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:57,396
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1857
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:58,696
the humans came...

1858
01:14:59,263 --> 01:15:00,696
and went mutant hunting.

1859
01:15:01,962 --> 01:15:03,128
I can guess the rest.

1860
01:15:03,162 --> 01:15:04,362
No, no, let me...

1861
01:15:05,595 --> 01:15:06,795
Let me say it. I...

1862
01:15:09,395 --> 01:15:10,596
I need to say it.

1863
01:15:13,062 --> 01:15:15,728
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1864
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,061
it was too late.

1865
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:22,561
They were dead. Every...

This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1868
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:34,827
And what I did.

1869

[sniffles]

1870
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,594
We're headed to Cassandra's
at sunup.

01:15:50,393 --> 01:15:52,427
Have fun. Not my fight.

1872

We won't pull this off
without you.

Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

You were always the wrong guy.

Alioth didn't get them.

Cassandra wanted to

- No.

Good. All right. Phew.

Well done, Pyro.

- Relax.

If they come after Nova,
she'll handle it.

Cassandra is

Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.
