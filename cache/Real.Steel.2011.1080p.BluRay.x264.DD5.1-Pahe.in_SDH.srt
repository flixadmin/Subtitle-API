Whoa, little lady.
What are you doing?

- Sure. For five dollars.

You want five dollars? Seriously?

- Yes, sir. We did.

- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.

All right, Charlie.
I'll tell you what,

twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

because there will be one.

Charlie, relax.

153

I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.

154

What does she want?

00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:14,634
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?

158
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,096
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.

159
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,931
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

160
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,850
[sighs] Is he dead, too?

161
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,853
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.

162
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,523
[soft music playing]

163
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,800
[man] This court is convened
to address the custodial status

164
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:59,012
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

165
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,097
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

166
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:02,890
Father, Charles Kenton.

167
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,101
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

168
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:08,730
Yes. As I've already told you,

169
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,857
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

170
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:14,193
and we can more than provide for Max.

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,989
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

172
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,741
next of kin retains custody.

173
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,952
Charles Kenton, who is aware
of this custody hearing,

174
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,621
and we are expecting him...

175
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,290
[Charlie] No, I need a new robot now.

176
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,626
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

177
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,294
I got to show up with something.

178
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,546
Noisy Boy is for sale?

179
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:37,216
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?

180
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,552
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

181
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,638
I can live with that.

182
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,182
Well, I don't have it have it.

183
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:47,060
Charles Kenton waived all
of his rights to custody

184
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:51,064
right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.

185
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,274
Whoa.

186
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,692
Please be Charles Kenton.

187
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,404
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

188
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,491
[stammers] I'm here to sign some paper

189
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:04,952
that releases my rights
to the custody of my son.

190
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,038
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

191
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,457
Charlie.

192
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,168
Do you even remember me?

193
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,879
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

194
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,047
- Mr Kenton.
- Yeah.

195
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:17,256
Please take a seat.

196
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,512
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

197
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,013
Yes, you may.

198
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,391
- How about you, Mr Kenton?
- What?

199
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,559
You can spend some time with him,
if you'd like.

200
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,353
- With the kid?
- [Debra] Yeah, the kid.

201
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,313
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.

202
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,233
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

203
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,653
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

204
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,447
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

205
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,081
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture,

206
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:52,959
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

207
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,419
[judge] Please.

208
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,550
Come on. Come on.

209
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,593
There you are.

210
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,179
He'll be in a foster home.

211
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,182
No, they find good families.

212
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,017
Young, energetic. Yeah.

213
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:14,230
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

214
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:15,565
- [phone beeps]
- Oh, hey.

215
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,692
Hey, um...

216
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,903
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

217
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,865
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

218
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,451
And...

219
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,620
- I'm up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.

220
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,748
$75,000?

221
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,126
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,463
The thing is...

223
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,090
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

224
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:44,927
with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

225
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,596
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

226
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:49,974
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

227
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:53,269
In August. A hundred.

228
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,354
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

229
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,774
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

230
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,194
if you tell her I just signed
over that kid to the state of Texas.

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,989
The way I see it, there's a real way
everyone gets what they want here.

232
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,283
So here's what you're going to do.

233
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,328
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

234
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,789
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

235
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,374
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

236
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,545
for being such a terrible absentee dad
how I want to make good with junior,

237
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,714
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

238
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:26,177
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero,
and everybody wins.

239
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,892
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

240
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,269
I understand.

241
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,814
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

242
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,982
and the other 50
when we get back in August

243
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,235
and you deliver him to us in New York.

244
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,612
Pleasure doing business with you.

245
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,700
Your Honor, I'm really happy
we all took the time

246
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,410
to make the best decision for everyone.

247
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,332
- Happy?
- [Charlie] Yeah, it's me.

248
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:59,502
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.

249
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,839
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

250
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:18,646
Hello?

251
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:21,274
Bailey?

252
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,067
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

253
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:24,360
and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,

254
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,280
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

255
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,408
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.

256
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,493
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?

257
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,538
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.

258
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,541
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

259
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,085
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

260
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,379
Now, putting aside the fact
that you're doing

261
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:46,132
what I'm guessing is a black market deal
on my doorstep,

262
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,217
how are you gonna pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

263
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,553
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.

264
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,597
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.

265
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:53,848
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,975
Is that why
you're buying a $45,000 robot

267
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,143
when you owe me six grand in rent?

268
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,269
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

269
00:16:58,436 --> 00:16:59,562
- No, six.
- Whoa.

270
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:03,691
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with
real money who wants to buy this place.

271
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,027
Come on, like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

272
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,778
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments

273
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,280
and I won't have a choice.

274
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,365
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

275
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,117
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

276
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,077
and kick your ass.

277
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,245
[sighs]

278
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:19,582
Bailey.

279
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,504
- Don't.
- Don't what?

280
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,298
Don't do that. Don't... that...

281
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,091
Hey.

282
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,218
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

283
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,681
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

284
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,975
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

285
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,061
I used to. Once. Briefly.

286
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,063
Now I like money more.

287
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,942
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

288
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,568
[clears throat]

289
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,612
Marvin.

290
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:51,906
Your money has arrived.

291
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,910
Marv.

292
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,875
Fifty grand, as promised.

293
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,003
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.

294
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,464
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.

295
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:10,049
So that's everything there.

296
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,097
So Marvin tells me you want
this time with Max.

297
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,474
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing

298
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,143
giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.

299
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,770
Yeah.

300
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,272
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

301
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:27,650
That's a deal.

302
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,820
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.

303
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,656
OK? Let's get Max.

304
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,286
It's OK. You want me to go on the
other side here and I'll get Max?

305
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,873
Hey, Max.

306
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,251
See you, pal.

307
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,962
[Debra] Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

308
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm Charlie.

309
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,855
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

310
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,065
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

311
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,275
Do you know where they're going?

312
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,444
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

313
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,654
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.

314
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,115
You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

315
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:19,910
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.

316
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,329
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?

317
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,791
Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?

318
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,669
- OK?
- Hey.

319
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,129
Hey.

320
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:33,049
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

321
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,260
Max Kenton.

322
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,263
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

323
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,557
Don't worry about it, OK?

324
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:42,975
I'm standing here looking at you two...

325
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:46,187
Just go and put Noisy in the shop,
please? Thank you.

326
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,983
[sighs]

327
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,570
So listen, you're going to stay here
with her while I'm on the road.

328
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:55,988
How much did he give you, huh?

329
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:58,032
You're coming
at this the wrong way, kid.

330
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,325
No, tell me. I want to know.

331
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,870
50,000. OK?

332
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,164
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

333
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,249
Will you shut up now?

334
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,626
You sold me?

335
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,378
Sounds worse than it is.

336
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,173
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.

337
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,258
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

338
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,261
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

339
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,013
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

340
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,723
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

341
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,102
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

342
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,145
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.

343
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,523
It's gone! OK? Gone!

344
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,316
I'm through here.

345
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:41,992
All right, what do we got?

346
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,204
Noisy Boy has arrived.

347
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:48,082
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

348
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:51,502
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

349
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,255
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

350
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,757
Maybe that's why you got such
a good price, genius.

351
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,012
[Charlie] Decided to stay, huh?

352
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,306
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

353
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,391
- What?
- By the way,

354
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,977
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks or, like, eight.

355
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:12,189
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

356
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,567
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

357
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,277
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?

358
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:20,447
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

359
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,200
- [chuckles]
- [beeps]

360
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,455
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

361
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,334
Well, his composite armor
has been replaced.

362
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,961
Let's see if the insides look as good.

363
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:37,798
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

364
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,842
He should have had him
in the third round

365
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,845
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

366
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:45,973
[beeping]

367
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,027
[Charlie] Relax, kid. he's on our side.

368
00:21:58,194 --> 00:22:00,738
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

369
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:02,448
You know he
has voice recognition, right?

370
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,450
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

371
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:06,493
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

372
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,288
Brazilians are crazy about
that talk-to-your-robot crap.

373
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,876
Right, left, uppercut!

374
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,008
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!

375
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:23,385
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

376
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,803
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

377
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,764
God, look how good he looks, too.

378
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,349
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

379
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,767
Why didn't you ask the guy
to have a look at it?

380
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,101
Relax!

381
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,269
[speaks Japanese]

382
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,274
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?

383
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,735
[speaks Japanese]

384
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,406
Let me see if I can reset him
to English. Hang on.

385
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,409
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.

386
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:50,162
[Charlie] You play video games
in Japanese?

387
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,081
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

388
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,131
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English,

389
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,342
and I found his command matrix.

390
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,010
They have pre-loaded a bunch
of combinations.

391
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:08,347
- They should be listed here.
- Right.

392
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,975
Uh... Top salvo!

393
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,271
- [laughing]
- What did I tell you?

394
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,274
Gravity One Downtown!

395
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,446
[chuckling]
I was due for some good luck!

396
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,323
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

397
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,368
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

398
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:45,175
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

399
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,844
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

400
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,804
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

401
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:52,766
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

402
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,020
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

403
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,396
[jingles]

404
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:01,150
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

405
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:02,276
Don't do that again.

406
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:05,029
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

407
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:08,032
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa!
- Get in. Just get in, will ya?

408
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,199
Give me the keys first.

409
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,701
No, you can wait
till I get in the truck.

410
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,995
Thanks, Big Pops.

411
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,002
[Max] Sweet ride.

412
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,171
[Charlie] Put on your seatbelt
and don't talk.

413
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:27,009
[engine starts]

414
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,057
[? Eminem: "'Till I Collapse"]

415
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,694
I'm taking all bets!

416
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,013
Keep up. Stay close.

417
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,475
Hey, hey, hey!

418
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,103
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

419
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,354
All right, all right.

420
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,606
- [man] Come on, man!
- Hey, Finn.

421
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:25,818
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

422
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:30,155
- That's Noisy Boy!
- [cheering]

423
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,827
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

424
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,245
You sure you want
to fight him tonight?

425
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:39,498
What do you got, Finn? He can take any
bot in this place. You know it.

426
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,626
[laughs] You can have
any undercard you want.

427
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,128
- Five thousand guaranteed.
- Come on, man.

428
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:47,297
A thousand
every round your bot survives.

429
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,842
- Fight till the death!
- [crowd cheering]

430
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,388
No. Give me the main event.

431
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,682
- Come on, Charlie.
- Finn, this is Noisy Boy.

432
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,559
An original Tak Mashido bot.

433
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,353
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

434
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:05,983
You want to fight Midas?

435
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,278
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

436
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,239
Fifty? Really, 50?

437
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,615
Now you're talking.

438
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,659
[Max] Listen, listen. No, look.

439
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,453
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

440
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,455
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash

441
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,831
and get the hell out of here!

442
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,374
All right, first, there is no "we."

443
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,669
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

444
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,422
We'll take Midas!

445
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,008

[metal music playing]

00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:38,932
Yeah!

448
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,562
Tonight, our main event

449
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:48,650
features the gold-blooded killer!

450
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:52,613
This pimped-out punk

451
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,117
is programmed for pain!

452
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:02,289
I give to you the mighty Midas!

453
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,556
Whoo!

454
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,083
Against a bot

455
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,046
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

456
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:57,052
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home

457
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,513
and he's ready to make some noise!

458
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,933

who's ready for some destruction?!

462

Let's make some money! Come on!

463
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,616
[Finn] We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

464
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,993
Noisy Boy against Midas.

00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,371
You've been waiting all night
for this matchup, Crash Palace!

466
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,960
[bell rings]

467
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:13,754
Scimitar right!

468
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,675
Did you see that?

469
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,803
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

470
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,098
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

471
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,392
Skull salvo! Firefight!

472
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,898
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

473
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,818
Shockfist!

474
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,865
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

475
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,744
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

476
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,707
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

477
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,000
Get up!

478
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,420
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

479
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,550
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

480
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,261
I got something for you.

481
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:08,558
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

482
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,644
Get up!

483
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,273
That's illegal!

484
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,275
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules!

485
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,695
[Finn] Now we're seeing
the Midas touch.

486
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,071
No. Hands up!

487
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:24,324
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

488
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,788
He's getting killed in there!

489
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:36,586
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

490
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,171
Panic Shield!

491
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,174
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

492
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,137
[grunting]

493
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,597
No, no. Shatter Punch!

494
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,979
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

495
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,651
Jeez, damn it.

496
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,194
Jab, jab!

497
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,287
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!

498
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,165
[Finn] Did he just spit
his juice in Midas's face?

499
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,834
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

500
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,755
- It's party time now, Crash Palace!
- Use your left!

501
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,924
[Finn] Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

502
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,719
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

503
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,602
No, no, no! Get up!

504
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,146
Get some!

505
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,773
He's got...
Just gotta get to the bell.

506
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,108
Move! Get out of the corner!

507
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,113
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

508
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,867
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

509
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,953
I got something for you!
You ready?

510
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,416
[Finn] Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.

511
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,628
And so long to Noisy Boy.

512
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:12,224
[screaming]

513
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,811
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

514
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,579
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

515
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,957
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

516
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,960
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

517
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:43,547
I need to find a mainframe. What?

518
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,549
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

519
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:48,927
Fine, more for me.
Here, drink this.

520
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:50,679
You never should have taken that fight.

521
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,557
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

522
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,476
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

523
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,728
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

524
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,399
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

525
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,818
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

526
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,736
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.

527
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,489
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.

528
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,409
Was. Was a great robot back
in the League, back in the day.

529
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,119
But look around you, kid. This place...

530
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,538
This place is where once great robots
go to die.

531
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,291
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?

532
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,334
Anything you don't need
you just throw away.

533
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,380
Wow.

534
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,008
It's been a long night.

535
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,136
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

536
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,889
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

537
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:04,294
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

538
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,481
You stay put.
I'm going to go look for some parts.

539
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,232
- I'm coming with you.
- Huh?

540
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,776
That drink has my heart pounding.

541
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,111
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

542
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:31,738
Whatever. Just keep up.

543
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,957
[thunder crashing]

544
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,250
Crap.

545
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,627
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

546
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,849
All right, keep up.

547
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,977
These searchlights are automated,

548
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,437
but you got to time them right,
so stay close.

549
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,943
Keep up. It's all right.

551
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,612
All right. Come on, come on.

552
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,240
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

553
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:18,910
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

554
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:23,039
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

555
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,211
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

556
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,215
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights.

557
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,175
Quick! Go, go, go!

558
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,318
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

559
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,238
Anything. Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

560
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:56,656
- Hey, look.
- What?

561
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,411
It's so small.

562
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:04,622
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One,

563
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,834
the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.

564
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,919
The more human, the better.

565
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,630
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.

566
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,007
What changed?

567
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,051
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.

568
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,011
- It just faded.
- Why?

569
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,305
Because the money moved on.

570
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,974
People wanted more carnage,
more show.

571
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,351
You had the whole Brazilian
underground,

572
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,354
the Gracies, the Machados,
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,

573
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,566
and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.

574
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:32,859
- Look at this.
- What's that?

575
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,820
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.

576
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:39,115
You still had human fighters,
human bodies

577
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,451
so you couldn't
give the people what they really wanted:

578
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,788
true, no-holds-barred violence.

579
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,666
So the next logical step:

580
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,878
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

581
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:55,090
Do you miss it?

582
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:59,469
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

583
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,137
What? I want to know.

584
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:02,972
Careful, you're on a cliff.

585
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,102
Whoa!

586
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,605
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

Look at me. Look at me.
That's it! I've got you, Max!

You don't have to be scared. I got you!

- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.

602
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,968
Just give me your other hand
very slowly.

603
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,262
Reach back. Come on. Reach!

604
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,473
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.

605
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,392

Just look at me.

623
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,582
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

624
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,085
Could you just bring the cart to the
edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.

625
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:40,797
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

626
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,774
[wheels whirring]

627
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,904
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

628
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,198
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition

629
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,034
to the front of the Crash Palace.

630
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,745
- [scoffs] It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

631
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:39,040
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

632
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,751
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

633
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,003
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

634
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,713
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

635
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,259
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

636
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,845
You're not even
in the game anymore, Charlie.

637
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:54,931
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

638
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,849
Don't get loud with me.

639
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,143
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?

640
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,356
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring,

641
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,608
and the whole ugly spiral down,
and I'm tired.

642
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:09,195
My father invested everything
he had in your fight career.

643
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:10,655
We loved...

644
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:16,786
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

645
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:19,622
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

646
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,333
What's yours?

647
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,378
[sighs]

648
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:35,638
You're done, right?

649
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:36,973
You're finally done?

650
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,560
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

651
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,229
I got nothing left.

652
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,315
All right.

653
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:51,404
Maybe there's something here.

654
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,948
This robot the kid brought
in last night.

655
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,783
Would you look at it for me?

656
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,452
Please?

657
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,164
Bailey?

658
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,129
I've never seen
anything like it before.

659
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:10,298
He's Generation Two, but barely.

660
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,425
I found a power cell that fits him,

661
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,845
and I hooked him up
to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...

662
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,972
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.

663
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:20,975
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

664
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:24,103
- Charlie, stop.
- [Max] It's my robot!

665
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,315
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there.

666
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,066
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.

667
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,694
But the parts we're
putting in him are mine!

668
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,449
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you start fighting over him.

669
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:37,867
What happened to you?

670
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,414
Hey.

671
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,999
[beeping]

[electronic whirring]

674
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:56,469
Whoa. Whoa.

675
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:58,346
Watch out. Stay back.

676
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,784
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

677
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,912
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory, Max.

678
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,248
[Charlie] You think there's
anything here we could use?

679
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,250
- [Bailey] Not much.
- There's a bucket...

680
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,419
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.

681
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:33,464
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

682
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:36,551
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

683
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:40,263
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

684
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:42,974
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

685
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,893
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

686
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,854
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

687
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:50,565
Cool.

688
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:26,309
"Atom."

689
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,944
[Max] His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

690
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,696
I don't think he
was ever a boxing robot.

691
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:42,617
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

692
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,285
They must have built robots
like this one

693
00:45:44,452 --> 00:45:46,287
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

694
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:48,706
OK, so can we get him a fight?

695
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:51,208
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

696
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,086
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

697
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:55,838
You could always sell him off for parts.

698
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:57,298
Can't you get him a fight?

699
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,508
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."

700
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,469
God, you don't quit, do you?

701
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:04,472
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

702
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,391
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

703
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:09,852
The places that would
let you fight this robot

704
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,729
would make you pee your little pants.

705
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:14,315
Excellent. Get him a fight.

706
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,361
[mechanical chirping]

707
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,364
Stubborn kid.

708
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,491
Surprise, surprise.

00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:31,475
[Atom whirrs]

715
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,396
Can you understand me?

716
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:28,532
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

717

[whirrs]

718
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:56,018
[Max] You've known Charlie a long time.

719
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:59,522
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

720
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,817
My dad, he trained him.

721
00:49:04,193 --> 00:49:06,654
That's them. That's Charlie.

722
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,991
- [Max] What was he like?
- [Bailey] As a boxer?

723
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:13,494
- As anything.
- He was something.

724
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:17,289
He was lean, tough.

725
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,291
No quit, no fear.

726
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,549
Come here.
I want to show you something.

727
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:31,679
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

728
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:35,432
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

729
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,394
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.

730
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:41,230
Charlie was just supposed
to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

731
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:45,025
Nico wasn't
even supposed to break a sweat

732
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:50,281
but nobody told Charlie that, so he just
kept coming and coming at him.

733
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,782
Check this out.

734
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,495
[Bailey] That's Charlie.

735
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,499
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

736
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:05,129
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

737
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:07,131
- Really?
- Really.

738
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,049
He was toying with Nico.

739
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:12,094
The top contender,
number two in the world

740
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,556
and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!

741
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:18,767
Charlie was floating inches
off the canvas that night.

742
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:21,770
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

743
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,064
I could.

744
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,569
He was beautiful.

745
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:31,030
He was beautiful.

746
00:50:33,824 --> 00:50:36,535
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

747
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:40,497
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

748
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,333
Second time for good. Lights out.

749
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:44,585
You were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round.

750
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,630
Nico Tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated

751
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,131
world champ for the next three years.

752
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:52,009
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

753
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:53,344
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

754
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,387
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.

755
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:57,014
But every fight a knockout.

756
00:50:57,181 --> 00:50:59,058
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

757
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:00,517
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

758
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,187
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

759
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:05,606
- [Max] Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

760
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:07,650
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

761
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:11,070
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.

762
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,572
Wow. Here.

763
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:16,325
Keep it.

764
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,204
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

765
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,585
I like that kid.

766
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:28,837
He likes you.

767
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:37,304
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

768
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:42,142
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight
to see if I can get a partner

769
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:43,936
or raise money to get a new bot.

770
00:51:45,187 --> 00:51:49,024
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?

771
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:55,531
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

772
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,040
OK.

00:53:21,617 --> 00:53:24,578
All right, listen up.
I got to go find Finn.

789
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:27,539

- OK.

You're very kind,

798
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:55,442
but I assure you,
the mind behind Zeus

799
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:57,277
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

What did it take to lure the reclusive
genius, former boy wonder

802
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,201
and arguably the most
important bot designer

803
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:07,121
in the history of the sport
out of retirement?

Why don't you ask him yourself?

[all clamoring]

Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

807
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:23,637
Zeus is autonomous and constantly
evolving during a fight.

808
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:27,850
With his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns

809
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:32,187
and rewrites his fight code
instantaneously.

810
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,691
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...

811
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:40,696
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring,

812
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:44,283
the result of any fight is inevitable.

813
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,994
What Zeus sees...

814
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:49,830
...he kills.

815
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:52,958

[Charlie] I just need a break here,
Finn. C'mon.

820
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,117
You got that old bot truck out there.

821
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:29,036
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot,

822
00:55:29,203 --> 00:55:32,164
ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?

The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

824
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,002
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

825
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:39,880
I just need a little loan. Something...

What?

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,468
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

Something. A couple hundred. Few
hundred. Whatever you got.

You know I'm good for it.

That's what's left of Axelrod.

838
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:25,842
Where you been?
I told you to stay put.

839
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:27,928
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

840
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:30,264
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

841
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,433
He was just peppering Axelrod
with punches, but so fast.

842
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,228
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

843
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:38,063
He didn't even survive the first round.

844
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,481
Is that what you think boxing is?

845
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:41,733
Zeus beating up some piece
of steel that they feed him?

846
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,653
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

847
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,406
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

He's more than that. And if you'd
just get us a fight, you'd see.

You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

- [laughing] Two rounds.

Two rounds, son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

- What if he does?
- He ain't.

882

Let's just say he does.

883
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:25,147

- Check it out.

Incredibly amazing.

- Yeah.

I had to start over.

to use the spin frame from Ambush...

...and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy and it works.

- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart? It could be genius!

It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

- I might have had a few.

- Are you kidding me?

He's nowhere near advanced enough
to handle Noisy's voice command.

So he needs your moves.
Your commands.

You don't need me. Sorry.

take the ring, you should do it.

in front of a boxing crowd.

They had their personas.
They all had flair.

Now you? You might
not have much robot,

01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,143

you got flair.

Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

is people want to see that.

<i>really something,</i>

1088
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:14,744

<i>aside for a second</i>

1089

<i>Chaos. Wall Street.</i>
<i>One-Eyed Jack.</i>

1091
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,792
<i>No slouches on that list, right?</i>

1092
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:24,128
<i>But folks,</i>
<i>Atom's fought them all, beat them all.</i>

1093
01:14:24,295 --> 01:14:26,380
<i>[caller] I'm telling you, Tommy,</i>
<i>this bot is fast!</i>

1094
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:28,716
<i>He escapes shots from</i>

1095

<i>[DJ] No doubt, no doubt.</i>
<i>I'm telling you, listeners,</i>

1096
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:33,888

<i>[DJ] This bot is one to watch.</i>

1099
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:44,190
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

1100
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:46,359
Great fight, guys.

1101
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:47,860
- Kenton, you guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

1102
01:14:48,027 --> 01:14:49,904
Good enough, we'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

1103
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:51,864
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

1104
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:55,618
Right. Whoa.
That's a WRB... That's a League fight.

1105
01:14:55,785 --> 01:14:58,204
Damn right it is.
What do you say, fellas?

1106
01:14:58,371 --> 01:14:59,830
You ready for the show?

1107
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,708
Heck, yeah.

1108
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,460
[crowd clamoring]

1109
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:15,304
[Charlie] It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

1110
01:15:15,471 --> 01:15:18,516
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed, OK, Max.

1111
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:20,059
No freaking out.

1112
01:15:20,226 --> 01:15:21,602
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

1113
01:15:21,769 --> 01:15:24,105
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

1114
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:26,273
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.

1115
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,858
You got to have fun,
you understand me?

1116
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:30,027
We've come too far to get out there

1117
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:31,987
and freak out
and blow this whole thing.

1118
01:15:32,154 --> 01:15:35,533
We're going to have fun, and we gonna...
we're gonna not freak out!

1119
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:39,078
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

1120
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:42,790
I tell ya, man, I've spent my whole life
waiting to get here. We're going to...

1121
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:47,753
Because, I tell ya what... Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

1122
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,423
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

1123
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:55,761
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

1124
01:15:55,928 --> 01:15:57,430
What was that? One more time.

1125
01:15:57,596 --> 01:16:00,015
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

1126
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:04,395
Sure. Yeah. Let's head
up to the champ's suite. Sure.

1127
01:16:27,293 --> 01:16:30,337
[hip hop music playing]

1128
01:16:33,382 --> 01:16:34,508
[Charlie] Wow.

1129
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:36,469
Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.

1130
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,596
Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton and...

1131
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:40,723
And this, of course,
is Tak Mashido.

1132
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:44,059
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

1133
01:16:44,226 --> 01:16:46,353
I know you have
a very important fight tonight,

1134
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,646
so I'll get right to it.

1135
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:49,565
It's a little far
from the action for my liking.

1136
01:16:49,732 --> 01:16:53,110
It's nice. I like it, though.
Very nicely...

1137
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:55,196
Wow, that is... That's a great shot.

1138
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:57,990
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind...

1139
01:16:58,157 --> 01:16:59,617
I'd like to buy your robot.

1140
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:03,996
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.

1141
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:06,165
And for that I'm willing to pay.

1142
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:10,211
$200,000.

1143
01:17:10,377 --> 01:17:12,505
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

1144
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:15,257
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

1145
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:17,384
You are 15 minutes away

1146
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:20,471
from getting in
the ring with Twin Cities,

1147
01:17:20,638 --> 01:17:22,389
a vicious League bot.

1148
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:26,060
So, to be clear, my offer stands

1149
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:27,811
until the starting bell.

1150
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:30,397
OK. And just to be clear,

1151
01:17:30,564 --> 01:17:32,191
he's not for sale!

1152
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:34,860
Not now, not ever.

1153
01:17:35,027 --> 01:17:37,821
Listen, give me
a minute to clear this up, OK?

1154
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:40,824
Tak, how are you? Max!

1155
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,579
Max. Max. Be smart.
I know you love him

1156
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:48,123
but in 20 minutes there
may be nothing left to love.

1157
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:50,459
Think about it.
Take the offer.

1158
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:52,920
You think about it.
Why does she want Atom?

1159
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:55,631
Huh? Because he's
different from other bots!

1160
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:57,424
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller and weaker,

1161
01:17:57,591 --> 01:17:58,676
and he's going
to get his ass kicked.

1162
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:03,264
He's a boxer. We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

1163
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,391
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

1164
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:08,811
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

1165
01:18:08,978 --> 01:18:11,897
Charlie, we can go round and round
this all night long.

1166
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,524
Look at me, look at me.

1167
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:16,151
But it's not going to happen.

1168
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:18,737
I got a fight to get to.

1169
01:18:33,335 --> 01:18:37,006

- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

1186
01:20:43,382 --> 01:20:45,634
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

1187
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:47,469
All right, now this bot
is tough to put down.

1188
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:48,595
Atom can do it.

1189
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:53,016
Max, look over there. You see those
geeks with the joysticks and consoles?

1190
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:54,435
They're controlling everything
their bot does.

1191
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,520
They're monitoring his systems,
seeing what he sees,

1192
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:58,105
stadium feeds of the fights, everything.

This is the League. Stand on that.

1195
01:21:02,818 --> 01:21:04,361
So what do we do?

1196
01:21:05,112 --> 01:21:08,615
We fight smart,
we be patient. And pray.

1197

Too many hits.
He's taking too many hits.

1213

Come on, Charlie. He's getting killed
in there! Tell him what to do!

1216
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:15,474
That guy's got two heads, and about a
foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.

1217
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:17,434
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

1218
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:24,691
Wait, wait, wait.

1219
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,153
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

1220
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,823
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

- So?
- We got him! See? Here it comes again!

Backstep. Lean right.

Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

Got to get in close where he can't use
that size and reach on us!

Left to the body! Right to the body!

Stay on him! Lunging right!

No!

1238

This is not happening.

I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

and using your
money to control this sport...

1272

- [Charlie] That's it!
- Wait, I'm not done.

1273
01:24:59,596 --> 01:25:02,683
Why not give
the littlest guy the biggest shot?

1274
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:06,645
Seriously, because I bet if you give him
a shot, he'll surprise you!

1275

Wouldn't you
like to see a little guy get a shot

Yeah! OK!

That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

1288
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:00,741
That's one thing to call it.

1289
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,409
I think a lot of people would
like to see that fight.

1290
01:26:02,576 --> 01:26:05,287
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

1291
01:26:05,454 --> 01:26:07,164
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

1292
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:09,082
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

1293
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:12,419
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

1294
01:26:12,586 --> 01:26:14,546
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

1295
01:26:14,713 --> 01:26:16,923
I told you
we shouldn't have sold him.

1296
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,302
OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right?

1297
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:22,721
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

1298
01:26:22,888 --> 01:26:24,806
All right, all right. All right.

1299
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:28,351
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

1300
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:31,104
[Charlie] That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

1301

- Whoo! All right, we set?
- Yeah.

- All right, let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,659
I actually really
was going to call you.

1305
01:26:44,826 --> 01:26:46,453
Don't worry about that.

1306
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,538
That was a heck of a fight.

1307
01:26:48,705 --> 01:26:51,083
Congratulations to both of you.
That was really good.

1308
01:26:51,249 --> 01:26:54,211
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

- Come on, man.
- What?

1310
01:26:56,713 --> 01:27:00,759
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

1311
01:27:00,926 --> 01:27:02,594
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

1312
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:05,847
He thought that was a joke.
How about that? It wasn't a joke.

1313
01:27:06,014 --> 01:27:10,185
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

I'm sure you do, Charlie, but...

1315
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:16,149
...but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,443
All right. What do you want?

1317

You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

- Yeah, right.

Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

Well, buddy, that will teach him.

- Max, just...

Is it Farra?
She called you, didn't she?

1343
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:52,472
- We're going to get the Zeus fight.
- Listen, it's not the Zeus people.

all this, and...

so you call her to come and get me?

I told you he couldn't take care of him!

Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

We're fine. She can leave!

And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

You tell me, what can I do?

Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

What's going on?

He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

I'm going to wait in the car.

1375

You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

01:31:48,505 --> 01:31:50,382
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

1377
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:55,595
You knew from day one what this was.
You decided to take the ride.

Will you say something, please?

1384
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:26,167
I tried, OK. What do you want from me?

1385
01:32:26,334 --> 01:32:28,044
I want you to fight for me.

01:34:46,558 --> 01:34:49,477
Did you not see
the way he looked at you?

1393
01:34:49,644 --> 01:34:51,771
Charlie, that's the way
I looked at my dad.

1394
01:34:51,938 --> 01:34:54,315
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

1395
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:59,237
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

1396
01:34:59,404 --> 01:35:00,989
Me, come on. I blew it.

1397
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:04,450
I blew it.

1398
01:35:05,577 --> 01:35:07,203
When Max was born I just...

1399
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:09,205
...freaked out.

1400
01:35:09,372 --> 01:35:11,624
But something
would have been better than nothing.

1401
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:12,917
I just wouldn't know where to start.

1402
01:35:13,084 --> 01:35:14,252
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

1403
01:35:14,419 --> 01:35:15,753
- You do.
- No.

1404
01:35:16,588 --> 01:35:17,880
You do.

1405
01:35:50,872 --> 01:35:52,081
I got to go.

1406
01:35:55,043 --> 01:35:56,711
Twelve-hundred miles for a kiss.

1407
01:35:58,129 --> 01:36:00,506
Worth it. Worth it.

1408
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:13,519
Go get him, Charlie.

1409
01:36:16,898 --> 01:36:18,316
You sound like your dad.

1410
01:36:40,463 --> 01:36:42,340
Hey.

1411
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:50,431
OK. Uh, look,
I know you think I abandoned you

1412
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:53,434
and I guess I did originally.

1413
01:36:53,601 --> 01:36:56,354
- Then you sold me.
- [Debra] Charlie.

1414
01:36:56,521 --> 01:36:59,399
- Hey.
- You have no business being here.

1415
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:01,984
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

1416
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:04,612
And I know I've done
all kinds of wrong by this kid,

1417
01:37:04,779 --> 01:37:06,948
but if you'll let me...

1418
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:10,326
...I'd just like to
do one thing right.

1419
01:37:13,162 --> 01:37:14,247
Right.

1420
01:37:15,873 --> 01:37:17,625
- Now, where were we?
- You sold me.

1421
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:21,087
- Right, yeah, that happened.
- Wait, what?

1422
01:37:21,254 --> 01:37:23,923
- Then we had our asses kicked.
- And you slept on a shelf in a truck,

1423
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:25,383
- and it was awful.
- And dangerous.

1424
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:30,471
Really dangerous. I mean, I know.
God. I'm sorry.

1425
01:37:31,472 --> 01:37:34,434
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

1426
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,936
No. I mean yes. Yes.

1427
01:37:39,856 --> 01:37:41,357
But no.

1428
01:37:41,524 --> 01:37:44,360
No, I came to
tell you that I heard you.

1429
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:48,740
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

1430
01:37:48,906 --> 01:37:53,035
I know you had a bum ride, Max, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

1431
01:37:54,245 --> 01:37:55,455
I should have been.

1432
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:58,958
Your mom was...

1433
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:00,376
She was cool, wasn't she?

1434
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:03,546
She was.

1435
01:38:03,713 --> 01:38:05,757
She was the coolest.

1436
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:08,468
Yeah, she was.

1437
01:38:11,637 --> 01:38:13,639
And I'm sorry about...

1438
01:38:15,641 --> 01:38:17,560
...what happened with her.

1439
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:24,192
And I can't get those years back,
Max, but...

1440
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:26,986
...but I'm here right now...

1441
01:38:27,153 --> 01:38:30,740
...and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

1442
01:38:44,462 --> 01:38:46,214
We got the Zeus fight.

1443
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,176
- What?
- No, no, we didn't.

1444
01:38:50,343 --> 01:38:52,970
You got the Zeus fight.

1445
01:38:56,474 --> 01:38:59,727
So what do you say, Debra?
Can we do this one last thing?

1446
01:39:03,231 --> 01:39:04,398
One night.

1447
01:39:04,565 --> 01:39:06,025
One night.
It's all we need. Thank you.

1448
01:39:10,822 --> 01:39:14,742
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

1449
01:39:14,909 --> 01:39:16,118
Yeah?

1450
01:39:16,285 --> 01:39:17,954
What do you say?

1451
01:39:19,914 --> 01:39:21,999
<i>[announcer] Welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to New York's Bing Arena</i>

1452

<i>a true David versus Goliath spectacle.</i>

1459
01:39:41,853 --> 01:39:45,356
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

1460
01:39:45,523 --> 01:39:48,109
The greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt

1461
01:39:48,276 --> 01:39:50,319
to a G-2 named Atom?

1462
01:39:50,486 --> 01:39:54,240
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

1463
01:39:54,407 --> 01:39:56,659
[Tim] Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena

1464
01:39:56,826 --> 01:39:59,829
but he has made no bones about
his disdain for this matchup.

1465
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:02,790
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

1466
01:40:02,957 --> 01:40:05,710
Take a look at this clip. Mashido
wouldn't even stop to talk to the press,

1467
01:40:05,877 --> 01:40:09,338
<i>referring only to this fight</i>
<i>as an insult to his creation.</i>

1468
01:40:09,505 --> 01:40:11,591
Now, in truth, Herb, Max Kenton,
Atom's trainer,

1469
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,175
did more
than just challenge Zeus.

1470
01:40:13,342 --> 01:40:14,760
He did so publicly.

1471
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:18,347
The challenge went viral and
created a PR nightmare for the champ.

1472
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:20,725
No argument there, Tim.
And I think the Zeus camp

1473
01:40:20,892 --> 01:40:23,853
- knows exactly what they're doing.
- That they do. I mean, come on.

1474
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,939
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

1475
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:30,276
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

1476
01:40:30,443 --> 01:40:33,112
And, hey, judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

1477
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:35,781
[reporters clamoring]

1478
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,128
We can't win, can we?

1479
01:40:50,212 --> 01:40:51,297
We'll see.

1480
01:40:55,384 --> 01:40:57,762
[Tim] As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

1481
01:40:57,929 --> 01:40:59,889
you can hear
the surge of excitement, Herb.

1482

[crowd cheers]

1483
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:14,946
[Herb] Atom has arrived onto
the WRB scene with a vengeance,

1484
01:41:15,112 --> 01:41:17,823
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

1485
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:20,409
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

1486
01:41:20,576 --> 01:41:22,828
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

1487
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:25,831
and the look on Farra Lemkova's face
says it all.

1488
01:41:25,998 --> 01:41:27,792
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

1489
01:41:27,959 --> 01:41:30,920
I'm giving 1-to-5 odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

1490
01:41:31,087 --> 01:41:33,089
Now who wants some?

1491
01:41:33,255 --> 01:41:34,590
[Ricky] I'll take some of that action.

1492
01:41:34,757 --> 01:41:38,928
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

1493
01:41:39,095 --> 01:41:42,223
How's it going... partner?

1494
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:44,350
Partner?

1495
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:47,436
That's great. How about a
hundred K deep? Is that funny?

1496
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:50,439
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

1497
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,358
You carrying
around that kind of scratch?

1498
01:41:53,526 --> 01:41:55,778
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

1499
01:41:56,612 --> 01:42:00,574
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C

1500
01:42:00,741 --> 01:42:03,661
and you can bring me my money
right to my seat.

You heard me, homey.

01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:10,960
- Homey?
- Right?

And in the corner to my left,

the undeniable champion
of this universe

Push up! Stand up!

1541
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:07,052
[Herb] But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

1542
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:10,306
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

time in less than ten seconds.

- That's my boy right there!

01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:19,982
Get up and get in the game!

1546
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:23,152
Come on!
No, please Atom, get up! Please!

1547
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:26,071
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1548
01:45:27,239 --> 01:45:30,201
[Tim] Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

1549
01:45:31,619 --> 01:45:32,953
Lean back! Lean back!

1550
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,080
[Herb] Atom's getting pummelled
into the corner!

1551
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:37,499
- Get out of there, Atom!
- Move, Atom, move!

1552
01:45:39,793 --> 01:45:41,837
[Tim] A demolishing inside shot.

1553
01:45:42,004 --> 01:45:43,214
Get your hands up!

1554
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,800
Hands up!

1555
01:45:47,593 --> 01:45:49,094
Crush that little can!

1556
01:45:49,261 --> 01:45:50,596
Get out of the corner!
Get out of the corner!

1557
01:45:50,763 --> 01:45:52,932
[Herb] Charlie Kenton desperately
trying to command his robot

1558
01:45:53,098 --> 01:45:54,058
out of that suicide corner.

1559
01:45:54,225 --> 01:45:55,559
Cover up!

1560
01:45:58,437 --> 01:46:00,189
[groans] Get your feet under you!

1561
01:46:01,774 --> 01:46:03,776
[Tim] Good night, sparring bot!

1562
01:46:03,943 --> 01:46:06,487
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

1563
01:46:06,654 --> 01:46:10,074
[Herb] Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

1564
01:46:10,241 --> 01:46:12,409
- Stand up!
- [crowd chanting] Two!

1565
01:46:12,576 --> 01:46:15,371
- Three!
- C'mon, Atom, get up!

1566
01:46:15,537 --> 01:46:17,706
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

1567
01:46:17,873 --> 01:46:21,043
- [referee] Six! Seven!
- Get up!

1568
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,754
[crowd continues] Eight! Nine!

1569
01:46:23,921 --> 01:46:26,632
[Tim] I don't believe this!
Against all odds,

1570
01:46:26,799 --> 01:46:28,634
this little bot is on his feet again.

1571
01:46:29,802 --> 01:46:30,844
Come on, Atom!

1572
01:46:34,056 --> 01:46:35,224
He can't survive this!

1573
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:41,272
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

1574
01:46:42,564 --> 01:46:45,317
[Tim] Atom has landed a punch!

1575
01:46:45,484 --> 01:46:48,153
[Herb] Zeus is stunned as he reels back
from an uppercut

1576
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,323
- that he clearly never saw coming!
- Advance!

1577
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:54,243
Fade back, counter right!

1578
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,245
Fade back, counter right!

1579
01:46:56,412 --> 01:46:58,831
Right cross! Right cross!

1580
01:46:58,998 --> 01:47:00,749
Right cross! Left hook!

1581
01:47:00,916 --> 01:47:03,794
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

1582
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:04,837
Double right to the body!

1583
01:47:05,004 --> 01:47:06,714
[Tim] For the first time
in his dominant run,

1584
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,426
Zeus has met a bot who simply
won't back down!

1585
01:47:10,592 --> 01:47:12,219
[crowd cheers]

1586
01:47:12,386 --> 01:47:15,097
[Herb] The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

1587
01:47:15,264 --> 01:47:18,017
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

1588
01:47:18,183 --> 01:47:22,354
[Tim] Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

1589
01:47:22,521 --> 01:47:25,441
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

1590
01:47:25,607 --> 01:47:28,652
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

1591
01:47:32,323 --> 01:47:35,534
[Herb] Only five seconds left,
as here comes that monster

1592
01:47:35,701 --> 01:47:37,286
piston-packed right of the champ!

1593
01:47:37,453 --> 01:47:38,620
[bell rings]

1594
01:47:38,787 --> 01:47:42,875
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

1595
01:47:43,042 --> 01:47:45,627
- He made it!
- [Herb] We will have a second round.

1596
01:47:45,794 --> 01:47:48,255
And the crowd here is thrilled!

1597
01:47:51,383 --> 01:47:53,302
He made it!

1598
01:47:53,469 --> 01:47:56,013
Yeah! Corner!

1599
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,723
We got to get out of here,
darling, come on.

1600
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:59,933
We got to get out of here right now!

1601
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:05,064
We got to go this way.
Come on!

1602
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:11,904
OK, you sit down.

1603
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:17,659
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

1604
01:48:17,826 --> 01:48:19,453
I'll be back for you, baby.

1605
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:22,498
Get your hands off me!

1606
01:48:25,376 --> 01:48:27,920
[Herb] Both corners furiously
working on their bots.

1607
01:48:28,087 --> 01:48:31,298
I tell you, Tim, this crowd came here
tonight expecting a massacre

1608
01:48:31,465 --> 01:48:33,592
but instead they're getting a war!

1609
01:48:33,759 --> 01:48:35,135
- You got it?
- [Max] Yeah.

1610
01:48:35,302 --> 01:48:38,555
- All right. Here we go.
- What is happening?

1611
01:48:38,722 --> 01:48:41,934
He is fully prepared
for all possible contingencies.

1612
01:48:42,101 --> 01:48:45,187
- He will be fine.
- What next?

1613
01:48:46,105 --> 01:48:47,439
Round two.

1614
01:48:48,482 --> 01:48:50,401
[rock music playing]

1615
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:57,241
- [bell rings]
- [Tim] Round two kicks off,

1616
01:48:57,408 --> 01:49:01,787
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,
is giving the champ a run for his money.

1617
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:06,542
[Herb] Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

1618
01:49:10,295 --> 01:49:12,548
[Tim] Kenton working his bot
with a trifecta

1619
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:15,259
of straight rights
to the champ's dome!

1620
01:49:20,347 --> 01:49:24,351
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

1621
01:49:27,438 --> 01:49:31,108
[Herb] Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

1622
01:49:33,944 --> 01:49:37,364
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

1623
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:40,367
This is a brawl!

1624
01:49:42,494 --> 01:49:43,996
[Tim] The crowd is on their feet,

1625
01:49:44,163 --> 01:49:47,082
watching two machines
driven to kill each other!

1626
01:49:47,249 --> 01:49:50,127
Something has to give,
and it does!

1627
01:49:50,294 --> 01:49:52,045
Atom goes down again!

1628
01:49:52,212 --> 01:49:54,214
[Herb] Lights out
for the junkyard dog

1629
01:49:54,381 --> 01:49:56,341
who put on a heck
of a show here tonight!

1630
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,054
[Tim] And yet again,
Atom rises up.

1631
01:50:01,221 --> 01:50:05,684
Kenton must have hardwired this bot
with the will to go on!

1632
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:17,029
Midway through round four, and Zeus is
looking to end this thing right now.

1633
01:50:17,196 --> 01:50:18,906
[Herb] The champ
is holding nothing back

1634
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:21,116
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

1635
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,124
[electronic whirring]

1636
01:50:31,835 --> 01:50:33,587
[Herb] Atom is
stumbling around the ring,

1637
01:50:33,754 --> 01:50:35,547
apparently disoriented and dazed!

1638
01:50:35,714 --> 01:50:37,216
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

1639
01:50:37,382 --> 01:50:38,759
I think the voice recog is shot!

1640
01:50:38,926 --> 01:50:40,093
- He's not responding!
- What?

1641
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:46,141
[Herb] Zeus has found
yet another gear of violence,

1642
01:50:46,308 --> 01:50:48,227
drilling Atom's midsection.

1643
01:50:48,393 --> 01:50:52,648
- No! Stop! Do something!
- He can't hear me!

1644
01:50:52,814 --> 01:50:54,024
[bell rings]

1645
01:50:54,191 --> 01:50:56,276
[Tim] But the bell sounds,
and once again,

1646
01:50:56,443 --> 01:50:59,112
this little robot
has stunned the world!

1647
01:51:01,448 --> 01:51:04,117
We're done, Max!
He can't hear me.

1648
01:51:04,284 --> 01:51:06,411
This is murder.
We've had enough.

1649
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,956
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- So what? He can't hear me!

1650
01:51:09,122 --> 01:51:11,500
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

1651
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:15,587
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

1652
01:51:15,754 --> 01:51:18,215
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

1653
01:51:18,382 --> 01:51:22,344
- No way. No way!
- Look at them. They are freaking out!

1654
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:24,346
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

1655
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:26,598
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

1656
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:28,934
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

1657
01:51:29,101 --> 01:51:30,811
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

1658
01:51:30,978 --> 01:51:34,189
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1659
01:51:34,898 --> 01:51:38,443
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

1660
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:43,031
- Don't ask me. Don't.
- Charlie... please.

1661
01:51:43,824 --> 01:51:45,492
I beg you.

1662
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,960
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

1663
01:51:56,795 --> 01:52:00,090
- Damn it!
- Yes!

1664
01:52:00,257 --> 01:52:02,676
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1665
01:52:02,843 --> 01:52:05,345
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

1666
01:52:05,512 --> 01:52:06,763
but I know you're in there!

1667
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:09,182
- Come on, Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

1668
01:52:12,728 --> 01:52:17,524
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

1669
01:52:17,899 --> 01:52:20,110
Watch... me.

1670
01:52:20,277 --> 01:52:23,822
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

1671
01:52:25,032 --> 01:52:26,700
Watch me.

1672
01:52:27,034 --> 01:52:28,952
An epic battle
being waged here tonight,

1673
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:31,246
as the fifth
and final round gets underway.

1674
01:52:31,413 --> 01:52:33,081
Come on, Atom!

1675
01:52:42,716 --> 01:52:44,968
[Tim] Wait a second, Herb.
Are you seeing this?

1676
01:52:45,135 --> 01:52:48,221
Charlie Kenton
is shadowboxing just outside the ring!

1677
01:52:48,388 --> 01:52:50,641
[Herb] Tim, it looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

1678
01:52:50,807 --> 01:52:53,435
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

1679
01:52:53,602 --> 01:52:56,563
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

1680
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:58,940
[Tim] Well, I tell you what, it doesn't
seem to be much help,

1681
01:52:59,107 --> 01:53:01,193
because Atom is backed up
against the ropes again.

1682
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:04,946
Charlie, help him! Fight back!

1683
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:06,365
Not yet.

1684
01:53:08,909 --> 01:53:13,538
[Tim] Tak Mashido supervising
personally as Zeus hammers down,

1685
01:53:13,705 --> 01:53:17,584
furiously trying
to end this thing once and for all.

1686
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:20,754
[Herb] I got to tell you,
folks, the champ looks tired.

1687
01:53:20,921 --> 01:53:23,215
This robot
seems to be running on empty.

1688
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:29,304
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

1689
01:53:29,471 --> 01:53:33,100
- Switch to turbo!
- [Herb] He's actually asking for more.

1690
01:53:35,018 --> 01:53:36,561
Please do something!

1691
01:53:36,728 --> 01:53:39,147
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

1692
01:53:41,858 --> 01:53:43,318
Nitrous pistons, now!

1693
01:53:46,446 --> 01:53:48,448
Charlie, he's not going
to last much longer!

1694
01:53:48,615 --> 01:53:50,992
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

1695
01:53:51,159 --> 01:53:52,411
Hang in there!

1696
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:55,622
[Tim] Atom is riddled
with the nitrous-fuelled

1697
01:53:55,789 --> 01:53:59,000
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

1698
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:02,879
[crowd chanting] Atom! Atom!
Atom! Atom!

1699
01:54:03,046 --> 01:54:06,174
[chanting continues]

1700
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:08,552
Wait him out,
wait him out! Not yet!

1701
01:54:11,138 --> 01:54:13,140
[Herb] Zeus is slowing down!

1702
01:54:13,306 --> 01:54:16,059
Tim, the champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

1703
01:54:16,226 --> 01:54:17,394
Charlie, please!

1704
01:54:19,646 --> 01:54:22,607
- Hey, kid. Now.
- Now!

1705
01:54:25,944 --> 01:54:27,154
[electronic beeping]

1706
01:54:28,447 --> 01:54:29,573
Get in there!
Don't let him breathe!

1707
01:54:31,992 --> 01:54:34,286
Knock that little bitch!
Bust him open!

1708
01:54:43,253 --> 01:54:44,546
Yeah! That's right!

1709
01:54:44,713 --> 01:54:46,006
[electronic beeping]

1710
01:54:46,173 --> 01:54:47,424
Do something!

1711
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:49,342
Move!

1712
01:54:50,844 --> 01:54:53,180
Override. Switching to manual.

1713
01:54:55,265 --> 01:54:57,976
[Herb] In a shocking move,
Tak Mashido is manually

1714
01:54:58,143 --> 01:55:00,020
operating his robot personally!

1715
01:55:10,572 --> 01:55:12,073
Work the body! Get inside him!

1716
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,241
Get him, Atom!

1717
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:17,329
[Herb] Look at this!
The champ is trying

1718
01:55:17,496 --> 01:55:21,333
desperately to stay on his feet
but Kenton is relentless,

1719
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,920
landing blow after blow
after blow to the body!

1720
01:56:07,128 --> 01:56:09,297
[Tim] Left! Right! Left! Right!

1721
01:56:09,464 --> 01:56:12,759
A huge uppercut by Atom!

1722
01:56:12,926 --> 01:56:14,761
Zeus is down!

1723
01:56:17,472 --> 01:56:20,475
- Yeah!
- [Tim] This little bot

1724
01:56:20,642 --> 01:56:25,397
has dug deep here tonight
and shown something damn near heart!

1725
01:56:25,564 --> 01:56:29,693
[referee] One, two, three,

1726
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:34,739
four, five, six, seven...

1727
01:56:34,906 --> 01:56:35,907
He's good!

1728
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:37,242
[Tim] Zeus gets to his feet.

1729
01:56:37,409 --> 01:56:39,578
[Herb] But Kenton has
Atom on him again,

1730
01:56:39,744 --> 01:56:42,247
landing punch after punch!

1731
01:56:42,414 --> 01:56:44,624
[Tim] Tak Mashido
and his super bot have no answer.

1732
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:47,752
[Herb] Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

1733
01:56:47,919 --> 01:56:50,171
[Tim] It all comes down to this, folks!

1734
01:56:50,338 --> 01:56:52,173
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

1735
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:54,384
[Herb] Kenton
is about to drop the champ...

1736
01:56:54,551 --> 01:56:56,386
No! There's the bell!

1737
01:56:56,553 --> 01:56:59,306
[Tim] Zeus is saved by the bell!

1738
01:56:59,472 --> 01:57:02,225
[crowd cheers wildly]

1739
01:57:04,102 --> 01:57:05,353
No!

1740
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,523
[Herb] Amazingly, Tim,
we will go to the judges' cards!

1741
01:57:19,576 --> 01:57:21,703
Now, go on.

1742
01:57:22,037 --> 01:57:25,957
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

1743
01:57:26,124 --> 01:57:28,793
we go to the judges' scorecards.

1744
01:57:32,756 --> 01:57:37,177
Judge Number One
scores the fight 47-48.

1745
01:57:37,344 --> 01:57:42,265
Judge Number Two
scores the fight 48-46.

1746
01:57:42,432 --> 01:57:47,062
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46

1747
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:52,400
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

1748
01:57:52,567 --> 01:57:54,945
Zeus!

1749
01:57:56,571 --> 01:57:58,156
[crowd booing]

1750
01:58:00,283 --> 01:58:04,454
Farra... Farra...
Farra Lemkova...

1751
01:58:04,621 --> 01:58:06,957
...you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

1752
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:09,334
Some would say
that your bot won the decision

1753
01:58:09,501 --> 01:58:11,086
but lost the fight.

1754
01:58:11,252 --> 01:58:12,629
Oh, she looks pissed.

1755
01:58:12,796 --> 01:58:15,423
It took a little longer
than we thought,

1756
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:18,927
but the result is as expected.

1757
01:58:19,761 --> 01:58:21,012
We won.

1758
01:58:21,805 --> 01:58:24,683
Zeus is still undefeated.

1759
01:58:27,435 --> 01:58:29,854
Tak... Tak Mashido... Tak...

1760
01:58:30,021 --> 01:58:32,857
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

1761
01:58:33,024 --> 01:58:34,651
your bot suffered tonight?

1762
01:58:37,654 --> 01:58:40,073
- Nothing.
- No comment.

1763
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:41,658
Max. Where's Max?

1764
01:58:41,825 --> 01:58:42,909
Max, let's go, go.

1765
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:48,081
There he is. Max. Max.

1766
01:58:48,248 --> 01:58:52,293
They're already calling
your bot "the people's champion."

1767
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,963
Yeah!

1768
01:58:55,130 --> 01:58:57,090
Max, what do you say to that?

1769
01:58:58,049 --> 01:58:59,509
People's champion?

1770
01:59:02,095 --> 01:59:03,930
Sounds pretty good to me.

1771
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:06,516
[crowd cheers wildly]

1772
01:59:09,394 --> 01:59:11,604
Dad? Dad!

1773
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:14,024
Max! Max! Max!

1774
01:59:15,483 --> 01:59:16,651
- Max!
- Dad!

1775
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,412
Max... Max, I...

1776
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:29,080
I really want you to know...

1777
01:59:29,247 --> 01:59:31,416
No, I need you to know.

1778
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:34,544
Don't worry.

1779
01:59:36,087 --> 01:59:37,547
Your secret's safe with me.

1780
01:59:44,637 --> 01:59:46,181
Wait here. Wait here.

1781
01:59:50,852 --> 01:59:52,437
[Atom whirrs]

1782
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,654
[Charlie] Up!

1783
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:10,371
- [crowd cheering]
- [Charlie] Yes!

1784
02:00:10,538 --> 02:00:12,332
Yeah!

1785
02:00:31,226 --> 02:00:34,729
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1786
02:00:36,106 --> 02:00:38,274
[Charlie] Yeah!

1787
