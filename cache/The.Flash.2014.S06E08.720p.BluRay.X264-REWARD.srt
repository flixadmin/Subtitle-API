1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,311
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:05,382
<i>So, this is where
you've been hiding.</i>

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:09,219
<i>I think you're afraid
to use your powers,</i>

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,721
because you think you'll become
like someone you hate.

5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,325
I know you're doing it for all of us.
That's what it means to be a hero.

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,451
I knew I picked the right guy.

7
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,119
- He's gonna die.
- Frost, how do we save him?

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't know! I can't fix this!

9
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,898
Accepting Ramsey's blood would save
your body, but not your soul.

10
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,525
You would lose the best of you.

11
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:24,901
<i>The part of you that Iris loves.</i>

12
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:25,902
That's not Barry.

13
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:26,903
Barry?

14
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:32,992
The entire world will embrace...

15
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,619
Bloodwork!

16
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,921
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,114
I don't understand. That wasn't Barry.

18
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,431
Yeah, it was.

19
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,766
Ramsey turned him
into one of his Blood Brothers.

20
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,990
Babel Protocols initiated.

21
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,783
What's "Babel Protocols"?

22
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,470
I thought that was just some defense
stuff that you added to Barry's suit.

23
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,537
That was version one.

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,956
Version 2.0 puts up a forcefield
around S.T.A.R. Labs.

25
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,876
Nothing gets in, nothing goes out.
Not even our comms.

26
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,711
I built them just in case...

27
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,173
Just in case the Flash ever went dark.

28
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,258
Barry said that Ramsey
gave him a choice. Why...

29
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:31,760
Why would he choose this?

30
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:35,180
Maybe he decided eternal life
was better than dying in Crisis.

31
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,556
Ramsey's using Barry.

32
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,850
And whatever he's having him do,
he's got a plan.

33
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,878
You have a police scanner?

34
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,987
I'm hoping that since this thing
transmits in analog,

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,907
we can figure out what's going on
outside S.T.A.R. Labs.

36
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,908
I don't get it.

37
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,577
Why didn't Ramsey just have
Barry kill us as soon as he woke up?

38
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,622
I don't know,
but don't count us out yet.

39
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,304
You know that tech I've been working on?

40
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,210
- Meet the photon emitter.
- So, what, you built a ray gun?

41
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:08,505
It's not a ray gun. It's a weapon
that can deliver mega doses

42
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:11,090
of photon radiation,
the same kind of radiation

43
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,259
typically administered
to cancer patients.

44
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,761
What exactly does it do?

45
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,056
My theory is that these photons
could be strong enough

46
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,476
to destroy Ramsey's sentient infection.

47
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,037
If I get close enough to blast him,

48
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,729
he should revert back to his human form.

49
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,957
He'd still have HLH,
but at least he wouldn't be

50
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,067
a gooey zombie overlord anymore.

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,212
What about everyone else that was
infected? Would they be cured?

52
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,947
Yes. They'd lose the goo,
they'd go back to normal.

53
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,659
But since Ramsey's the only one
who can create more Blood Brothers,

54
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,829
I say we hit him first, then Dark Flash.

55
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,498
And you've tested this?

56
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,834
Well, I haven't even finished
building it,

57
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,877
so no... No, I haven't tested it.

58
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,188
So, let me get this straight.

59
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,589
You wanna shoot radiation at my husband

60
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,300
out of some crazy powerful device
that you've never tested?

61
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,719
Iris, this is the only plan we have.

62
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:58,429
This could kill Barry, Cisco.

63
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,032
<i>Is anyone there? Please, help me!</i>

64
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:03,101
<i>The city's being overrun!
I'm using a police officer's radio.</i>

65
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,894
<i>He's turning into
some kind of a monster.</i>

66
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:06,288
<i>His eyes are black.</i>

67
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,689
Ramsey's spreading his infection.

68
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,108
That's why he took down
communications citywide.

69
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,903
Caitlin once said,
Ramsey's infection samples indicate

70
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:18,074
he needs his victims to be afraid
before he attacks them.

71
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,544
Hey, is your Internet working?

72
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:33,840
- What's with the lights?
- I don't know.

73
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,216
Who's that?

74
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,728
Get inside. Get inside.

75
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,315
He looks like he has rabies
or something.

76
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,918
Mitch Romero. You remember the mobster

77
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:53,502
that Ramsey turned into a Blood Brother?

78
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,320
Well, Joe said that he looked
just like that.

79
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,446
Come here.

80
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,699
What... What do we do?

81
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,327
We gotta get out of this building.

82
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,961
Run!

83
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,416
Freeze!

84
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,420
<i>Remember, these people are innocent!</i>

85
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,672
<i>Nonlethal force only!</i>

86
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,521
Your efforts
are in vain, Captain.

87
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:27,477
I'm going to transform this city
by dawn, and you can't stop me.

88
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,440
Stand down, Dr. Rosso.

89
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,110
Rosso is my human name,
and he had human plans.

90
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:39,822
My name is Bloodwork now,
and I am not alone.

91
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,045
Flash, this isn't you.

92
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,965
Whatever happened to you,
we will fix it.

93
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,550
It's humanity that needs fixing.

94
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,563
Why would he let that happen?

95
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,065
'Cause this isn't Barry anymore.

96
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,445
Ramsey, whatever the hell your plan is,
we will stop you.

97
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,700
I've already done it.
I've cured death. But not for you.

98
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,996
Continue our mission.

99
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,831
Kill them.

100
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,540
I'm coming for you.

101
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,274
<i>You seek the truth.</i>

102
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,366
Novu.

103
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,579
<i>If you wish to know all,
show your allegiance,</i>

104
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,372
<i>and all will be revealed.</i>

105
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,126
Yeah, that sounds great. Oh, wait, no.
I don't barter with false gods!

106
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,770
<i>Bow down to me...</i>

107
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:20,673
<i>And all you desire
shall be yours.</i>

108
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,216
Let me in.

109
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,593
Let me in!

110
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,219
<i>Bow down to me!</i>

111
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,224
Planet after planet, Earth after Earth,

112
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:33,770
I've tracked you, Novu,
and you think some paltry mind games

113
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,980
and a little rock wall is gonna stop me?

114
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,775
You've got another thing coming.
I'm coming for you,

115
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,777
and you can't stop me!

116
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,536
Hmm.

117
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,334
What's this now?
Punishment from an angry god...

118
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:00,630
or simply faulty wiring.

119
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,717
I say, let there be light.

120
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,429
Still nothing.

121
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,190
Hey, girl, we got this.

122
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,610
We just need to get to the end
of the hallway, to the stairwell.

123
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,655
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I can't.

124
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,990
- I can't even move.
- What's wrong?

125
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,282
Fear.

126
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,329
There's so much fear, and I can feel it.

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,557
And I think there must be
other people in the building.

128
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,251
Place is empty.
No one else is working this late.

129
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,479
It's everywhere! And I can't...

130
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,339
I can't stop it,
and I can't keep it out of my head!

131
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,050
Okay, okay, okay.
I believe you. I believe you.

132
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:49,762
Cisco told me that Ramsey needs
his victims to be scared

133
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:50,948
for the infection to take.

134
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,057
Something about
a fear-related amino acid.

135
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,146
What if you're feeling
what those zombies are feeling?

136
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,438
The fear inside them.

137
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,108
Whatever it is, just make it stop.

138
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,318
Cecile, don't you get it?

139
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:08,531
You're a fricking zombie detector.
You're our way out of here.

140
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,512
<i>We've got another 207 downtown.</i>

141
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,371
<i>All available units respond!</i>

142
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,082
207 is an abduction.

143
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,835
There's been ten of those
in the last five minutes.

144
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,254
<i>Iris,
I know you're listening.</i>

145
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,104
<i>I need to see you.</i>

146
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,967
<i>Meet me where our life together began.</i>

147
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,844
<i>Where you said yes.</i>

148
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,764
Iris, that's not him.

149
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,559
That might sound like Barry,
it might even look like him,

150
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,102
but that is Dark Flash.

151
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,147
You don't know that.
What if Barry is still alive in there?

152
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,357
What if it's a trap, all right?

153
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,335
We don't even have comms.
It's too risky.

154
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,486
Listen to me.
I just need to look him in his eyes.

155
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,090
If the emitter doesn't work on Ramsey,

156
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,907
I get to come back
and try something else.

157
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,242
But if you go out there,
and that's not Barry,

158
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,119
you could get infected, or worse!

159
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,502
Please.

160
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,347
In sickness and in health.

161
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,643
Iris. Iris!

162
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,362
Barry?

163
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,199
Yes, Iris?

164
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:35,992
It's me.

165
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,289
And so much more.

166
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:54,511
Ramsey.

167
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,555
Neat little trick, huh?

168
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,809
Don't you see now, Iris?

169
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,352
Come on.

170
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,780
<i>My control over
my Blood Brothers</i>

171
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,115
<i>and Sisters is absolute.</i>

172
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:18,411
As more cured souls accept my lifeblood,

173
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,956
they become extensions
of one collective body.

174
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:23,832
Mine.

175
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,751
You asked me here. Why?

176
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,962
To offer you a chance.

177
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,799
Barry would want you to follow him
down this path he chose.

178
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,051
- No.
- The path of life.

179
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,512
You aren't saving lives, Ramsey.

180
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,848
You're destroying
what makes one beautiful.

181
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,228
Barry, I know you can hear me.

182
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,357
And you can hear
when I tell you that I love you.

183
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,319
And after everything
that we've been through together...

184
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,199
I know that this is not
how our story ends.

185
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,161
Come home to me.

186
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,918
Why would Barry come home to you?

187
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,130
You accepted his death in Crisis
as inevitable.

188
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,467
What kind of wife is willing
to bury her husband?

189
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,427
Iris, get out of there.

190
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,399
In good time.

191
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:32,818
This is not over.

192
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,155
Trust me, Iris.

193
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,971
Are you okay?

194
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,391
No.

195
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,353
I piggybacked the audio
off the extrapolator.

196
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,108
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,573
I have to try again.

198
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,657
Iris.

199
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,828
He almost killed you.

200
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,039
- We can't just give up, Cisco.
- We're not.

201
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,000
But if we're gonna take down
Bloodwork and Dark Flash,

202
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,710
we need to do it with a photon emitter.

203
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,839
- You haven't even tested that thing.
- We have no time.

204
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,715
Maybe you don't remember,

205
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,860
but we actually have been preparing
for this for weeks.

206
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,678
No, we've been preparing for the Flash

207
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,639
to die trying to save this world,
not helping to destroy it.

208
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,142
It doesn't matter!
We were gonna lose him anyway!

209
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,939
This is the moment he prepared us for.

210
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,533
We still have four hours.
That is 240 minutes,

211
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,096
and I am not letting Ramsey take
a single one of those from me.

212
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,371
I am not giving up on Barry.
He's my husband.

213
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,538
He was.

214
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,625
And he was my best friend.

215
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,837
And no one's giving up on anybody,

216
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,715
because there is nothing left
to give up on.

217
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,551
Iris, he's gone.

218
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,805
He was always gonna leave us.

219
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,810
And whether or not the emitter works,
it's not gonna change that.

220
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,191
The emitter's almost ready.

221
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,319
And when it is,
I'm gonna use it on Bloodwork,

222
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,529
and I'm gonna use it on Dark Flash.

223
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,501
Joe!

224
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,724
Just lie still.

225
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,526
- Get the hell away from her.
- Allegra.

226
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,445
Frost, is Captain West okay?

227
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,405
No. We need to get the hell out of here.

228
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,898
Let's go.

229
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,978
Get away. Get away from there.

230
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,171
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

231
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,232
Come on.

232
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,569
Wait!

233
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,908
Come on! Come on!

234
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,328
Oh, God. Help me!

235
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,728
That's not gonna hold for very long.

236
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,629
S.T.A.R. Labs is still ten blocks away.

237
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,382
Ten blocks. Ten blocks.
We can do it. Let's go.

238
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,053
Rise, my Blood Brother and Blood Sister.

239
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,846
You are cured.

240
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,641
Now you will never die.

241
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,952
Feel the burn, Bloodwork!

242
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,220
Is that all you've got, Mr. Ramon?

243
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,181
<i>- Too bad.</i>
- Cisco!

244
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,560
My lifeblood is a gift.

245
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,937
Are you ready to receive it?

246
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,066
No.

247
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,405
You have another purpose to serve.

248
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,532
The reckoning is near.

249
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,995
My army is almost ready
to march on S.T.A.R. Labs.

250
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,331
What the hell do you want
with S.T.A.R. Labs?

251
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,549
The particle accelerator.

252
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,595
The very tech you helped to create

253
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,931
will be the vessel
carrying my glorious cure.

254
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,602
Soon, all of Central City
will be granted eternal life.

255
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,731
And I choose you, Mr. Ramon,
to be my messenger.

256
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,231
Go.

257
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:31,028
Tell your team, the great
S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator

258
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,864
is ready to fulfil its true purpose.

259
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,202
- Salvation is nigh.
- An ass-whupping is nigh, pal.

260
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,248
And you're gonna lose, Ramsey.
You're gonna lose.

261
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,794
Plucky right up until the end.

262
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,215
I knew I picked the right guy.

263
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,094
Iris! If you're listening,

264
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,013
<i>I'm coming home!</i>

265
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,488
Look at this.

266
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,825
Ramsey wasn't lying.

267
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,035
Barry hacked the particle accelerator.

268
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,513
He was getting it ready for Bloodwork.

269
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,705
That's why he was pretending
to be Barry.

270
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,290
But why?

271
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,545
If Ramsey drops even just a tiny
amount of his blood into the core,

272
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,631
and it explodes,
the infectious cells will aerosolize,

273
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,692
and it would infect
all of Central City in seconds.

274
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,385
All you'd have to do is take a breath.

275
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:40,888
Dad!

276
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,560
Do something, Frost.

277
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,437
I can't. I can't handle this.

278
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,447
There's a lot of blood loss.
Looks like a nicked spleen.

279
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,868
Frost, I don't have the equipment I need
to close up this complicated of a wound,

280
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,452
but you can with your ice powers.

281
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,705
- <i>I can't.</i>
- Yes, you can.

282
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,041
- Frost, come on.
<i>- After Ralph and Barry...</i>

283
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,586
Frost, take control.

284
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,754
- <i>How?</i>
- Let yourself feel the fear,

285
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,217
count to three, and do it anyway.
Because that's what heroes do.

286
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,929
One, two...

287
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,561
Three.

288
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,081
You like that?

289
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,584
You like that?

290
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,072
For the record,
both our plans failed.

291
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,822
Yeah.

292
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,620
I just went in one direction,
while you went in the other,

293
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:29,122
instead of figuring out a plan together.

294
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,498
Yeah.

295
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,877
I should have made that happen.

296
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,589
I should have led the team.

297
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,676
Well, it's not too late.

298
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,805
I mean, Barry chose you for a reason.

299
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,474
Don't doubt yourself, Cisco.

300
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,437
What?

301
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,319
Something Ramsey said.
"I knew I picked the right guy."

302
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,280
Barry said those words.

303
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,164
Barry said those exact words to me
when he made me team leader.

304
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,920
Ramsey could have infected me.
He could have killed me.

305
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,842
But he didn't. Instead, he just did
a complete 180 for no reason.

306
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,806
There's something else.
Ramsey said, "I'm coming home."

307
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,726
I begged Barry to come home
the last time I saw him,

308
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,609
but I didn't think that
I was getting through.

309
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,981
Iris, what if that was Barry?

310
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:40,402
What if you were right,
and he's still alive inside Dark Flash?

311
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,369
Then he could be trying
to tell us what to do.

312
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,448
Like how to take down Bloodwork.

313
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,367
Someone's at the barrier.

314
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,172
<i>I have arrived
to fulfil my destiny.</i>

315
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:03,508
And yes, my army is coming.

316
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,471
Iris, Cisco...

317
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,348
let the light in.

318
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,813
I think I just figured out Barry's plan.

319
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,608
He just told us the next step.

320
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,568
We need to lower the defenses.

321
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:23,945
Let them in.

322
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,872
It's time to put an end to death
once and for all.

323
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,313
Find the humans who've rejected
my lifeblood and kill them.

324
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,956
You want me to do what?

325
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,833
Barry's plan is to let the light in.

326
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,544
It isn't for Ramsey to spread
his infection to the city,

327
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,504
it's for you to spread the antidote...

328
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,465
With one hell of a UV blast.

329
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,592
But I can't do that.

330
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,716
<i>Don't worry.
I've done all the calculations.</i>

331
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,346
We'll walk you through the whole thing.

332
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,014
Just get to the Pipeline, now.

333
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,697
Good evening, Team Flash.

334
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:53,869
<i>I have tried repeatedly
to bestow upon you eternal life,</i>

335
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,704
<i>and yet you've refused.</i>

336
00:24:55,787 --> 00:25:00,834
So now, instead of continuing
to offer you the gift of life,

337
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:05,005
<i>I've ordered my Blood Brothers
to take it from you.</i>

338
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,340
<i>Now, as you run
for your worthless lives,</i>

339
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,304
do keep in mind that your leader,
Flash, belongs to me now.

340
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:16,683
I have his access codes,
his handprint, his knowledge.

341
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,978
My objective will be achieved.

342
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,054
Bring me Iris and Cisco.

343
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,768
Barry. Barry...

344
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:11,112
I want you to know
the scope of your failure.

345
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,283
My lifeblood is circling
the accelerator.

346
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:23,208
And when it gathers enough speed,
it'll collide with the energy inside,

347
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,586
and the resulting collision
will cure this city.

348
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,089
And you.

349
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:30,924
Barry.

350
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,887
Barry, I trust you.

351
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,980
What are you doing? Kill her!

352
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,407
Barry.

353
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,665
We are one, you and I.

354
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,388
It's pointless to fight it.

355
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:24,602
I know you want to execute my will.
I can feel it inside you, Flash.

356
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,735
Much better.

357
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,297
Get ready to run.

358
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,215
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do.

359
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,388
Barry?

360
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,828
We only have about
five rotations left before collision.

361
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,437
How long is each rotation?

362
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,855
A few seconds, if we're lucky.

363
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,644
- Allegra, where the hell are you?
- Right here.

364
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,286
When I open this door,

365
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,247
you need to hit these particles
with all the UV rays you've got.

366
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,731
You got this. Don't hold back.

367
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,362
One rotation left!

368
00:28:58,488 --> 00:28:59,489
Now!

369
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,748
Hey.

370
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
Barry.

371
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,296
Barry.

372
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,182
Hey.

373
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,270
It's me.

374
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,906
Hey, uh, where's the scary guy
who tried to kill us all?

375
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,661
He won't get far.

376
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,500
I won't be denied.

377
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,419
Okay. Just stay here.

378
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,422
You can't control me anymore.

379
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,176
And I'm not gonna let you
hurt anybody else.

380
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:47,472
For the last time,

381
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,850
I am trying to save everyone!

382
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:55,980
Don't you understand?
You're not the hero here. I am!

383
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,507
- Cisco, are you with me?
<i>- Always.</i>

384
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:32,267
Babel's been lifted, comms are up.
We are back.

385
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,519
What do we have that can hold Ramsey?

386
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:37,313
After Mitch Romero,
we know a Pipeline cell won't work.

387
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,901
The MAC. It contained
Chester's black-hole energy.

388
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,028
So, Ramsey should be a walk in the park.

389
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,617
Flash, you okay?

390
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,423
Stay down!

391
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,183
Any last words before your death?

392
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,979
I just wanna enjoy the time I have left.

393
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,857
I felt the same way.

394
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,028
My beautiful boy.

395
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,197
Ramsey...

396
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,580
what have you done?

397
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,669
My son...

398
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,298
I've missed you so much.

399
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:49,718
Mom?

400
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:53,669
- How is this even possible?
- I brought her.

401
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:58,895
You entered my mind to bring out
that doubt that was hidden inside.

402
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,691
I let you infect me, so I could
return the favor and bring out yours.

403
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:08,112
Impossible. I have no doubt.
Only conviction.

404
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:13,201
Ramsey, I would give anything to have
just one more day with my mom.

405
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,995
You have that chance right now.

406
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,122
Listen to her.

407
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,125
He's right.

408
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,337
You were born to heal.

409
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,591
But you've become
an angel of destruction.

410
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:33,221
No. This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

411
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,181
My dear son...

412
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,689
you wanted so desperately to save me.

413
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,066
Now let me save you from yourself.

414
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,652
I just wanted to help them all.

415
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,871
No!

416
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,834
No. She was wrong.
I was born to save the world!

417
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,170
And I still can.

418
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:13,344
Can you hear me, Flash?
I was chosen to save the world.

419
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:18,141
And when I escape these chains,
I will complete my destiny,

420
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:22,061
and you will all accept my cure.

421
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,942
Containment protocols holding.

422
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:30,861
It worked.

423
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,780
We did it. We beat him.

424
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,535
Now it's time for our next fight.

425
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,630
Lyla says Ramsey is officially
in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

426
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,382
And I called the local hospitals.

427
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,469
Ramsey's infection doesn't seem
to have any long-lasting effects.

428
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,429
So, everyone's gonna be okay?

429
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,181
Everyone except Ramsey.

430
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,348
Frost ran some tests,

431
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,559
and it looks like
his condition is, um...

432
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:03,894
pretty permanent.

433
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:05,998
Joe's resting in the lounge,

434
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,733
and I think I'm gonna go check on him.

435
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,033
What was it like being Dark Flash?

436
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,831
I knew what was happening,
but I couldn't stop it.

437
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,460
Honestly, it took everything I had
just to keep from hurting you guys.

438
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,798
But as the night went on,
I could tell I was getting to him.

439
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,509
I could feel him doubting himself
more and more.

440
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,930
Thank you for what you did.
You saved the city.

441
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,097
Right back at you.

442
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,267
But you should really thank Frost.
She got me there.

443
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,603
- She's badass.
- Yeah, she is.

444
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,397
Speaking of, where is the ice queen?

445
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,738
Caity, I know the last couple of days
have been a roller coaster,

446
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,907
but I just wanted to say thanks.

447
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,744
For believing in me,
even when I didn't believe in myself.

448
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,831
<i>No thanks needed.
And for what it's worth,</i>

449
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,708
<i>I'm really proud of how you've grown
these past few months.</i>

450
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,044
<i>I can't wait to see where you go next.</i>

451
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,003
Me too.

452
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,884
But, for tonight,
I think you should take over.

453
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,637
It's only right
that you're with the team

454
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,014
for whatever Crisis is about to bring.

455
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,123
Guys...

456
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,333
sitting in silence really isn't

457
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,737
how I want to spend
the next few minutes.

458
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:58,842
Joe...

459
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,555
When you gave me your watch,

460
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,183
it meant... It meant the world to me.

461
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,395
I wanna give you mine.

462
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,773
So I know, wherever I go...

463
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,693
a part of me is with you.

464
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:17,445
I love you for that.

465
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,615
But you're not going anywhere yet...

466
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,242
so you hold on to it.

467
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:25,869
All right.

468
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,541
H.R. Wells told me once...

469
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,921
"Barry Allen's superpower isn't speed.

470
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,089
It's hope.

471
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:43,512
It's hope. And that kid has
an endless reservoir of it."

472
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,769
I didn't know how right he was until
I really got to know you, Barry.

473
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,066
Whatever is about to happen,

474
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,235
this world's a better place
for having you in it.

475
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,905
You know,
when you first came into my life,

476
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,659
I had lost faith
in just about everything.

477
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,870
You saved my life, Barry.

478
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,501
God, I remember the old days.

479
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:18,923
No doppelgangers,
no Flashpoint, no time travel.

480
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,176
It was just us against the bad guys.

481
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,513
I miss that.

482
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,348
I don't know.
I kind of like time travel.

483
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,934
When you were stuck in the Speed Force,

484
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,269
I would have Cisco vibe me
to the waterfront

485
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,605
so I could watch our first kiss.

486
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,167
You know, the one that you had
to erase from the timeline

487
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,192
to save the world.

488
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,069
Why'd you do that?

489
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,823
I don't know.
I guess when you're filled with sadness,

490
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,575
happy thoughts are what
get you through the day.

491
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,371
And what's happier than...

492
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,525
getting to have your first kiss
with the love of your life,

493
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,668
other than getting to do it twice?

494
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,848
Our love story never ends, Barry.
Not even with Crisis.

495
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,434
Iris, it's inevitable.

496
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,519
Maybe.

497
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,274
But whether you vanish...

498
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,071
or worse, I am gonna be there with you.

499
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,616
I'll be right there with you
to the very end, okay?

500
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,040
Because the only thing
more inevitable than Crisis is us.

501
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,879
Iris is right.

502
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,215
Whatever's in store for us,

503
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,217
it can't change
what we mean to each other.

504
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,346
It can't erase what's in our hearts.

505
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,016
As long as we hold on to that...

506
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,147
we've beaten Crisis
before it even begins.

507
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:41,398
For so many years,
I've traveled across worlds...

508
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,195
...across the multi-verse,
to do one thing.

509
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,155
To kill you.

510
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,783
And now, here...

511
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,744
you saved my life.

512
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:57,665
<i>Submit and begin your life anew.</i>

513
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,126
Show me.

514
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,962
<i>The knowledge is within you.</i>
