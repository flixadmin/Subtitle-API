(HORSE NEIGHS)

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,340
MAN: Hold that wagon!

00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:18,090
(HORSES NEIGHING)

6
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,756
You've just won
the biggest prize in the world.

7
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,007
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

8
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,214
Come on, you can tell me.

9
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,756
Queen of Thorns
give you one last prick in the balls

10
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:40,089
before saying goodbye?

11
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,673
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

12
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,881
There is no more High Septon.

13
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,131
No, there isn't, is there?

14
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,424
There is still
the question of my prize.

15
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:55,089
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

16
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,424
It's not a castle.

17
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,256
How about that one?
It's available.

18
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,631
You don't want Highgarden.

19
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,423
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

20
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,632
Daenerys Targaryen could come and
take it back the day after you move in.

21
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,881
Besides, think of the upkeep.

22
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,922
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

23
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,506
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

24
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,424
All your new riches
weighing you down?

25
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,964
- MAN: Move out!
- JAIME: They're not mine.

26
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,715
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

27
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,964
See?
We pay our debts.

28
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,799
Right, just not to me.

29
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,464
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

30
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,922
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

31
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,840
with a saddlebag full of gold,

32
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,298
complaining about
not getting paid.

33
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,089
When we win this war,

34
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,964
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

35
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,423
will be yours to choose from,

36
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,840
with no one left
to take them away from you.

37
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,715
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

38
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,172
will be quiet and peaceable.

39
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,756
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

40
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:53,799
Like what?

41
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,798
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

42
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,631
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

43
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,298
from all the farms in the Reach.

44
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,631
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

45
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,798
and help them
accelerate this process?

46
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,798
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

47
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,964
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to
hand over their harvest...

48
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,007
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

49
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,840
My lord.

50
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,965
My lord.

51
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:25,173
My lord.

52
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,089
TYCHO: I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

53
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,840
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

54
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:47,047
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

55
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:50,673
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

56
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,881
You're too kind, my lord.

57
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:56,047
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

58
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:59,214
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

59
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,964
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

60
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:06,048
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

61
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:09,339
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

62
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,339
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

63
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,256
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

64
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:19,006
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

65
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:22,256
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

66
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,715
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

67
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:27,506
in some current venture.

68
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,464
My only venture at this moment

69
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,131
is reestablishing control
over this continent

70
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,423
and every person on it.

71
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:37,256
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

72
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:41,214
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

73
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,464
It will, indeed.

74
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:45,423
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

75
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:49,131
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

76
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,339
I know them well.

77
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,798
They have helped us
recover significant sums

78
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,756
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

79
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:57,464
That's good to hear.

80
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,882
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

81
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,590
Rest assured, Your Grace,

82
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:07,506
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

83
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,549
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

84
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,298
(FIRE CRACKLING)

85
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,632
LITTLEFINGER: This is for you.

86
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:23,131
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

87
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,965
but your mother fought him off.

88
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:35,798
The other dagger,

89
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,464
the one that took her life,

90
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,673
I would have stopped that dagger
with my own heart

91
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,090
if I could have.

92
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:47,799
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

93
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:52,506
But I am here for her now

94
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:55,214
to do what she would have done,

95
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,173
to protect her children.

96
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:03,673
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

97
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,007
you need only ask.

98
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,214
Do you know
who this belonged to?

99
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,922
No.

100
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,756
That very question was
what started the War of the Five Kings.

101
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:22,172
In a way, that dagger made you
what you are today.

102
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,047
Forced from your home,

103
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,548
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

104
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:31,299
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

105
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:43,881
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

106
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:48,506
only to find such chaos
in the world,

107
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:49,548
I can only imagine...

108
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,507
Chaos is a ladder.

109
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,674
(DOOR OPENS)

110
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,881
(EXHALES)

111
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,798
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

112
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,215
I'm not Lord Stark.

113
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,715
What's that?

114
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,715
Maester Wolkan built it for me

115
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,256
so I can move around
more easily.

116
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,090
It's a very good idea.

117
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,799
You're leaving.

118
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,756
I don't want to leave you,

119
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,756
but when...
when they come,

120
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:39,465
I need to be with my family.

121
00:08:40,674 --> 00:08:42,548
And you're safe.

122
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,424
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

123
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:47,757
You don't need me anymore.

124
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,382
No, I don't.

125
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:55,961
That's all you've got to say?

126
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:59,007
Thank you.

127
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,464
Thank you?

128
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,132
For helping me.

129
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,256
My brother died for you.

130
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,964
Hodor and Summer died for you.

131
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,299
I almost died for you.

132
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:20,132
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

133
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,631
Not anymore.

134
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,798
(CRYING)

135
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,089
I remember what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark,

136
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,591
but I remember so much else now.

137
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,299
You died in that cave.

138
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,089
I did.

139
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,506
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

140
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:28,172
The only thing in the kitchen
that you've put your cock in is the liver.

141
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,506
'Ey up.
Where you going?

142
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,047
In there.
I live here.

143
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,756
(SNICKERS)
Fuck off.

144
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,841
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

145
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:41,715
(HENK SNORTS)

146
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,340
Arya Stark's dead.

147
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,172
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

148
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:51,214
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

149
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,047
Maester's named Wolkan.

150
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:56,214
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

151
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:58,756
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

152
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,548
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

153
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,922
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

154
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:07,799
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

155
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,964
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

156
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,673
- Which Lady Stark?
- HENK: You tell us.

157
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,424
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

158
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:22,256
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

159
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:26,590
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you, just like us.

160
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,922

324
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,840
I have three large dragons.

325
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,548
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

330
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,632
What do you think I should do?

331
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:02,214
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

The people who follow you

337
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:25,132
know that you made
something impossible happen.

338
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,006
Maybe that helps them believe

339
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:31,172
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

340

But if you use them
to melt castles and burn cities,

343
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,799
you're not different.

the right amount of grain to the stores,

Forgive me,
but may I ask a question?

00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,131
Of course.

395
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:20,006
Your name is Jon Snow,
but your father's name was Ned Stark?

396

I'm a bastard.

397
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,131
My mother and father
weren't married.

398

Is the custom
different in Naath?

399
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,006
We don't have marriage in Naath,

400
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,964
so the concept
of a bastard doesn't exist.

and set me free.

Of course, you're
serving her now, aren't you?
