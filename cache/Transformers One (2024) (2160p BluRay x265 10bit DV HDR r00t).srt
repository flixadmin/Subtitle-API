1
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,329
Okay, let's see what we got here.

2
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,373
Seen it. Seen it.

3
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,875
What's this about?

4
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>At the dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

5
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,551
<i>dawn... dawn... dawn...</i>

6
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,935
Here we go.

7
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,858
<i> At the dawn of time, there was
our gracious and powerful creator,</i>

8
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>Primus.</i>

9
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>To protect our universe,
he sacrificed his life force,</i>

10
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,909
<i>transforming himself into our planet,</i>

11
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,787
<i>Cybertron.</i>

12
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>From within Cybertron's core,</i>

13
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,002
<i>Primus birthed the first Transformers</i>

14
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>known as the Primes,</i>

15
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:58,261
<i>the most powertul Transformers, appointed</i>
<i>to lead and protect future generations.</i>

16
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:03,016
<i>To assist them,
Primus created an entity of great power,</i>

17
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,185
<i>the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

18
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,188
The Matrix, there it is. Okay. Good.
Come on. Keep going.

19
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>With the Matrix in the Primes' possession,</i>

20
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:17,364
<i>Cybertron's natural power source, Energon,
flowed in abundance,</i>

21
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,784
<i>sustaining life across the planet.</i>

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,750
<i>Attention! Unauthorized movement
detected in archival vault. Sector J-3.</i>

23
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,462
KDQ-12 to KDK-1 .
Breaching archives in ten seconds.

24
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:37,467
<i>For generations,
there was peace and prosperity</i>

25
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,762
<i>until the Matrix of Leadership was</i> lost,

26
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>causing Energon to no longer</i> flow.

27
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:49,187
Why does every legend about the Matrix
end right there?

28
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,939
One of these has to say what happened.

29
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,733
<i>Halt, criminal! Prepare</i> to <i>be detained!</i>

30
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,069
-Halt, <i>criminall Prepare to be detained!</i>
-Hey there.

31
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,071
Uh-oh.

32
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,699
-Freeze!
-Get down!

33
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,744
Well, hello, guys.
Yeah, I'm so glad you're here.

34
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,580
Which way is the exit?
I must've taken a wrong turn.

35
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,417
It's that defective mining bot, Oreon Pix!

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,876
-Orion Pax.
-Who cares?

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
We told you to never come back here!

38
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,881
-Why are we all yelling?
-I'm gonna smash you!

39
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,676
Hold on. Hold on. No need for violence.

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,096
How about this: I run away, you chase me.
We play that game, huh?

41
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,223
Come on.
You're bigger, faster. It'll be fun.

42
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,101
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

43
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,937
Why not? It's not like he can transform.

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,896
Oh, yeah?

45
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,898
Well, watch this.

46
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,070
Get him!

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,785
Something that flies.
Something that flies.

48
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,663
<i>Prepare</i> to <i>be detained! Halt, criminal!
Prepare</i> to <i>be detained!</i>

49
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,165
<i>Halt, criminall</i>

50
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,888
Come on! Start! Come on!

51
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,063
No, no, no, no!

52
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
There he is!

53
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,449
So long, suck--

54
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,411
Energon.

55
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,121
Evening, everyone. Pardon me.

56
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,389
-It's Orion.
-Seriously, again?

57
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,819
Okay.

58
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,322
Hey, fellas! Thanks for the head start.
Want to give me another one?

59
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,824
-You're dead!
-I'll take that as a no.

60
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,202
Hey! Watch where you're going!

61
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,537
What did you say, no-cog?

62
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,913
Sorry, sir, I didn't mean you.

63
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,957
I was referring to the bot
who was behind you.

64
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,918
-Where'd he go?
-The filthy red and blue bot?

65
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,588
Has a big mouth, squeaky joints,
gives off a corroded metallic stench?

66
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,298
-Where is he?
-He went that way.

67
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,467
When I get my hands on that bot...

68
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,353
All right, all clear.

69
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,691
Listen, D-16, I may be a Iittle rusty,
but "corroded"? That is too far.

70
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,776
Let me guess. Chased out of the archives?

71
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,530
Yeah. I had to jump out of a window
this time. Almost died. It was wild.

72
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,949
And digging through ancient data
is worth dying for?

73
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,158
Yes, it is.

74
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,743
I need a new best friend.

75
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,662
If there are clues in our recorded history

76
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,789
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

77
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,999
they're in the archives.

78
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,504
Sentinel Prime, the Sentinel Prime,
is up on the surface right now

79
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,716
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

80
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,802
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

81
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,387
Yeah, okay.

82
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,224
The sooner Energon flows again,
the sooner we won't have to mine for it.

83
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,643
Don't you want to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

84
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,354
We're miners. We mine, that's all.

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,691
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.

86
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,401
-I can feel it.
-Oh, yeah?

87
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,654
Like the time that you had a "feeling"
you could transform without a cog?

88
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
You said you were never gonna
mention that again.

89
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,826
It took me three days to pry you open.
Your feelings get you in trouble.

90
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,788
-Just trust in Sentinel Prime.
-I do trust in him.

92
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,417
Hey, if we did have cogs--

93
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,628
I'd transform into a shovel and beat you.

94
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,463
I don't like how fast you answered that.

95
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,423
But listen. If you did beat me,

96
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,843
I couldn't give you this awesome
Megatronus Prime thing I have here.

97
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,804
-It's cool. I'll give it to someone else.
-What Megatronus Prime thing?

98
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:56,059
It's nothing. Just a, you know,
mint-condition Megatronus Prime decal,

99
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,518
first edition.

100
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,436
What?

101
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,313
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

102
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,023
Throw it away?
That's not funny. Let me see.

103
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,442
Wait. Don't grab. You're gonna crease it.

104
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,072
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

105
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,325
The strongest Prime to ever live.
I know, buddy.

106
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,704
-Looks good on you.
-It's really cool.

107
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,708
-Thanks.
-Always got your back.

108
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,877
No matter what.

109
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,841
<i>Approaching sublevel station.
Stand clear ofdoors.</i>

110
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,635
<i>Mining teams, prepare</i> to <i>unload.</i>

111
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,449
Metal to the pedal, drill bits.
This is it.

112
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,035
How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

113
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,286
So much, Elita-1 !

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,288
And how perfect is my mining record?

115
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,832
So perfect, EIita-1 !

116
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,336
We are a mere 30 units of Energon away
from my promotion to supervisor.

117
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,838
Are you happy for me?

118
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,214
So happy, Elita-1 !

119
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,720
Elita... I mean Captain. .. you are looking
especially shiny this morning. New polish?

120
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,473
Orion Pax, I'm sorry that I somehow gave
you the impression that we're friends.

121
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,558
Apology accepted.

122
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,643
Light up that wall! Let's go! Ten seconds!

123
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,395
Happy to take the Iead today, Captain.

124
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,815
Feeling Iike I have enough power in me
to drill down and touch Primus myself.

125
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,567
You don't have the touch or the power.

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,819
Ready positions, rust buckets! Let's go!

127
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,529
She's in a good mood today.

128
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,448
-You ready?
-Always ready.

129
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,949
Let's punch in.

130
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,119
Here we go. This one won't be open Iong.
Brace it up!

131
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,580
Here we go! Bridge!

132
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,040
Brace up!

133
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,668
Lower channel is open.

134
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,341
Drill power on max!

135
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,468
Low bridge!

136
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,016
Drill it out!

137
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,603
I tapped a vein!

138
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,443
It's unstable!
We got to go. We got to move!

139
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,619
Evacuate!

140
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,749
Everyone out! Evacuate immediately!
The tunnel is closing.

141
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,335
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

142
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,755
-You with me, D?
-On your six! Keep going!

143
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,715
Look out!

144
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,179
Jazz is stuck!

145
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,140
Elita, we've got a trapped miner.
I'm falling back to assist.

146
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,059
<i>Negative. Do not break protocol. Evacuate!</i>

147
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,186
We're gonna need more lift.

148
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,647
It's closing! Just grab your pack and go.

149
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,898
Yeah, good idea.

150
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,067
What? No, I didn't mean it!

151
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,780
Pull him clear!

152
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

153
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,456
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff. It's all good.

154
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,083
That's not good.

155
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,754
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

156
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,881
<i>Elita, it's about</i> to <i>get messy</i> out <i>there!</i>

157
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,055
Go, go, go!

158
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,060
Run! Run!

159
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,770
-Hurry!
-We're not gonna make it!

160
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,772
Come on! Go, go, go!

161
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,698
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

162
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,242
-I did, eventually.
-If I get fired because of you--

163
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,202
Oh, please. They're not gonna fire you.

164
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,538
Elita-1 , you're fired.

165
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,541
What? Why?
I followed protocol to the letter.

166
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,793
That is true.
I was the one who broke the rules.

167
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,003
No one asked you!

168
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,422
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard for this.

169
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,675
You are no-cog bots with limited options.

170
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,344
Report to waste management immediately.

171
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,429
Waste management?

172
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,638
Elita...

173
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,516
Next time, why don't you stop and think
before you ruin someone's life?

174
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm sorry!

175
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,104
-Hey, Darkwing!
-Don't do it.

176
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:14,400
I may not have a cog, but my finger
can transform. Guess which one?

177
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,819
I'll give you a "limited option."

178
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,157
Excuse me, sir. Allow me.

179
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,659
I apologize on his behalf for the--

180
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,787
Why?

181
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,637
That really hurt.

182
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,138
What'd you expect? He's metal.

183
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,059
You know you were out of line,
talking back to a superior Iike that.

184
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,353
Darkwing was out of line. He deserves it.

185
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,398
Aren't you tired of being treated
like we're nothing?

186
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,236
He had every right to hit me.
I interfered.

187
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,033
Hey, and I appreciate you having my back.

188
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm glad you were there with me
to get punched in the face. That was fun.

189
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,748
Anytime, buddy.

190
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>Attention, all sectors.</i>

191
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,753
<i>Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

192
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,839
-He's back? He's back already?
-Maybe he found the Matrix.

193
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>Is it on? Okay, thank you.</i>

194
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
<i>Hello, my fricnds.</i>

195
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>Hello, Iacon Cityl</i>

196
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>Hello to our saviors,</i>

197
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,230
<i>the industrious miners who toil selflessly</i>
<i>to maintain our Energon reserves.</i>

198
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,107
<i>I celebrate you.</i>

199
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:42,029
Humility and presence! That's leadership!
Nobody does it better!

200
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>Once again, I have narrowly returned
with my fleet</i>

201
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,951
<i>after another treacherous expedition</i>

202
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,287
<i>across the desolate, dangerous surface
of our planet.</i>

203
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,873
<i>I departed with hopes of finding
the Matrix of Leadership,</i>

204
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,042
<i>thc key to bringing balance to Cybertron.</i>

205
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,961
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

206
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,504
<i>that we've returned empty-handed.</i>

207
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,134
<i>This is a setback, but not a failure.</i>

208
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,053
<i>Rest assured,
I will find the Matrix of Leadership</i>

209
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,639
<i>so that Energon can flow again.</i>

210
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,433
<i>But that's in the future.</i>

211
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,686
<i>Right now,
I think we all deserve a little fun!</i>

212
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,272
<i>Tomorrow, there will be no work.
All shifts off</i>

213
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>because tomorrow is the Iacon 5000!</i>

214
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,320
-Yeah!
-Yes!

215
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,908
<i>My favorite event.
A high-octane race all across Iacon City.</i>

216
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:32,121
<i>Let's all see which competitor can prove
they are truly more than meets the eye.</i>

217
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
D.

218
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Hey, D.

219
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,394
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on. I have an idea.

220
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,314
Whatever this is, it better be good.

221
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,982
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Listen.

222
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,151
All right, what if. . . what if...

223
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,612
what if tomorrow

224
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,741
we ran in the Iacon 5000, huh?

225
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,452
What if I kill you for waking me up?

226
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,204
No, no, hear me out.

227
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,956
-We don't even have to win!
-That's good, because we wouldn't.

228
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,253
But if we beat just one Transformer,
it proves we're just as good as they are.

229
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:26,759
Not only would we go down in history,
the mining bots that did the impossible,

230
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,513
but we would show everyone
that we're capable of so much more.

231
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,599
Or we get publicly humiliated
and then busted back to tier one.

232
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,602
Yeah, but at least
we would've done something, you know?

233
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,270
-Pax...
-Come on, D.

234
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,522
Pax.

235
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,608
We're mining bots who can't transform.

236
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,444
We can't fly, we can't roll,

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,154
we can't race.

238
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,531
Come on. Let's go.

239
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,367
All right, fine.

240
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,952
Yeah, maybe you're right.

241
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,041
Maybe.

242
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,546
The Iacon 5000 is finally here!

243
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,172
I have a surprise for you. Come on.

244
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,383
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

245
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,302
-Yeah, I know. Follow me.
-Great. We're gonna be late now.

246
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,680
I wanted good seats.

247
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,142
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony. This is wonderful!

248
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,977
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

249
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,895
Hold up!

250
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,735
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you halfway across the city.

251
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,654
Okay, where are you taking me?

252
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,658
Don't be a glitch,
this will be totally worth it. Trust me.

253
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,951
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

254
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,996
Look, I know this is fun for you,
like, we're joking around,

255
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,915
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

256
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,836
I swear I will smelt your face
right off your...

257
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,301
<i>Welcome to the Iacon 5000. There they are.</i>

258
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,722
<i>Put your hands together as today's
competitors are taking the field.</i>

259
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,559
Look! There's Thunderglide and Behemoth!

260
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,313
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

261
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,026
You did this for me?

262
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,110
No.

263
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,154
I did this for us.

264
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,661
<i>And now the moment
you've all bcen waiting for.</i>

265
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,330
<i>The icon of Iacon!</i>

266
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,166
<i>The savior of Cybertron!</i>

267
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,086
<i>Ouintessons fear him, but we love himl</i>

268
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,756
<i>Our leader, the one and only...</i>

269
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>Sentinel Prime!</i>

270
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,426
I love you, Sentinel!

271
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,099
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

272
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,856
My friends. My Cybertronian family.

273
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:51,070
It has been precisely 50 cycles
since the Quintessons attacked our home.

274
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,115
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

275
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,743
and our Energon supply dried up.

276
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,789
Fiffy cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

277
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,791
my brothers and sisters in arms.

278
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,836
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours,

279
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,882
and we show them that the strength
of Cybertron will never be diminished.

280
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,555
Racers, on your marks!

281
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:26,188
I can't believe we get to watch
from the starting line,

282
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,898
the best seats in the house!

283
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,817
Why'd you bring jetpacks?

284
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,277
Get set!

285
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,363
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

286
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,781
Oh, no.

287
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,826
<i>And they're off!</i>

288
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,876
-Are you crazy?
-Sure feels Iike it.

289
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,881
<i>The Iacon 5000 has begun!</i>

290
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,761
I'm sorry, are those miners in the race?

291
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,180
Miners! Those are miners, like us!

292
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,475
<i>I can't believe what I'm seeing here!</i>
</i>Miners trying to run in the Iacon 5000!</i>

293
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,810
You've got to be kidding me.

294
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,895
<i>This is insane!</i>

295
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,023
There are miners in the race!

296
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,941
-No way!
-They can't even transform!

297
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,609
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

298
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,033
<i>This is a first in Iacon 5000 history.</i>

299
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>How are they going to survive?</i>

300
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,998
If we survive this, I'm gonna kill you!

301
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,458
I accept those terms.

302
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,841
<i>It's Tailwind pulling into the lead
down the main stretch</i>

303
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,177
<i>followed by Strafe and Skyfire!</i>

304
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,597
Hey, look out!

305
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,727
-I owe you one.
-More like a thousand.

306
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,441
I can't believe we're not in last place!

307
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,986
Eat it, miner!

308
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>-Darkwing delivers a devastating blow.</i>
-Got you.

309
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,374
-We're not fast enough!
-Improvise!

310
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,256
-Hey, get off!
-Spinout! Big fan!

311
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,550
Jetstorm, I'm so sorry. Big fan!

312
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,928
Get off!

313
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,233
Time it just right!

314
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,110
And... now!

315
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,904
Move!

316
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,202
<i>And the miners have fallen way behind.</i>

317
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,414
<i>We can now focus
on the real contenders in this race.</i>

318
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,351
<i>I don't believe it!</i>
<i>The miners take down Darkwing!</i>

319
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,020
Miners!

320
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,564
Great effort, Darkwing!

321
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,691
That worked! It actually worked!

322
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,860
Is this the dumbest thing we've ever done?

323
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,486
Oh, yeah, it's up there!

324
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,501
Wait!

325
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,794
Go, go, go!

326
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>A four-bot pile up in the magnetic tunnel,</i>

327
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,427
<i>and the two miners are now
in first position!</i>

328
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,472
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

329
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,145
D!

330
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,147
No. Go. Leave me!

331
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,441
No, we do this together.

332
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,945
<i>One miner is now carrying the other
mere steps from the finish line</i>

333
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:06,158
<i>in the most amazing, sensational,
dramatic, heartrending, exciting,</i>

334
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,826
<i>thrilling finish in the history of</i>--

335
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,415
<i>We have a winner!</i>

336
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,585
<i>Chromia comes from behind</i>
<i>to take the prize.</i>

337
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,922
<i>Talk about an Iacon 5000 for the ages.</i>

338
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,217
Well, second place is still pretty good.

339
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>Paging Dr. Ratchet.</i>
<i>Dr. Ratchet to Medical Bay 94.</i>

340
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,351
Do not worry.
You will be fixed up in no time.

341
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,186
Did I win?

342
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,771
You participated.

343
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,897
Yay!

344
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,651
So...

345
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,819
how long do you think we'll be here?

346
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,321
I'm not talking to you.

347
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,454
You know what? I can't believe
you made me do that. We are so screwed!

348
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,872
Thought you weren't talking to me.

349
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,875
Hey, look, I know it's all
a big joke to you. But not me.

350
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,002
I was paying my dues. I was going places.

351
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,005
And now they're gonna bust me down
I don't even know how many tiers!

352
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,715
I'm sorry, D.

353
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,425
But come on. Didn't you feel it?

354
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,678
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

355
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,304
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

356
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,140
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

357
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,977
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

358
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,898
But it doesn't matter.
We're going to get punished and demoted.

359
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,279
Sentinel Prime saw the whole thing.
This is so embarrassing.

360
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,960
It's clear.

361
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,382
Orion Pax.

362
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,801
D-16.

363
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:52,097
What you two did today was
one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

364
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,016
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

365
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,018
I loved it!

366
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,561
You did?

367
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,979
How could anyone not love it?

368
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,732
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

369
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,151
So we're not getting demoted?

370
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,527
Demoted?

371
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,450
Demoted.

372
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,701
Yeah.

373
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,453
What is happening?

374
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,250
The fact of the matter is, we're halfway
into the first shiff since the race ended,

375
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,630
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

376
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,757
You inspired them to work harder!

377
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,842
Sentinel Prime, sir,

378
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,138
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential,

379
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,057
that we bots can do more than just mine--

380
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,393
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

381
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,145
Perhaps you two could tour the mines,

382
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,439
speak to your brethren
and help them see their potential.

383
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,857
Wow!

384
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,860
Okay, great. That sounds incredible.
I would love to--

385
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,278
Sir, it's time.

386
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,571
Yes.

387
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,659
I'm sorry, friends. We're preparing
our next travel to the surface.

388
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,037
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you. Hang tight.

389
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,875
Airachnid, have someone escort these
heroes to my personal service facilities.

390
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,461
Best care in Iacon.

391
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,254
Until next time, legends.

392
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,929
Sentinel Prime. The Sentinel Prime!

393
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,889
-You still mad at me?
-I am Iess mad at you.

394
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,850
I'm telling you, D, I got a feeling that
everything's gonna change,

395
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:19,976
and we're gonna go--

396
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,813
Miners!

397
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,899
Hi, Darkwing.

398
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,444
-No, no, no!
-No! No!

399
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,781
Wait! You don't understand!

400
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,534
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

401
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:40,330
You two dolls aren't going to see anyone
ever again. I'Il make sure of that.

402
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,624
You're making a mistake! Ask Sentinel!

403
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,001
I hate that guy!

404
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,891
You! How did you get down here?

405
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:04,604
There's no access to this level.
There is nobody down here but me.

406
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,648
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

407
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,110
You're others! You're. . . not me!

408
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,612
You're here and you're not me!

409
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,825
-Yeah.
-Awesome!

410
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,202
I am so sorry.
That must have been weird for you.

411
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:23,623
I just haven't had a lot of company since
they put me down here in sublevel 50.

412
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,918
Fiffy? But there are only 40 sublevels.

413
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,420
That's what I thought!

414
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,339
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

415
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,300
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

416
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,344
-How long have you been down here?
-How long have I been here?

417
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,598
Let's see, somewhere between
a long time and forever.

418
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,310
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

419
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,187
'cause I'm so good at what I do.

420
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,190
I'm B-127, by the way.

421
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,524
But you can call me B.

422
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,443
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

423
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,070
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron,

424
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,866
which is actually
pronounced "Badassatron."

425
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,204
-But if you have any critiques--
-Yeah, great. How do we get out of here?

426
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,164
Great question. You don't.

427
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,499
-We don't?
-Nope.

428
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,043
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

429
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,130
but the new shiff manager there
does not like distractions.

430
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:15,175
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

431
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,718
Which is?

432
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,223
The scrap comes in from the chute there
onto the conveyor belt.

433
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,392
Ourjob is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

434
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,103
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

435
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,147
So you watch garbage burn.

436
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,482
Yes!

437
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,150
It is so great that you're here now.

438
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,110
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

439
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,862
And then tell you everything about me!

440
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,615
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

441
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,117
with one or two new best friends.

442
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,452
Yeah, I would love to--

443
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,829
Where are my manners?

444
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,914
Come on. I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

445
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,916
Hey, guys, we've got company!

446
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,169
This is EP-508,

447
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,507
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

448
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,716
"Steve"?

449
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,801
Yeah, he's foreign.

450
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,886
Question: Do they talk back to you?

451
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,597
They're not real.

452
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,101
-Geez, you think I'm that crazy?
-No, it's just you've been down here a--

453
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,394
No, I was talking to Steve.

454
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,480
Classic Steve.

455
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,732
-What is that?
-Look at this guy.

456
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,235
It's coming from inside.

457
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,904
Steve! No!

458
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,991
-I am so sorry.
-Steve!

459
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,118
-We can fix it, don't worry.
-No! My Steve!

460
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,163
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

461
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,167
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support. Immediate support!</i>

462
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,420
That's Alpha Trion.

463
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,963
One of the Primes?

464
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,299
<i>Repeat, Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

465
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,135
-It's an SOS message.
<i>-Protect the Matrix!</i>

466
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,430
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

467
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,311
Holy Primus!

468
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,063
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

469
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:57,235
This could be where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

470
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,614
Which means this is where we could find

471
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,741
the Matrix of Leadership.

472
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,536
What are you talking about? It's an old
beacon inside a statue made of garbage.

473
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,830
Or it's a clue of how we could find
the Matrix of Leadership.

474
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,957
No. No way. Absolutely not!

475
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,752
Come on. This could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

476
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,755
You already tried to "show everyone"
in the race you tricked me into running

477
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,925
which got us stuck down here
in this waste hole with this...

478
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,470
really cool guy.

479
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,596
Thank you.

480
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,680
I'm just saying--

481
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,934
There's a reason no one goes
to the surface. It's dangerous!

482
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,686
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime finds us.

483
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,104
Okay. Yeah.

484
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,483
Well, we'll just stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

485
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,153
Forever? This is great!
I have new coworkers and roommates.

486
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,988
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

487
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,157
I usually sleep on the conveyor belt,
but you can have it.

488
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,700
I'll sleep in the corner next to A-A-Tron.

489
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,244
Plenty of room for you to stretch out,
too, 'cause you're taller than I am.

490
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,329
You know what I mean?

491
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,248
Hey, D. What do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be

492
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,962
if you personally handed him
the Matrix of Leadership that you found?

493
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,839
Okay, stop.
I know what you're trying to do.

494
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,133
And it's definitely working. I'm in.

495
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,301
Yeah, buddy.

496
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,678
How do we get to the surface?

497
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:09,182
You kidding me? The surface?
Easy. I know a way.

498
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,768
But it won't be easy.

499
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,604
Why is there so much trash?

500
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,107
Warn me next time, please.
My mouth was open.

501
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,275
Only 49 sublevels to go!

502
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,862
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

503
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,489
that go all the way to the surface.

504
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,409
Yeah, but they don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

505
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,786
Yeah, that's the "won't be easy" part.

506
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,539
It's perfect.
We'll be safe inside the train.

507
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,132
That's the last one. Send her up!

508
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,139
Hold up! One more.

509
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,436
I'll lock it down.

510
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,697
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

511
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,742
Turning you in will definitely get me
promoted back up a rank or two.

512
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,909
Got her!

513
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,203
No, wait. I--

514
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,372
-Elita! Stop!
-Orion?

515
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,290
Hold on. Let me--

516
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,916
Security! Sound the ala--

517
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,091
-She's headed to the engine!
-Don't worry, I got this.

518
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,179
Hold on. Let me explain!
We're on a mission!

519
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,389
So am I. To ruin your life.

520
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,860
Elita, wait. We found a message.

521
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,570
-We know where--
-Hey, look out.

522
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,906
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

523
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,616
Dead end, Elita. There's no way...

524
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,618
Well, she's gone.

525
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,804
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

526
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,971
Climb faster!

527
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,570
Gotcha!

528
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,606
The surface.

529
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,276
It's beautiful.

530
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:12,115
I am speechless.

531
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,618
Elita, listen to me.

532
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,871
We know where the Matrix of Leadership is.

533
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,873
Oh, sure. And I'm really a Prime.

534
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,917
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

535
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,837
Where did you get this?

536
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,630
From my friend Steve. Orion killed him.

537
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,049
-I did not kill Steve.
-He was never alive.

538
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,342
-What?
-Look.

539
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,720
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

540
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,555
and then we found this message.

541
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:40,810
We figured that we could hand deliver it
to him or scout the Iocations ourselves.

542
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,187
Whichever comes first.

543
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,690
This was too important to wait.

544
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,401
It will change all of our lives.

545
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,154
No, no, no.

546
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,449
I'm not going to get demoted again
because of you.

547
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,367
I'm turning this rig around
and I'm notifying--

548
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,286
Hey, guys? Guys?

549
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,370
What is that?

550
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,084
Is it getting bigger?

551
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,962
Or closer?

552
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,431
No, no, no.

553
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,435
Are you closing?
Don't close. Stop closing.

554
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,519
It's closed!

555
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,729
Come on!

556
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,780
Now I know why
no one comes to the surface!

557
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,513
<i>Elita?</i>

558
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,807
EIita?

559
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,892
You okay?

560
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,773
-Please stop punching me in the face.
-Help me! Help!

561
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,650
Iacon... The train...

562
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,820
-Where's the train?
-Relax, okay? Here it comes.

563
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,822
And there it goes.

564
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,033
Okay, I was wrong about that.
It was going the other way.

565
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,212
Okay, so I think this is us,

566
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,714
and if we follow the path to--

567
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,342
Now you listen to me,
Mr. Zero-Seconds-Since-My-Last-Accident!

568
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,387
I'll go on your little quest
'cause I don't have a choice.

569
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,308
But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this Ieads to nothing,

570
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,228
then I'm dragging you and those
two idiot go-bots back to Iacon City

571
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,981
and to the first supervisor depot we see,

572
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,942
at which point you will explain
everything that's happened

573
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:57,030
using words that reflect me
in a very positive Iight! Got it?

574
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,282
Yeah, okay. Deal. Great. AII right.

575
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,160
-Let's go!
-She's joining us?

576
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,244
Fantastic!

577
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,622
Hi there. Elita, right?
Am I saying that right?

578
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,875
Wanted to formally introduce myself.

579
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,628
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

580
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,381
You can call me B. Or Badassatron.

581
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,342
It's a nickname some of the guys gave me.
I don't know.

582
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,427
I didn't give it to myself or anything.

583
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,805
Actually, it's pronounced "Badassatron,"

584
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,475
in case you were wondering.

585
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,936
Badassatron.

586
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,188
You like that, right?

587
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,107
-Badass--
-I'm gonna need you to talk less.

588
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,692
Sure! Yeah. No problem.

589
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,652
What am I talking less about, my nickname?

590
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,905
That's fine with me.
Got some mountains over here...

591
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
Hey. You're thinking about what you'll say

592
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,825
when you hand the Matrix
to Sentinel, aren't you?

593
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,993
I can't help it.

594
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,329
D, we're really doing this.

595
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,832
So glad I'm out here with you.
This was a great idea.

596
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm just having a good time.

597
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,504
How much further is the Matrix on the map?
Make an educated guesstimate.

598
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,507
This is the coolest thing that has ever
happened to anyone anywhere.

599
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,591
I'm telling you!

600
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,885
<i>Not one, not two, not thrce, but four</i>

601
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,097
<i>Four best friends
Who are walking through the door</i>

602
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,058
-There's no doors, we're outside.
-Hey, look, there's more of it over here.

603
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,560
-What is it?
-It's not metal.

604
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,189
It's like some kind of weird nature.
It's weird.

605
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,273
So are they.

606
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,652
<i>Going to the Matrix with my best friends</i>

607
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,071
What was that?

608
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,627
I think this is not right. We should go.

609
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,421
-Yeah, good idea.
-Run!

610
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,548
What are we running from?

611
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,533
-What is that?
-Oh, no.

612
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,577
-It's a Quintesson ship.
-What?

613
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,953
What do we do? What do we do?

614
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
Quiet.

615
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,301
It's scanning for life-forms. Move, move!

616
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,057
Wait!

617
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,979
Go, go, go, go!

618
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,114
Come on! They're not gonna make it.

619
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,102
What were they searching for?

620
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,190
-Someone to hug, B. How should I know?
-I'm not waiting around to find out.

621
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,359
This way. We're close.

622
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,237
Quintessons haven't been here
for 50 cycles.

623
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,948
It doesn't make sense.
There's nothing out here.

624
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,515
A cave with teeth.
Nothing scary about that.

625
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,941
Knives coming out of the ceiling. Amazing.

626
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,819
Everyone, do we have to go insi--

627
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,238
Okay, yep, we're going in.
Why shouldn't we?

628
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,533
Just walking into the scariest place
I've ever seen in my entire life.

629
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,619
This is ridiculous.

630
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,978
I don't believe it.

631
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,063
The Primes.

632
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,816
We're here.

633
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,146
Megatronus Prime.

634
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,703
Zeta Prime.

635
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,791
The Matrix!

636
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,504
It's gone.

637
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,466
Let's keep looking.

638
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,703
Hey, guys!

639
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,597
It's Alpha Trion!

640
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,725
He's powered down.

641
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,478
But his spark is still Iit.

642
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,166
Quintesson ambush!

643
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,126
Attack!

644
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,546
Message before--

645
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,215
Whoa, whoa, it's okay! It's okay.

646
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,675
You're safe now.

647
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,218
The war is over.

648
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,618
I failed you, old friend.

649
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,289
You deserved so much better than this end.

650
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,166
No, you didn't fail.

651
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,795
We heard your message.
We've come to find the Matrix.

652
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,507
Your transformation cogs.
What happened to you?

653
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,883
Who are you?

654
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,260
We're cogless miners, from Iacon.

655
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,347
Miners? Why?

656
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,892
Well, we've had to drill for Energon
ever since it stopped flowing.

657
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,060
Impossible.

658
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,729
That's why we came, to fix things.

659
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,274
If we find the Matrix of Leadership
and get it to Sentinel Prime, he can fix--

660
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,736
Sentinel is no Prime.

661
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,072
What?

662
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,198
He's broken. Fantastic.

663
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,242
What are you talking about?
Why would you say that?

664
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:25,204
Sentinel Prime is our protector.
He's been saving us from the Quintessons--

665
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,250
You have not been saved.
You've been living a lie.

666
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,253
I saw the truth with my own eyes.

667
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,381
Come. I will show you.

668
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,389
For thousands of cycles,

669
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,560
the war with the Quintessons
had been a brutal conflict.

670
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:56,193
<i>Until Sentinel,
the principal aide to the Primes,</i>

671
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,779
<i>intercepted an enemy transmission.</i>

672
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,034
<i>There was going to be a secret gathering</i>
<i>of Quintesson commanders.</i>

673
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,871
<i>Their elimination could end the war.</i>

674
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:13,002
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

675
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,298
We agreed to meet Sentinel
for his sensitive intel in secret,

676
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,842
here in this cave.

677
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,219
But we were not alone.

678
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,472
-Quintessons!
-They're here!

679
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,932
-It's a trap!
-Battle positions!

680
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,934
-Hold the line!
-Primus be with us!

681
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,523
For Cybertron!

682
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,324
<i>We were outnumbered, but stood as one.</i>

683
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,578
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

684
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,292
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

685
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,944
Sentinel, why?

686
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,197
For all the power of Cybertron.

687
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:32,039
<i>But Sentinel never understood
thc true power of what he desired.</i>

688
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:36,752
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

689
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:42,007
<i>by one that Primus himself deems worthy.</i>

690
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,971
<i>And Sentinel most certainly was not.</i>

691
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,473
No!

692
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,644
Wait. Hold on.

693
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:58,816
You're saying that
the Matrix of Leadership just vanished?

694
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,067
No.

695
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,861
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

696
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,697
Why would Sentinel do that?

697
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,281
To make a bargain.

698
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,909
A bargain? With who?

699
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:14,498
With the new rulers of Cybertron.

700
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,380
The Quintessons.

701
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,715
There are so many.

702
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,030
He's here.

703
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,074
Sentinel Prime is here.

704
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,402
-Keep your eyes open.
-They always are.

705
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,986
I load those crates.

706
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,364
Those are filled with contaminated metal.

707
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,116
I don't understand.

708
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,743
What do the Quintessons want
with toxic waste?

709
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,083
Our Energon.

710
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,299
-Traitor!
-D, no.

711
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,481
I know what I promised you,

712
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,609
but our mines, they're running out!

713
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,778
There's barely enough Energon for us.

714
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,658
I swear I will get you the rest.

715
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,166
Triple-time every mining shiff.

716
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,793
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

717
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:05,961
All of it! Let's go.

718
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,772
Now you have seen the truth.

719
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,111
Every day...

720
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:37,409
Every single day of my life

721
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,537
has been a lie.

722
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,956
My God, I knew it!

723
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,876
Deep down,
I always felt something was off.

724
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,337
He deceived everyone.

725
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,505
Sentinel bought himself power

726
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,550
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

727
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,260
I can't believe it.

728
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:58,680
Well, obviously, I can believe it.
I just saw it. But I still...

729
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,724
I can't believe it.

730
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:05,020
Sentinel lied to my face.

731
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,857
It was all a shame.
How could we have been so gullible?

732
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,444
This is going to change everything.

733
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,368
You just had to do it, didn't you?

734
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,662
Me? What did I do?

735
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,540
You just had to go to the surface,
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

736
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,126
You just had to break protocol!

737
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,880
-Who cares about protocol?
-I do! I care!

738
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:35,175
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

739
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:39,096
Sentinel Prime has been forcing us to work
in the mines until our gears strip,

740
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,766
and all the while he's been giving
the Energon away to our greatest enemies!

741
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,769
And what do you think he's gonna do
to us when he finds out that we know?

742
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,854
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

743
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,773
I'm thinking about what we're going to do.

744
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,983
Well, that's the whole thing!

745
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,610
You're never thinking about anything else,
just yourself!

746
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:57,948
Fantastic! Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

747
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,408
Don't you want to stop him?

748
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,326
No, I want to kill him!

749
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,622
I want to put Sentinel in chains
and march him through the mines

750
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,376
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

751
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,672
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

752
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,676
But we all know that it doesn't matter
what I want, right, Pax?

753
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:21,346
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

754
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,312
We had limited options, and now. . .
now we have none.

755
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:34,401
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

756
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,321
Oh, yeah. I've been with myself
since I came online,

757
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,365
and this slot's always been empty.

758
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,326
So what are you saying? Are you saying--

759
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,618
No. No way.

760
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,996
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

761
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,417
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

762
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:55,630
We were born
with transformation cogs, but he...

763
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,382
He took them from us.

764
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:03,305
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in his chest

765
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,684
but the spark that resides in their core.

766
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:13,690
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

767
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,195
My fellow Primes had that spark.

768
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,240
And I see their strength in you.

769
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:30,248
Take their cogs
and access your full potential.

770
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
Prima.

771
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,504
Onyx.

772
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,130
Alchemist.

773
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,299
Micronus.

774
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:45,138
Warriors of noble spirit,
Loyalty, strength.

775
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:49,726
Their uniqueness enhanced by these.

776
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:20,340
They were one. You are one.

777
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,884
AII are one!

778
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,943
Wait. We have. . . You gave us...

779
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,447
The ability to change your world.

780
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,535
How you choose to use that power
is up to you.

781
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,875
They've found us.

782
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,586
Oh, yes! Time to fight back!

783
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,465
No. You must return to Iacon City
and alert everyone.

784
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,929
Embedded in this are the records
I have shown you.

785
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:12,058
-Use it to reveal the truth.
-We will.

786
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,853
This tunnel leads to the mountains.

787
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,523
Cybertron's future is in your hands.

788
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,400
We're out of time. We got to move!

789
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,695
Wait. We can't just leave you here.

790
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,281
Your fight will come, my friend.

791
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,075
Primus has a purpose for us all.

792
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,660
But this fight...

793
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,330
This fight is mine.

794
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,414
Now go!

795
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,386
Stand down, old-timer.

796
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,389
Old, you say?

797
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,421
Not too old for you.

798
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,095
We need to hurry!

799
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,598
I still think we have better odds fighting
than outrunning them.

800
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,726
Wait! We have cogs. We can transform now.

801
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,688
-That's right. Everyone ready?
-I was born ready.

802
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,565
On three. One--

803
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,206
How do we use these things?

804
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,292
I don't know. Just try.

805
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,671
It's working. It's working!

806
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,506
My head! My head!

807
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,426
Helpl Help!

808
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,641
This is not faster!

809
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,521
Come on!

810
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,232
And transform!

811
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,778
Wheels! I need wheels!

812
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,733
Wow.

813
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,610
-We're alive!
-I've never moved that fast.

814
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:12,030
-That was incredible!
-See me slide all over the place?

815
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,788
Yes!

816
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,459
Hey, whoa, buddy. You okay?

817
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:28,088
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

818
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,298
We transform!

819
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,675
Oh, hey! I know.

820
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,010
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

821
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,887
Looks like the fastest way
back to Iacon is--

822
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,013
Here, I got it.

823
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,264
Whoa. What are you doing?

824
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,225
-Don't worry about it. I got it.
-But be careful.

825
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,395
Our proof is inside,
and you're spilling it everywhere.

826
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:49,567
I. . . got. . . it.

827
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,987
Okay.

828
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,284
Follow me.

829
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,960
Alpha Trion!

830
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,921
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

831
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,007
You look horrible.

832
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:17,595
Traitor. You are a disgrace.

833
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,681
Primus will surely--

834
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,391
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

835
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,644
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

836
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,065
Anything to get out of working for you
and that boring council of elders.

837
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:33,319
Seriously, I would watch you Primes
spend half the day losing a war

838
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:38,199
and the other half sitting around
waxing poetic about loyalty and honor.

839
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,534
And now look at you.

840
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:43,413
Hear my words: You will fall.

841
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,457
And a new Prime will rise--

842
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,916
There you go again.

843
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,919
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

844
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,715
There were others in the cave with you.
Who are they?

845
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,968
They are to be your undoing.

846
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:01,347
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

847
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,108
Didn't I just say no speeches?
You heard me, right?

848
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,486
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

849
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,572
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

850
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,784
Okay. Hunt down the others.

851
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,535
With pleasure.

852
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,553
Hey, buddy.

853
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,806
Hey.

854
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,810
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

855
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:51,648
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

856
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,443
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

857
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,528
We are.

858
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,697
With Alpha's proof inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

859
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,742
You honestly believe it'll be that easy?

860
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,913
Iacon doesn't want to hear the truth.
They worship Sentinel.

861
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,123
There's got to be a better way
to bring him down.

862
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,876
We have to trust that
everyone will believe what we show them.

863
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,253
I trusted Sentinel!

864
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,839
With everything.

865
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:22,095
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

866
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,599
There's only one bot I know I can--

867
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,237
<i>All right. Wake them up.</i>

868
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,597
Now, are you spies

869
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,767
or just incompetent lackeys?

870
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,604
-We're not spies.
-But he is incompetent.

871
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:16,941
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

872
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:21,487
That just means he believes himself,
like any spy would.

873
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,034
Why is he gagged?

874
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,577
He wouldn't stop talking.

875
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,287
Even when he was unconscious?

876
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,497
Especially when he was unconscious!

877
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,749
Enough!

878
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,084
Two options for you!

879
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:40,048
One, we slowly dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time

880
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,717
and really make sure you feel it.

881
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,801
Or two:

882
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:48,097
In exchange for a quick death,
you give us intel on the Energon trains,

883
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,099
access to the mines

884
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,811
or anything else
that could hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

885
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,730
Who exactly are you guys?

886
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:01,152
The Cybertronian High Guard!

887
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,071
I told you it wasn't tight enough!

888
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,199
-Prestigious defenders of Iacon.
-Prestigious?

889
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,910
He's right. I read all about you
in the archives.

890
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,288
You were the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

891
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,456
Look, look, look!

892
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:16,584
That's Starscream,
and you're Shockwave, and Soundwave.

893
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,712
Gosh, raise your hand if "wave" is
in your name. There's a lot of "waves."

894
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,297
Silence!

895
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,424
The yellow annoying one is correct.

896
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,260
We were once the High Guard.

897
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:30,014
We witnessed Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

898
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,892
Since that day,
we've been fighting from the shadows,

899
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,645
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

900
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,355
Well, that's great! We're--

901
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:41,109
Okay, okay. We're good. Everyone relax.

902
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,486
I'm just saying we're allies.

903
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,655
We were on our way back to Iacon,

904
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:49,701
and now with your help, we can unify
Cybertron against Sentinel Prime.

905
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,871
The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth.

906
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:58,710
All that counts
is the strength of one bot over another!

907
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,631
Okay. So these guys are a little intense.

908
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,550
Yeah, just a little.

909
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,302
Hey! What are you doing?

910
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,307
I tell you what I'm not doing.

911
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:17,645
I'm not cowering in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

912
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,856
I'm not pretending
Iike I'm making a difference

913
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,567
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

914
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:28,072
I found out that Sentinel is rotten today
and I'm gonna make him pay for it today!

915
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:31,909
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

916
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:35,997
No one leaves here unless I say so.

917
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,665
Is that right?

918
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,418
Well, how can you say so

919
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,628
with my head in your teeth?

920
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,464
D!

921
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,937
Hit me! Do it!

922
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,148
Come on! Yeah, more!

923
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:07,820
D-16! D-16! D-16!

924
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,366
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another, huh?

925
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,952
Is that all you've got, tough bot?

926
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,747
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

927
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,475
Please! I beg you!

928
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,727
Stop! D, he's not the enemy!

929
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,273
Bear witness!

930
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,568
This is the last time I show mercy!

931
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,238
Decide right now:

932
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,867
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before your pathetic leader,

933
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,204
or follow me as we march on Iacon

934
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,958
and I take down Sentinel once and for all!

935
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:08,840
D-16! D-16! D-16!

936
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:36,951
B, come on!

937
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,188
Engage all hostiles! I've got the bridge!

938
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,720
Elita, get down!

939
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,912
I feel like someone dropped a cliff on me.

940
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,122
Where are the others?

941
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,960
Sentinel's troops took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

942
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,753
They got D-16 and B.

943
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,672
Oh, no.

944
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,383
And half of those High-Guard nutjobs.

945
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,970
Our proof.

946
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,429
It's gone.

947
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,557
So, what do we do now?

948
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,101
D was right.

949
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,728
-About what?
-Everything.

950
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,524
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

951
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,069
It's all my fault.
I should have stayed on protocol.

952
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,745
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

953
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:45,830
Are you listening?

954
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,875
I'm better than you.

955
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,753
Yeah, okay, I'm hearing you.

956
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,966
I'm better than you in every way,
except you have hope.

957
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:01,220
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

958
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:05,224
You snuck up to the surface
to find the Matrix of Leadership.

959
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,101
Yeah, and how'd that work out?

960
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:12,773
My point is that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

961
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:17,361
This blind optimism that you have
is why you make

962
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:20,823
such bold and courageous choices

963
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,492
that are also extremely stupid.

964
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,037
First time giving a pep talk?

965
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,788
You're inspiring.

966
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:31,208
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

967
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,254
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

968
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:39,342
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

969
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,594
Listen to me.

970
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,679
We can do this.

971
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:49,310
Those Energon trains
will be heading back to Iacon.

972
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,063
If we intercepted one--

973
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,857
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

974
01:09:55,358 --> 01:10:00,029
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

975
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,367
I was afraid you'd say that.

976
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,953
Shockwave, Soundwave. You in the back.

977
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,248
In order to save our captured friends,
we have to act now.

978
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,876
How about I blast you back to Iacon?

979
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,962
She punched me in my eye!

980
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,216
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

981
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:25,679
Most likely, our friends are being held
captive at the top of Sentinel's tower.

982
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,724
A surprise attack would give us
a chance to rescue them.

983
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:33,729
Impossible. We do not have
enough soldiers or a way inside.

984
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,899
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

985
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,526
Why should we follow you?

986
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,320
We will follow you.

987
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,573
Attention, High Guard. Prepare for battle.

988
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,617
What is our first move?

989
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,827
We roll out.

990
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:50,413
What?

991
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,831
Louder.

992
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,291
Transform and roll out!

993
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,805
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

994
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:11,392
Look at this rowdy bunch! The High Guard!

995
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:13,352
You know, you guys have been
tough to find.

996
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,897
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

997
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,442
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

998
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,696
-You captured Starscream!
-It was too easy.

999
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,366
I'm going to rip you apart piece by piece
so that your death is painful!

1000
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,703
-You'll regret the day you were--
-You sound ridiculous. It's weird.

1001
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,706
D-16, what a tragic story you'II be.

1002
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,626
Atop the leaderboard in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1003
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,712
I'm not a traitor. You're the traitor.

1004
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,465
Nuh-uh. You, all of you, are traitors.

1005
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,968
You've been working with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1006
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,596
You're the reason why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1007
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,805
None of that is true!

1008
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,223
Trust me, it'll be very true

1009
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,393
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1010
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:58,272
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1011
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,742
Well, well. What's this about?

1012
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:12,411
I'm not kneeling in front of you.

1013
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,955
Feeling confident, are we?

1014
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,209
You don't scare me. You want to know why?

1015
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,585
Please.

1016
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,506
Because I don't have
anything left to Iose.

1017
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,217
You took it all.

1018
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,427
I sure did.

1019
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,933
Megatronus Prime.

1020
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:38,395
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was the coolest Prime!

1021
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,482
The biggest! The baddest! The toughest!

1022
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,069
That's why, after I killed him,

1023
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:48,030
I took his cog for myself.

1024
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,533
He was greater than you'll ever be!

1025
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,826
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1026
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,704
But I can understand
why you'd want to wear his face over mine.

1027
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:56,789
Here.

1028
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,834
Let's make sure it doesn't come off.

1029
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,981
Okay.

1030
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,150
I can do this.

1031
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:42,001
You can't be serious.
We just worked 22 shiffs without a break!

1032
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,961
These miners need rest
and time to repair--

1033
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:46,255
Sentinel Prime wants more Energon.

1034
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:49,717
So get back in the mines
before I make you get back in--

1035
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,391
-Who was that?
-Did you see who that was?

1036
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:58,517
That can't be him.

1037
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,602
Is that...

1038
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,396
It can't be.

1039
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,857
-Orion?
-Jazz.

1040
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,275
Is it really you?

1041
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,777
Yeah, I know I Iook a little different.

1042
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,362
"Little"?

1043
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,489
There's nothing "little" about you.

1044
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,033
How is this possible?

1045
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,910
Sentinel told us
you died from your race injuries.

1046
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,872
Sentinel is a liar.

1047
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:20,956
What?

1048
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:27,171
I know how this will sound coming from me.
I was never the most focused miner.

1049
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,257
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1050
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:42,353
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1051
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,563
My friends,

1052
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:49,777
we were all born with transformation cogs.

1053
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,530
And then Sentinel, he stole them from us.

1054
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,408
He took away
our ability to make our own decisions.

1055
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,370
He stole our freedom.

1056
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:08,170
But now I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1057
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:13,050
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1058
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,554
or fight back against Sentinel with me.

1059
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,431
Right now.

1060
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:23,519
-How are we supposed to do that?
-We can't fight. We don't have cogs.

1061
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,733
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1062
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,319
but the spark that resides in their core.

1063
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,281
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1064
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:40,744
And that spark,
Sentinel can never take from us.

1065
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,205
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1066
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:46,959
And we have one. Elita is bringing troops.

1067
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,044
We are not alone in this.

1068
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,839
If we want to be
in control of our own destiny,

1069
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:53,507
we will have to fight for it.

1070
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:59,012
Now is the time
for us to stand up for ourselves.

1071
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,600
Stand up for this injustice.

1072
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:09,064
I promise you this fight will be worth it.

1073
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,775
Follow me.

1074
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,987
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1075
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,157
Together as one.

1076
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,661
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

1077
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:25,080
<i>Elita, it's time.</i>

1078
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,498
You got it.

1079
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,792
Buckle up, BIinky. We're going in.

1080
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,849
Not a good idea.

1081
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,770
D, stay down.

1082
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,033
Well, that's a shame.

1083
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:03,368
You really were a great miner.

1084
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,334
We've got a breach! Protect Sentinel!

1085
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,137
Looks like they spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1086
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:25,349
High Guard, eject.

1087
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:26,725
Come on! Move out!

1088
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,742
There's too many. We have to abort!

1089
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,457
We're not gonna make it.

1090
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,673
Metal to the pedal, miners!
Let's break some protocol!

1091
01:17:57,756 --> 01:17:59,424
That's what I'm talking about, Pax!

1092
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,353
That's intense.

1093
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:16,149
You can't win, miner. I see everything!

1094
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,944
That's right, you do.

1095
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,780
Except the tower
we're about to crash into.

1096
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,336
What's going on?

1097
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:41,717
Hey.

1098
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,390
What has he done to you?

1099
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:51,852
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1100
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,063
Soundwave, free the prisoners.

1101
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,112
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1102
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:03,822
-I'm doing this my way.
-D!

1103
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,454
Yes!

1104
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,374
I got a battle mask!

1105
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:20,464
Elita! Battle mask!
It appeared when this guy tried to--

1106
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,050
Sword hands? I have sword hands!

1107
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,095
What the--

1108
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,934
Badassatron.

1109
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,565
Where's Sentinel?

1110
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,737
You pathetic little twits.

1111
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,283
Did you really think that you could
knock down everything I've built?

1112
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,827
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.

1113
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:54,831
What truth? That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1114
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:58,210
Forced you to mine so that I could pay off
the Quintessons and Iive Iike a king?

1115
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,003
None of that matters!

1116
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:05,384
Because the truth is what I make it.

1117
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,512
Incoming!

1118
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,437
-He's too strong.
-I have a plan.

1119
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,314
-We need Airachnid.
-Airachnid?

1120
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,525
-We need her memory.
-Where is she?

1121
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:22,484
Found her!

1122
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:25,654
Elita!

1123
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:27,823
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1124
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,492
<i>Bring her to the broadcast station.</i>
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

1125
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:32,452
Easier said than done.

1126
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:55,809
<i>-I said, don't break her!</i>
-Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1127
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,983
Orion! Orion, look! I have sword hands!

1128
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,526
I can see that.

1129
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,278
I'm gonna cut these guys. Watch.
Come here!

1130
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,071
You can jab them later. We got to go.

1131
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,035
Yeah!

1132
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,556
Excuse me. You can't be in--

1133
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,273
B!

1134
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,318
-These are not the bad guys.
-Why did you cut the door?

1135
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,945
What? No, I didn't. . . That was...

1136
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,031
It was already like that. Right?

1137
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:54,034
-Yes, that's right.
-That's right, yes. It was already Iike...

1138
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,540
<i>Attention, Iacon City.</i>

1139
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:03,960
<i>Stand by for a live transmission
from Sentinel Prime.</i>

1140
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,426
What's wrong, D-16?

1141
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,428
Rise up!

1142
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,433
<i>That's why, after I killed him--</i>

1143
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:23,188
<i>That's why, after I killed him,
l took his cog for myself.</i>

1144
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,524
<i>...cog for myself.</i>

1145
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:29,152
<i>What truth? That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1146
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:33,031
<i>Forced you to mine so that I could pay off</i>
<i>the Quintessons and live like a king?</i>

1147
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,493
<i>What truth? That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?</i>

1148
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:40,413
<i>Forced you to mine so that I could pay off</i> 
<i>the Quintessons and live like a king?</i>

1149
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:44,709
<i>I'm working my miners as hard as I can.
I swear I will get you the rest!</i>

1150
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:49,422
<i>I'm working my miners as hard as I can.
I swear I will get you the rest!</i>

1151
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,592
<i>I'm working my miners as hard as I can.</i>

1152
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,219
Liar!

1153
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,890
We trusted you!

1154
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,600
Traitor!

1155
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,686
Pax, we did it.

1156
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,448
D!

1157
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:44,644
D-16.

1158
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,689
We can lead Cybertron together!

1159
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,065
Don't do this!

1160
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:56,489
What are you doing?

1161
01:23:56,573 --> 01:24:00,285
It's over, D.
Everyone in Iacon knows the truth.

1162
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,912
So do I!

1163
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:05,081
He took everything from us!
I have to do this!

1164
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,791
No, you don't.

1165
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:10,462
Rebuilding Iacon cannot begin
with an execution.

1166
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,048
He deserves to die! Can't you see that?

1167
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:16,051
We're better than this.
Don't be like Sentinel.

1168
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,596
Pax,

1169
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,767
you need to move out of my way
before I move you myself.

1170
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,976
D, listen--

1171
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:35,362
Stop!

1172
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,291
No!

1173
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,418
No, no, no, no. Why?

1174
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,838
Why did you do that? Why?

1175
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,976
D, no.

1176
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,525
I'm done saving you.

1177
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,419
The Age of Primes has ended!

1178
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,797
No more false prophets!

1179
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,343
Follow me and you will never again
be deceived.

1180
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:06,346
Rise up!

1181
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:07,722
Rise up!

1182
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:10,850
Rise up! Rise up!

1183
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,020
<i>Orion Pax,</i>

1184
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:19,401
<i>your noble sacrifice for the greater good
has proven you worthy</i>

1185
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,236
<i>in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1186
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:24,489
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1187
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,409
the future of Cybertron

1188
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:33,039
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1189
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,669
I will lead us all into the future!

1190
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:55,728
I...

1191
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:57,564
am...

1192
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:00,275
Megatron!

1193
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,944
<i>Arise...</i>

1194
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,239
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1195
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:10,910
Burn it down!

1196
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:12,912
All of it!

1197
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,504
All hail Megatron!

1198
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,884
-He's gonna kill everyone.
-We have to stop him. Come on.

1199
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,720
Stop! It's over.

1200
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:32,891
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1201
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,926
Impossible.

1202
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,556
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1203
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:16,559
We could've built the future together.

1204
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,603
I'll build it myself

1205
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:22,190
after I tear down everyone in my way!

1206
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:10,131
We were given
the power to change our world,

1207
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,592
and you chose to destroy it.

1208
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:13,885
Just like Sentinel.

1209
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,972
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1210
01:31:19,682 --> 01:31:22,435
And you betrayed me.

1211
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,572
Go.

1212
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,242
Take the High Guard and leave.

1213
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:43,039
You are banished from Iacon.

1214
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:50,171
It didn't have to end this way.

1215
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:55,968
This isn't over, Prime.

1216
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,895
High Guard, follow me!

1217
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:24,789
<i>The line between friend and enemy
is not as clear as I once believed.</i>

1218
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:28,668
<i>Once it's crossed, there's no going back.</i>

1219
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:32,672
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1220
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,049
Hey, Megatronus Prime. Nice.

1221
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,051
Oh, yeah. Well, he's my hero.

1222
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,012
-The greatest Prime to ever live.
-The greatest Prime to ever live.

1223
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:43,516
-I'm D-16.
-Orion Pax.

1224
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:46,436
-You ever mine Energon before?
-No.

1225
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:49,647
-You?
-No. I hear it's dangerous.

1226
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,399
Well, I'll tell you what.

1227
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:54,193
You watch my back,
I'll promise to watch yours.

1228
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:55,445
All right.

1229
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,239
Thanks, Pax.

1230
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:13,588
A new beginning for Cybertron.

1231
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,631
And a new leader.

1232
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,425
Yes, about that.

1233
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:22,680
I could use some help from a bot
who is better than me in every way.

1234
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:24,640
Who, me? Oh, no.

1235
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,059
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1236
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,062
Well, Captain, I do owe you a promotion.

1237
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,815
How's Major Elita sound?

1238
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,401
How about Commander?

1239
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,153
Even better.

1240
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:41,324
And I'm sorry, B, but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1241
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:44,994
I may be a Prime now,
but I'm gonna need you by my side.

1242
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:48,414
Are you serious?
This is the greatest day of my Iife.

1243
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,708
I get to work for the government.

1244
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,253
Okay. So that's new.

1245
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:55,797
I'm sorry. What is happening?

1246
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:30,081
<i>And now we stand here together as one...</i>

1247
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,628
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1248
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,881
<i>to become who we were destined to be,</i>

1249
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:43,052
<i>to right wrongs, to make our world better.</i>

1250
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:49,517
<i>Because here, freedom and autonomy
are the rights of all sentient beings.</i>

1251
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:55,147
<i>Here, all are truly Autobots.</i>

1252
01:34:56,566 --> 01:35:00,069
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1253
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:05,533
<i>If you dare return to Cybertron,</i>
<i>the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1254
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:08,452
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1255
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:12,290
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

1256
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:42,612
Hey, guys! Great news, the Energon's back!

1257
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:44,906
And I have a cog and I can transform!

1258
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,241
It's a long story. I'll fill you in later.

1259
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:50,369
And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up swords.

1260
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,204
Watch this. Sword hands!

1261
01:35:54,206 --> 01:35:55,207
No!

1262
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:23,405
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1263
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:27,618
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

1264
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,912
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1265
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:32,039
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1266
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:37,336
<i>We will not be blinded by his deception.</i>

1267
01:43:37,419 --> 01:43:40,005
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1268
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:42,841
Decepticons!

1269
01:43:42,925 --> 01:43:44,676
Rise up!

1270
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,180
Rise up! Rise up!
