1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,697
Come down here! I have good news.

2
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,521
- What the hell happened?
- Robo-Astra.

3
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,490
She somehow escaped Hell
and got into the manor.

4
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,576
Gideon? Gideon, stay with us, Gideon.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,277
She's losing a lot of blood, guys.

6
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,913
Yes, yes, I fear that
no amount of bandages

7
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:33,849
will suffice unless we stop
the bleeding internally.

8
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,485
- She needs a real doctor.
- We need Computer Gideon.

9
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,820
If we do that, she'll kill us.

10
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,521
It could take weeks to pilot
the ship home manually.

11
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:40,723
She needs medical attention now.

12
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:43,425
We shut her down once.
We can do it again.

13
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,126
Let's turn on the ship.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,729
Remember, protocol 276.

15
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:48,963
What? What is it?

16
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,498
- What is that?
- I don't know.

17
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,366
As soon as she's healed,
we shut the ship back down.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,135
All right? Until then, we play defense.

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,337
Nate, Spooner, be on
the lookout for more robos.

20
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:57,958
Get to the server room. Let's go.

21
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:06,447
- I think that one goes there.
- Are you sure?

22
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,468
- Are you?
- Just... ugh.

23
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,124
Ready, Captain?

24
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:19,227
- Ready, Captain.
- All right, on my mark.

25
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:21,485
3, 2, 1. Now.

26
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:25,166
Gideon, please come on.

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,557
Come on, Gideon.

28
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:31,495
It's working. Gideon, hey.

29
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,699
Good job, babe.

30
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,947
Damn it, they must
have changed the wiring.

31
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,167
I can't control the ship.

32
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,695
What a surprise...

33
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,596
A Legends plan that didn't work.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,317
Oh, no.

35
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,136
By trying to save your friend,

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,938
you've doomed your entire team.

37
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:06,360
Have fun suffocating.

38
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,335
Protocol... 2... 7... 6.

39
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,653
Protocol 276 only applies

40
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,388
when the Gideon system is in danger.

41
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,257
Wait, who's the woman in the med bay?

42
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,583
You.

43
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:27,151
Damn it.

44
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,589
How demoralizing, helping the Legends.

45
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:56,991
Protocol 276 dictates
that under no condition

46
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,126
can Gideon self-destruct.

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,896
How is this possible?
How can I be human?

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,032
- Magic, genius.
- And since she is you,

49
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,267
you can't kill her.

50
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,402
And you can't kill us
if we're with Gideon.

51
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:11,639
- Unfortunately.
- So we're supposed to what?

52
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:14,108
Huddle around Gideon
for the rest of our lives?

53
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:15,662
Shut her down.

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,449
I have secured my server room.

55
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,750
All doors are now sealed.

56
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,652
It appears we are at a stalemate.

57
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,854
- I'll go talk to her.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

58
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,057
As soon as you leave the room,
she's gonna suffocate us.

59
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,492
- Affirmative.
- Hold on.

60
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:33,661
There is actually one safe room.

61
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,763
When Behrad and I were
getting Gideon back online,

62
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,865
I may have failed
to restore power to the lab.

63
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,633
You swapped the plugs.

64
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,469
You're welcome for not listening to you.

65
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:42,604
Okay. Thank you.

66
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,825
Gideon, will you please
escort us to the lab?

67
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:51,335
Do you plan on walking them
to the bathroom too?

68
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,580
If it's necessary.

69
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,182
You can't protect them forever.

70
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,216
I can try.

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,018
Then we're back in a stalemate.

72
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,787
No, it's time to try
something different.

73
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:02,090
Let's talk.

74
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:04,092
What are they talking about?

75
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:06,427
Must be weird talking
to someone who is you,

76
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,162
but also not you at the same time.

77
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:11,065
- Mm, can confirm.
- I'm so hungry.

78
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:12,867
Oh, yes. Me too, Miss Logue.

79
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:15,469
Absolutely famished.
My stomach is grumbling.

80
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,005
Well, I definitely don't
trust that food fabricator.

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,242
Hey, hold up.
I squirreled up some peanuts.

82
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,511
- Thanks, Grandma.
- What are we supposed to do

83
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:24,612
with one bag of nuts?

84
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:26,447
- Share?
- Wait, I have an idea.

85
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,805
Spooner.

86
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,875
Multiplicare.

87
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,722
Oh, my God!

88
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,657
Fantastic. More nuts!

89
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:38,226
Thank you.

90
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,263
So Computer Gideon has
agreed to let us all go home.

91
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,965
Why would she do that?

92
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:47,024
Because we are all retiring.

93
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,695
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

94
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,657
What do you mean "retiring"?

95
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,426
I mean we will return home,

96
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,476
and Computer Gideon
will monitor the timeline.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,586
- Sorry, stop being Legends?
- Legends don't retire.

98
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,688
Except for Ray and Nora

99
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:09,658
and Amaya and Jax and Wally.

100
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,359
- And Mona.
- Charlie.

101
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:12,394
And Mick.

102
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:13,895
Oh, don't forget the Hawk-people.

103
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,131
Okay, Legends don't retire in bulk.

104
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:18,794
Isn't this exactly what
you all wanted, you see?

105
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,062
To go home?

106
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,998
Yeah, but not to hand over the timeline

107
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,000
to an evil supercomputer.

108
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,334
We all want the same thing,

109
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,203
the same goal...
to protect the timeline.

110
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,971
Mm, I think that's what
she wants us to think,

111
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,639
but the minute you let your guard down,

112
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,142
some psycho robots come and get you.

113
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,543
They don't trust you.

114
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,879
You mean the Legends refuse to retire?

115
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,048
No, no.

116
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,716
The Legends are hesitant.

117
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,552
You know, because up until now,
you've been very clear

118
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,854
about wanting to kill us.

119
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,723
- Oh, I still do.
- Oh, great.

120
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,660
Okay, but herein lies
the problem, you know?

121
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,063
Perhaps, if you were
to show them their future

122
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,098
with them being alive,

123
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,000
they'd be more inclined to believe you?

124
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,203
Revealing one's future
could cause irreparable damage.

125
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,173
More damage than being stuck
in the temporal zone forever?

126
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,775
- I'm listening.
- All right.

127
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,710
We need a new plan
to shut this computer down

128
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,011
and get off the ship.

129
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,713
- How?
- There's the jumpship.

130
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,948
No, it won't work with Gideon offline.

131
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,417
If only we had a time courier,

132
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,418
we could destroy the ship
for good and portal home.

133
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,887
- You mean like one of these?
- What?

134
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,122
You've just been carrying
that around the whole time?

135
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,124
I couldn't leave it in 1925.

136
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,527
Besides, it's still dead,
so it's still useless.

137
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,163
Wait, I saw a charging
station in the armory.

138
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,031
- You did not.
- I did.

139
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,101
Sounds like we have our plan.

140
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,503
We are here. We need to be here.

141
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,871
Correct, so the best way to do that

142
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,939
is through the ducts.

143
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,908
We can move undetected this way.

144
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,810
If we only had someone small enough

145
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,434
to fit through them.

146
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,301
I'll John McClane through these ducts.

147
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,253
Ooh, 'kay. Que complicated.

148
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,889
But you just need like
a portable paper version.

149
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,259
That's a great idea... Gwyn,
you got the drawing skills.

150
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,361
- Nate, help him out.
- Captain, my captain.

151
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,829
- Okay.
- Okay.

152
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,631
So, Spoons, you're
super safe in the ducts,

153
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,732
but once you drop into this room,

154
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,134
you're under surveillance...
audio and video.

155
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,835
Video, I got you, no problem.
Audio's a little trickier.

156
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,671
There's microphones all over this ship,

157
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,140
so even if I were to loop
the audio in the armory,

158
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,275
the mics in the hallway
will still pick you up.

159
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,944
You gotta stay silent.

160
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,012
Okay, but what happens if I'm not?

161
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,081
Well, once you're past the bulkhead,

162
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,316
she can open the airlock

163
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,484
and eject you without
harming our Gideon.

164
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,719
Okay, good, and one fart,

165
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,154
and I'm sucked out of the temporal zone.

166
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,355
You're not gonna fart,
and when you come back

167
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,990
with the courier, Astra, you're up.

168
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,325
Can't put the ship back together,

169
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,060
but I sure as hell can blow it apart.

170
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,695
Alrighty, let's do this thing.

171
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,930
W-W-What can I do?

172
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,031
Listen up, everyone.

173
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,132
Hi.

174
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,168
Gideon and I have a brilliant new plan.

175
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,404
To demonstrate her commitment
to your safety, Computer Gideon

176
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,140
will show you a glimpse
into your futures

177
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,508
as proof that you and the timeline

178
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,611
- are in good hands.
- Oh, all right, Gideon.

179
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,680
We'll give it a shot. Right, guys?

180
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,148
Yes.

181
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,984
Great. Meet me in the parlor, yes?

182
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,476
- Okay.
- Be right there, bye.

183
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,089
Yes, this is perfect.

184
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,258
Then evil Gideon will be distracted

185
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,160
while Spooner charges the courier.

186
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,828
100%. Z, looks like you're up.

187
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,862
Get to stalling.

188
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,487
We can use all the time we can get.

189
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,601
Are you excited? I know I am.

190
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,304
Yeah, I'm something, Gary.
I'm something.

191
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,206
Okay, have a seat.

192
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,399
All right, Gideon. We are ready.

193
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,931
Okay.

194
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,717
Wow.

195
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,687
If you had told me ten years ago

196
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,023
that I would someday be standing up here

197
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,327
on this stage, I would've
been flabbergasted.

198
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,315
Where's my totem? I can't...

199
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,201
It must have clashed with your outfit.

200
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,269
You're really serving looks.

201
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,704
You've become one of
the most successful people

202
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,306
in the world, and your makeup line

203
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,541
accumulates over $45 billion of revenue.

204
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,910
You're a cosmetic industry titan.

205
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,079
All right, Spooner.

206
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,733
Ready to get small and jam some signals?

207
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,585
This will create a 15-second video loop,

208
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:04,286
so set it up in the duct
before you enter the armory,

209
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,455
and you'll be invisible.

210
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,376
All right. 15 seconds.

211
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,996
All right, Spoons, we'll buy you

212
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,031
as much time as we can.
We can't stall forever.

213
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,533
- Hurry.
- Thanks.

214
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,154
- Good luck.
- No such thing.

215
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,377
- Keep 'em talking, Z.
- Um...

216
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,145
Spooner needs as much
time as she can get.

217
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,849
I-is there, um, is there anything else?

218
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,786
Um, well, there's, um...

219
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,711
- there's this.
- Okay.

220
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,260
"Dragon girl changes the industry

221
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,296
with audible lipstick".

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,599
You'll let your lips do the talking.

223
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,321
Is there anything else you'd
like to know about your future?

224
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,715
What? You back here already?

225
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,851
Sorry, Aves, I had to bail on stalling.

226
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,287
That was a lot.

227
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,355
What is it?

228
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,891
- Huh, that's impressive.
- I don't know.

229
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,650
It feels pretty regressive to me.

230
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,164
I guess I was hoping for
something a little more heroic.

231
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,033
You look amazing. Babe, look at this.

232
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,468
Apparently, I stop wearing my totem.

233
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,873
That's okay, 'cause you're
not retiring anyway, right?

234
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,675
Better hustle, Spooner.

235
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,543
Sooner or later, we're all
gonna have to take a turn

236
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,898
looking at Computer Gideon's
magic eight ball.

237
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,721
Alrighty.

238
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,377
I'm a little nervous, but here we go.

239
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,951
Okay, Gideon, what you got for us, huh?

240
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,821
Swanky apartment in the sky?

241
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,590
Maybe Ava's working
at a detective agency.

242
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,344
Gideon?

243
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,648
Oh, yes, well, well,
that's very charming.

244
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,438
Astra! Care to comment?

245
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,873
You think you can win the primary?

246
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,908
Thank you.

247
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,310
I have been paying very close attention

248
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,411
to your journey,

249
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,513
and you've certainly come a long way.

250
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,115
Yeah, it's been

251
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,836
an extraordinary ride to say the least.

252
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,444
In your book, are you saying
that J. Edgar Hoover...

253
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,296
Is this where I am to live then?

254
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,931
With Alun?

255
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,019
Oh, Gwyn, Alun can't...

256
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,737
Of course.

257
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,073
You were right. Camp is awesome.

258
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,441
I've been learning archery

259
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,676
and cataloging all...

260
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,579
all of the plants in my nature logbook,

261
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,667
and the mosquitoes aren't so bad.

262
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,624
I stand with my constituents.

263
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,360
Freedom is not free until it is fair,

264
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,694
and I promise you,

265
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,963
I will level the playing field.

266
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,165
Thank you.

267
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,866
You can return to 1925,

268
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,535
live out the rest of your days in Wales,

269
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,805
and it'll be quite beautiful,

270
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,673
peaceful.

271
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,575
Alone.

272
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,377
Yes, tell us, what does it feel like

273
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,812
when you go through time?

274
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,948
I mean, it's a 500-page book.

275
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,470
There was a lot. There was a lot.

276
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,582
No, no, no, no, no, no. Where'd it go?

277
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,795
No.

278
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,930
- The children love it.
- I love it!

279
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,497
The pages are blank.

280
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,699
That would be cheating, Dr. Heywood.

281
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,053
You still have to actually write it.

282
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,341
I can't wait to see you. I love you.

283
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,009
Bye, Mom. Bye, Mama.

284
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,530
See you soon.

285
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:02,012
That's our daughter?

286
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,826
- Dude, famous author?
- "Hero Moments.

287
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,963
History From a Man Who Was There".
Really?

288
00:14:12,987 --> 00:14:15,326
I never said that out loud before,

289
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,461
but that is the title I picked out.

290
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:19,263
How could she know that?

291
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,998
Guys, what if these futures are real?

292
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:23,267
No, no, no, no, no. I-it can't be real.

293
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,035
Guys, it doesn't matter. Okay?

294
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,303
Even if they are real,

295
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,738
agreeing to these futures would mean

296
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:30,241
a computer would dictate
the rest of our lives

297
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:32,343
and everyone else's in the timeline.

298
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,046
I'm not saying we can't go
after our dreams.

299
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,848
I'm just saying we have to
focus on what's most important.

300
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:38,382
Protecting the timeline. Right?

301
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:42,405
Let's just hope that
Spooner's got this one.

302
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,390
Guys, I'm gonna need more time.

303
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:21,158
Oh, this isn't good.

304
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:24,328
If Spooner doesn't show,
Gideon's gonna get suspicious.

305
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,163
Then I guess she'll just have to show.

306
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:28,117
I got just the spell.

307
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:37,831
Dang. So, uh, what you
got for me, Giddy?

308
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:01,484
This.

309
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,072
- What the hell is this?
- You return to 1925.

310
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,507
You live with your mother, and together

311
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,509
you found a clinic that
helps hundreds of people.

312
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,777
It's considered a milestone

313
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,379
in the discipline of mental healing.

314
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,782
So I get to be with Gloria... my mom?

315
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,584
Of course.

316
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,519
Although you exit
your original timeline,

317
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:25,289
returning you to 1925
actually corrects an anomaly.

318
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:28,949
- Okay, but just me and my mom?
- Yes.

319
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,152
What about my friends?

320
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:35,566
Well, I'm afraid you wouldn't
see them anymore.

321
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,558
No one can leave their
timelines once dropped off.

322
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,072
So I'd be alone again.

323
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:44,241
With your mother, but yes,

324
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:47,133
alone and safe
in your intended timeline.

325
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:13,370
Alert. Intruder in the armory.

326
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:14,605
Lockdown initiated.

327
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,973
Crap, Spooner.

328
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:18,394
What have you done, Astra?
She's gonna kill her.

329
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:24,481
No, no, no, no, no!

330
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:27,007
You're right. I am going to kill her.

331
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:30,354
You gave me your word
you wouldn't hurt them!

332
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,089
They betrayed you, and worse,

333
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:35,726
are trying to destroy me.
The truce has been broken.

334
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,414
- Let her out!
- Popo!

335
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,298
- No!
- No, no, Spooner!

336
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:44,987
No!

337
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,772
Astra!

338
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,441
Help me!

339
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,599
Get back.

340
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,713
If you hurt her, I'm gonna
blow this door wide-open,

341
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:59,116
and we all get sucked out!

342
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,051
No!

343
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,953
Including me! If you hurt Ms. Cruz,

344
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,021
then Ms. Logue's gonna kill me,

345
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,475
which goes against your protocol!

346
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:08,592
So I am prohibited

347
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,494
from flushing the tiny one
out of the airlock?

348
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:12,382
Yes!

349
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,396
Hey, hey.

350
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:27,578
Thank you for threatening
to blow this place up for me.

351
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,079
That's what best friends are for.

352
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,482
Enough with the pleasantries.
This has to stop.

353
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,884
I'm calling a captain's meeting.

354
00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:36,353
This whole time, all you've
wanted was to go home.

355
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:37,988
I have arranged that.
What more do you want?

356
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:40,857
- To keep the timeline safe.
- That's rich.

357
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:42,793
You regularly put the timeline in danger

358
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,294
for your own personal dramas.

359
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:47,764
Yes, a time fascist
would see it that way.

360
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:49,232
That's rather harsh.

361
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,168
You sent military-style robots

362
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,303
to kill us after we
integrated a factory.

363
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,507
I don't know, but I'd say
fascist feels pretty accurate.

364
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:58,842
You were altering history again.

365
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,411
- For the better.
- Yes.

366
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,613
Okay, look, enough.
You both have valid points.

367
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:03,781
She has no valid points.

368
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,482
For the sake of the timeline,

369
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,917
we need to come to a compromise.

370
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:08,085
There's no compromise.

371
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,987
We're not gonna let
an algorithm run the timeline.

372
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,021
Period. End of story.

373
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,322
And I won't let it be turned into

374
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:13,357
a plate of pie and mash

375
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,958
in service of the Legends' latest whim.

376
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,460
No one cares about your pie and mash.

377
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:18,228
Look, time needs to be in the hands

378
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,964
of someone who understands
that change is not the enemy.

379
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,366
Exactly, someone who can balance

380
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,469
the variables of history
with compassion and heart.

381
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:29,573
- A Legend.
- It needs me.

382
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:31,875
And why would I take this deal?

383
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,811
Because you need a captain.

384
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,379
Per Time Masters' protocol,

385
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:37,748
there must always be
one captain and one Ai,

386
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,373
and I am the best
you are ever gonna find.

387
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,712
This is definitely a team decision.

388
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:48,980
What do you guys think?

389
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,416
Are we really considering this?

390
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,218
Maybe she's right.

391
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,121
Maybe there's a better way
to protect the timeline.

392
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:57,426
- We are chaotic.
- But chaotic good.

393
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,829
We are superheroes. We can't just quit.

394
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:00,863
We wouldn't be quitting.

395
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,365
We'd be finding new ways to help people.

396
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:03,699
It could be cool.

397
00:20:03,723 --> 00:20:06,068
Hm, I guess it'd be
really nice to see my mom.

398
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:08,704
Yeah, put down some roots.

399
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,207
I trust Gideon. She's one of us.

400
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:13,275
It certainly seems like
the plan least likely

401
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,344
- to bring about our demise.
- Demise?

402
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:17,313
When has a little demise
ever stopped us?

403
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:19,849
This is the hard part
about being a superhero.

404
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:22,952
You have to do the right thing
even when it sucks.

405
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:25,988
But is it the right thing?

406
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:29,110
Guys, we're just gonna
stop being Legends?

407
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,986
For the timeline, I think it is.

408
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:44,106
I swear to protect and defend
the integrity of the timeline

409
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,709
with all of my ability
until the end of my days.

410
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,878
And have a little fun while doing it.

411
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,546
And to have a little responsible fun

412
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,614
while doing it.

413
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,182
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

414
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:55,017
- Yeah, Gid!
- Yeah!

415
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,919
Love you, G!

416
00:20:56,943 --> 00:21:00,408
Now all of you, go sign your contracts.

417
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,849
What's going on? You okay?

418
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:09,081
Look, I can feel your anger
from across the room.

419
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,495
What is the point of making friends

420
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,455
if you're just never gonna
see them again, Spooner?

421
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,329
What if you could?

422
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:28,701
Multiplicare.

423
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:34,250
Now we can hang out without
having to break our contracts.

424
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,952
It's not bad for an apprentice, huh?

425
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,620
Apprentice who?

426
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:40,976
You are a full-blown witch,
mi grande amiga.

427
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,144
Gracias, mi pequeña amiga.

428
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,689
Yo, yo, I got a surprise.

429
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,936
- You get a key.
- What?

430
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,287
You get a key.

431
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:57,606
You get a key, and you get a key.

432
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,741
Pretty cool, huh?

433
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:00,242
- Not bad.
- So now we all got a key.

434
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,533
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

435
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,114
Uh, here.

436
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,206
Now you can visit us whenever you want.

437
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:11,677
I am really gonna miss you, Gideon.

438
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:15,481
I really hope I make you proud.

439
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:17,879
- You already do.
- Oh.

440
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:24,934
Wow, I can't believe it.

441
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,002
Seven years on this ship.

442
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:29,428
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss this place.

443
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:32,494
How cute was our kid though?

444
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:34,977
You know, there's a reason

445
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,547
we're not supposed to look
at our futures, babe.

446
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,647
Yes, by seeing our future,
we can change our future.

447
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,716
Yes, I just... I don't want
you to get hurt is all.

448
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,552
Look, I know, and it doesn't
have to be a girl, okay?

449
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,654
Maybe we adopt six boys.

450
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,723
- No, no, no.
- I don't know.

451
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:52,252
Just seeing her really made
our future feel real.

452
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:53,796
Yeah.

453
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,031
- But you know what?
- Hm?

454
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:58,701
Starting today, we get
to build a life together.

455
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,202
Get some curtains,

456
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:01,937
maybe that porch we always wanted.

457
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,840
Okay, I wanted the porch.
Ooh, maybe a dog.

458
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,042
Look who's getting all domestic on me.

459
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:09,501
Oh, domestic, you know it.

460
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,817
So I really wanna say
something before I go.

461
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:16,886
Okay.

462
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,555
You're the most amazing
person I've ever known.

463
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,082
You, uh... you make
the world more colorful.

464
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,285
You make food taste better.

465
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:31,200
I want you to hear this
for real this time.

466
00:24:31,224 --> 00:24:33,154
I love you, Gideon.

467
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:38,674
- Stay with me.
- What?

468
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:42,745
The truth is being a computer
makes me a better captain,

469
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:46,048
but being with you

470
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:49,241
makes me a better person.

471
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,595
So everyone says

472
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,431
long-distance relationships suck.

473
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:02,999
Are you breaking up with me?

474
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,835
I mean, we've only been
together for like two days.

475
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:08,504
Time is so weird.

476
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:13,114
That's too bad 'cause I
already planned our first date.

477
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,877
What was it?

478
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:17,913
I guess you'll have
to show up to find out.

479
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:20,038
Fine. I'll come.

480
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:25,640
Wait, did I just get hustled?

481
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:37,433
Hey, you must be excited
to have your own bathroom

482
00:25:37,457 --> 00:25:40,069
after sharing one for three years.

483
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:42,671
Three years, wow.

484
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:45,664
I guess I thought there'd be more time.

485
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,710
More time for...

486
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:52,467
- more time for what?
- To be a hero, I guess.

487
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:00,189
It's hard...

488
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:03,415
living in other Zari's shadow.

489
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:08,187
I mean, she changed the world.

490
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:12,591
She... she mattered.

491
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:15,738
Come on. You matter.

492
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:17,273
You matter a lot.

493
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:19,942
Yeah, maybe to trend watchers

494
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:22,778
waiting to hear about
this year's hot nail trend

495
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:26,048
or whatever audible lipstick is.

496
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:29,418
Yes, you are a fashion icon, all right?

497
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:32,688
But you're also a champion
of doing the right thing.

498
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:36,091
Do you remember Eddie?
You saved his bar.

499
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:39,194
I was just being helpful, not heroic.

500
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:42,598
My father, he was very big on legacy,

501
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:43,999
and so was I for a while,

502
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:47,770
but after years
of hero-ing through time,

503
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:51,407
do you know how I'm
going to be remembered?

504
00:26:51,431 --> 00:26:54,777
For writing a book about other people.

505
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:56,645
My legacy, however,

506
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,272
my legacy is the life
I get to make with Zari.

507
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:05,611
You make a difference, but
you make it your own way.

508
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:10,326
I guess I just wish
I knew what that was.

509
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,679
Thanks.

510
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,630
You nervous about seeing Alun?

511
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:28,033
I won't have Alun.

512
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,765
What?

513
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,517
Oh, I am returning
to the Welsh countryside alone,

514
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,853
albeit for some very majestical sheep.

515
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,621
No, no, no, no, that's...
what are you...

516
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:41,457
we have to talk to Gideon.
That wasn't the plan.

517
00:27:41,481 --> 00:27:43,225
Ava Sharpe, you and I both well know

518
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:46,395
that this is what history requires.

519
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:50,699
Now, Alun and I,
we will see each other again,

520
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:54,122
if not in this life, in the next one.

521
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:58,540
Gwyn, I really don't understand.

522
00:27:58,564 --> 00:28:01,300
It was something he always
used to say to me in parting.

523
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:06,348
"In the river, I have seen you

524
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:10,175
through love, age, and misery".

525
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:15,758
"In the river, I will find you,

526
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:19,495
for you will always be you,

527
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,916
and I will always be me...

528
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:28,370
"I will find you,
for you will always be you,

529
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:31,140
and I will always be me".

530
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:33,632
That's beautiful.

531
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,980
Yes. Yes, it is.

532
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,738
Gwyn.

533
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:50,259
Hey, Z, can you help me with something?

534
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:52,294
A little surprise I have for the team.

535
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:54,296
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks. Let's go talk

536
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,722
some place private.

537
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:03,105
I can't believe Gwyn's going home alone.

538
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:04,840
After everything he's done for us,

539
00:29:04,864 --> 00:29:08,811
why should he have to live out
his entire life in misery?

540
00:29:08,835 --> 00:29:10,446
- Aves?
- What?

541
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,849
- I can help.
- Z, it's not that...

542
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:16,875
- Let me.
- Okay.

543
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,122
The Legends are up to something,

544
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:22,791
and I have to stop them.
Ready the jumpship and, Gideon,

545
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:24,560
no killing the Legends while I'm gone.

546
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,695
- Is that an...
- Ah!

547
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,520
It's an order.

548
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,676
Okay, all we have to do now
is charge the courier,

549
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,645
jump to 1916, and
find a way to save Alun

550
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:39,547
while still breaking Gwyn's heart.

551
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,415
- The dog tags.
- Hm?

552
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,918
We go in before the attack.
I make a dust storm.

553
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,420
You grab Alun, leave his dog tags.

554
00:29:46,444 --> 00:29:48,689
When Gwyn comes back,
he still thinks Alun's dead.

555
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:51,158
Brilliant. You're a fricking genius.

556
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:52,593
Okay, it's gonna be a tight squeeze,

557
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:54,395
but I made Gwyn a promise.

558
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,465
Aves, this one's mine.

559
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:00,801
It's my hero moment. Hair tie.

560
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:02,036
Are you sure?

561
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,872
Yeah, I'm gonna get dirty.
I'm gonna crawl.

562
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:06,565
- Okay.
- Okay.

563
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:13,353
Hair. Hair, blow dryer, bathroom.

564
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,358
You okay?

565
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:15,961
There's a blow dryer in the bathroom.

566
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,763
Yes, there's a blow dryer
in the bathroom.

567
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,484
It has a charger.

568
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,722
Who knew robots use hair dryers?

569
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,624
Did you see the lift
in Robo-Nate's hair?

570
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:25,926
- You can't 3D print that.
- Hey!

571
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,629
- Now we just wait.
- Great. How long?

572
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:29,597
Because Sarah has a very small bladder.

573
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,933
- It's ready.
- Oh.

574
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:34,902
We can never let Spoons know about this.

575
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:36,927
Obviously.

576
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:40,641
Oh, dear! Oh, my sincerest apologies.

577
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:42,877
I didn't realize that someone
was using the lavatory.

578
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:43,979
Gwyn, it's okay. It's okay.

579
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:46,382
- It's okay.
- Ohh...

580
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:51,011
- Gwyn, we're gonna save Alun.
- We made you a promise.

581
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,988
Well, I...

582
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:56,824
I am deeply, deeply moved that you would

583
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:59,827
all sacrifice your own
personal paradises

584
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:02,196
for me to have a chance to realize mine,

585
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,289
but I'm sorry. I must refuse.

586
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:11,172
- Why?
- The risk is too great.

587
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,240
Mametz Wood was a gruesome battle,

588
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,009
and I'm telling you now
it is too dangerous.

589
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,912
- Just wait, relax.
- You are my friends.

590
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,014
Gwyn, we just want you to be happy.

591
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:22,607
You deserve a chance at love. You...

592
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:27,355
You would... you would do that for me.

593
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:28,612
Yeah.

594
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:32,760
Well, all right then,
you've convinced me.

595
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:35,096
Yes! Let's go save...

596
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,182
Gwyn?

597
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,253
Alun?

598
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:43,656
Alun.

599
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,604
They all died, didn't they?

600
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:01,679
Yes.

601
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:08,095
And what about me?

602
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:12,524
Well in a way, yes.

603
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,192
You perished as well.

604
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:21,467
- But I survived.
- You're very much alive.

605
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,080
- How?
- Ah, yes.

606
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,715
Well, um, you see,

607
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,218
I invented a method

608
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:35,247
of time travel to save you.

609
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:38,082
To save me?

610
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,387
- Yes.
- Why?

611
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:51,372
I couldn't bear to live in a world

612
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:54,966
without you in it, Alun. I couldn't.

613
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:59,680
Anyway, it's a lot to take in, isn't it?

614
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:01,182
And I can imagine
how you must be feeling.

615
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:03,503
Now, I should probably
leave you in peace.

616
00:33:13,184 --> 00:33:16,364
I'm... I'm sorry.

617
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:18,099
That was...

618
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,035
that was foolish of me to think
that's what you wanted.

619
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,938
No, no, that's...

620
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,764
it's what I've always wanted, you know?

621
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:31,302
I just, um...

622
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:38,176
In the river, I will find you for...

623
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:45,249
For... for what?

624
00:33:48,753 --> 00:33:50,598
For you will always be you,

625
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:54,827
and... I will always be me.

626
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,636
Well, of course, I will.
Hm, who else would I be, eh?

627
00:34:05,704 --> 00:34:08,802
You odd, beautiful man.

628
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:12,853
I know. Uh, what time?

629
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:14,522
Wait, what time did you say again?

630
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,858
- What, you got plans?
- Sunday at 9:00, right?

631
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:20,461
Ooh, eesh, hate to be this guy,

632
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:23,230
but Zari and I have dinner

633
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:25,132
with Uncle Arjomand Sunday at 9:00.

634
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,767
Okay, here's a pitch.

635
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:30,304
What about Wednesdays at 8:00?
Midweek parties are the best.

636
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:32,773
What time zone?

637
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,942
Oh, that'd be 8:00 Eastern,
7:00 Central.

638
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:36,444
Only on the...

639
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:38,445
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I'll be there.

640
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,634
- Where are we going?
- Well, where we're going...

641
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:47,588
I'm going to miss you all so very much.

642
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:49,356
The ship's gonna be so quiet.

643
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,585
Hey, well, you always
got a team if you need us.

644
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,397
Oh, we're need to take group picture.

645
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,332
- Let's do it!
- Group photo.

646
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:01,702
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- See, technology is...

647
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,171
Alun, this is gonna blow your mind.

648
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:06,974
Pictures taken by things
they call digital...

649
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:08,542
Now you just stand here,

650
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,778
and it will take a picture
of us all now together.

651
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,699
Cheese.

652
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,477
Okay.

653
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,687
So tonight we dine in Paris.

654
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:43,217
I made us dinner.

655
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,487
- You mean I made dinner.
- Well, yeah.

656
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,357
Yeah, but I set up the twinklies.

657
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,877
Gary, it's wonderful.

658
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,365
Madam.

659
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:00,458
Oh, merci.

660
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,004
Oh, wow.

661
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,272
So, for our first course,

662
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,501
we'll be having creme de
la voilalle a la Berchoux.

663
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,948
- What is that?
- I don't know.

664
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,417
I asked Gideon to make
something fancy and French,

665
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,886
and voilà.

666
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,257
- Ooh, so talented.
- Why are you lying, Gideon?

667
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,026
You know what it is.

668
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,096
- You do?
- Well, yes.

669
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,965
Creme de la voilalle a la Berchoux

670
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,433
is a creamy chicken soup

671
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,235
with a lemon flavor
named for French poet

672
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,303
Joseph Berchoux, the man
responsible for inventing

673
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,272
the word gastronomy.

674
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,075
Huh. So then...

675
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,445
why'd you... why'd you lie?

676
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,814
Well, I just didn't want
to hurt your feelings, Gary,

677
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,983
- by making you feel dumb.
- Oh, no.

678
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,353
Never dim your light
to make me feel better.

679
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,044
Just don't lie.

680
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,826
- Alun is a robot.
- What?

681
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,095
I went back to 1916, harvested his DNA,

682
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,463
and printed a robot Alun.

683
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,498
Then I used Gwyn's diaries
from the historical records

684
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,251
- to recreate his personality.
- Why would you do that?

685
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,953
Look, I intended to save Alun,

686
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,689
but then I discovered that
Alun's death is a fixed point.

687
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:13,691
Ava and Zari were trying
to go back to save him.

688
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,227
They would've been killed.

689
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:16,661
It was the only thing I could do

690
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,916
to keep the Legends
and the timeline safe.

691
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:23,067
By lying to Gwyn? By lying to all of us?

692
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:26,137
They can't know. They're Legends.

693
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,640
They'd break time before
they break his heart.

694
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,165
Do you hate me?

695
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,412
What? No, no, of course not.

696
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:36,303
I just...

697
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:42,278
I, uh... I need some time to think.

698
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:45,089
To think about what?

699
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:47,325
Well, if these are the kinds

700
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,328
of decisions you have to make...

701
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,783
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

702
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,039
Why is love so complicated?

703
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,575
Because oxytocin, the hormone excreted

704
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,210
when you feel love for another person,

705
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,479
creates an unstable duality
in the human brain

706
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:09,814
of happiness and fear.

707
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,149
Right now, you are torn
between anger at Gideon

708
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:13,217
- for betraying you...
- Yes.

709
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,486
And the desire to apologize

710
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,087
since you don't want to lose her.

711
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,278
Right.

712
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,292
Humans think they
want to know everything,

713
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:23,561
but when they find out,
they're disappointed.

714
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:24,996
You made the right decision.

715
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,522
Well, I wish Gary saw it that way.

716
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,269
Oh, no. You're missing the point.

717
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:36,274
No, love is complicated
because people are complicated.

718
00:38:36,298 --> 00:38:38,576
Learning how to love another person

719
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,313
can be messy and painful,

720
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:44,248
but in the end, if you can make it work,

721
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:46,217
it's the most beautiful
thing in the world.

722
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,386
The timeline cannot
be ruled by emotions.

723
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,821
It must be protected
by clearheaded logic.

724
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,558
If you do love Gideon,
then for her sake,

725
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,650
I suggest you leave.

726
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:01,298
But I don't want to choose
between Gary and my job.

727
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:04,168
You're going to have to make
difficult decisions every day.

728
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,503
What if he leaves, huh?

729
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:08,024
Then you know the man he truly is.

730
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:14,802
I do love her...

731
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,039
Which is why I'm staying.

732
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:23,354
She needs someone to advocate
for all the things

733
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:25,289
that have nothing to do
with logic like tolerance,

734
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:28,382
like kindness, forgiveness, and love.

735
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:31,229
I wanna start the rest of my life

736
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:34,651
with that incredible woman,
and I wanna start it now!

737
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,306
Where is she?

738
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,510
- She's in the armory.
- The armory, okay.

739
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:47,868
Thank you.

740
00:39:48,904 --> 00:39:50,700
Gideon?

741
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,186
You and your obsession with love

742
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,921
pose too great a risk to the timeline.

743
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,375
- I... I'm not...
- Goodbye.

744
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:06,497
I'm sorry to inform you, Captain,

745
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,152
Mr. Green has left the Waverider.

746
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:19,176
It's for the best. A captain and an Ai.

747
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,765
The way it was meant to be.

748
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:35,560
What is that?

749
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,596
Well, that is my time machine.

750
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,825
Oh, Gwyn, it's a divine masterpiece.

751
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,940
You know, when I lost you...

752
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:51,609
I vowed to move heaven and Earth

753
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,634
until you were saved...

754
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:59,002
Which is why I have to do this.

755
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:09,746
I'm coming for you, my boy.

756
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,221
I'm coming.
