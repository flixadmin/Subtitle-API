1
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,185
Mother is better now, Mayor.

2
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:09,094
And thanks again. I know family
emergencies are never convenient.

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,932
But after some personal reflection,
I realized I have to be with her.

4
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,935
Everything I am started with her.

5
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,856
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes.

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,273
Good.

7
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,654
- You've changed your appearance.
- The suit is necessary.

8
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:31,282
The properties inside of it help me
continue my acclimation process

9
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,366
when I'm outside
the reflection modulation chamber.

10
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:38,039
Now... it's time to get rid
of my husband.

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:42,127
We begin by dismantling
everything that protects him.

12
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:47,382
- You know where to start.
- Success is assured.

13
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,674
Guys, shouldn't it be all hands on deck

14
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:14,033
with Iris, Kamilla and Singh
stuck in the Mirrorverse?

15
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,744
Hey, you're just as important.

16
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,329
Found this. Caitlin or Frost?

17
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,249
They're going to the Arctic,
not OzzFest.

18
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,876
How are you so bad at everything?

19
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,854
Caity keeps her heavy coats
in the back closet.

20
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,839
- I'll check on it.
- Right. That makes more sense.

21
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,883
You're so good at this kind of stuff.

22
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,051
- Still mad at me?
- Little bit.

23
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,845
Nash, Allegra will come
around eventually.

24
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,680
You just have to be there when she does.

25
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,056
Trust the process.

26
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,310
- Pretty wise for a Popsicle.
- Thanks.

27
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,270
Got a Dib-ploma to prove it.

28
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,063
Ba-dum-pum.

29
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,152
- Uh... Cool. Can I borrow this?
- Sure.

30
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:53,448
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- Me, too.

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,824
Hm?

32
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,580
I mean, all... We all are.

33
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,918
- Aw. There's hope for you yet.
- Enough. Okay.

34
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:07,795
Hey, you stay frosty.

35
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:18,723
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not, and, honey, it's okay.

36
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,810
I promise you, you can handle anything.

37
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,687
You just got to remember,
she's your mom, too.

38
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,897
Of course I am.

39
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,568
Hi, Killer Frost.

40
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,904
Uh...

41
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,739
It's just Frost now.

42
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:36,949
Hi.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,620
Okay, uh...
We're gonna leave you two alone.

44
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,250
Give us a call
when you get settled in the north.

45
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,338
Mm.

46
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,841
Give 'em hell.

47
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,639
So...

48
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,270
I think I should run a few tests
before we leave.

49
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,940
Check your baseline
for any ribonucleic anomalies.

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Great.

51
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,409
Eva's been missing for over 24 hours.

52
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:22,662
- Where are we with facial recognition?
- Satellites have turned up zilch.

53
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,171
The artificial Speed Force
isn't finished yet,

54
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,542
so I still can't do
my usual sweeps of the city.

55
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,004
- Right. Why are we meeting here?
- I have a backlog of cases.

56
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,048
I can't lose my CSI job
along with everything else.

57
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,176
A job.

58
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:42,765
Eva said that she had
unfinished business.

59
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,102
Is there any way
that she meant that literally?

60
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,064
If she wants to get McCulloch back,
she does have to deal with Black Hole.

61
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,651
- So, find Black Hole, find Eva.
- Mm-hm.

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,154
- Any idea where to start?
- Actually, no.

63
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,947
Maybe.

64
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,158
- Ralph?
- Ralph.

65
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,427
- Where did you get that?
- Where did you get that?

66
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,887
- Sue gave it to me.
- She gave you that?

67
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,711
- She gave that to you?
- She gave that to me.

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,542
And it turns out that Black Hole's logo
is embedded inside.

69
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,962
Dude, there is serious UV energy
coming off that thing. Can I?

70
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,305
Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,933
This is a Triangulation Cartograph.

72
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,727
It's a treasure map.

73
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,899
Allegra, aim it over this.

74
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,658
The center's at 42nd and Darby.

75
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,075
Hang on.

76
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,036
42nd and Darby.

77
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,413
- Holy heck.
- What?

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,041
Well, it turns out
that is a ginormous warehouse

79
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,669
with five subterranean levels.

80
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,730
Ralph and I will check it out.
You two, take comms.

81
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,384
Just... excuse me.

82
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,309
Could be a long night.

83
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,203
- I made us a couple of coffees.
- I hate coffee.

84
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,104
No coffee.

85
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,582
<i>- Guys, we're in.
- All right, be careful.</i>

86
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,000
<i>Place like that
could have a guard or two.</i>

87
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,109
More like five.

88
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,112
They were all stabbed.

89
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,155
By a mirror-bayonet, I'm guessing.

90
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,910
That is a lot of bad guy stuff.

91
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:27,988
It's Black Hole's depository.

92
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,589
Sue said that Carver
was blackmailing her parents.

93
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,427
This is bank statements,
investment records.

94
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,430
This must be everything
that Carver has on them.

95
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,808
- I'm taking this.
- All right.

96
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,061
Smells like gasoline in here.

97
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:00,153
- Singh?
- I don't want to hurt anyone else.

98
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,074
- Tell that to those guards you killed.
- They left me no choice.

99
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,702
I have to assure Eva's success.

100
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,122
Just put down the flare gun.
Help us bring Carver to justice.

101
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,209
Mother's not interested
in your brand of justice.

102
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,211
Singh. Singh!

103
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,963
- This isn't you.
- You still don't get it, do you?

104
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,719
<i>Carver was there that night.</i>

105
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,474
<i>He let the mirror keep her.</i>

106
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,726
He never tried to rescue her.

107
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,520
Instead, he sold her tech
to the highest bidder...

108
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,149
for weapons, blackmail or worse.

109
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:43,237
And that is why Carver... is a dead man.

110
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,666
It's not working.

111
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,131
Guys...

112
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,719
<i>Allen, Dibny, are you guys there?</i>

113
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:07,803
Barely.

114
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,558
- What do we do now?
- The only thing we can.

115
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,269
Protect Carver.

116
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,047
And our guy
knows to destroy anything

117
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,471
that could tie me to the warehouse?

118
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,033
Yes, but there's nothing
left to destroy.

119
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,827
Everything we had was incinerated.

120
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,538
Replace the items, quickly and quietly.

121
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,249
Don't use The Three.
They can't know they're off-leash.

122
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:38,613
If someone is coming after me,
I'll need their protection.

123
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,296
Hello, Officer Allen.

124
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,010
Please.

125
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,975
You're not here to slap me, are you?
Captain West went for the left side.

126
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,433
How is he, by the way?

127
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,354
Look, there's no easy way
to say this, so...

128
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,902
Your wife wants to kill you,
but C.C.P.D. can keep you safe.

129
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,904
My wife is dead.

130
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,867
Eva's been trapped in another dimension
for the last six years.

131
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,190
A place called the Mirrorverse.

132
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,288
But you already knew that.

133
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,711
If Eva did escape that wretched place,
I'd know.

134
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,714
This is about your wife, isn't it?

135
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,386
I came across this footage from
my wife's office a couple of weeks ago.

136
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,435
Ooh.

137
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,147
- You knew Iris was abducted?
- Your wife was a problem.

138
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,400
Her disappearance was fortuitous.

139
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,455
- What happened to my wife?
- The same thing that happened to my Eva.

140
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,908
- She's gone. They both are.
- No.

141
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,545
- There has to be a way to get her back.
- I used to think that, too.

142
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,831
But if Iris is still alive in there,

143
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,084
there's probably
nothing left of her to save.

144
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,463
I had the most brilliant minds
in the world study that...

145
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,507
Mirrorverse.

146
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:13,471
You know what they found?
It's incompatible with the human brain.

147
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:18,434
That place warps the mind until
the person is no longer recognizable.

148
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,980
Your Iris is long gone.

149
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:27,318
I suggest you accept that and move on.

150
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,490
Oh, one more thing.

151
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,493
How do you know Eva's coming after me?

152
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,787
Who else would've burnt down
your warehouse?

153
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:43,042
- 42nd and Darby, right?
- I'd never buy on that side of town.

154
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,170
And I don't need protecting.

155
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,174
Give Captain West my best.

156
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,857
Without the satellites,
finding Chief Singh feels impossible.

157
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,353
I know.

158
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,814
We'll have to go find him ourselves.

159
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:09,402
Every time I interact with this place,
the neural dissonance gets worse.

160
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,406
And what if Eva comes back?

161
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,615
Then what?

162
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,536
Look, things in this place
may be backwards,

163
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,998
but everything works.
We just have to figure out how.

164
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,633
Did you see the map of the city?

165
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,760
You just said looking at those
was too dangerous.

166
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:35,802
No, I didn't mean to.

167
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,514
But I was thinking about finding David,

168
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,558
and the map came into view.

169
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,978
There was thermal energy
coming from a specific place.

170
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,821
I'm not sure where,
but that has to be David.

171
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,442
There was like a radius,
almost like a beacon.

172
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,695
I feel like if I could just focus,
I can find his location.

173
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,196
No, Iris, come on. Look at you.

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,198
No, I'm acclimating
to this place, Kamilla,

175
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,367
that's why I can see the map,
and you can't.

176
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,203
I can find David.

177
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,252
- Mrs. Dearbon.
- Hi.

178
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:12,381
Mr. Dearbon, so great to see you again.
I have fantastic news.

179
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,633
- So, it turns out that...
- Oh.

180
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,513
So you are the person
my parents employed to find me.

181
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,224
It's so good to meet you.

182
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:29,023
And please forgive me.
I never meant to cause a stir.

183
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,441
I read <i>Eat Pray Love,</i>

184
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,027
and I took the "pray" part
just a little bit too seriously.

185
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,491
Our Susie joined
a mindfulness retreat in India.

186
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,534
I meant to stay for a month,

187
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,162
and then lost track
of the weeks, months...

188
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,374
Well, it happens, right?

189
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,960
Mr. Dibny, while we're delighted
to have our Susie back,

190
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,088
we realize how much trouble you went to.

191
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:54,924
Do you have a pen?

192
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,009
Uh...

193
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,930
Oh, heck, wouldn't you know.
I'm fresh out.

194
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,265
Let me just check that hallway closet.
Ms. Dearbon,

195
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,768
- could you help me look for a pen?
- Oh, of course.

196
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,561
We'll be right back.

197
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,188
Do you need a legal pad or anything?

198
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,150
Why would you call my parents?

199
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,586
So, that diamond that you gave me,

200
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,029
it turns out it has a map
for Black Hole's stash house.

201
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,114
I did some recon...

202
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,240
Oh!

203
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:22,701
I thought breaking and entering
was a line Elongated Man didn't cross.

204
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:23,785
Would you...

205
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,931
- Inside voices, please.
- I'm sorry.

206
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,457
Look, Carver had files with
your parents' names on them.

207
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,960
Those files contain the evidence
he was using to extort them.

208
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,463
- What do you mean, "had"?
- Well, things got toasty,

209
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,799
and Carver's blackmail arsenal
got cooked.

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,970
- You torched the place?
- No. I... No.

211
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,681
Okay. How do I say this?

212
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,226
There's a Mirrorverse dimension.
There's these pod people running around.

213
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,063
They're claiming innocent lives.
It's very <i>Invasion of the Body...</i>

214
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,250
You know what? Why don't
we just forget about that part?

215
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,151
The point is, your parents are safe.

216
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,485
Yeah. Already knew that.

217
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,279
You're welcome. It was really no...

218
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,448
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, Carver called last week.

219
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:02,217
Said he had a change of heart.

220
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,035
Guys like Carver
don't have hearts to change.

221
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,119
Agreed.

222
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,125
But my parents are safe,
and I can finally go home.

223
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,921
- I don't understand. If we agree...
- Enough, Slick.

224
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,257
You really wanna help me?

225
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,092
Leave us in peace.

226
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,193
Did he say who wants
his head on a pike now?

227
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:10,934
Who's there?

228
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,811
Hello, Kimiyo.

229
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,815
Shall we do this the easy way...
or the hard way?

230
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,375
Sunshine?

231
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,763
Hoshi?

232
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,019
Ultraviolet?

233
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,299
I'm glad Carver turned you down.

234
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,843
After what he did
to my cousin, Joe, Iris,

235
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:26,969
he deserves what he gets.

236
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,013
He doesn't deserve to die.

237
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,976
But what if he's telling the truth about
the Mirrorverse affecting minds?

238
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,269
Or he's lying.
He's not exactly the Paragon of Truth.

239
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,561
I don't think he's lying.

240
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,480
I think it could be neural dissonance.

241
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,692
I came across this Earth on my travels

242
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
where any visitor to that Earth

243
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,613
immediately suffers
a traumatic psychological state,

244
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,697
neural dissonance.

245
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
This could be that.

246
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,636
I'm glad someone believes me.

247
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,121
I need your help after all, Allen.

248
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:57,124
Federal protection.
The full Joe West treatment.

249
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,709
What happened to your killer minions?

250
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,815
- Eva got to them first, didn't she?
- You gonna help me or not?

251
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,136
Look, get me into protection,
and Joe can get out of it.

252
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,123
One call from me, and he's sleeping
in his own bed tonight.

253
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,558
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

254
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,852
That sounded like a "yes" to me.

255
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,941
Huh. That's interesting.

256
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,363
The stoichiometric ratio is manifesting
in a way that's abnormal.

257
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:33,786
It'd be so much easier
if Caitlin were here to help analyze.

258
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,453
I can help.

259
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:42,044
Oh, I'm sorry. I just meant that
I could use an expert in meta-DNA.

260
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,384
- I forgot.
- I figured.

261
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,763
Probably because every time
you look at me, you just see Thomas...

262
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,431
and the monster he became.

263
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,061
You're not a monster.

264
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,735
You protected Caitlin from her father

265
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,364
and then some, which is a hell
of a lot more than I ever did.

266
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,951
You know, to be honest,

267
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,454
I always kind of
felt like a third wheel.

268
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,041
I'm sorry you felt that way.

269
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,169
No. No.

270
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,005
That must have been horrible.

271
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:33,387
Then again, I've made
so many mistakes in my life.

272
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,682
Maybe I'm the one who needs fixing.

273
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,687
You're a brilliant scientist who runs
the most successful lab on the planet.

274
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,939
I don't think you need fixing.

275
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:48,360
'Cause from where I'm standing,
you're a pretty awesome human being.

276
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,363
One I'd like to get to know
a lot better.

277
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,076
I'd like that, too.

278
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,291
What is taking so long?

279
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,145
Federal agents
will be here any minute

280
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,969
to take you into custody.

281
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,841
Officer.

282
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,133
Mr. Carver.

283
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:16,680
When your paperwork came across my desk,
I thought a VIP such as yourself

284
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,764
shouldn't have to ride
in a two-bit government van.

285
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,478
So I'm here to escort you personally
into custody.

286
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,647
Allen. A word?

287
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,576
Let me walk out of here with Carver,
and Mother will give you Iris.

288
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,498
Eva is not interested in a fight
with you or with your friends.

289
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,084
You knew we were in that warehouse
when you set it on fire.

290
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,880
- That feels like a fight to me.
- Let me have him, Barry.

291
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,174
He's a bad man.

292
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,301
Bring Iris home.

293
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,346
Get your life back.

294
00:18:58,597 --> 00:18:59,807
Are we doing this, or what?

295
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,230
- On my six!
- What the hell?

296
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,781
Will someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

297
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,950
I saved you. That's what's going on.

298
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:19,451
- Nash.
- What?

299
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,376
The Barry Allen I know would never,
never have considered that deal.

300
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,191
I knew Eva was ambitious, but...

301
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,026
mirror duplicates?

302
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,778
Eva's more powerful than you thought.

303
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,903
I don't get it.

304
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,624
Why doesn't she just
come after you herself?

305
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,993
Well, Eva's still technically missing,
so she can't be seen in public.

306
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,202
That's why she took Singh.

307
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,663
The Chief of Police
could get close to you.

308
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,876
Fortunately, Mr. Wells
teleported us to safety.

309
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
You're welcome.

310
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,841
What is that device?
And how much do you want for it?

311
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,469
- It's not for sale, dirtbag.
- Oh, please.

312
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,804
Everyone has a price.

313
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,700
Hey, listen. We just saved your kiester,
so why don't you put a sock in it

314
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,444
until we can figure out
what to do with you.

315
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,772
So, guess we're stuck
with our new guest for a while.

316
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,941
It's only a matter of time
before Eva shows up here.

317
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,026
Right.

318
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:35,503
Any mirrored surface
inside S.T.A.R. Labs

319
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,838
is a door for her to walk through.

320
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,780
McCulloch's security system
can protect us.

321
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,116
I have a panic room
Eva doesn't know about.

322
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,368
No offense,
but extra guards and a lockdown

323
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,772
aren't going to help us out here.

324
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,415
I have a biogenic ionization field

325
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,709
that can be activated
around the entire facility.

326
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,879
Anything breaking in
would be atomized in a second.

327
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,131
We just have to get there.

328
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,469
We could take the sewage system,
pop out right underneath R&D.

329
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,764
I break into things.

330
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,474
Hmm.

331
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,142
No time like the present.

332
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,568
Allen.

333
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,198
I wanna ask you a question.

334
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,078
You knew that Carver
was in mortal danger, right,

335
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,538
soon as Mirror Singh
stepped off that elevator?

336
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,165
Why didn't you get him out of there?

337
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,701
I couldn't exactly run him out of there
as Barry Allen.

338
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,878
Or he offered you a deal.

339
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,298
That's the other thing.

340
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,051
I have all these Wellses in my head,
and they all...

341
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,445
They're all screaming the same thing,

342
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,930
that the Barry Allen they knew
would never have hesitated.

343
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,139
You did.

344
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,060
You were considering...

345
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,228
the deal.

346
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,315
You were considering trading
Carver's life to save Iris.

347
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,417
It's more complicated than that.

348
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,586
It's more complicated?
Is it complicated like in the way

349
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,737
you almost killed Eobard Thawne,
and me along with it?

350
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,006
- That was different.
- How is that different?

351
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,032
Iris is my wife. I have to save her.

352
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,618
How do you not understand that?

353
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:07,702
I do.

354
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,582
But what do you think Iris will say...

355
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,421
when you tell her you traded
another person's life to save hers?

356
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,382
A.R.G.U.S. will be here in an hour
to take you into custody.

357
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,361
Wait, this isn't safe.

358
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,530
Relax, after I saw what happened
to your wife,

359
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,240
I had it coated with protective nanites.

360
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,660
I thought Palmer Tech
and McCulloch were rivals.

361
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,873
Let's just say, what Palmer Tech
doesn't know won't hurt them.

362
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,086
And this is my panic room.

363
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:01,214
Concrete walls
and not a mirror in sight.

364
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,885
Even if my outer field fails,
Eva can't get in here.

365
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:11,058
Once the building's clear,
you can engage your ion field.

366
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,936
Then tell your people
to speed up the evacuation.

367
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,818
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

368
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,156
Allegra, here.

369
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,658
Take this, just in case.

370
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,912
All right? Any trouble, you should
blast it with one of your UV rays.

371
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,872
All right?
Provide a welcome distraction.

372
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,957
When are you gonna stop trying?

373
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,001
Never.

374
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,098
What the hell?

375
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,442
I knew you were lying.

376
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,736
You really can't take a hint.

377
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,530
You're not here to rob the place.

378
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,283
And Carver didn't have a change of heart
on your parents. You...

379
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,709
You offered to take their place
in Black Hole.

380
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,954
Carver agrees.

381
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,498
I'm more valuable than my parents.

382
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:19,876
Sue, you...

383
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,438
You don't have to do this.

384
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:26,049
Yes, I do. I have been trying to collect
leverage on Carver for over a year.

385
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,050
He's untouchable.

386
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:34,933
Untouchable unless you have one of those
handy-dandy Black Hole pins.

387
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,270
You joined Black Hole
to get close to Carver.

388
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,133
Because you're going to kill him.

389
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,984
That's why you're here, isn't it?

390
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,069
Carver's never going to
let my parents go.

391
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,654
Sue... damn it.

392
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:48,655
It's the only way it ends.

393
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,908
You gotta listen to me.
There is always another way.

394
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,703
Do you understand what happens
if you kill Carver?

395
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,097
Every time you look in the mirror,

396
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,248
you won't recognize
the person looking back.

397
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,083
- You'll lose yourself.
- Why do you care?

398
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,251
Because I believe in you.

399
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,088
And I know there's still good in you.

400
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,299
I can see it.

401
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,804
I'm sorry about this, Slick.

402
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,022
Oh, come on.

403
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,370
<i>All clear down here.
Ready for the force field when you are.</i>

404
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,579
The ion field's up and running.

405
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,582
Now all that's left to do
is sit and wait.

406
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,583
Cheers.

407
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,474
That's not good.

408
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,770
Guys, the force field
isn't working anymore.

409
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,147
Can we find out what happened
to the power source?

410
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,734
We know what happened.

411
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,894
Carver's Angels invited themselves
to the party.

412
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,969
Something Carver never did.

413
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,637
We're no longer under his thumb.

414
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,305
Neither is Eva.

415
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,557
Whatever she is paying you,
I will double it.

416
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,351
This isn't about a paycheck.

417
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,644
It's about payback.

418
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,900
Eva's coming for you, Carver.

419
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:52,237
And we're gonna make sure
no one gets in her way.

420
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,780
Nice family reunion.

421
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,180
Eva's going to be here any minute.
We have to get your ion field back up.

422
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,793
- Is there an alternate power source?
- The sub-basement.

423
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,099
There's remote access
to a secondary generator.

424
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,911
Guys, hold them off as long as you can,
I'm going to get the power back on.

425
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,396
You do that.
I know how to handle traitors.

426
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,199
Drop your weapons.

427
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,246
Singh.

428
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,168
You don't want to do this.
This isn't your will.

429
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,714
Eva's will is my will.

430
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,028
Success is assured.

431
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,111
I thought Sunshine was solar powered?

432
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,221
So how the frak is she
frying people at night?

433
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,390
Those bracelets aren't fashion,
they're fuel.

434
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,058
They're solar energy battery packs.

435
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,394
Well, how do we get them off?

436
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:49,995
Just got to increase the internal
temperature, overload the cells.

437
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,499
- Allegra, if you...
- Already on it.

438
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,000
- She's good.
- What are you gonna do?

439
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,584
I don't know. I'm making it up as I go.

440
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,608
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

441
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,239
Fine, do it.

442
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:43,134
You think you're the only one
that feels that way?

443
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,492
The only one that feels alone?

444
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,617
Well, get in line!

445
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:57,213
Okay, remember when I told you,
if things go sideways, zap the stone?

446
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,673
- Yeah.
- I'd zap the stone.

447
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:20,653
You came back.

448
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,514
Couldn't let you have all the fun.

449
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,822
Fun must mean something
entirely different when you're rich.

450
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:56,231
Honey, I'm home.

451
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,327
Guess somebody forgot
to spike the punch.

452
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,096
Let's talk about this.

453
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,267
About what?

454
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,979
How you weaponized my technology?

455
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,148
Extorted charitable donors?

456
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:43,236
Kidnapped and blackmailed
innocent meta-humans

457
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,030
like Kimiyo, Esperanza and Millie?

458
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,741
This is me talking.

459
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,410
I did what I had to do.

460
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,089
Then I'll do what I have to do.

461
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,593
Goodbye, Joseph.

462
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,346
No, Eva! Wait!

463
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:14,934
No!

464
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:18,646
What don't you understand?
He's not worth saving!

465
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:24,527
Maybe,
but it's not your decision.

466
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,573
Oh, yes, it is.

467
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,917
My husband...

468
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:45,173
let me rot in that world for years.

469
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:49,218
He does not get to live in this one.

470
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:54,891
You're not my wife.

471
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:00,980
My wife died
in the particle accelerator explosion.

472
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,818
Well...

473
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,657
I've never felt more alive.

474
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:16,204
You're not even... human.

475
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,878
No. Oh, no.

476
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:28,966
I'm sorry you had to see that.

477
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,555
God.

478
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,772
What are you doing here?

479
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,190
I'm making this up as I go.

480
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:45,857
Right.

481
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,609
Flash...

482
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:51,447
Barry, you and I are not enemies.

483
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,324
We never have been.

484
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,244
You just killed him in cold blood.

485
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,456
Your wife set out to catch a bad man.

486
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,959
She couldn't.

487
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,629
But together, we could.

488
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,298
- We're on the same side.
- No.

489
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:11,592
Just remember that.

490
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,845
All right, on three,
everybody go crazy.

491
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:14,929
Got it.

492
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,306
That seems like bad advice.

493
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,350
Song title. No, I like it.
It'll be good. All right.

494
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,186
One, two...

495
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:23,813
<i>Stand down.</i>

496
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:25,857
<i>Joseph is dead.</i>

497
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,653
Well, I didn't see that coming.

498
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,321
You're going to let us go?

499
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,823
Of course.

500
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,326
I've achieved my goal for today.

501
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,621
We'll never stop coming after you.

502
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,042
You'll fail.

503
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:49,756
This building, this company...

504
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,092
is all mine.

505
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,555
And you and your little friends
are trespassing, so...

506
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,391
run along, little Barry.

507
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,352
Before I have to call the police.

508
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:16,157
Mrs. McCulloch,
where have you been all this time?

509
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,661
Well, over the past six years,

510
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:25,374
I have been held hostage
by an international crime syndicate.

511
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,044
Forced to watch

512
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:31,923
as they stole my technology
and used it to create deadly weapons.

513
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,050
How did you escape?

514
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,971
My husband, Joseph...

515
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,308
he worked tirelessly to try to find me.

516
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,228
And he succeeded.

517
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,733
Only to be murdered
moments after we were reunited.

518
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,905
Words cannot express my sorrow.

519
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,035
But know that I am working
with the C.C.P.D.

520
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,870
to try to find my husband's murderer.

521
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:08,417
And as for McCulloch Technologies,
I will be resuming my position as CEO,

522
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,461
effective immediately.

523
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,840
It's what Joseph would've wanted.

524
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,884
Thank you.

525
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,891
Going somewhere?

526
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,349
Carver's dead.

527
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:28,521
Which means my parents are finally free.

528
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,147
So am I.

529
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,608
I'm going home.

530
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,532
Sue, I'm not sure you can.

531
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:45,580
Eva framed you.

532
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,379
For Carver's murder.

533
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,319
Barry, we've been through
stuff like this before, don't worry.

534
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,985
You're going to find a way
to stop Eva and get Iris back.

535
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,779
I can't even be frustrated without...

536
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,241
losing more of it.

537
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,789
Maybe instead of focusing
on what you've lost,

538
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,292
you should try remembering
what you'll never lose.

539
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:36,672
The reason you beat
Zoom, Godspeed, Thawne...

540
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,175
is because speed isn't what drives you.

541
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:40,926
It's love.

542
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,721
That's your true force.

543
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,683
And there is nothing artificial
about that.

544
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,853
So as long as you stay true to yourself,

545
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,189
you will always find a way
to beat the bad guys.

546
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:55,900
And gals.

547
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,195
I'm going to miss you.

548
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,906
I'll be back before you know it.

549
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,453
All set? The car's downstairs.

550
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:12,875
I promise I'll get these two back to you
and your team as soon as possible.

551
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:15,335
Thanks.

552
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,712
Yeah, okay.

553
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:18,755
Hey...

554
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,927
Frost can hear me too, right?

555
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:24,804
As long as she's awake.

556
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,097
<i>I'm awake, really.</i>

557
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,639
Go ahead.

558
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,058
Just...

559
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:31,352
Get better.

560
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,205
And hurry back. We still have
a white water rafting trip to take.

561
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:37,387
<i>I'm holding you to that.</i>

562
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,276
She says she can't wait.

563
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,459
Tell the team I miss 'em already.

564
00:38:57,962 --> 00:38:59,130
I will.

565
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,372
Well, well.

566
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,791
This is a little quieter.

567
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:36,875
Yeah.

568
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:38,627
Hey, look, I know that...

569
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,256
I'm not your favorite person, but...

570
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,009
if ever you need anything,

571
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,470
if ever you need my coffee...

572
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,430
What happened to "I don't like coffee"?

573
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,724
Uh...

574
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,309
Okay.

575
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:57,063
- Thanks.
- For what?

576
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,315
For this.

577
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:02,984
Of course.

578
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,988
What did it do to her? My cousin?

579
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:09,617
It made her relive her worst memory.

580
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,078
You know what?

581
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:15,872
You hang on to it.

582
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,114
Just in case you need it again.

583
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:20,628
Hey, guys.

584
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:22,546
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

585
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,548
- Yeah.
- Iris and the others,

586
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,925
they're still Eva's prisoners.

587
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,168
We're going to get them back.

588
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,833
And remember, we still have one thing
that Eva doesn't...

589
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,513
hope.

590
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:33,766
We also have reinforcements.

591
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,147
- Oh.
- Joe.

592
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:46,946
How are you here?

593
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,658
Well, it turns out that
when the guy that's trying to kill you

594
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,701
kicks the bucket,
they lift the protection detail.

595
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,286
- That makes sense.
- Nash.

596
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,122
Hey, man. Yeah.

597
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,416
- Hey.
- You're just in time.

598
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,877
Team needs you now more than ever.

599
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,880
Well, let's go save some people we love.

600
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,266
You have been at this for hours.

601
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,017
Barry wouldn't give up.

602
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:18,984
And the woman
that he married wouldn't either.

603
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,199
I found him.

604
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,285
David's at Central City Hospital.

605
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,288
I can't believe I just did that.

606
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:39,373
Holy frak!
Iris, you can control this place.

607
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
Iris.

608
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,256
Iris, stay with me.

609
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,677
Iris!

610
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:59,701
