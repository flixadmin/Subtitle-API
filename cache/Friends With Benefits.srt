Okay. Let's see where we are.

00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:22,815
We could move this,
get rid of that, kill that.

4

That kind of freaks me out.
Don't need her. We can get rid of that.

That's done. Okay,
we could start with this.

- Perfect.

ALL: Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. She does, right?

No! Not even close.

So am I. So many people.
What are you wearing?

28

I'm wearing the only
clothes outside the theater,

29
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,294
because I'm the only
person outside the theater!

I love that outfit.
You look so sexy in that.

You know that I love this movie.

If a prostitute and a ruthless
businessman can fall in love,

Well, apparently it doesn't.

- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay. I got us sandwiches.

I got you turkey, no cheese,
gluten-free bread.

43
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,490
You sure this was prepared
in a nut-free facility?

44

Yes, I'm fully aware
of your allergies.

Hey, I'm here! I'm here.
I'm really sorry.

Hey, I'm here! I'm here.
I'm really sorry.

Okay. Only one song.
That's not so bad, right?

49

It was fucking

Here's an idea: next time,
instead of being late, just shit on my face.

52
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,721
'Cause that's kind of the same thing as missing
<i>Your Body Is a Wonderland.</i>

53
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:17,972
Okay, come on.
We really gotta go in.

chill for a while, you know?

- You're doing this?
- You're breaking up with me?

60

You said I was your soul mate.

61
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,740
I did? When?

62
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,284
When we were at that
bed and breakfast having sex.

63

- But, you know, that doesn't...

Count.

65
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,205
I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.

66
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,624
Maybe you should care
a little bit less about work

67
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,918
and a little more about
the girl that you're dating.

68

'Cause last time I checked,
work doesn't reassure you

that liking a finger up your ass
doesn't make you gay.

70

I never said "go up." Okay?

71
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:00,431
I just said lightly around...
It's like a little button.

You know what?
Not your issue anymore.

73
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,684
Is this why you were late?

74
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,269
You were worried about
how to break up with me?

75

Oh, no, no. I was trying
to decide what to wear.

76
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,066
- So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,901
What, are you gonna
take the SATs after this?

78

Don't lash out, okay?

- I'm really not.

And just know that I am not at
all crushed by this breakup.

87
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,256
So, be honest. Why?

88
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,633
- Wait, is this a trick?
- No.

89
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,593
Just pure anthropological research.

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,678
Okay. You want someone to
sweep you off your feet,

91
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,556
but you're more interested in
getting swept off your feet

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,849
than the someone who's
doing the sweeping.

93
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,143
You seem like you've
got it totally together,

94
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,104
but you're actually
really emotionally damaged.

95
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,649
Also, you have, like, really big eyes,
and that freaks me out sometimes...

Of course it's me! You can't say that.
You're breaking up with me!

It's not. It's me.
I don't like you anymore.

You're a great guy.

102

A little too emotionally unavailable,
if you ask me.

103
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,875
I didn't.

104

No. It's the East River.

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,115
- It's actually making me dizzy.
- Hold on.

620
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,659
There we go.

621
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,457
No relationship.

622
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,000
No emotions.

623
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,752
Just sex.

624
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,463
Whatever happens, we stay friends.

625
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:16,756
- Swear.
- Swear.

626
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,924
BOTH: Swear.

627
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,304
Okay.

628
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,311
So I guess we should just start.

629
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:32,813
Okay.

630
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,982
I'll serve.

631
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,401
That's really...
That's enough of the tennis.

632
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,569
Let's go to the bedroom.

633
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,655
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

634
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,114
The bedroom has better light.

635
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,909
And since we're just friends,
I don't have to be insecure about my body.

636
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,994
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.

637
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,163
You have nothing to be insecure about.

638
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,209
No, you see,
that is way too emotionally supportive

639
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,294
and you need to just lock that down.

640
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,632
- Your ass is a little bony.
- Much better.

641
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,677
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

642
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,805
and had I known this was gonna happen,
I would have shaved my legs this morning.

643
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,432
My chin is ticklish,
I sneeze sometimes after I come,

644
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,976
and if I'd have known this was gonna happen,

645
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,268
I wouldn't have shaved my legs this morning.

646
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,520
Okie-dokie.

647
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,647
Oh!

648
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,149
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.

649
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,151
Great, 'cause feet gross me out.
Daddy issues.

650
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,569
Great.

651
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:25,992
I can work with that.

652
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,912
Should be fine.

653
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,250
I can't believe I'm doing this.

654
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,293
Should we stop?
We could just go for a run.

655
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,920
I don't know,
are we getting too old for this?

656
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,589
- Sex?
- No, casual sex.

657
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,426
It just, I don't know,
feels a little collegey.

658
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,553
- I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
- Okay.

659

660

- I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

661
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,601
Nope.

664
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,859
- I totally agree.
- Okay.

665
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,152
- Great.
- Great.

666
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,445
Little faster.

667
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,572
- More circular.
- Watch my chin.

668
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,073
- Touch my ears.
- Okay.

669
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,951
Kiss my neck.

670
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,620
- Say my name.
- Dylan Francis Harper Jr.

671
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,747
Not my full name.

672
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,081
Sorry, I had to fill out
a lot of your paperwork.

673
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,249
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

674
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,251
Oh, my God, you're really...

676
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,053
- Dylan, I...
- Relax.

677
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,305
Just a friend going down on another friend.

678

Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.

00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,437
What, what?

680
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,689
What are you trying to do?
Dig your way to China?

681
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,149
- I'm good at this.
- Says who?

682
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,609
Every girl I've been with.

683
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,111
Well, they're either lying or their
vaginas are made out of burlap.

684
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,113
So, relax. You're not a lizard.

685
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,948
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

- No, no, no, no!

707
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,866
It's too easy, too predictable.
Go with Shaun.

708
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:16,871
He's stylish, transcendent of sport,
has an ass like a kumquat.

709
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,874
- I hear he's kind of a jerk.
- No, he's not.

710

You're just threatened by him

711
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,627
because he's the greatest
snow sport athlete in the universe

712
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,671
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.

Hey, Dylan?
Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.

Okay, thanks.

00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,510
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?

716
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,180
Nobody wants to
fuck Obama, brah.

717
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,598
He's got ears like an elephant.

718
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,892
That's not the part of an elephant you want.

720
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,277

No, no, no, it's fine.

722
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,405
So...

723
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,242
- Wanna take a walk?
- Love to.

724
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,620
Great. Okay.

725
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,752
Okay, so about what happened, I...

726
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,671
- It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
- Exactly. No, no, exactly.

727
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,006
I mean, it is so not me.

728
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,091
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.

729
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,762
Great. I mean, look,
I've had one-night stands.

730
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,098
We both have had one-night stands,
none of which we're proud of, but...

731
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,100
Really?

732
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,145
Look, to think that you and I could just have sex

733
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,439
and without it compromising anything was just so...

734
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,900
- Misguided.
- Exactly.

735
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,485
I was gonna call you this morning.

736
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,778
But you didn't.

737
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:31,946
But I didn't.

738
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,281
And you see, it's already
coming between us and I really...

739
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,699
I just don't want it to.

740
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,825
It's not going to.

741
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,828
Look, I know that I act all tough
and I talk all tough, but really...

742
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,748
It's just a front to protect yourself
from your own vulnerability.

743
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,292
What are you, my fucking therapist now?

744
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:50,089
No, I'm a friend.
Who knows that every time you curse, you blink.

745
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,634

- It does not.

746
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,802
- Fuck you.
- Blinked.

747
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,637
- No, I didn't fucking blink.
- Blinked again.

748
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,430
- Shit.
- Ah, didn't blink.

749
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,099
"Shit" you're okay with.

750
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,184
- It was stupid.
- Yes.

751
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,602
We're friends, let's stay friends.

752
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,187
Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.

753
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,438
Me neither.

754
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,648
- Great.
- Fantastic.

755
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,608
Portrait for the lovely couple?

756
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,785
- What the hell are we doing?
- I don't know.

757
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,331
- Rub my hair.
- Kiss my neck.

758
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,126
(GIGGLING)

759
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,502
- Watch my nipple.
- All right, all right.

760
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,006
- I didn't know you had a tattoo.
- Yeah.

761
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,465
Why didn't I notice that before?

762
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,050
Because we were drunk.

763
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,136
- Was it your dog?
- No. Never had one.

764
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,387
But everyone else did.

765
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,180
And I thought having a dog
meant you had a normal family,

766
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,974
which at 17 I desperately wanted.

767
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,976
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo

768
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,644
of the most conventional thing you could think of.

769
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,354
It was super awesome back then.

770
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,647
- Check it.
- Okay.

771
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,107
- A lightning bolt?
- Eighteen.

772
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,400
- Wanted superpowers.
- Yeah.

773
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,236
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.

774
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,947
- Were you also gay back then?
- Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!

775
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,824
- Okay.
- Are you sure about this?

776
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,950
- Are you?

00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,285
You know what I discovered?

931
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,037
It's not who you want to
spend Friday night with,

932
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,582
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

933
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:04,750
Feel me, Felix?

934
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:08,170
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

935
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,088
It's okay, you don't get it.

936
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,841
It's no big deal. But you will.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

937
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:17,095
One day, you'll meet someone
and it'll literally take your breath away.

938
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:21,349
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

939
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,852
- Like a fish...
- Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

940
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,437
Yeah, you don't.

941
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,356
Nice work on that new online site, by the way.

942
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
What was the font on that headline?

943
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,693
It was Times Roman.

944
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,112
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

945
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,703
You have a boat?

946
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,165
I live in Jersey. And I ain't taking no ferry.

947
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,460
Unless it's out to dinner and a show. Bam!

948
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,018
- Hey.
- Yeah.

949
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,440
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

950
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:12,192
Kudos, baby, kudos.

951
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,360
(LAUGHS)

952
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,028
It's not that big of a deal.

953
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,655
It's just surprising.

954
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,366
I always thought you were
a true-love kind of girl.

955
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,536
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

956
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,538
That's what I thought back in '78.

957
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,665
And every year since.

958
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,251
I'm just...
I'm flattered, actually.

959
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,878
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

960
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,005
It's just surprising.

961
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,218
- There, done. It's... There we go.
- Okay.

962
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:42,848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

963
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:44,724
- Yeah!
- Really?

964
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,226
-  Yeah.
- Okay.

965
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:50,188
Hey, my friend gave me his
house in Montauk for July 4th.

966
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,149
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

967
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:56,736
- Just mother-daughter. Like a Nora Ephron movie.
- (SCOFFS)

968
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:59,406
When was the last time we spent
a full weekend together?

969
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:02,576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

970
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,785
- Demitri.
- Bill.

971
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,245
He reminded me a lot of your father.

972
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,915
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.

973
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,876
- My father was Russian?
- I don't remember.

974
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,087
But what I do remember is we drank a
lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

975
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,757
Mom, this "who's your daddy"
game is getting really old.

976
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,594
I know I haven't been the
best mother in the world...

977
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:25,056
I'm sorry,
were you waiting for me to jump in?

978
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,393
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!

979
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,062
- Come on. Come on.
- (LAUGHING)

980
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,316
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?

981
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:36,943
(SIGHS)

982
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,864
(GASPS)

983
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
- Mom...
- I was trying to bond!

984
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
- It was either this or sniff glue.
- (LAUGHS)

985
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,251
- Sorry about my mom.
- I thought she was funny.

986
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:56,129
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

987
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,798
and she's hilarious when
she needs a place to stay.

988
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.

989
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen, I think we should stop this.

990
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,440
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

991
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,192
I kind of think you're right.

992
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,318
Right?

993
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:24,032
<i>♪ Every new beginning comes
from some other beginning's end ♪</i>

994
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,909
That actually makes sense right here.

995
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,953
Who would've thought
Third Eye Blind could be so prophetic?

996
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,162
Not Third Eye Blind.

997
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,997
I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.

998
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,290
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

999
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,500
- Yes.
- Okay.

1000
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,293
- You're buying.
- What?

1001
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,630
Okay.

1002
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,632
Oh.

1003
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
- Pants.
- Shirt.

1004
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,843
So this is the end of this?

1005
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
- I guess so. But it's good.
- Yeah.

1006
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
- And we did it.
- With no bullshit.

1007
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,556
- Shirt.
- Sweater.

1008
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,309
We managed to actually stay friends.

1009
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:52,811
- Yup.
- Yeah.

1010
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,025
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?

1011
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,194
No, I don't have a type.

1012
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,571
- It's more about what's inside.
- Oh, please!

1013
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,407
Okay, what about her?

1014
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:08,034
DYLAN:
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.

1015
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,202
And she's reading a book.

1016
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:10,661
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

1017
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:11,329
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

1018
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,665
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- What?

1019
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
What do you mean, "What"?
We said we wanted to date again.

1020
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,711
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Now?

1021
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,337
Here, in front of all of these people?

1022
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,716
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

1023
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,389
Excuse me. I'm Dylan.
Nice to meet you.

1024
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,016
Oh, <i>The Notebook.</i>

1025
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,059
(INAUDIBLE)

1026
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,565
DYLAN:
Nice meeting you.

1027
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,821
- Well?
- We talked. We laughed.

1028
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,031
Yeah.

1029
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,408
- She's Belgian.
- Explains the reading.

1030
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:50,160
I showed her where the balcony was,

1031
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,912
because that's where she is
meeting up with her husband.

1032
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,581
Oh!
(LAUGHING)

1033
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,082
DYLAN:
Anniversary trip to New York.

1034
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,377
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

1035
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,546
Shut up.

1036
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:05,425
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

1037
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,261
Fine. I'll go next.

1038
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,930
- See if I still have game.
- Okay.

1039
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,432
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

1040
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,017
- Yes.
- Right here. Eleven o'clock.

1041
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,853
- Iced coffee.
- Handsome, but doesn't know it.

1042
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,440
Staring at a tree, which means he's
actually in the park for nature

1043
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,108
and not to watch women sunbathe.

1044
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,860
- Or he's retarded.
- Don't care.

1045
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,070
I'm going in.

1046
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,031
(SCATTING)

1047
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,369
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1048
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,954
- Hi.
- Hello.

1049
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,748
I'm Jamie.

1050
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,626
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

1051
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,629
Oh, hi.

1052
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,132
Okay.

1053
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,383
- Nice to meet you.
- (MOUTHING) Oh, my God!

1054
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,928
(SCATTING)

1055
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,893
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

1056
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:57,977
(SCATTING)

1057
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,813
And I have a date this Saturday.

1058
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:00,980
(SCATTING A FAN FARE)

1059
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,315
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1060
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,943
Why'd you wave to me?

1061
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,404
I told him you were my gay best friend,

1062
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,240
so he wants to set you up with his brother.

1063
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,158
(SCATTING MOCKINGLY)

1064
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,788
PARKER:
College, med school, and I haven't slept since.

1065
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,207
JAMIE:
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.

1066
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,543
Well, me and God.

1067
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,837
- What?
- I'm kidding.

1068
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,673
- Can you imagine someone who would actually say that?
- (EXHALING DEEPLY)

1069
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,842
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

1070
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,677
- Cancer doctors?
- No, assholes.

1071
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,387
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

1072
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:33,680
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.

1073
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:38,351
Although, I gotta warn you,
lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.

1074
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,477
- Really?
- Yeah.

1075
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,480
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.

1076
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,400
While they're doing this, a little bit of that.

1077
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,027
Hey.

1078
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,237
(JAMIE LAUGHING)

1079
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,697
Thank you.

1080
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,574
When can I see you again?

1081
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:57,704
Right now.

1082
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:58,913
Ah.

1083
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
- I'm just kidding.
- Okay.

1084
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,375
Can you imagine someone

Go have fun with your mom.

1240
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:04,839
- Okay.
- Oh. Almost forgot. I got you something.

1241
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,141
It's Lieutenant Kali,
the street artist we talked about.

1242
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:17,810
I got him to do something for you.
"F-tale." Fairytale.

1243
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,647
- I know you're into that girly shit, so...
- This is so cool.

1244
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,734
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.

1245
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,819
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah. Thank you.

1246

Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.

1247

I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

No problem.

They're disgusting.

What are you doing?

1251
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,792
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

1252
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,211
You're an animal. Stop doing that.

Come on.

00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:56,891
Ma?

1257
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:14,825
Ouch.

1258
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,411
Why did I think that this
time would be any different?

1259

1260

It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

1261
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,793
You're very sweet for asking, but it's fine.

You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

1263
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,880
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

1264
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,716
I'm actually asking you to come
because it would help me.

for my family.</i>

1266

drilling me for being single.

1267
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:36,389
Won't they think that we're together?

1268
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,557
- Not if I tell them we're not.
- And they'll believe you?

1269
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

1270
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,520

but I'm just gonna stay here.

Go to the gym.

1275

I just got you a ticket with my miles,
it's done. Meet me at JFK.

- But...
- No buts.

Oh, please.
It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.

- We're just friends.
- Oh, no, I know.

If you were his girlfriend,
he never would've brought you here.

me of a girl I used to know.

He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

He had a rough childhood.

I don't understand.

1538
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,468
She divorced you, Dad.

1539

Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

1552

I'm a little over 6 foot.

Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

Ninety-two feet.

- Yeah.

01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,503
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

He's the smartest man I've ever known.

He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

He's my dad.

Dylan, he's still the same man.

When I see the way people look at him now...

1587

It doesn't matter how people look at him.

All that matters is how you look at him.

Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

- So what?
- It's embarrassing.

1591

He needs to know that nothing has changed.

I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

1843
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:59,400
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

1844
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,068
and this gets way more Christian.

1845
01:28:01,152 --> 01:28:02,194
Mmm-hmm.

- What?

1867
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,038
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

1868
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:55,915
Oh, right.

1869

If I did leave,

1870
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,169

all I did was take one meeting,

Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1873
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,092
Why didn't you tell me you were looking?

1874
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:08,219
That's personal.

1875
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:09,720
And we're not friends anymore.

1876
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:10,971
You made that pretty clear.

1877
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:15,809
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

Open up to you like I've
never done with anyone ever.

1880

Why don't you pick him up?

1887
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,834
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,759
I'll tell you something that I
wish I knew when I was your age.

1999
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,761
And I know you've heard a
million times, "life is short."

2000
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:28,432
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

2001
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:31,643
is that life is goddamn short and
you can't waste a minute of it.

2002
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:36,106
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2003
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:44,448
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

2004
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:45,782
Yeah, what's going on with her?

2005
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,451
I think I messed it up.

2006
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:49,286
- Fix it.
- She won't talk to me.

2007
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,747
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

2008
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:54,124
If you think there's even a chance

2009
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:56,501
that she could be it, you fix it.

2010
01:35:58,879 --> 01:36:00,297
Did Annie put you up to this?

2011
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:01,632
Who's Annie?

2012
01:36:02,341 --> 01:36:03,508
I'm kidding.

2013
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:04,635
What, I can't joke about this?

2014
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:05,802
(LAUGHING)

2015
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:07,179
Jesus Christ, Dad.

2016
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:08,513
I don't know what else to do.

2017
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:11,475
Let's go.

2018
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,644
You don't want to finish your steak?

2019
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,312
We're eating in the goddamn airport.

2020
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:16,855
I can leave the steak. Come on.

2021
01:36:17,356 --> 01:36:19,232
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from <i>GQ.</i>

2022
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:21,026
We met a few weeks ago at the...

2023
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,987
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?

2024
01:36:24,196 --> 01:36:25,405
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.

2025
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:26,615
It's my fault.

2026
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,325
- You just scared me.
- No, no. My fault. You all right?

2027
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:29,868
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Here, let me help you with that.

2028
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,161
Thanks, man. You're really nice.

2029
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:32,579
All right. Hey, safe travels.

2030
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:33,914
- All right, thanks, man.
- Okay, thank you.

2031
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,040
Oh.

2032
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:36,833
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2033
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,752
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

2034
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:40,128
What's your problem with me?

2035
01:36:40,212 --> 01:36:41,755
I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

2036
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:44,341
How could such an awesome
girl be with this

2037
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:45,842
over this?

2038
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:49,012
I've been trying to take that little
monkey to pound-town for years.

2039
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:51,348
- I'll tell her you say hello.
- What?

2040
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,600
You missed a little.
There you go.

2041
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:55,352
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

2042
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,853
I ever run into you again,

2043
01:36:56,937 --> 01:36:59,356
I'll crush your earlobes and
make soup stock out of them.

2044
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:01,525
- You have a vivid imagination.
- I do!

2045
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:02,693
I'm gonna get in the cab now.

2046
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:03,944
I'm gonna go make soup!

2047
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,904
- What's the matter with her?
- I don't know.

2048
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:13,370
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

2049
01:37:13,537 --> 01:37:14,788
Is there another way into the city?

2050
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:27,300
DYLAN:
I owe you big time, Tommy.

2051
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:31,763
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

2052
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:36,560
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

2053
01:37:36,727 --> 01:37:37,769
You okay, Dad?

2054
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,979
Are you kidding?

2055
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,357
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

2056
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:43,567
Nice.

2057
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:47,988
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at...

2058
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,158
Right. Can I ask you a huge favor?

2059
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,998
My number. Here's the remote.

2060
01:37:58,248 --> 01:37:59,750
My friend Dave from across the hall,

2061
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,418
his oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

2062
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:04,504
Your friend Dave is here using
the kitchen or watching me?

2063
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:06,423
Go.

2064
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:08,300
- Holy...
- What?

2065
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,260
"How to wear white
pants to a cookout."

2066
01:38:10,427 --> 01:38:13,513
Did you scoop the <i>Times</i> on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

2067
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,307
All right, all right.

2068
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:16,850
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

2069
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:19,269
See you, Dad.

2070
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:21,188
Thanks, man.

2071
01:38:22,147 --> 01:38:23,690
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

2072
01:38:23,774 --> 01:38:27,486
(SLOWLY AND LOUDLY)
Hi, Mr. Harper. How are you?

2073
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,946
And now we know why you're here.

2074
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,534
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

2075
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:36,745
LORNA: <i>I'm standing right
by the guy in the tie.</i>

2076
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,622
There are a million guys in ties.

2077
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:40,499
<i>So look for the guy
I'm standing next to.</i>

2078
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:43,460
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

2079
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,170
<i>Just hang on, baby.</i>

2080
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:47,464
<i>(JUMP</i> BEGINS PLAYING

2081
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,884
What?

2082
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:55,138
<i>I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it after all.</i>

2083
01:38:55,222 --> 01:38:57,349
<i>Something came up.
Let's meet tomorrow.</i>

2084
01:38:57,474 --> 01:39:00,560
I'll be on the stairs.
Right across from you.

2085
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,483
Oh, my God.

2086
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,318
Have a great night, baby.

2087

2089
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,256
What is this?

2090
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:32,050
It's <i>Closing Time,</i>
by the band Semisonic!

2091
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:34,636
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

2092
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,514
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

2093
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,724
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

2094
01:39:40,684 --> 01:39:44,271
Sorry I had to use the real
Grand Central instead of the fake one.

2095
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,112
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

2096
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,364
I'm having trouble hearing you!

2097
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,324
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

2098
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:58,743
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

2099
01:39:58,869 --> 01:40:00,245
and they put the music in later.

2100
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:01,580
What?

2101
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:06,042
I messed up.

2102
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
I was scared.

2103
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:11,089
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

2104
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,299
Of course I was scared.

2105
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:14,759
So I ruined it.

2106
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:17,512
Everything that happens in the day,

2107
01:40:17,596 --> 01:40:20,765
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

2108
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,895
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

2109
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:27,939
And when I hear a kid's
been cured of cancer,

2110
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:30,317
I pray it's not by that douchebag,

2111
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,320
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

2112
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,655
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,

2113
01:40:35,822 --> 01:40:37,949
but, you know,
I wish someone else did it.

2114
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,118
Come on.

2115
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,417
Hey, I miss you.

2116
01:40:47,584 --> 01:40:49,169
Yeah, I miss you, too.

2117
01:40:49,628 --> 01:40:51,588
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

2118
01:40:51,755 --> 01:40:53,965
So am I. Who isn't?

2119
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:55,967
That's what makes us so awesome.

2120
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:57,928
- And our tattoos.
- Yeah.

2121
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,264
No, no, no.

2122
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:02,599
Oh, shut up. It's not what you think.

2123
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:05,602
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

2124
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:07,687
That is so lame.

2125
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:08,939
I know.

2126
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:11,733
That's some Prince Charming
shit, though, right?

2127
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,026
- Get up.
- Okay.

2128
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:17,697
Look, I can live without ever
having sex with you again.

2129
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:19,282
It'd be really hard.

2131
01:41:20,492 --> 01:41:23,370
Hey, I want my best friend back,

2132
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,455
because I'm in love with her.

2133

You can all go home now.

Okay. So...

What do we do now?

2141
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:11,167
Have our first date.

2142
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:12,669
