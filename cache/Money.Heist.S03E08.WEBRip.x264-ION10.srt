1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,540
They think we're academics, not thieves.
Why are you so pessimistic?

2
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,995
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,173
Why does it matter?
Love can't be timed!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,920
Love is to be lived.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,330
You can't risk the entire plan
for a woman.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,746
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule.

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,673
A job can't be poisoned by
an amorous relationship. Never.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,580
Never.

9
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,076
It's not that hard to understand.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,331
You're so cute.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,251
A loose end, just one,
will cost us our lives in there.

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,083
Inside, our lives are at risk.
You need to understand that.

13
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,456
Dying is a possibility.

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,211
- No, only if you make mistakes!
- No.

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,501
No. That's the funny part.

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,463
You're heading into absolute chaos
and you insist on being in control.

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,631
Chaos doesn't exist
in a perfect plan.

18
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,538
For God's sake,
of course chaos exists.

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,915
Chaos always intrudes on life.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
You don't need to make mistakes
to get killed.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,540
How long do I have to live?

22
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,541
Three years.
What mistake did I make?

23
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,575
What mistake did I make?

24
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:19,881
None.

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:24,923
It happens.

26
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,711
And you can't prevent it.
What mistake did Dad make?

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,670
- He must've made mistakes to end up dead.
- No, it's simpler than that.

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,130
A police patrol that was too close.

29
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,998
Or someone saw him enter,
or his weapon jammed.

30
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,673
Brother, you're clever.

31
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
Accident.

32
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,043
That's life's mystery.

33
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,785
That's why it doesn't make sense
to live like you do.

34
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,748
- How do I live, Andrés?
- Without Tatiana.

35
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,791
What I mean...

36
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,076
Without enjoyment.

37
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,536
In the end, that's the only thing
that matters.

38
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,785
We're here.

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,001
At every step.

40
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,496
Because some day,

41
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,916
something will go wrong.

42
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,383
It may cost your life...

43
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,418
or even something worse.

44
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,043
And on that day, you can't think

45
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:23,078
that you are guilty of something
you couldn't control. Do you understand?

46
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,963
That's life.

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,170
Enjoy it...

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,540
until the party is over.

49
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,376
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

50
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,168
Seville's detachment isn't enough?

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,830
No, I'm in a 170-hectare forest
with 183 houses to search.

52
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,536
Farms, huts, wells, and a search perimeter
I have to expand 20 kilometers every hour.

53
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,375
- Madrid needs to come immediately.
- I'll talk with Defense. They'll go.

54
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,288
Okay.

55
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,830
- Suárez, let's go to those farms.
- I'll take care of it.

56
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,381
Let's go!

57
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,543
Marseille is on his way here.

58
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,168
- Okay. Copy.
- How are you?

59
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,998
Very scared.

60
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,421
And very angry.

61
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,205
And surrounded by chicken shit.

62
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,825
I'm sorry, Raquel.

63
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,628
I'm very sorry. I really am.

64
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,038
Look, I am...

65
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,665
I'm quite old
and you're my first love.

66
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,625
I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to talk...

67
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,673
About this...
I only know I need you in my life.

68
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,208
I've held on
to everything you've taught me.

69
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,541
Like cooking together...

70
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,381
in our filthy boat.

71
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,166
Swimming fully clothed in the ocean.

72
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,461
And that Van Morrison guy
is really good. He is.

73
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,791
I really like him.

74
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,828
Raquel, everything is better
because you're with me.

75
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,878
Because I'm in love.

76
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,666
You could've told me before
that you were in love.

77
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,996
I'm telling you now because I don't know
how to say it to your face.

78
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,633
Forgive me because...

79
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,035
in our earlier argument,

80
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,538
who was really talking was...

81
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,501
the maladjusted one who doesn't know
how to enjoy life, the Professor.

82
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,753
But Sergio, I...

83
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,078
Raquel, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

84
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,918
I feel really ridiculous here.

85
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,036
Crying.

86
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,625
While a hen stares at me.

87
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,995
Hens bring luck.

88
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,706
I don't know where.
Definitely not in the Chinese zodiac.

89
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,825
After what you've told me, I think
I'll be able to endure three hours.

90
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,748
We'll talk again in 15 minutes.
Frequency 144.

91
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,583
Understood. Over and out.

92
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,463
I brought that champagne bottle
to drink with Rio.

93
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,170
While I was dancing,
I realized there are two kinds of people.

94
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,083
The ones who break up with you
and need to wish you the best.

95
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,376
Like, take care, be happy.

96
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,790
Rio is one of those.

97
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,963
Then there's the other kind.
We're a little bit more of a dick.

98
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,921
I'm sorry. If you want,
I can wait outside.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,420
No. At this point,
being shy doesn't make sense.

100
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,206
Rio, I wanted to say...

101
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,081
You did what we should have done
a long time ago.

102
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,456
Hey. Not a long time ago.

103
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,251
We had a lot of fun together.

104
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,173
And you're fucking crazy,
but you haven't headbutted me yet.

105
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,495
Yeah, we had our fun.

106
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,083
Good times.

107
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,875
But it wasn't enough.

108
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
The wave swept us away.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,210
What wave, Tokyo?

110
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,331
What fucking wave
are you talking about?

111
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,536
The robbery.

112
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,745
The pressure.

113
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,035
Being millionaires.

114
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,631
Hello, Denver.

115
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,378
I didn't hear anything.

116
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,495
- See you later.
- Where are you going, Denver?

117
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,503
- Don't go, don't go.
- What?

118
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,378
Rio, did you know
I almost hooked up with Denver?

119
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,378
Tokyo, what the fuck are you thinking?

120
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,628
- In Toledo. At that party.
- What are you talking about?

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,960
You were drunk.

122
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,673
Yes, of course. He was drunk.

123
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,960
You were drunk. I was drunk.

124
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,130
No. Moscow came into the room
and ruined the moment.

125
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,671
What I'm saying

126
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,915
is that what we had
was something casual.

127
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,671
Anything...

128
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,166
could have happened that day.

129
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
And now I wonder
the same thing you do.

130
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,213
How could have we wasted
all this time together?

131
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,171
Thank you.

132
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,001
Rio, we didn't even kiss.
Nothing.

133
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,876
Love is like
two people on a seesaw.

134
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,666
When one goes up,
the other goes down.

135
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,881
The balance is always fucked.

136
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,326
Thanks to time, monotony,

137
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,460
or because of people like me.

138
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,666
The ones who only know one way
to get rid of pain...

139
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,325
by giving it back.

140
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,040
Rio had a microphone
and a GPS beacon.

141
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
Everything was extracted.
No problem.

142
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,128
Did you isolate the chips?

143
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,035
Of course, dear.

144
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,713
They're in the little box,
tuned in to the sweet sounds of sleep.

145
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,501
The police have been taking notes
on snoring for quite a while.

146
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,291
It's time to give them
something else.

147
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,133
Palermo.

148
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,205
Let's do the Alcatraz Plan now.

149
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,383
Maximum urgency.

150
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,748
The Alcatraz Plan?

151
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,168
Sergio, what the fuck is happening
out there?

152
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,421
We're in...

153
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,455
an extreme situation.

154
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,921
It's possible that, at some point,
Lisbon and I will be under such pressure

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,420
that it could overwhelm us.

156
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,538
We'll have the army on us.
The police as well.

157
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,790
Things may go wrong.

158
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,578
But, in that case,

159
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
we'll have the Alcatraz Plan.

160
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,541
If Lisbon and I see ourselves
in a critical situation,

161
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,785
we'll need the biggest
possible distraction tactic.

162
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,915
The objective is
that the police will need

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to look in two places at the same time.
And there's only one thing bigger

164
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,463
than capturing us two.

165
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,416
Capturing us all?

166
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,955
You escaping is the greatest bait
we can create.

167
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,036
They'll go mad.

168
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,828
Any news?

169
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:37,923
Colonel.

170
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,041
The seismic sensors
indicate movement.

171
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,213
It's possible they're digging
with industrial machinery.

172
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,423
Bernardo!

173
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,418
You've studied that subsoil
to the point of exhaustion.

174
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,790
Tell me. Is there any possible way
they could escape through there?

175
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,421
I would say no, sir.

176
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,498
It's a very remote hypothesis.

177
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,043
Remote or impossible, Bernardo?

178
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,325
We'd be talking about an engineering job
with tunneling machines,

179
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,126
- more than 100 meters underground.
- So, Bernardo?

180
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,628
We can't underestimate them.

181
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,578
They could dig the Channel Tunnel
and we wouldn't notice.

182
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,076
- How many men are down there?
- Twenty-five men, sir.

183
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,076
Only 25 men?
Were there budget cuts or something?

184
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,206
Bring 50, 100 for every square meter.
I want an officer by every puddle.

185
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,711
They can't take a step without
being spotted. Get it together, Bernardo.

186
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,711
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:37,923
Let's go.

188
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,041
Bring me an expert who knows
every stone underground.

189
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,245
I want georadar, engineers, whatever!

190
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,133
Fuck everything! Come on!

191
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,626
What were you doing in there?

192
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,746
I was on a hike and I got lost, sir.

193
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,133
I came here to rest. I'm sorry.

194
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,711
And you hide in a chicken coop?

195
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:18,575
Well, I knocked on the door to the house,
but nobody answered. Please.

196
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,880
And those spikes?

197
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,575
Climbing.

198
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,211
There's no mountain here.

199
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,745
Or ice.

200
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,750
Do you think I'm stupid?

201
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,998
I know who you are.

202
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,376
Raquel Murillo.

203
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:50,996
Okay.

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,540
I'll tell you the truth.

205
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,748
- Don't aim at me!
- Calm down.

206
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,043
- Don't! Put down your gun.
- Calm down.

207
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,035
What's your name?

208
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,415
- Put down the gun!
- Your name.

209
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,540
What's your name?

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,210
Tell me your name.

211
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,423
- Justino.
- Justino. Justino, calm down.

212
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,170
Look at me.

213
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,381
Now...

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,420
you have two guns aimed at you,
and you...

215
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,750
You have a shotgun that kills birds.

216
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,923
You can hurt me.

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,080
But if you shoot me, you're dead.
So, put the weapon down.

218
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,711
Put it down, Justino.

219
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,080
Easy.

220
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,543
Easy. Yes.

221
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,463
You don't have a chance.

222
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,375
If I were you,
I wouldn't risk my life.

223
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,498
They've asked for citizen cooperation.

224
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,463
And they're offering ten million euros
as a reward, ma'am.

225
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,713
Put down the guns.

226
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,423
Okay.

227
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,455
Okay.

228
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,381
Okay.

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,210
Don't move!

230
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,791
- Don't move!
- Step back!

231
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,785
Drop your weapons.

232
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,035
- Step back!
- Calm down.

233
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,495
Step back!

234
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,923
- Quiet, Justino.
- Step back, I say!

235
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Stop it, Justino.

236
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,495
Drop your weapons.

237
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,383
- I know this game, you don't.
- Do you think this is a game, ma'am?

238
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,036
You're police.
I've seen you on TV.

239
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,581
You aren't going to shoot.

240
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,576
But we can. You've trespassed
onto our property.

241
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,536
And you have to have great aim
with both hands.

242
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,625
This rifle is for big-game hunting,
not for birds.

243
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,625
This makes holes.

244
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,078
Drop the fucking gun!

245
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,415
Okay.

246
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's do something. Okay?

247
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,463
Don't move.

248
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,383
What if we start negotiating?

249
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,248
Wow, so pretty.

250
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,418
So pretty.

251
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,330
Very pretty.

252
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,423
Yes. And it's warm here. Look.

253
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:09,881
Here it is.

254
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,326
Hey! What are you doing?

255
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,076
Nairobi! Nairobi!

256
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,463
- What...
- We're both single now.

257
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,381
I see.

258
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,128
We can go buy kittens.

259
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,916
Yes. What happened?

260
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,455
Nothing. We...

261
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,251
We broke up.

262
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,543
- Things break. Love breaks.
- Come here.

263
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Hey, guys!

264
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,458
- Come on.
- We came here with the cavalry...

265
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,711
Tokyo!

266
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,381
And then he shits all over me.

267
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,496
The oven!

268
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,291
- Listen to me.
- What?

269
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,580
Go upstairs and drink some coffee.
I'll come up later so we can talk.

270
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,916
- Not coffee, then I'll throw up.
- Yes. Then throw up.

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,710
- No.
- Yes. Throw up.

272
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,131
What?

273
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,708
I'm going to take a bath.

274
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,581
What bath?
You're drunk as a skunk.

275
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,876
Yes, I'm going to take a bath.

276
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,578
I need the water
and being inside the darkness.

277
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,876
- Floating!
- Relax!

278
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,498
Let's go upstairs, the two of us,
so we can talk.

279
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,713
- A little bit.
- Sure.

280
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,955
Because you're in love
with the gang's fatty gay.

281
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,921
But I...

282
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,920
I had a good love story.

283
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,285
I'm going to take a bath.

284
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,830
Yes.

285
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,830
Radio!

286
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,331
Denver. Come downstairs immediately
to pick up Tokyo.

287
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,076
- Hello, handsome!
- Let her be. She's funnier this way.

288
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,333
Shut your face hole, Matías.

289
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,331
If she wants to dive,
I'll teach her.

290
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,706
Go back to work
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

291
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,631
Okay, okay.

292
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,330
Okay.

293
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,963
These ovens are at
1500 degrees Celsius.

294
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,581
- We can't babysit drunks right now.
- The alpha male.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,420
What a buffalo you are, Bogotá.

296
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,626
- Stop messing around.
- Oh, I know.

297
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,168
You like Nairobi.

298
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,213
You like her ordering you around.

299
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,130
Stop messing around.

300
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,788
Okay. Then let's do something.

301
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,375
If I can't swim in water,
let me swim in gold like Uncle Scrooge.

302
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,253
Denver, you again?

303
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,876
Denver is here again.

304
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,173
Take her upstairs.

305
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,080
Tokyo, what the fuck are you doing?

306
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,956
What the fuck are you doing?
You're putting us at risk.

307
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,633
- I'm sorry.
- You're fucking sorry?

308
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,668
We're here because of you
and you're drunk.

309
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,790
If you aren't going to help,
at least don't get us killed.

310
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,705
So, fucking stop it now
because all of us have suffered.

311
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,206
I'm pathetic.

312
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,038
I'm not surprised
he broke up with me.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
Listen to me.

314
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,961
We came here to rescue Rio.

315
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,668
Didn't we?
That's why we came.

316
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,250
Not to save your relationship.

317
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,165
And you got it done.

318
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,710
Because you're an amazing woman.

319
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,583
But you need to move on.

320
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,126
But I can't.

321
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,083
You think you can't.

322
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,035
But you can.

323
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,881
Repeat after me.

324
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,665
I will move on

325
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,880
- because I'm the fucking best.
- I am...

326
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,461
No, no, no. Tokyo!

327
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,710
- What's up with you?
- I don't know.

328
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:04,995
Okay, but...

329
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,246
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,128
No harm done. Okay?

331
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,498
- Okay.
- No harm...

332
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,923
No. We aren't doing this.
Okay?

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,790
- No. Okay.
- Stop that.

334
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,415
- I beg you.
- I won't do anything.

335
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,330
Please.

336
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,996
- I won't do anything.
- Okay.

337
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,133
- You stay put.
- I will.

338
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,458
That's not what I mean!
No. We're going up.

339
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,421
Stop. Hey, hey.
Stop right now.

340
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,881
I'm not joking.

341
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,463
You wanted it before.

342
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,825
Get out.

343
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,076
Get out.

344
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,416
Oh, my God.

345
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,710
They will try to put at least a mic
and a GPS beacon in Rio.

346
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,133
And we'll use it to our favor.

347
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,955
In the Alcatraz Plan.

348
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,671
So, they'll think we're fleeing.

349
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,330
To make them feel that we're fleeing.

350
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,705
It's much more powerful.

351
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,286
Stop. Stop, Helsinki!

352
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,713
The seismic sensor isn't emitting
any signal now.

353
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,881
There's the hole.

354
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,666
Adding sound effects to their fear is
the biggest generator of paranoia ever.

355
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,210
We can make them believe anything.

356
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,458
The gallery.

357
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,881
- Hurry, call Palermo.
- Gallery?

358
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,830
Is there any gallery at that depth?

359
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:53,996
No.

360
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,878
There's none.

361
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,998
It can't be. There must be something.
Look for it!

362
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,883
- There isn't any gallery under that point.
- Find it!

363
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,671
Listen.

364
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,920
An escape is tension.

365
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,580
It's emotion, it's darkness.

366
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:11,536
It's the cavity's echo,
the subsurface humidity.

367
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,495
They have to feel all of that.

368
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,878
And they will.

369
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,876
They're in a flooded gallery.

370
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,498
Turn the volume up.

371
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:31,955
There's an echo.

372
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,876
Where's Nairobi?

373
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,673
She's not done melting.

374
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,631
Tell her to come down. We have enough.
We're leaving now!

375
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,075
Can they melt 90 tons of gold

376
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,036
- in two days?
- No. That's impossible.

377
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,750
Engineer, is it possible or not
to melt 90 tons in two days?

378
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,923
They would need 150 or 200 ovens.
I have to do some calculations.

379
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Technically, it's possible, but...

380
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,171
Improbable.

381
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,170
If they did probable things,
they'd be out robbing savings banks.

382
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,501
They'll question their ears so much

383
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,383
that they'll need confirmation
from another sense.

384
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:11,496
Sight.

385
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:16,043
And that's when the gang's new member
would come into play.

386
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,915
Be good, Sofía. It's your turn.

387
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,423
Sofía.

388
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,745
We'll put the geolocation
chip in Sofía,

389
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,536
and we'll get her ready while we keep
bombarding them with sound.

390
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:50,751
What the fuck is that?

391
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,713
It sounds like a four-stroke engine.

392
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,751
An engine?

393
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,786
It could be an outboard motor.

394
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,415
With a recoil starter.

395
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,250
Who gives a fuck about the recoil starter?
They're leaving.

396
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,833
They're leaving!

397
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,036
And they could only think one thing
because there's a clear precedent.

398
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,788
And they won't like it.

399
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,208
It's Chapo Guzmán's modus operandi.

400
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,961
The Altiplano jail escape.

401
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,173
I'm here.

402
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,213
We're all here now.

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,960
What is that?

404
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,211
Carts.

405
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,041
Carts!

406
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,325
And then it will be time...

407
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,038
to unleash the madness.

408
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,036
We will release Sofía.

409
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,328
Satellite confirmation.
They're moving.

410
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,826
At what speed are they moving?

411
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,246
Eighteen kilometers per hour.

412
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,883
Fuck, at that pace,
they'll be in Alcorcón in 30 minutes.

413
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,206
What's up, Ángel?

414
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,421
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

415
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,130
- It's urgent.
- Urgent? Fuck, no.

416
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,918
They're taking the gold out
through a tunnel.

417
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The national reserve,
on carts propelled by outboard motors!

418
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,001
The Emergency Unit stays in Madrid.

419
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,828
We'll inhibit the mic's signal
so they'll only have the satellite.

420
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:19,746
Then...

421
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,665
they'll have to follow us blindly
to where the GPS indicates.

422
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,418
Wherever Sofía goes.

423
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,960
We've lost sound.

424
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,791
The signal is out of range.

425
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,955
They're going very deep.

426
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,496
Call the underground unit!

427
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,423
And I want a detachment
outside the sewer.

428
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,880
Deploy units now!

429
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,673
Suárez.

430
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,670
We only have two farms left.
We're close.

431
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,381
Okay.

432
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,331
Gentlemen!

433
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,286
We're leaving!

434
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,793
Forty meters.

435
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,075
Come on, come on, come on.

436
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,288
Come on.

437
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,630
Yes. Yes. We have them, Bernardo,
we have them.

438
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,538
Thirty meters.

439
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,250
You're next to them, Bernardo.

440
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:26,746
Next to them!

441
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,785
Come on!

442
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,540
Fifteen meters.

443
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,293
They're at the other end of the corner.

444
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:38,955
They stopped.

445
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,080
Let's go.

446
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:50,955
Seven meters.

447
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,705
Slowly.

448
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,960
Five meters.

449
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:55,788
Bernardo!

450
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,456
Three meters.

451
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,418
Two.

452
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,205
- They're here. They're here.
- Bernardo, what's going on? What?

453
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,041
- Where are they?
- They're here.

454
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,456
A meter and a half away.

455
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,376
Fuck. What's that?

456
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,830
Colonel.

457
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,125
It's a ferret.

458
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,378
It's dressed as Dalí.

459
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,211
Those fuckers.

460
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,205
Those fuckers.

461
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,706
Cutting off visual communication.

462
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,958
This news isn't that bad, Tamayo.
Read the situation.

463
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,631
Really? Enlighten me.

464
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,541
They're faking an escape.

465
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,248
It's an extreme distraction tactic.

466
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,126
He's fucked
and he wants us to look elsewhere.

467
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,081
You're stressed. Aren't you?

468
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,285
But I assure you,
he's on the verge of collapse.

469
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,746
It's all part of his fucking plan.

470
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,713
Yes, but he isn't the only
one with plans.

471
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:06,666
It's the moment to hit them
where it hurts the most.

472
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:10,918
We have to attack.

473
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,250
Go straight for the heart.

474
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,496
Break them from the inside out.

475
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,330
I know how to do it.

476
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:24,996
How?

477
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,420
It's already in motion.

478
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,423
All of it.

479
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,536
I have money.

480
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,035
The police do too.

481
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,581
Ten million.

482
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,166
Are you sure you've heard my name
on the news?

483
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,080
- Of course we're sure.
- Because...

484
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,535
they're offering ten million,
but that's for the Professor.

485
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,170
And that's not even true.

486
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,460
All the rewards have small print.

487
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,628
We're farmers,
but we aren't stupid.

488
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,628
They've said it on the news, on TV.
Everywhere.

489
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,418
I've been a police agent
and I know rewards...

490
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,291
are never paid. Never.

491
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,383
Tom Lee,
a businessman from Michigan.

492
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,076
He gave crucial information
about Bin Laden's whereabouts.

493
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,246
They were offering $25 million.

494
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,038
He's still trying to claim it.

495
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,538
I'm not lying.
You can look it up online.

496
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,750
I can offer you money.

497
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,673
Today.

498
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,666
And a lot more than what
the police are offering.

499
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,130
How much?

500
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,078
What do you think about 15 million?

501
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,080
Fifteen?

502
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,461
Alert everyone of any movement.

503
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,501
Everyone, be alert.

504
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,133
Perimeter covered.

505
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,748
Windows. Watch the windows.

506
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,633
Copy, sir.
Watch the third floor.

507
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,038
West side.

508
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,165
Covered.

509
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,293
What a bitch.

510
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:37,495
Come here.

511
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,245
You're the biggest
piece of shit on earth.

512
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,883
We came here to rescue you

513
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,418
and the first thing you do
is break up with Tokyo?

514
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,460
Denver, that's a personal matter.

515
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,581
It's not fucking personal.
Tokyo is a time bomb. You knew that.

516
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,036
Ask her for forgiveness.

517
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,745
Ask her to be your girlfriend
or to marry you.

518
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,423
Whatever the fuck you want.

519
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,876
And once you get out of here,
break up with her. But not here.

520
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,918
Maybe you could grow up some.

521
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,830
A pregnant woman
with a teddy bear is coming.

522
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,290
Did anyone call the circus?
What the fuck is happening?

523
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,038
Watching left side.

524
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,376
Entering high security perimeter.

525
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,378
Everything's in order.

526
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,458
Perimeter covered.

527
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,423
Roof and upper floor?

528
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,750
Affirmative.

529
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,538
She's crazy.

530
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,501
We have to get that bear.

531
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,883
We're on it right now.

532
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,038
I'll do it.

533
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:52,921
Nairobi!

534
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,633
- Stop, Nairobi.
- What?

535
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,328
We have a protocol.

536
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,455
What's gotten into you?

537
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,330
Nothing.

538
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,246
Denver.

539
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,423
The volunteer.

540
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,166
I have him.

541
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,168
What are you looking at?

542
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,210
Come here.

543
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,253
Come here. Look.

544
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,923
We're going out there
to get a teddy bear.

545
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,206
But won't that be dangerous?

546
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,541
It's not dangerous. Go.

547
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Stop!

548
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,130
Don't do it, boy.
Don't try to be a hero. It's not worth it.

549
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,828
You know perfectly well that it's a trap.
You can't send him out.

550
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,626
This is practically suicide.

551
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,671
You're condemning that boy
to certain death.

552
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,210
Damn! You're sending him
to the slaughterhouse!

553
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,501
It could be explosives!

554
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,713
If it were explosives,
I would send you!

555
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,076
Shut up!

556
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,751
Come. It's your moment.
We've talked about this. Remember?

557
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,168
Hey, listen to me.

558
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,290
I believe in you. I believe in you.
Be calm and composed.

559
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,666
Amanda is watching.

560
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,788
Come on, hurry. Come on!

561
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,883
Masks!

562
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,173
Rio!

563
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,173
They're opening the doors, sir.

564
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,750
Hostages with fake weapons, sir.

565
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,418
I can see them, Antoñanzas!
I can see them!

566
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,828
I'm a hostage, don't shoot!

567
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:33,916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

568
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,708
Intern at the Systems Department.

569
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,461
Be careful with the masked ones.
There could be thieves among them.

570
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,495
Understood, sir. We're alert.

571
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,995
Waiting for orders.

572
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,038
He's grabbing the teddy bear.

573
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,540
The bomb is inside.

574
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,753
Mission accomplished, Mr. Denver.

575
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,333
Very well, Miguel.

576
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,626
Now, give it to me.

577
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,128
Be careful with any sudden movements.

578
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,498
Take it to the X-ray.

579
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,291
I can go out for any exchange,
Mr. Palermo.

580
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,790
There's a phone here,

581
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,208
but there's no bomb.

582
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,326
- There's another thing.
- Open it, Helsinki.

583
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,040
The phone.

584
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,328
You bitch!

585
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,125
The fuck do you want?

586
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,038
To make you an offer.

587
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,825
Go to hell.

588
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,206
Okay.

589
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,253
Where do you think you're going?
Did it strike a chord...

590
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,173
Let me go.

591
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,376
What the fuck is happening here?

592
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,078
I don't know what the fuck is wrong
with her, but I want her here.

593
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,666
Now! Go!

594
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,080
- No. No.
- What?

595
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,170
- I'll go.
- No, you won't.

596
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,333
I said, I'll go.

597
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:08,246
Between the police and the thieves,
I trust the police.

598
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,003
These thieves have dumped
140 million euros on the center of Madrid.

599
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,708
Do you really think we don't have 15 or 20
to give you in exchange for your help?

600
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,001
Yes, but that's dirty money.

601
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,668
- The police's money is legal.
- It's legal.

602
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,833
If you hand me over,
you'll be outcasts.

603
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,833
As soon as they have me,
they'll disappear,

604
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:30,746
but you won't.

605
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,583
You'll be on every TV.

606
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,245
The couple that handed Lisbon over.
They'll hate you.

607
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,205
Everyone here loves us.
Do you know why?

608
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:44,078
Because we came back to rescue a friend
who was being tortured.

609
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:47,996
And those torturers are the same
who are offering you the ten million.

610
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,710
So, think it over.

611
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:52,995
And take the money.

612
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,208
You'll have it in two hours.

613
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,456
And nobody will ever know
about this.

614
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,706
I give you my word.

615
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,131
Okay.

616
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:15,996
Fuck.

617
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,788
It's the police.
The police are here, Justino.

618
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,328
That's your son's bear, isn't it?

619
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,960
It doesn't smell like him anymore.

620
00:39:58,833 --> 00:39:59,673
Nairobi.

621
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,710
They did it to hurt you.

622
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,291
Yeah. I know.

623
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,455
And now I'm really fucked
because...

624
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,625
the only thing I want now...

625
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,126
is to smell my son.

626
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,378
I'm a bad mother.

627
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,330
No.

628
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:23,995
No, Nairobi.

629
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,003
You were the mother you could be.

630
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,501
And you paid for it.

631
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,380
You paid a lot.
And you're still paying.

632
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,790
You don't know shit.

633
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,625
Do you know what I did
with this bear?

634
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,711
I'm so ashamed that not even
Helsinki knows about it.

635
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,420
When they called me to buy drugs,

636
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,581
I took my son to the park.

637
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:54,706
I dressed him up.

638
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,751
He sat in his chair.

639
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,706
And I gave him his bear.

640
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,133
And inside the bear,
his mom...

641
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,876
hid pills...

642
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,883
cocaine...

643
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,880
heroine...

644
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,880
and whatever else I needed.

645
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,213
That's how I took my kid
to the park.

646
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,878
I used him...

647
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,496
as a mule.

648
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,923
So, they took him away from me.

649
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,751
And they were right to do it.

650
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,668
I've brought your son here.

651
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,423
- What?
- Axel.

652
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,328
He's here with me.

653
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,038
That's not true.

654
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:17,955
It is.

655
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:25,326
He's in front of me, one meter away.
He's as funny as ever.

656
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,825
But he's nine. Axel.

657
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,416
- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- A cook.

658
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,418
- What?
- A cook.

659
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
What?

660
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,628
A cook!

661
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,538
- He wants to be a cook.
- You're lying. I'm gonna hang up.

662
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:39,918
Don't hang up.

663
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,668
I have something to offer you.

664
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,041
But first of all,

665
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,628
I'll show you I don't lie.

666
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,128
I don't trust bitches like you.

667
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,378
Yes. I don't either.

668
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:54,705
Come, Axel.

669
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,875
Let's do something.

670
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,041
I'm going out there...

671
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:00,996
with him.

672
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,706
And you will see
that what I'm saying is true.

673
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,043
Then we'll talk.

674
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,333
I have something important
to tell you.

675
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,170
- Permission to shoot?
- My son.

676
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,210
- Shoot.
- Nairobi, get out of there!

677
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:57,081
Nairobi. Nairobi.
Don't touch it. Don't.

678
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,213
No!

679
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,331
Help!

680
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,293
Help! Come here!

681
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,915
Please, hide me somewhere.

682
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,960
Please. You have to hide me.

683
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,333
Hide me somewhere, please!

684
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,416
Twenty million.

685
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,328
Yes. Fine.

686
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,786
I have two million in my bag.

687
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,418
Once I'm out of here,
I'll give you the rest.

688
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,960
- I swear.
- Don't listen to her.

689
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,421
There's no time, Justino!

690
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,880
Stop! Stop that!

691
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,828
Calm down. It's a radio.
I want you to hear this.

692
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,376
Professor. It's Lisbon.
I'm surrounded.

693
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,080
I need to give 18 million to some people
so they'll help me. Is it possible?

694
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,920
Of course. We'll give it to them
as soon as possible.

695
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,576
He never betrays his word.
Neither do I.

696
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:38,826
Twenty million.

697
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,383
Do you accept?

698
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,541
They have dogs.

699
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,460
They will find her.
We will go to jail, Justino.

700
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:49,961
We have the trapdoor.

701
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,961
I can cover it with manure.

702
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,751
- The dogs won't smell her.
- There's no time!

703
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,041
- Please, Reni.
- Please!

704
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:58,671
No.

705
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,458
Help, please.

706
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,291
Nairobi! Nairobi, please.
Hold on!

707
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,785
Nairobi. Let me do it. Nairobi.

708
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,455
You have to hold on, Nairobi!

709
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,501
I'm really fucked, Helsi.

710
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,793
The bullet's inside.

711
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,625
It's inside.
That's good, that's good.

712
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:23,828
We'll get it out.

713
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,376
Gauze! Gauze!

714
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,036
Give me the gauze.

715
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,211
They must be busy
playing doctor now.

716
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,920
- We'll go all in. Won't we?
- It's time.

717
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,833
Gentlemen, launch the attack!

718
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:45,833
Armored units, go.

719
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,133
We're going to knock down
that damn gate.

720
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,455
Raquel.

721
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,580
Let's go.

722
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,918
They're going to hide me
in a basement.

723
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:21,996
Stop there!

724
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,331
Raquel Murillo is inside here!

725
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:25,996
She's talking to the Professor.

726
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:26,963
- Delta.
- Drop the gun!

727
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,826
Easy, easy.

728
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,041
- Is it inside?
- Yes. It's inside.

729
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,035
- Morphine!
- They got me good.

730
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,383
It ripped me apart.

731
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,418
No.

732
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,745
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

733
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,705
Against the tree!

734
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,751
- Against the tree!
- I didn't do anything.

735
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,583
- Please.
- Sierra, do you hear me?

736
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,666
- Yeah, talk to me.
- We have Murillo.

737
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,170
She's talking to the Professor.

738
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,540
What do you want me to do?

739
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,745
- Don't move!
- No, Justino, no.

740
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,423
- Don't move!
- Hide me.

741
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Don't move!

742
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:05,746
On your knees!

743
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,920
I'm going to give you morphine
to get the bullet out.

744
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,130
Hold on.

745
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:13,745
Hold on.

746
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,543
- Morphine!
- Morphine, here.

747
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,043
Justino, help me.

748
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,536
I can't.

749
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:25,035
Velasco, Solana, come with me.
The rest, surround the house.

750
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:28,998
Police!

751
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,173
There's nothing to do now.

752
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,833
Guys!

753
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,631
Guys, guys, guys!

754
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,958
They're coming with fucking tanks!

755
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:38,881
Fuck!

756
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:44,711
Police! Police!

757
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,420
- Put down your weapon!
- Hands where I can see them!

758
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,580
Hands on your head!

759
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,038
Sir, get out of here.

760
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:53,538
Raquel.

761
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,381
Why are you sending him
outside, Suárez?

762
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,330
- Don't go, Justino, don't go!
- She's dangerous. I order you to leave.

763
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,206
- What are you going to do?
- Suárez.

764
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,331
I'm handing myself over. I'm unarmed.
What are you doing?

765
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,671
Velasco, take this citizen outside!

766
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,750
- What are you going to do?
- Justino, don't leave. Don't leave!

767
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,251
What are you going to do?

768
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,963
- Justino!
- Against the tree.

769
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,330
Against the tree! Don't move!

770
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:26,286
Suárez, I'm not a threat.

771
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,285
You're the biggest threat, bitch.

772
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,580
You sold us all out, traitor!

773
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,876
Suárez, put down the gun.

774
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,330
Where is the Professor?

775
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,578
Raquel, tell them you'll give me up.
Buy time until I can get there.

776
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,041
Raquel, tell him.

777
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,748
Where is the Professor?

778
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,253
I don't know where he is.

779
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,923
Raquel, I'm on my way. Raquel.

780
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,790
Where is the Professor?

781
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,875
I don't know!

782
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,830
Are you sure?

783
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,171
Because I'm only going to ask you
once more.

784
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,078
Get out of there!

785
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,213
Get out of there!

786
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,213
I don't know
where the Professor is.

787
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,580
I don't.

788
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:08,748
Wrong answer.

789
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:18,958
I'm on my way.
Get out of there. Get out of there!

790
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,458
It was self-defense.

791
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,538
Do you understand, Solana?

792
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,665
She shot first.

793
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,710
Take the weapon. Clean the fingerprints.
Put it in her hand.

794
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,420
Professor, it's Palermo.

795
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:00,326
Get ready for immediate intervention.

796
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:04,706
As soon as we knock down that gate,
we're going in with all the troops.

797
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,710
Professor, it's Palermo.
Do you copy?

798
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,578
Professor, it's Palermo.
Do you copy?

799
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,293
Sergio! Are you there?

800
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,330
Sergio!

801
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,381
They've executed Lisbon.

802
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,076
They've taken down Nairobi here.

803
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,995
A sniper. It's really serious.

804
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,245
- Hold on.
- Yes.

805
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,631
Almost.

806
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,126
I saw my son.

807
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,460
Just now.

808
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,245
He's fine.

809
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,833
He's fine.

810
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,126
He's fine.

811
00:50:56,416 --> 00:51:00,246
Palermo! Palermo!
They're coming with a tank.

812
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,883
They're going to knock
down the door.

813
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,170
We're being attacked.

814
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,535
Palermo...

815
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,290
this isn't a robbery...

816
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,625
or a challenge to the system.

817
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,211
This is war.

818
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,076
Act accordingly.

819
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,286
Sir...

820
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,213
it was an honor to be
under your command.

821
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,500
DEFCON 2!

822
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,541
Denver! Come!

823
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,961
Ready.

824
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,790
When he turns 18,

825
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:43,291
give him the money and tell him
who his mother was.

826
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,673
No.

827
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,578
- Swear it to me.
- Yes.

828
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,166
Look at me.

829
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:49,918
You will do it yourself.

830
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Okay?

831
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,875
You are going to get out of here
and you'll do whatever you want.

832
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,381
- Helsinki! DEFCON 2 now!
- Palermo!

833
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,710
Not now!
I'm with Nairobi now, Palermo.

834
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,880
I'll go!

835
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,291
Sir, we're ready for the assault.

836
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:23,246
Now!

837
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:38,378
Attention! Clear this area.
Two groups, two corners. Now!

838
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,293
On your knees with your hands
on your head!

839
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,461
Come on!

840
00:52:58,583 --> 00:52:59,923
Come on, Rio. Come on.

841
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,170
In position.

842
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:06,791
Wait for it.

843
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,208
Wait for it.

844
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,381
Gates!

845
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,206
Fire!

846
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:53,251
The Professor had fallen
for his own trap.

847
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,133
The ear's ability
to elicit paranoia.

848
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:09,421
That's the card Sierra had played...

849
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,578
Pretend to execute her.

850
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,536
He'll be listening.

851
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:16,583
