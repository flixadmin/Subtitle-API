1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,167
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,761
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,491
<i>but secretly, with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,007
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,525
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,682
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,286
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,969
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,441
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,841
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,961
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,487
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,170
<i>I accidentally ran to the future.</i>

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,924
<i>I saw Savitar murder you.</i>

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,366
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
- I'm not.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,564
If you guys got something going on,
I hope you know you can talk to me.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,882
Every night when I go to bed,
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up...

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,041
<i>Her.</i>

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,807
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,122
So, you're telling me
that every time I'm blacking out...

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,321
<i>You've become Alchemy.</i>

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,643
Alchemy can restore the powers
that people had in Flashpoint.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,325
What Alchemy did was not your fault.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,482
I'm saying that at this point
in his training,

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,130
you're faster than Barry.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,203
It's crazy how fast I've gotten
in such a short time.

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,486
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,324
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar,

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,527
you are.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,481
So this is it, huh?

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,244
Yeah, this is
the starting line to our race.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,129
Cisco's set up sensors
all along the course,

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,327
and he'll be tracking our speed

35
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,369
all the way to the finish line
on the other side of town.

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,721
No, I meant, this is it,

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,089
the day the greatest upset
in speedster history goes down.

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,526
Wally...

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,411
man, this isn't
about winning or losing, okay?

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,722
This is about training
so you can get faster

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,609
and beat Savitar and save Iris.

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,842
- Yeah. Which I'm gonna do.
- Okay.

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,329
But first I'm gonna make you eat my dust.
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,731
Okay, you know, there is a reason
they call me the fastest man alive.

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,526
<i>Cisco, you good?</i>

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,807
Ladies and gentlemen, the Central City
Speedster 500 is about to begin,

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,762
but first, I've got five-to-one odds
Barry takes down Wally.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,922
- <i>Any takers?</i>
- Yeah. Game of speculation?

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,401
Are we... We're betting? Yeah. No, I'm in.

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,728
On my Earth, financial wagering was banned

51
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,724
after an unfortunate incident
with Vice President Al Capone.

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,042
- Well, lucky for you, you live here now.
- Yes.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,441
Put me down for $20 for Barry.

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,204
- Joe, got to be in it. Come on.
- No, not me.

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,084
That's a Sophie's Choice
I'm not gonna make.

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,170
$80 on Barry.
Mama needs a new confocal microscope.

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,368
All right, H.R.,
you put your life in my hands,

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,727
so I know for a fact you like high stakes.
How much you in for?

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,722
Wallace's recent speed tests
ensure that he is a lock.

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,609
- Put me down for an Abe Lincoln.
- Hmm?

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,201
$100. Whatever $100 is on this Earth,
put me down for that.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,361
<i>Guys, we're ready.</i>

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,569
All right, all right. All bets are in,
and may the odds be ever in your favor.

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,761
Gentlemen,

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,081
<i>start your engines.</i>

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,171
- Ready.
- Get set.

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,607
Go.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,126
<i>At the first marker, one-third
of the way in, Flash is in the lead,</i>

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,805
- or is that Kid Flash?
- Kid Flash.

70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,930
Come on, Little Joe from Kokomo,
mama needs a new pair of shoes.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,730
<i>Come on, Wallace. Down the lane!</i>

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,120
I think he's done this before.

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,642
Ooh! Second marker, Wally's in the lead.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,531
- Yeah, Wallace! That's my boy.
- You mean, that's my boy.

75
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,331
That's your boy. I wanna double down.
I wanna double down on that right now.

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,130
Oh! H.R., big spender. You serious?

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,886
Serious? Serious as a heart attack, Rich.

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,966
Guys, they're neck-and-neck.

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,246
And almost at the finish line.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,803
- Oh!
- Oh-ho! Yes.

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,961
Pay up.

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,361
Hmm?

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,641
Now?

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,246
Do you guys take IOUs?

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,131
Come on, man! That didn't count.
You know I can't phase yet.

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,487
Man, you just saw me do it, right?

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,723
And you have to be ready to face
any obstacle that's put in your path.

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,570
Yeah, well, don't worry, Barry.

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm gonna get faster.
Pretty soon, I'm gonna be faster than you.

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,001
Oh, yeah? Well, until then,
what's my name?

91
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,167
Joe, hey, this one is, uh...

92
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,850
Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,923
- That's the body?
- Yeah, why?

94
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,003
'Cause he died less than eight hours ago.

95
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,921
Eight hours?

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,208
He was a chef here, Stuart Holzman,

97
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,522
and the owner confirmed
that he was working last night.

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,488
That's a lot of damage
in a short amount of time.

99
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,002
- We thinking he's a meta?
- Possibly.

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,367
Although certain chemicals
can cause a similar reaction.

101
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,409
Yeah, any acid with a pH below two.

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,561
Precisely.

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,727
We could be looking for an aggressive
variant of a necrotizing fasciitis.

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
A flesh-eating disease.

105
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,088
In a restaurant?
I'm never eating out again.

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,803
Hey, so an autopsy might help us
hone in on what really did this.

107
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
Yes, I agree.

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,409
Unfortunately, County denied my request

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,450
for a 3D-image medical scanner, which
would make short work of the process.

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,443
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,363
Allen, this is an active investigation.
There is protocol to follow.

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,441
Surely?

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,886
Not if we're gonna figure this out.

114
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,568
Okay. I'll bag the body myself
and meet you there.

115
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,767
Great.

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,446
Iris.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,161
Hey.

118
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,081
You okay?

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,851
Yeah, I'm just running up
against a deadline, so...

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,447
Since I have you both, I wanted to ask,

121
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,606
um, Cecile's daughter, Joanie, is in town,

122
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,922
and I was thinking
that maybe we could all get together,

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,366
if you don't think it's too soon.

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,166
I mean, I haven't exactly been dating
Cecile for that long...

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,521
It's not too early, Joe.

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,605
And Jitters,
is that cool, or is that too casual?

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,888
Dad, don't worry, okay? It's great.

129
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,201
Joanie's gonna love you.

130
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,570
I love my kids. I'm gonna set it up.
Thank you.

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,767
All right.

132
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,810
<i>It's nice to see him so happy.</i>

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,408
- Yeah, it is.
- Are you okay?

134
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,204
Hey, I need to show you something
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,441
Okay.

136
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,601
Look.

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,371
That's the name
of the restaurant where we just were.

138
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,124
- Yeah.
- I spoke to the owner,

139
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,281
and he said he doesn't think

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,363
that the restaurant can survive
an attack like this,

141
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,689
that they'd most likely have
to reopen under a new name.

142
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,127
- It's all coming true, Barry.
- No.

143
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,250
I thought things were changing.

144
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,488
Things are changing, okay? They are.

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,167
I was supposed to stop Plunder, right?
And instead Wally did.

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,081
And we're gonna stop Savitar, too.
I'm making sure of it.

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,521
What if we can't stop all of this?

148
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,050
I'm scared, Barry.

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,041
Okay, look.

150
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,487
Maybe we should tell Joe.

151
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,242
No, no. No, we agreed that we wouldn't.

152
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,487
Besides, you saw him earlier.
He's planning for a future with Cecile.

153
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,331
If we tell him about Savitar,
it's all he's gonna think about.

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,891
I can't do that to him. I won't.

155
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,168
Okay, whatever you want.

156
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,726
But listen to me.

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,850
I promise you,
I'm doing everything in my power

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,923
to make sure that
that future never happens.

159
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,681
Okay.

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,324
You think this is what it's like
to be a character on <i>CSI?</i>

161
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,689
What do they hope to gain
from that examination?

162
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,530
They're trying to find
the exact cause of death.

163
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,121
Once we know that, we'll have
a better idea of what we're dealing with,

164
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,850
but until then, we need to train.

165
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,601
I'm gonna teach you everything I know,
starting with phasing.

166
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,041
Yes! Finally.

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,043
You know what we should do?
We should concoct some simulations

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,885
to help Wallace learn this new skill.
What do you say, Francisco?

169
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,883
I've got one word for you, <i>"Quebracho."</i>

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,727
- Let's go.
- <i>Quebracho!</i>

171
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,166
What's his name?

172
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,731
Doesn't really matter much now, does it?

173
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,325
Of course, we should call him by his name.

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,602
After everything he's been through,
he deserves that much respect.

175
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,091
"He" is a corpse,

176
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,527
thus impervious to such bedside manners.

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,604
Well, thank goodness 'cause I'd hate
to have to subject him to yours.

178
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,161
Victim is male, between 30 and 40,

179
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,129
<i>with a highly necrotized epidermis.</i>

180
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,204
We plan to do a full-body scan
and a chest wall retraction...

181
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,361
Julian, look.

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,567
The decay continues
even after the tissue's dead.

183
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,404
This is not a bacteria.

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,801
Or any other disease
known to medical science.

185
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,484
That was one crazy set, man,
and I'm telling you, Rob,

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,250
you keep wailing on that saxophone,

187
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,449
you're gonna be running up
to Lee Jay Thompson in no time.

188
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,409
All right, have a good one.
Catch you laters.

189
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,126
All right. All right.

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,328
Whoo!

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,924
- Do I know you?
- Unlikely.

192
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,884
But I know you, Julio Mendez.

193
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,451
<i>Man, that was some set.</i>

194
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,645
Your cover of "Dock of the Bay"
took me to a different time and place.

195
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,081
Well, I'm glad you dug the set, man.

196
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,161
Hey, before you go, uh,
I'd just really like to shake your hand.

197
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,288
Yeah, anything for a fan.

198
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
What did you do to me?

199
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,327
What you deserve
for all the pain you caused me.

200
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,040
Oh!

201
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,482
No. Ow!

202
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,849
That hurt like...

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,924
Like you ran into a giant wooden wall?
'Cause you did.

204
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,085
That was not just any big wooden wall.
That's double-reinforced <i>quebracho.</i>

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,049
That's like the strongest stuff
on the planet right there.

206
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,850
Well, fantastic choice, Cisco.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,241
Well, it shouldn't matter
if it's wood or steel or stone.

208
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,602
If you're moving fast enough,
you can phase through anything.

209
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,446
Even molten lava? You know,
if you ever ended up in a volcano?

210
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,683
You know, I still don't get it.
How do you do this?

211
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,241
All right, here, watch.

212
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,520
When you vibrate
at the natural frequency of air,

213
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,968
your body, your cells,
will be in an excited state

214
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,367
that'll allow you to phase.

215
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,444
Yeah, it's not really helping.
What exactly do I do?

216
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,840
Connect with your body, right?

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,207
Connect with the air. Be pure electricity.

218
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,840
You have to feel everything
that's around you, all right?

219
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,801
So go fast and feel things. Yeah.
No worries.

220
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,045
<i>You can do this, Wallace.</i>

221
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,884
Okay. All right, all right.

222
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,243
You can do this.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,241
All right, again. Yeah?

224
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,561
You got this.

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,091
- This isn't working.
- It's not working.

226
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,651
You've been training him. What's worked?

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,961
<i>You know what works with that guy?</i>

228
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,441
Vocal encouragement.
You got this, Wallace!

229
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,726
I don't know why you ask him.

230
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,126
Well, what did Wells do with me?

231
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,010
His plan was more methodically constructed
than John Doe's in <i>Seven,</i>

232
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,083
<i>and he had a bit more time to work it out</i>

233
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,766
by, give or take, 15 years.

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,002
Well, we don't have 15 years.

235
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,608
I have a crime scene. I've got to go.
I'll be back.

236
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,330
<i>Just make sure he keeps practicing.</i>

237
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,443
Go, Wallace!

238
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,843
Body was found by that bicyclist.
Same MO as the first one.

239
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,482
<i>This victim was performing
here last night.</i>

240
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,483
He's a lounge singer named Julio Mendez.

241
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,005
Julio Mendez?

242
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,366
Has anybody seen Detective West?

243
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,443
<i>In Flashpoint, he was Captain Mendez.</i>

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,604
Sorry, in Flashpoint,
this alternate universe that you lived in,

245
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,370
he worked at the CCPD?

246
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,801
Yeah.

247
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,046
Wait a second. The other...

248
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,441
The other vic, Stuart Holzman,
do we have a photo of him?

249
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,725
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

250
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,120
The one on... That's him.

251
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,321
<i>What is it?</i>

252
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,921
<i>He was a cop there, too.</i>

253
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,044
So this is the second dead cop
from Flashpoint?

254
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,125
Yeah.
We've got to figure out who this guy is.

255
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,970
Well, if we hurry, there's still a chance

256
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,724
<i>we can get some
of the attacker's residual DNA</i>

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,406
before this corpse disintegrates,
but we've got to move quick.

258
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,165
Barry, you can help with that.

259
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,961
<i>All right, come on.</i>

260
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,001
- Anybody see me?
- Damn, I barely saw you.

261
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,521
Look, we've got to get going.

262
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,011
Hey, Joe, hold up.

263
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,642
Look, I know how excited you are for
this coffee thing with Joanie and Cecile,

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,446
but I think we should hold off.
I don't think it's a good idea right now.

265
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,160
Barr, these two attacks
don't establish a pattern.

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,765
- Well...
- And, besides, I'm a cop.

267
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,163
If I canceled my plans every time I was
in danger, I'd never leave the house.

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,724
I hear you. I would just feel a lot better
knowing you were someplace safe.

269
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,521
Name a place safer than a coffee shop
with my two speedster sons.

270
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,280
Meeting Joanie is important to Cecile.
Therefore, it's important to me.

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,923
Some things are worth taking risks for.

272
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,685
All right. Let's get out of here.

273
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,361
<i>Anything?</i>

274
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,682
Aside from this body
disintegrating before our eyes,

275
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,921
nothing unusual.

276
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,884
There must be a heightened point
of necrosis somewhere. Look.

277
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,726
We have less than 50 minutes

278
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,121
before this corpse disintegrates into ash
like the last one.

279
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,327
<i>We need to find it now.</i>

280
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,811
I'm aware.

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,884
This might be
a faster process if I did it alone.

282
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,327
You know,
I've done autopsies before, Julian.

283
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,403
I'm sure you have.

284
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,643
This might just be
a quicker process if I did it alone.

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,601
What are you doing?

286
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,649
The gradation is darker
on the palm of his hand

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
from the point of contact.

288
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,087
I see. I see.

289
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,130
You know, I used to think
Barry was overreacting

290
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,850
when he complained
about sharing a lab with you,

291
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,646
<i>but now I understand his frustration.</i>

292
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,406
Believe me,
no one is more frustrated than I.

293
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,208
You do realize that it's possible
not to be a jerk all the time, right?

294
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,164
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

295
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,121
<i>Two strains of DNA.</i>

296
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,850
One of them must be from our killer.

297
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,845
<i>But, you know,
there's something else here.</i>

298
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,442
One of the DNA strains
has an element in it.

299
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,443
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

300
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,367
I have...

301
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,243
In all the meta husks created by Alchemy.

302
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,844
Which means the meta that killed
our two innocent people

303
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,721
was created by me.

304
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,843
- French roast for Cecile.
- Thank you.

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,368
Non-dairy green tea latte for Joanie.

306
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,410
You're not much
of a coffee drinker, Joanie?

307
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,131
Well, I used to be, but then I learned
hot roasted coffee beans

308
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,567
contain cancer-causing levels
of acrylamide.

309
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,761
Well, damn.

310
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,604
Uh, Joanie, Cecile says you're at Coast U?

311
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,970
- <i>What are you studying?</i>
- I'm undecided.

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,849
Are you leaning towards anything?

313
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,481
Not really.

314
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,842
Uh, Coast U's pretty far, right?
Do you ever miss Central City?

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,240
Actually, I like it better there.

316
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,802
Well, there is one thing
I miss about Central City.

317
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,527
- What's that?
- You're gonna regret that you asked.

318
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,727
Kid Flash.

319
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,047
She's a little obsessed.

320
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,931
Kid Flash is the one thing
you miss about Central City?

321
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,970
Whoa, Barry, slow down. You don't have
to be so skeptical about it.

322
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,326
<i>Kid Flash is cool.</i>

323
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,482
What do you like best
about him specifically?

324
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,763
- Well, he's fearless, and he's brave.
- Yeah.

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,046
He's a hero.

326
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,850
And he's probably pretty cute
under that mask.

327
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,045
Yeah, I think so, too.

328
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,328
<i>Come on, Joanie. Honey, Kid Flash?</i>

329
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,609
He's a showboat. He's snapping selfies.
He's leaving graffiti bolts on buildings.

330
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,762
- Okay, that's his signature move.
- That's kind of his signature.

331
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,921
<i>Yeah, well, from what I hear,</i>

332
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,525
the Flash is the one
who's actually saving people.

333
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,603
Sounds like Cecile's Team Flash.

334
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,241
Uh, Joanie, my dad would never brag
about this, but he knows Kid Flash.

335
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,447
<i>You do?</i>

336
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,603
- Mmm.
- Is my mom right?

337
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,531
Who is the real hero, Flash or Kid Flash?

338
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,680
Mmm...

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,046
They both are.

340
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,851
They both do great things
for Central City.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,240
Okay, but if you had to choose?

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,881
I don't...

343
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,249
I don't think I could choose.

344
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,368
Yeah, but if you, like, had to.

345
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,210
Um, could you go get me
some cream, Wally, please?

346
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,881
Yes.

347
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,404
This is work. I'll be right back. Sorry.

348
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,721
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

349
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,723
Barry, we got some DNA
off Mendez's corpse.

350
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,564
We were able to match it
with CCPD records.

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,370
<i>The meta's name is Clive Yorkin.</i>

352
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,726
We're sending you his info now.

353
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,688
Detective Joe West.

354
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,966
Long time no see.

355
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,006
- Do I know you?
- You don't remember me?

356
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,607
You and your cronies
had a very fun time ruining my life.

357
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,842
Not gonna let you do that
this time around.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,445
I think you have the wrong guy.

359
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,604
No, no. You're the Joe West I remember.

360
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,281
Look a lot more full of life now, though,

361
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,284
but don't worry. I can change that.

362
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,648
- Everybody, get back.
<i>- Joanie, go.</i>

363
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,167
Everybody, get out of here.
Everybody, go! Go!

364
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,929
<i>Yes, everybody, run.</i>

365
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,687
I only want him.

366
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,170
You can't hide up there, Detective.
No one can hide from me anymore.

367
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,968
- Joe.
- One more step, and I'll shoot.

368
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,090
Didn't work then, won't work now, either.

369
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,487
Told you.

370
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,487
Stop.

371
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,927
Ah! You can't touch me, Speedster.

372
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,368
I knew it. Kid Flash is a hero.

373
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,249
Well, thank God for Kid Flash.

374
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,287
<i>He's gone.</i>

375
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,326
This guy's got the touch of death.

376
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,525
Yeah, he does, and it's not just people.
Anything he touched turned to ash.

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,204
Joe, I really think you should
just stay here until we find Yorkin.

378
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,601
No, I'm gonna go check
on Cecile and Joanie.

379
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,000
They were pretty shook up.

380
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,210
Dad, are you crazy?
This guy wants to kill you.

381
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,851
If it wasn't for Wally and Barry,
he could have.

382
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,530
He could have killed any one of us.

383
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,886
Come on. We have been through
much worse metas than Yorkin.

384
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,921
What?

385
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,685
Iris, I'm fine. We're all fine.
We're not losing anybody today.

386
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,130
Maybe not today but soon.

387
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,886
"Soon"? Wait. What are you saying?

388
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,681
- Iris.
- Wally, he needs to know.

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,281
Needs to know what?

390
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,608
When Barry threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,490
there was an explosion,

392
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,169
and he was propelled to the future.

393
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,407
The future?

394
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,080
It was a few months from now.

395
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,729
What he saw was himself
standing before Savitar,

396
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,087
and me,

397
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,844
right before Savitar killed me.

398
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,729
You're saying that,
in a few months, you die?

399
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,645
Unless we can change the future, Dad.

400
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,007
Which we're gonna do, Joe, okay?
I'm not...

401
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,207
We're not gonna let this happen.

402
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,805
How long have you known about this?

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,082
- How long?
- A couple weeks ago, Joe.

404
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,647
And you're just telling me now?
That's my daughter.

405
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,969
Dad, I didn't want them to say anything
because I knew how you would react.

406
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,646
This is not something
you keep from your father, Iris!

407
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,201
You should've known that,
and you should've, too.

408
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,361
I know, Joe.

409
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,289
Look, I can even understand
why they didn't wanna tell me

410
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,687
because they didn't grow up
under the same roof that you did.

411
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,881
They don't know.

412
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,723
They don't know what my baby girl
means to me, Barry, but you do.

413
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,127
I know.

414
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,605
- Joe.
- I...

415
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,601
I'll talk to him.

416
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,604
<i>I'm gonna go to CCPD,</i>

417
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,280
see if I can find anything
that might lead us to Yorkin.

418
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,251
Well, that went swimmingly.

419
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,362
Joe's right.
We should have told him before now.

420
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,211
What you should've told him
is that I'm the one responsible,

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,571
that the meta trying to kill him
is one that I created.

422
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,369
Julian, you can't change
what happened to you. It's not your fault.

423
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,602
You keep saying that, but it is my fault.

424
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,367
People are responsible for their own
actions. To say otherwise is just...

425
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,569
It's just a way
to make yourself feel better.

426
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,924
Is that what you think I'm doing?

427
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,605
Making excuses for things
I've done in the past?

428
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,843
You know, I'm really starting
to regret bringing you in here.

429
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,881
Come on, Dad.

430
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,891
Hey, Dad, it's me, calling again.

431
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,051
Look, I know you're upset,
but, um, give me a call back, okay?

432
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,761
I love you.

433
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,281
Honey?

434
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,725
Good evening, Iris West.

435
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,291
<i>It's Iris's panic alarm.</i>

436
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,446
She's at the apartment. I'll call Barry.

437
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,410
No, no, no. I got this.
He's at CCPD, and I'm closer.

438
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,607
Okay, go.

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,446
You know, initially,
I wanted your dad dead,

440
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,123
<i>but then I thought,
if I really wanna make him suffer,</i>

441
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,964
I should kill his daughter instead.

442
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,725
This is not how I'm supposed to die.

443
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,120
Well, I'm pretty sure it is.

444
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,767
No, stop!

445
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,770
Too late, Kid Flash.

446
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,727
Me or her.

447
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,801
<i>I got you, baby girl.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

448
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,962
Elevated heart rate. Temperature's 104.

449
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,401
The decay's reaching
her subcutaneous tissue.

450
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,928
I'm here, all right? What happened?

451
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,043
- Yorkin went after her.
- Why didn't you call me?

452
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,527
- Because I was here.
- You call me! All right?

453
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,681
We have to give her something.

454
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,927
There has to be something we can give her.

455
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,889
It's not bacteria. Antibiotics won't work.

456
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,008
We have to do something.
Nothing's not an option.

457
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,640
Okay, what do you do
when a banana ripens too quickly?

458
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,921
Put it in the freezer.

459
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,969
That's brilliant.
Caitlin, you can freeze her arm.

460
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,407
It will stop the spread of decay
and give us some time to find a cure.

461
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,246
I trust you.

462
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,165
I can't, even if I wanted to.
We're not talking about a cold blast.

463
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,482
This is a specific
and continuous cold stream.

464
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,244
Too high a temperature,
and the decay spreads.

465
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,727
Too low, and frostbite will destroy
your nerve endings.

466
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,929
And that long using my powers,
I could lose control.

467
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,322
Caitlin, you're strong, okay?
Stronger than you know.

468
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,925
You're not going to lose control.

469
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,085
Caitlin. Try, please.

470
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,109
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

471
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,601
It worked.

472
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,605
Thank God.

473
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,807
Are you okay?

474
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,086
So far, so good.

475
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,928
Wally, where are you going?

476
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,844
Out of the way,
where I can't screw up again.

477
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

478
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,606
Hey, look, what I said back there...

479
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,962
No, you were right.
We should've called you.

480
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,168
I just thought... I thought I could do it.
I thought I was ready.

481
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,446
Obviously, I'm not.

482
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,801
That's not on you.

483
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,926
I wasn't fast enough, Barry.
That is totally on me.

484
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,607
No, not really. It's not. All right?

485
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,606
Look, when I got these powers,

486
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,367
I was really lucky in a weird way.

487
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,807
You know, I had a lot of people
helping me through all of this.

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,009
I had Wells, both of them,

489
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,123
and Jay and Zolomon.

490
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,486
I mean, two of them turned out
to be bad guys,

491
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,770
but even they were good teachers
who really taught me how to use my powers.

492
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,969
I just don't think
that I've been that for you yet.

493
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,968
You're telling me everything
that I need to learn.

494
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,840
I'm just not getting it. I...

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,083
No, that's not it. It's... I've been...

496
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,244
I've been letting you coast by on
your raw talent, which you have a lot of,

497
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,448
but teaching, it's a lot more
than just doing something

498
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,801
and expecting you to follow.

499
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,045
It's about inspiring and empowering you

500
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,249
to use your gifts to succeed on your own.

501
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,363
That's what I need to do.
That's what I'm gonna do from now on,

502
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
so the next time
you're out there and you're alone,

503
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,406
you will win.

504
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,806
Deal?

505
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,446
Deal.

506
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,721
H.R. and I just came up with a way
to track down Yorkin,

507
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,211
and it's crazy,
like "defies time and space" crazy.

508
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,687
Okay. Here's what we know.

509
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,851
We know Yorkin's going
after cops in Flashpoint, right?

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,207
What we don't know
is who he's going after.

511
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,682
But if we find out who they are,
then we can be ready for him.

512
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,530
Right. So how do we do that?

513
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,685
- We vibe Flashpoint.
- We vibe Flashpoint.

514
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,365
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore.

515
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,521
Stop you right there, B.A.

516
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,570
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore
in this universe.

517
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,160
But in quantum mechanics,

518
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,049
- the Daughter Universe Theory tells us...
- Universe Theory.

519
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,441
For every decision you make,
a universe exists where you don't.

520
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,364
Yeah, I actually went to that class.

521
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,726
You better be going to all your classes.

522
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,481
Okay, so if there is a universe
where you stay in Flashpoint,

523
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,051
Francisco here could vibe it.

524
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,930
And you're sure you can do that?

525
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,401
No. No, not at all, but Gypsy did say

526
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,164
I could do some pretty incredible things
with my powers.

527
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,321
Yes, she did.

528
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,370
Things I'm not ever aware of yet,
so things I haven't even imagined.

529
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,881
Well, let's get to imagining.

530
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,201
- All right.
- What do you need me to do?

531
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,728
All I need you to do is just stand there,
focus on Flashpoint, okay?

532
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,484
Focus on CCPD,

533
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,962
Joe, Mendez, that part of it,
and I'll take care of the rest.

534
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,402
It worked! I'm here.

535
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,567
Huh.

536
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,406
For some reason, I thought
Flashpoint would look a lot different.

537
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,689
Okay, all right, if I were Joe West,
where would I be?

538
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,723
<i>He was at the same desk.</i>

539
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,081
Got you.

540
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,366
If it wasn't for this takedown,

541
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,284
we'd be having a different conversation
right now, Joe.

542
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,726
Understood, Captain.

543
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,368
Joe's in trouble.

544
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
for today's perp walk,

545
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,283
we have a literal degenerate.

546
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,724
The one and only, Clive Yorkin!

547
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,086
Here we go.

548
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,922
Captain Mendez, Detective West,
thanks for the assist.

549
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,770
Couldn't have bagged
this goon without you.

550
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,410
Get him to Iron Heights.

551
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
- Stone.
- "Stone."

552
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,687
That was the other cop.

553
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,450
And let me tell you,
she loves her perp walks.

554
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,204
Laura Stone, she's a PI.

555
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,284
Yeah, that's her.
It was you, Mendez, Holzman, and her.

556
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,124
You guys took down Yorkin in Flashpoint.

557
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,284
Well, then that means she is the only one
that Yorkin hasn't gone after yet.

558
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,727
Classic example
of saving the best for last.

559
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,881
I'm on it. You guys stay here

560
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,929
and try to figure out
how to catch somebody we can't touch.

561
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,170
- Joe West. Long time no see.
- Hi.

562
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,642
I wish it were under better circumstances.
Listen, you're being targeted by a meta.

563
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,771
Sweetheart, take a look over there.
I'm the only one doing the targeting here.

564
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,163
That chick's husband is paying me twice
my going rate, so scram.

565
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,241
Look at this.

566
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,850
The guy that's coming after you
can do that with one touch.

567
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

568
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,807
<i>The Star City Express is
now boarding on platform two.</i>

569
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,849
- How about we multitask?
- <i>All aboard, please.</i>

570
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,011
Hey, Julian. You have anything?

571
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,050
Look, it's early days,

572
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,609
but first tests show that her blood
is attacking the cells in her body.

573
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,489
Wait. That's the opposite of how
my blood causes cells to regenerate.

574
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,681
Precisely.

575
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,649
Can we use my blood to save her?

576
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,890
Listen, I don't think that
your blood is the key to saving Iris,

577
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,123
but I do think it might be exactly
what we need to take down Yorkin.

578
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,321
All is not lost, mate.

579
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,561
Oh.

580
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,571
- The decay is spreading.
- Why?

581
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,001
I don't know.

582
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,081
Caitlin.

583
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,329
- Caitlin.
- I'm losing control.

584
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,687
Okay, all right, it's spreading.
We need you.

585
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,201
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

586
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,490
Just a little bit longer, and she's dead.
How's that for changing the future?

587
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,768
I know who you are, Caitlin,
and you do not wanna do this.

588
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,445
This is who I am. You said it.

589
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,171
It's time for me
to take responsibility for my actions.

590
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,522
Time for me to own who I really am.

591
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,444
Who you are is Caitlin Snow.

592
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,850
I know firsthand
the battle going on inside of you.

593
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,286
I know what it feels like.

594
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,362
When it happened to me, I lost, all right?
I was weak, and I let it win.

595
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,801
And I did...

596
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,288
I did horrible things to a lot of good
people, and you don't have to do that.

597
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,207
You're not gonna do that.
You're stronger than I am, Caitlin.

598
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,600
You're far stronger than I am.

599
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,884
You're one of the strongest people
I've ever known.

600
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,887
You can win this fight.

601
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,247
Iris needs your help now.

602
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,647
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.

603
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,288
And how do you know
this guy's coming after me, Joe?

604
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,885
We have pretty reliable intel.

605
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,003
Look, Laura, this is not someone
you should be ignoring.

606
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,244
He's dangerous.
He's already killed two cops.

607
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,731
He tried to kill me and my daughter.

608
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,362
Well, I've certainly pissed off
a lot of people in my day,

609
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,922
but the only thing I fear now is
forgetting to clear my browser.

610
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,527
Consider me warned.

611
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,086
Oh, my God.

612
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,721
- What is that?
- It's Joe's panic alarm.

613
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,686
He must be on that train.

614
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,968
There is no way that train can stop.

615
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,642
It's not gonna stop in time.
We have to get everyone out of there.

616
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,926
We don't have enough time.

617
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,281
<i>What is happening?</i>

618
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,646
Everybody, brace yourselves!

619
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,841
We're gonna move the train.

620
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,889
- How are we gonna do that?
- I'll vibrate it.

621
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,361
I'll vibrate it fast enough
that it can phase through this.

622
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,521
You can do that?

623
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,767
I don't know, I've never tried before.

624
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,921
All right.

625
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,925
Everybody, hold on!

626
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,445
Is that even possible?

627
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,931
We're about to find out.

628
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,447
Holy Kardashians!

629
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,485
<i>Barry? Barry?</i>

630
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,164
We're good, man.
Took a lot out of me, but it worked.

631
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,448
Yeah, maybe,
but we've got another problem.

632
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,321
Yorkin's back.

633
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,489
<i>You know what they say, Kid Flash.</i>

634
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,729
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

635
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,206
<i>You have to stop him.</i>

636
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,245
I don't have it in me right now.

637
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,805
I need you to get your blood into him.

638
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,644
It'll counteract his cells
and negate his powers.

639
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,723
How am I supposed to do that
when I can't even touch him?

640
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,405
You're gonna phase it into him.

641
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,931
<i>You know I've never done that before.</i>

642
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,923
And you just watched me
do something I'd never done,

643
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,411
but I did it because I had to.

644
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,841
<i>All right?</i>

645
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,601
I know you can do it, okay?

646
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,091
<i>I need you to believe it, too.</i>

647
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,528
Now, run, Wally. Run.

648
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,408
It worked. I did it.

649
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,010
You sure did. Goodbye, Kid Flash.

650
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,571
Oh, look at that!
Your powers are neutralized, Yorkin.

651
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,884
- What did you do?
- I won.

652
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,767
Hey, Iris.

653
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,721
Hmm...

654
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,041
Dad.

655
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,362
The last time I was this happy looking
into your eyes, you'd just been born.

656
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,401
Hey.

657
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,084
It's okay. You're okay. Yorkin's done.

658
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,646
What happened?

659
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,280
I'll tell you what happened.
Wallace was a total badass.

660
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,130
That's what happened! Translate.

661
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,171
Yeah, he phased his speedster blood
into Yorkin and neutralized his powers.

662
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,521
That's the science behind it.

663
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,601
I had a great teacher.

664
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,081
And me?

665
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,724
Once Yorkin's blood was stabilized,

666
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,451
we actually managed
to get an antidote that cured you.

667
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,125
You'll have to wear
the bandage for a few days,

668
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,647
but, other than that,
you're absolutely recovered.

669
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,561
Thank you. I know what you risked for me.

670
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,845
I had some help.

671
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,561
Couldn't have done it alone.
It was all of us working together.

672
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,127
Yeah. Really proud of everybody.

673
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,282
Great job. Big ideas today.

674
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,287
My point is,
if we're gonna save Iris from Savitar,

675
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,923
we're gonna have to up our game.
No more lies,

676
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,970
even well-intentioned ones.

677
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,441
We have to be completely real
with each other.

678
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,328
- I agree.
- I agree with Joe, too.

679
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,204
From here on out, complete honesty.

680
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,651
- Honesty.
- <i>Namaste.</i>

681
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,090
All right, get some rest, all right?
Check on you in a bit.

682
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,405
- Barr.
- Yeah?

683
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,486
Savitar's prophecy of someone dying,
was that Iris?

684
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,642
Yeah, but it's not gonna happen.

685
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,522
Look, I'm glad
she comes first in your life now.

686
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,889
If you're gonna date my daughter,
that's the way it should be.

687
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,291
You're still a close second.

688
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,046
It's just heartwarming.
It's just truly heartwarming.

689
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,887
You're already crafting a version
of this for your book, aren't you?

690
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,122
"And peace finally descends
upon the Family West."

691
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,890
"The West Family"? "Family West."

692
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,805
Right, it's time I get to work.

693
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,961
At this hour?

694
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,321
Yes, there's still
one husk meta out there,

695
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,847
and I intend to find him. Good night.

696
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,521
<i>Hey, Julian.</i>

697
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,201
Hey.

698
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,407
I don't think you're weak because
of what happened to you with Savitar.

699
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,361
The strength
that I found to stay in control,

700
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,925
that came from you,

701
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,641
so thank you.

702
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,803
Well, I wasn't gonna let Iris die
at the hands of Killer Frost, was I?

703
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,402
I knew there was a good guy
inside of you somewhere,

704
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,406
one that the rest of us
would like to see a lot more often.

705
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,927
Good night.

706
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,325
Do you wanna get a drink?

707
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,686
Uh...

708
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,968
- What, as in now?
- Yeah.

709
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,403
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'd love that.

710
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,971
- Hey.
<i>- Hey!</i>

711
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,084
What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?

712
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,249
Oh, Joanie's headed back for midterms.

713
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,204
We just thought we'd come and say goodbye.

714
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,401
Aw.

715
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,042
I was hoping a redo on the coffee,
seeing as the last one went off the rails.

716
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,651
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

717
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,167
I got to see Kid Flash
in action right up close.

718
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,402
Well, we got a lot
of stories about Kid Flash

719
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,846
I can guarantee you never heard.

720
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,169
Maybe we can tell you them
over dinner next time you come to town?

721
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,288
I have a long weekend next month.

722
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,569
You sure you're ready to commit
to something that far in the future?

723
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,805
I am absolutely sure.

724
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,961
Hmm?

725
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,407
Good.

726
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,721
We should go.

727
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,209
- Good luck in school.
- Thank you. See you.

728
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,165
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

729
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,281
Okay.

730
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,002
Good as new.

731
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
Actually, it's better than new
with the three extra locks that I added.

732
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,563
Which you didn't have to do.

733
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,690
Well, Cisco did offer
to build us a custom security door,

734
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,686
but we've both seen how well those things
keep people out of S.T.A.R. Labs, so...

735
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,002
I like deadbolts. Deadbolts work.

736
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,405
Just with what happened here,
I wanna make sure you feel safe.

737
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,481
I do.

738
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,606
About everything?

739
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,887
You know, you've been saying for weeks

740
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,690
- that you were gonna save me from Savitar.
- Mmm-hmm.

741
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,680
And while I trust you with my life,
it was hard not to feel scared.

742
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,288
You know, sometimes it feels like
the Flash is this guy my boyfriend becomes

743
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,124
when he runs off to save other people.

744
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,888
Like, I'm the only one
who doesn't get the Flash.

745
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,571
He felt separate from you.

746
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,245
But yesterday, when you saved me,

747
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,846
I remembered
that I have no reason to be scared.

748
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,526
- Mmm-mmm.
- The man I love is a superhero.

749
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,931
I love and trust you,
Barry Allen, the Flash.

750
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,241
I love all of you, and I always will.

751
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,731
I love you.

752
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,644
That was so nice.

753
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,529
- Jesse!
- No, no, no.

754
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,881
What's wrong?

755
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,682
Grodd, he's got my dad.
He has him in Gorilla City.

756
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:50,706
