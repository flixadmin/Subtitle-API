1
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,900
<i>- Elisabeth!
- Here Elisabeth!</i>

2
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,924
<i>- We love you!
- Elisabeth!</i>

3
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,948
<i>- We love you, Elisabeth!
- Please!</i>

4
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:57,272
<i>- Over here!
- We love you!</i>

5
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:09,662
<i>- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah, get a pretzel or something...</i>

6
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
<i>- Remember her?
- She was in that movie, uh...</i>

7
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:19,184
<i>Agh...</i>

8
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,703
<i>We're gonna have to let her
know we're gonna be late...</i>

9
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,704
<i>Yeah I'll shoot her a text.</i>

10
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,528
<i>- Yeah, he owes me twenty bucks.
- Oh, you're kidding?</i>

11
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,220
<i>Shit!</i>

12
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,444
You got it!

13
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,468
Feel that power, ladies!

14
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,992
And march, get those knees up!

15
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,316
You got it!

16
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,140
Come on!

17
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:40,352
Front!

18
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,964
Kick!

19
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,488
Kick!

20
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:46,012
Oh yeah, you got it!

21
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,536
Square.

22
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
Think about those bikini bottoms

23
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:52,784
you wanna look like a giant
jellyfish on the beach?

24
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:54,508
Come on!

25
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,132
Cross!

26
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:57,856
Push!

27
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,004
Kick!
Come on, you've got it!

28
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:03,528
Hang in there, ladies,
you've got it!

29
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,152
You've got it!

30
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:09,376
Woah!

31
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Ah, thank you.
Great workout, ladies!

32
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:16,724
Alright, I hope I see you next week

33
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,908
for Sparkle Your Life.

34
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,448
We're gonna work
on the lateral abs

35
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,672
you know the most difficult part to sculpt.

36
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,284
But in the meantime

37
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:25,196
take care of yourself.

38
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,820
- <i>Back to position one.</i>
- Great job ladies.

39
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,344
You got it!

40
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,333
- Happy birthday
- Oh, thank you.

41
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,541
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

42
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,000
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,350
I don't care if we see
every fucking young girl

44
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,100
in this fucking town
in the next few weeks.

45
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,258
Look, I'll make it simple.

46
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,266
We need her young.

47
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,208
We need her hot.

48
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,333
We need her now.

49
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,476
How the old bitch has been able to stick
around for this long.

50
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,125
That's the fucking mystery to me.

51
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,958
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

52
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,233
When was that,
back in the 30s?

53
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,708
What, for King Kong?

54
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,266
No, I don't give a
fuck what we promised her.

55
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,066
This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

56
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,475
Find me somebody new.

57
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,900
Now.

58
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,413
Hey, did you know
that a woman's fertility

59
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:16,591
starts to decrease
about the age of 25?

60
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,333
How old is Jennifer?

61
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,475
You better get busy.

62
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,741
It's like when you see
someone fart on screen.

63
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,458
People just love that.

64
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,833
I mean, that's just the way it is.

65
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,017
So you know what I mean?

66
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,641
People are just people.

67
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,675
And I have to give people what they want.

68
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,708
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

69
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:23,908
And people always ask for something new.

70
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,525
Renewal is inevitable.

71
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,216
And at 50, well...

72
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,500
it stops.

73
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
What stops?

74
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,116
What?

75
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,991
What stops?

76
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,583
Um, you know, the um...

77
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,941
The um...

78
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,208
The um...

79
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,150
Oh, George!

80
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,642
Oh, oh!

81
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,059
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

82
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,267
Harvey!

83
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,950
George, those ratings are insane!

84
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,816
You're a genius!

85
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,683
Oh, what a mix. You're a genius.

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Let's buy you a drink, come on...

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,558
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

88
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,766
because we have
X-rayed you from head to toe,

89
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,658
and you don't have so
much as a cracked molar.

90
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,408
So, you are good to go.

91
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,600
Uh, vaccination, okay...

92
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,350
Not going on a vacation.

93
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:18,583
By the way, I just want to say,
my wife is a huge fan.

94
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,825
Um, blood type...

95
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,825
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

96
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,516
Happy birth...

97
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,473
Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry.

98
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:41,791
I, uh, had to..
Have a...

99
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,808
Bye.

100
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
One moment.

101
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:55,516
There's just one last exam to perform.

102
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,841
I thought he said I was good to go.

103
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,584
Is there a problem?

104
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:22,008
No, it's perfect.

105
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,675
You're a good candidate.

106
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,133
I mean, you're good to go.

107
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
I wish you the best.

108
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Lizzie?

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Lizzie Sparkle?

110
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,633
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

111
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,358
Fred!

112
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,350
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

113
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,333
Oh, Fred, of course...

114
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,816
You haven't changed a bit.

115
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,958
You're still the most beautiful girl in

116
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,441
the whole wide world.

117
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,101
You know, I followed your career.
What a success.

118
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,583
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

119
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,767
Wow.

120
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,883
Hey, why don't we go out maybe for a

121
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,541
drink sometime now that we're,
you know, reconnected?

122
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,025
Um...

123
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,916
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

124
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,809
You're super busy.

125
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,642
But you know what?

126
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,008
Why don't you give me your card?

127
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,441
I mean, you never know.

128
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,425
Um, sure, what I...

129
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,851
This will do.

130
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,717
Oh.

131
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,600
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

132
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,050
They're a disaster.

133
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, God.

134
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,983
There.

135
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,266
Now you've got it.

136
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,858
<i>Have you ever dreamt of a</i>

137
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,400
<i>better version of yourself?</i>

138
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,091
<i>Younger.</i>

139
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,725
<i>More beautiful.</i>

140
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,716
<i>More perfect.</i>

141
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,375
<i>One single injection unlocks your DNA,</i>

142
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,997
<i>starting a new cellular division</i>

143
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:30,108
<i>that will release another
version of yourself.</i>

144
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,017
<i>This is...</i>

145
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,050
<i>the substance.</i>

146
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,325
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

147
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,508
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

148
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,316

149
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,166
<i>This is simply</i>

150
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

151
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,158
<i>You just have to share.</i>

152
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,375
<i>One week for one</i>

153
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,158
<i>and one week for the other.</i>

154
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,133
<i>A perfect balance of seven days each.</i>

155
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,858
<i>The one and only thing not to forget.</i>

156
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,700
<i>You are one.</i>

157
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,233
<i>You can't escape from yourself.</i>

158
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,700
<i>Yes.</i>

159
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,191
Hello.

160
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,083
I'd like to order.

161
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400

170
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,058
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

171
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,025
Hello.

172
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,351
Thanks.

173
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,091
We'll let you know by next week.

174
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:01,059
Thank you so much.

175
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,983
I'm just dying to get the part.

176
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,191
Great dancer.

177
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,610
Hmm, too bad her boobs
aren't in the middle of her face

178
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,608
instead of her nose.

179
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,983
Next!

180
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,125
Looks like everything sure is in the
right place this time.

181
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,608
Please say your name, age, measurements.

182
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm Sue.

183
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,350
I'm Sue.

184
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:10,700
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue,
Sue, Sue, Sue,

185
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:14,458
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

186
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,241
Where is she?

187
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,408
Where is she?

188
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,950
What a gorgeous little angel.

189
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,575
You're hired.

190
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:52,457
We want a show that's just like you.

191
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,958
Beautiful and happy.

192
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,200
People want to be happy.

193
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:59,517
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

194
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,859
I'm gonna let you organize

195
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,900
the rest with my assistant,
uh...

196
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,733
Isabella?

197
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,333
Is-is-is.

198
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,816
Who has time to say that?

199
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,958
We're gonna make you Cindy.

200
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:16,350
It's shorter, it's better.

201
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,896
So, I'm gonna let you organize

202
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,250
everything else with Cindy.

203
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,683
Oh, um, before you go,

204
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,766
I just have to mention
a small scheduling issue.

205
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,125
I have to be out of town every other week

206
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,583
to take care of my mother

207
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,608
who's very sick.

208
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,108
I want you for this show

209
00:39:49,191 --> 00:39:50,541
and we will work around

210
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:53,483
any mother, brother, fucking sick,

211
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,916
puppy you need to take care of.

212
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,309
Hmm?

213
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,733
Hmm.

214
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,158
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

215
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,741
People are gonna love that.

216
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,633
Perfect.

217
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,591
So you jump out, touch your elbows,

218
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,683
head down, contract.

219
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:17,466
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

220
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:54,100
Where have you been?

221
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:56,726
We've all been wanting
to have a drink with you

222
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,150
for your departure.

223
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,208
Anyway, we all chipped in

224
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,458
and we got you just a little

225
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,583
something to keep you busy.

226
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,684
It's French.

227
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,458
My wife, she swears by it.

228
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,941
Oh, I love my wife.

229
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,241
Oops, I gotta run.

230
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,300
But it's always great to see you.

231
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,383
<i>The antelope and the deer moving about</i>

232
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,116
<i>a hunt through the...</i>

233
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,283
God damnit lady,
come on

234
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,125
I haven't slept in three nights!

235
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,150
Open up.

236
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,700
Goddamnit,
are you gonna open the...

237
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:47,250
Ah uh, sorry...

238
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,608
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

239
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,934
She moved out.

240
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,358
I'm the new tenant.

241
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,316
Sue.

242
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,059
Oliver.

243
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,483
Oliver.

244
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,783
- Oliver.
- You wanted to complain about something?

245
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,775
Oliver?

246
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,517
What?

247
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,941
No.

248
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,733
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

249
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:12,534
I think it's like awesome
when there's stuff

250
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:14,741
going on in the building,
you know what I mean?

251
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:19,508
Um, I'm actually,

252
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,616
quite handy if you ever need

253
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,800
need me to be of aid in any way.

254
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,242
I got a sack of tools and...

255
00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:32,675
I got a big hammer.

256
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,566
You know what I mean.

257
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,958
Anyways, I live right here,

258
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
so you know where to find me.

259
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,233
Anytime.

260
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,108
Day or night.

261
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,900
Later.

262
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,900
Hi everybody.

263
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,784
I'm Sue

264
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:47,283
and it's time to pump it up.

265
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:48,242
Are you ready?

266
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,366
Let's go.

267
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,500
Thank you so much everybody.

268
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:22,316
I'll see you next week.

269
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:27,400
And in the meantime,

270
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,375
take care of yourself.

271
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,258
Where is she?

272
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:41,982
There she is!

273
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,566
Wonderful, wonderful!

274
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,090
That's what I'm talking about!

275
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:06,258
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

276
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,866
Don't eat too fast.

277
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,283
Are you all right?

278
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,575
Yes, I'll be right back.

279
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:11,725
Are you all right?

280
00:59:56,558 --> 00:59:58,550
What did you do?

281
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:01,291
You've seen me the more
beautiful than before.

282
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,608
No.

283
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,316
<i>Yes.</i>

284
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,058
Yes, hi.

285
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,408
This is Elisabeth Sparkle.

286
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:48,158
I'm 503.

287
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,150
<i>Yes.</i>

288
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,466
Yes, hi.

289
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:57,283
There's been a slight
misuse of the substance.

290
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:03,641
A few extra hours were accidentally used

291
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,458
causing, um...

292
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,582
an alteration.

293
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:11,558
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

294
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:13,900
<i>What has been used on one side</i>

295
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,691
<i>is lost on the other side.</i>

296
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,533
<i>There's no going back.</i>

297
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,250
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

298
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,858
And obviously she was drunk.

299
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,425
<i>Remember there is no she and you.</i>

300
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,900
<i>You are one.</i>

301
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:38,166
<i>Respect the balance and you
won't have any more inconveniences.</i>

302
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,691
Sue!

303
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,400
Sue?

304
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,650
I just saw you on TV.

305
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,825
Holy moly.

306
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,308
Makes me want to join your class.

307
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,758
Hey, you don't give
private lessons, do you?

308
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:37,166
Hey, what about a
drink at my place tonight?

309
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,633
Come on, don't be shy.

310
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:44,125
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

311
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,558
All right, take your time

312
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,316
but it's a date.

313
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,616
You know, pump it up

314
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,491
You got to pump it up

315
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,466
You know, pump it up

316
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,283
You got to pump it up

317
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,525
Sue.

318
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,266
What can I get you?

319
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,616
Moka Latte.

320
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,616
It's long, isn't it?

321
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,608
Excuse me?

322
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:50,108
Seven days.

323
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:22,175
Did you follow me here?

324
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:25,241
I was just curious

325
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,158
to find out how things were going for you.

326
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:31,225
Each time you feel a little more

327
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:33,500
lonely...

328
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:36,424
don't you think?

329
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

330
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,858
I'm fine.

331
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:44,316
Everything's fine.

332
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,966
It gets harder each time

333
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,658
to remember that
you still deserve to exist.

334
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,876
That this part of yourself

335
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,975
is still worth something

336
01:09:00,058 --> 01:09:04,833
that you still matter.

337
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,900
Has she started yet?

338
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,816
Eating away at you?

339
01:09:32,658 --> 01:09:33,467
Fuck!

340
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:34,891
Watch out!

341
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,650
What?

342
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:55,892
Hey!

343
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,316
Move!

344
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,631
You're still the most beautiful girl

345
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:31,391
in the whole wide world.

346
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,126
<i>Hello?</i>

347
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,650
Hi, Fred.

348
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,275
It's Lizzie.

349
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,691
Hello?

350
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,758
<i>Sorry, I mean, I'm in shock.</i>

351
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,101
- Oh.
- <i>Wow</i>.

352
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,351
<i>Wow, wow.</i>

353
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,726
<i>I thought I'd never
hear from you again after--</i>

354
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,466
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

355
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:03,516
I've just--
I've just been really busy lately.

356
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,583
So listen, I was thinking that

357
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:12,700
maybe we could get
together and grab a drink.

358
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,400
Are you still there?

359
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,941
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock, again.</i>

360
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,659
<i>Um, I could book Luigi's,
at eight?</i>

361
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,101
Eight at Luigi's, it is.

362
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,683
I will see you tonight.

363
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,517
<i>Bye.</i>

364
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,641
Okay, bye.

365
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,767
Hi everybody.

366
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:45,059
Hi.

367
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,483
Okay, here we go everyone.

368
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,642
Clear the set please.

369
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,066
First positions, thank you.

370
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:50,775
Roll cameras.

371
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,866
And in three, two, one.

372
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:00,375
Squat, squat, squat.

373
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,941
Circle those hips.

374
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:04,983
Circle those hips.

375
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:08,000
Contract, contract, contract,

376
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,808
contract, contract, contract.

377
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,991
Head between your legs.

378
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:20,275
Cut.

379
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,916
I'm sorry, I thought uh,
thought I, I...

380
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,566
I just got distracted.

381
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,476
Not a problem, let's
get right back to it.

382
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,900
Back to one please.

383
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,408
Sorry, it's the control room now.

384
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,601
The director said he saw something

385
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,976
bizarre on the monitor.

386
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,600
Bring up the replay on camera two.

387
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,066
Camera two.

388
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:57,275
Forward.

389
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,476
Can I have my dressing gown?

390
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,476
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

391
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,500
Well then go and get it.

392
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,981
Let's just take this frame by frame.

393
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,225
I need five minutes.

394
01:20:23,141 --> 01:20:25,775
- <i>Yes.</i>
- This balance is not working.

395
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,241
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

396
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,100
while she wastes seven days

397
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,946
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

398
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,316
<i>Remember there is no she and you.</i>

399
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,466
I love everybody...

400
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:45,892
What's happening?

401
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,101
Where is everybody?

402
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,525
The taping's been cancelled.

403
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,517
What, why?

404
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,941
Sue.

405
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,358
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

406
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,650
Okay.

407
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,983
- I'll go change--
- No, he said now.

408
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,316
I'll get right to the point.

409
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,483
We can't keep you on the morning show.

410
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,241
But why?
I just started.

411
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,983
Ratings are through the roof.

412
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,833
We started at 42.

413
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,400
Now we're up to like--

414
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,017
216.

415
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,641
It's phenomenal.

416
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,016
People love you.

417
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,100
They adore you.

418
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,958
They want more and more and more of you.

419
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,117
That is why we have decided

420
01:21:47,141 --> 01:21:53,008
that we want you
to host the New Year's Eve show.

421
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,017
You mean the--

422
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,883
The network's biggest show.

423
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:59,316
50 million viewers live.

424
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,816
You can't go higher than that.

425
01:22:04,116 --> 01:22:05,442
That's gonna be intense.

426
01:22:05,566 --> 01:22:10,433
We only have a few months to pull it off.
So are you in?

427
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:23,333
If you don't open the
door when opportunity knocks,

428
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,816
you won't get another chance.

429
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,733
You of all people know this.

430
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:41,934
Just one more day and

431
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,226
then I have a whole week off.

432
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,650
We can switch.

433
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,483
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

434
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:06,691
Just one more day, okay?

435
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,275
- <i>Yes.</i>
- She didn't respect the balance.

436
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:20,916
She's stealing more
and more time from me,

437
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:25,041
completely without
consideration of the consequences.

438
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,541
She's a selfish bitch.

439
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,275
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

440
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:31,851
Stop?

441
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,333
<i>You are the Matrix.</i>

442
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,025
<i>If you are not satisfied,</i>

443
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,791
<i>you can put an end to the experience</i>

444
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:40,058
<i>and go back to being
just you on your own.</i>

445
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,666
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

446
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,900
Will it go back to the way it was before?

447
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:49,000
<i>What has been
transferred won't come back,</i>

448
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,908
<i>but you can stop the experience.</i>

449
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,150
<i>As of now, would you like to stop?</i>

450
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:56,291
<i>To go back to being just you on your own?</i>

451
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:00,316
No.

452
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,358
No, no, no.

453
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,275
I can't stop.

454
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,642
She just--

455
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,767
I'm...

456
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,425
The balance just needs to be respected.

457
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,300
<i>So respect it.</i>

458
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:25,084
Stop it, stop it, stop it

459
01:25:25,108 --> 01:25:26,691
stop it, stop it.

460
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,066
<i>You are the winner!</i>

461
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:40,975
<i>Well,
congratulations, you've won $25,000.</i>

462
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
<i>Now you'll have one final chance</i>

463
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:45,358
<i>to answer a simple question
in our big question round</i>

464
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,458
<i>and play for $250,000.</i>

465
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,041
<i>Now you'll have just 45 seconds
on the clock</i>

466
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:57,458
<i>to give me as many
correct answers as you can--</i>

467
01:26:53,225 --> 01:26:56,208
Just a little something to keep you busy.

468
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,000
Fuck.

469
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,833
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

470
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,666
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

471
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:46,233
Are you ready? Let's welcome her...
Sue!

472
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,666
You popped up out of nowhere

473
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,875
on our screens like a tornado.

474
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,500
I don't think anybody was

475
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,666
really prepared for this whirlwind.

476
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,000
It all started with the morning show

477
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:12,116
and rumor has it that you are
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

478
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:16,108
Wait, just a moment.

479
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,833
I'm being told that you are going to host

480
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,416
the New Year's Eve show.

481
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,900
Can you confirm this?

482
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,608
Yes, that's right.

483
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:25,150
Yes, that's right.

484
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,500
Oh my God, that is huge news.

485
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,998
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

486
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,300
Where are you from?
How did you get discovered?

487
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:40,841
I want, we want to know everything.

488
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,833
Well, I mean, there's

489
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,791
really not very much to tell.

490
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,750
I'm just a girl from a

491
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,266
very small town in Indiana.

492
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,310
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

493
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,700
In fact, it's not even a town.

494
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,809
I'm not sure you could

495
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,226
really even call it a village.

496
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:03,191
It's a farm, perhaps?

497
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,875
But ever since I can remember,

498
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,625
it has always been my

499
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,108
dream to be on screen.

500
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,583
This is my dream.

501
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:20,083
As a child, I used to
put on shows for my family.

502
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,108
Mm, your family.

503
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,900
How sweet.

504
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:30,250
So, everyone is aware that

505
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,700
you replaced Elisabeth Sparkle.

506
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,500
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

507
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,150
you turned up the volume,

508
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,208
and you rocked their world.

509
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,233
Were you a fan of her show?

510
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:53,691
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

511
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,351
I can't really say that I

512
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,958
actually watched her show.

513
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,041
You do know that we're not exactly from

514
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,525
the same generation.

515
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,083
And you have to admit

516
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,566
it was a bit old-fashioned.

517
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,325
Jurassic Fitness, really.

518
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,691
- Jurassic Fitness...
- It needed a change.

519
01:30:16,983 --> 01:30:18,483
I'll fucking show you.

520
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,375
You really wanna see
some Jurassic Fitness?

521
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:26,108
You want it?

522
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:28,226
Come on, come get your

523
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,500
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

524
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,775
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

525
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,916
So, every morning, rain or shine,

526
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,416
"Sparkle Your Life" was on TV.

527
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,158
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

528
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,450
Whether I liked it or not.

529
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,517
I guess that's why you could say

530
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,300
we have some sort of connection.

531
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,775
Some sort of connection.

532
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,833
You wouldn't exist without me.

533
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,226
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum...

534
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,391
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

535
01:31:16,475 --> 01:31:18,550
for our final question.

536
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,833
The question that we ask each

537
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:24,283
and every one of our guests.

538
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,309
Okay.

539
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,666
Would you share one of your

540
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,958
little beauty secrets with us?

541
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,302
Just one little trick of yours

542
01:31:33,326 --> 01:31:36,083
that helps you look
so incredibly stunning.

543
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,116
I mean, look at you.

544
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,351
I don't know.

545
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,775
Say it!

546
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,358
Say it!

547
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,059
Let me think.

548
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,017
Say it!

549
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:46,791
Tell them who your
little beauty secret is!

550
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:49,291
I guess, I would just
show them right here.

551
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:51,025
Here's your little beauty secret.

552
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:53,358
I guess I just try to be myself.

553
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,601
To be sincere and

554
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,541
grateful for all that I have.

555
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,101
And to always remember

556
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,434
to lead with my heart.

557
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,416
<i>Oh, I'm hearing this sweetheart.
We'll be back...</i>

558
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,150
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

559
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:19,391
Stop it!

560
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,434
Stop it.

561
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:22,858
You're taking it from me.

562
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,200
That's your little secret.

563
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,441
Stop it!

564
01:32:27,465 --> 01:32:28,365
Stop it!

565
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:30,389
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

566
01:32:30,413 --> 01:32:34,313
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

567
01:32:34,337 --> 01:32:41,637
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

568
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:43,198
You have to--

569
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:46,400
Control yourself!

570
01:33:05,941 --> 01:33:07,966
I can't go back inside her.

571
01:33:12,816 --> 01:33:14,216
Oh!

572
01:33:15,783 --> 01:33:18,333
Gross old rat.

573
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:20,775
Stop it!

574
01:34:40,858 --> 01:34:42,258
Coming to bed?

575
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,425
Yes, I'll be right there.

576
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,925
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Hi, hi, this is an emergency.

577
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:56,425
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

578
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,233
Hello?

579
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,691
It's fucking 503.

580
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,684
<i>Yes.</i>

581
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,892
Fuck!

582
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,267
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

583
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:07,691
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

584
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,233
<i>It means you've reached the end.</i>

585
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,184
What do you mean the end?

586
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,608
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

587
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,434
<i>If you want more, you must</i>

588
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,858
<i>let the fluid regenerate.</i>

589
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,059
Tell me how to do it.

590
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,291
I need to stabilize myself right now.

591
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,275
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

592
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,476
Excuse me?

593
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,309
<i>The switch reboots the
fluid secretion process</i>

594
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,851
<i>so you can continue to
enjoy the experience.</i>

595
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,625
No, no, no, no, no.

596
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,608
I can't switch, I can't.

597
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,401
Especially not now.

598
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,025
<i>There is no other option.</i>

599
01:37:07,933 --> 01:37:09,333
Sue?

600
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,025
Babe?

601
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:27,233
Sue?

602
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,858
You alright?

603
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,866
Stressed out about tomorrow?

604
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,350
Babe?

605
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,675
Babe?

606
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,775
Sue?

607
01:37:57,416 --> 01:37:58,816
Is something wrong?

608
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:05,358
...a little cranky because of your
lady business?

609
01:38:10,025 --> 01:38:11,425
Sue, open the door.

610
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,291
Come on, Sue.

611
01:38:14,075 --> 01:38:15,855
Sue, it's not funny,
I need to take a piss!

612
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:18,941
Sue, open the door.

613
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,208
Open the door, Sue, come on.

614
01:38:22,632 --> 01:38:23,932
Babe.

615
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:28,256
Sue, open the door.

616
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,680
Sue!

617
01:38:39,891 --> 01:38:41,291
Sue!

618
01:38:42,515 --> 01:38:44,515
Open the door, come on!

619
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:47,039
Sue, open the door.

620
01:38:47,263 --> 01:38:49,963
Sue!
Open the door!

621
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,525
Get out!

622
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,500
What the fuck?

623
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,600
Get the fuck out!

624
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,707
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

625
01:38:59,758 --> 01:39:01,158
And leave me alone!

626
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:12,200
What the fuck?

627
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,900
<i>Yes?</i>

628
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,608
It's 503.

629
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,608
I want to stop.

630
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,008
<i>Are you sure?</i>

631
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:17,291
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

632
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,958
I want to stop!
I want to fucking stop!

633
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:23,158
I want to stop!

634
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,608
We'll deliver.

635
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:15,050
- Sue, I was...
- Fuck off!

636
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:36,733
<i>Are you sure?</i>

637
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:40,500
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

638
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,458
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

639
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,500
<i>Just on your own.</i>

640
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,750
<i>Just on your own.</i>

641
01:42:50,774 --> 01:42:52,176
<i>On your own.</i>

642
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,125
- <i>On your own.</i>
- Shut the fuck up!

643
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:56,349
<i>On your own.</i>

644
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,600
Okay.

645
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,250
I can't do this.

646
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:06,166
I need you.

647
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,583
I need myself.

648
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:18,791
You gotta get ready.
It's our big night.

649
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,291
Come on.
They're gonna love you so much.

650
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,400
Come on.

651
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:27,191
Come on.

652
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:31,666
You're the only lovable part of me.
You have to come back.

653
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:34,125
You have to come back. Come back.

654
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,000
Okay. Okay.

655
01:44:55,291 --> 01:44:56,691
Come on.

656
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,708
Come on.

657
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:10,191
Come on.

658
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:56,250
Oh, don't!

659
01:51:11,983 --> 01:51:14,092
You've got an hour and
a half in makeup... hair...

660
01:51:14,116 --> 01:51:16,316
Then we gotta get you over to
the pinning room. Get you dressed.

661
01:51:16,341 --> 01:51:18,966
After that, we have one final test on
stage for lighting and sound.

662
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:20,642
We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

663
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:21,967
- You got it? You good?
- Mmhmm.

664
01:51:21,991 --> 01:51:23,391
Okay, let's go.

665
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,057
The dress...

666
01:51:32,081 --> 01:51:33,791
...is wonderful!

667
01:51:33,815 --> 01:51:35,815
Perfect!

668
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:45,275
There you go.

669
01:51:52,383 --> 01:51:53,783
Good.

670
01:51:53,866 --> 01:51:55,466
You get the dance lights.

671
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:01,750
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

672
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,041
They need to see you on stage

673
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:31,525
to set the lights.

674
01:53:55,625 --> 01:53:57,025
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

675
01:53:57,491 --> 01:53:59,750
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

676
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,166
<i>More beautiful, more perfect.</i>

677
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,300
Sue?

678
01:54:07,833 --> 01:54:09,233
Yes, let me meet you there.

679
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,190
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

680
01:54:21,025 --> 01:54:22,313
Oh!

681
01:54:22,737 --> 01:54:24,225
Sue!

682
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:28,950
Sue?

683
01:54:32,066 --> 01:54:34,708
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

684
01:54:35,041 --> 01:54:37,708
They have been dying to meet you.

685
01:54:41,266 --> 01:54:45,475
Is everything okay?

686
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,500
So smile.

687
01:54:59,416 --> 01:55:01,500
That's what we want tonight.

688
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:06,083
Pretty girls should always smile.

689
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:22,466
Feathers, feathers, feathers!

690
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:16,066
Hey, you ready for tonight?

691
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:07,059
I just need a better version of myself...

692
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:10,166
Please give me a better
version of myself, please!

693
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:18,150
Please.

694
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:21,066
Come on.

695
01:59:15,625 --> 01:59:17,691
Looks like everything sure is in the

696
01:59:17,775 --> 01:59:19,175
right place this time.

697
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:23,500
Please say your name, age, measurements.

698
02:02:20,916 --> 02:02:24,316
Pretty girls should always smile.

699
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:01,208
At last, we were starting to worry.

700
02:03:01,275 --> 02:03:02,675
Hurry up, you're up in five.

701
02:03:21,391 --> 02:03:23,141
There she is, so beautiful.

702
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:26,350
We love you.

703
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,400
This is where you belong.

704
02:03:29,475 --> 02:03:30,884
You'll always belong here.

705
02:03:30,908 --> 02:03:32,308
We can't do without you.

706
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,150
We could never do without you.

707
02:03:34,691 --> 02:03:36,491
You're irreplaceable!

708
02:03:36,916 --> 02:03:38,516
Oh.

709
02:04:04,666 --> 02:04:05,884
Girls, come on, let's go.

710
02:04:05,908 --> 02:04:07,051
What are we waiting for?

711
02:04:07,075 --> 02:04:08,559
Okay, come on, everybody...

712
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:09,983
let's go, let's go, let's go.

713
02:04:13,241 --> 02:04:15,525
You will not be disappointed.

714
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,366
She's my most beautiful creation.

715
02:04:18,416 --> 02:04:20,283
I have shaped her for success.

716
02:04:26,175 --> 02:04:32,391
Five, four, three, two, one...

717
02:07:27,633 --> 02:07:29,233
The monster!

718
02:07:37,725 --> 02:07:39,425
Shoot the monster!

719
02:07:40,491 --> 02:07:42,091
It's a freak!

720
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,450
Shoot the monster!

721
02:07:46,983 --> 02:07:48,176
Monster!

722
02:07:59,716 --> 02:08:01,116
Freak!

723
02:08:13,158 --> 02:08:15,258
- Freak!
- Monster!

724
02:08:15,982 --> 02:08:17,482
Monster!

725
02:08:21,083 --> 02:08:22,483
It's me.

726
02:08:24,458 --> 02:08:25,858
It's me.

727
02:09:31,391 --> 02:09:33,701
Too bad her boobs aren't
in the middle of her face

728
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:35,425
instead of that nose.

729
02:09:36,816 --> 02:09:38,216
Hmm.

730
02:09:38,475 --> 02:09:39,875
Next!

731
02:09:45,783 --> 02:09:48,616
Pretty girls should always smile.

732
02:09:54,366 --> 02:09:55,766
At 50.

733
02:09:55,891 --> 02:09:57,291
It stops.

734
02:12:57,633 --> 02:12:58,984
So beautiful!

735
02:12:59,308 --> 02:13:01,100
We love you.

736
02:13:04,516 --> 02:13:05,916
You're irreplaceable!
