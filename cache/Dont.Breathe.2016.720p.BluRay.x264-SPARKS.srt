1
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:17,236
- Are you sure you have the right keys?
- Trust me, it's the right key.

2
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:20,473
- Okay, then, open the door.
- It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

3
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,940
<i>20, 19, 18...</i>

4
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,181
- Rocky, those are very slow seconds.
- Yo, kill that already.

5
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,216
- Dude, come on.
- <i>...15, 14, 13...</i>

6
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,388
- <i>...12, 11, 10, 9...</i>
- This is what I'm talking about.

7
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,825
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

8
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:49,168
All right, so, just like last time. No cash.
The total take has to fall below 10 G's.

9
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:51,182
Yeah, yeah. Whatever, judge Judy. Come on.

10
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,069
Let's do this.

11
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,390
Okay, let's get out of here.

12
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,409
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

13
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,511
Everybody's leaving.

14
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:11,267
You know, if we keep hitting houses
like today's Rocky, and...

15
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,519
Bye-bye, Detroit.

16
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,622
And <i>hola,</i> California.

17
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,993
- Wait, wait. You're going away, Rock?
- Yeah, as soon as I can.

18
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:26,531
When are you... when are you coming back?

19
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,400
Never.

20
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,504
You should come with us.

21
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,976
What? Everyone else is gone.

22
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,011
I got my dad here.

23
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,780
I'll miss you, then.

24
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,774
Dad?

25
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,110
You home?

26
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:02,127
- Yo, this is it, man?
- Minus my 40 percent.

27
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,764
- Take it or leave it.
- There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.

28
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:09,468
And what do you think, I'm going
to put it up for auction at Sotheby's?

29
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,525
Do you know how much people
on the street pay for a hot Rolex?

30
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,513
You want money? Then steal money.

31
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,568
Fucking bullshit, bro.

32
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,793
Do you want this new tip or not?

33
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,458
All right, let's hear it.

34
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,960
<i>1837 Buena Vista Street.</i>

35
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,197
House is with your dad's security company.
I already checked.

36
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,600
Guy who owns it is an Army vet loner.

37
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,103
No family. Just him in the house.

38
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,856
- That part of the city is a ghost town.
- It looks like a dump.

39
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,009
- That's actually good news.
- How's that good news?

40
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,410
The story goes...

41
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,647
some preppy girl, a few years ago,
ran over this guy's daughter.

42
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,882
- Jesus.
- The daughter dies...

43
00:06:56,982 --> 00:07:01,153
and this preppy,
rich-ass family pays him off.

44
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,457
- Gives him a big-ass sediment.
- Settlement.

45
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,458
Blow me, Your Honor.

46
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,963
All right, this guy is sitting on at least...

47
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:15,601
300 K. Boom!

48
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:20,506
I mean, if I deliver this stake
to Raul, man, he will shit his pants.

49
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,475
Do you think the money's in the house?

50
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,779
- I don't know. Let's go find out.
- Guys, no. We don't do cash.

51
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,898
Above 10 K, it's major larceny.
That means 10 years if we get caught.

52
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:32,134
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

53
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:35,137
That amount brings a serious cop presence.
They'll do an investigation.

54
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:38,106
- My dad could get in trouble.
- I knew you'd bitch out, man.

55
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,462
- I just knew it.
- Alex, if we do this right,

56
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,978
we never have to do it again.

57
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:51,453
Where are you going?

58
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,106
We're not doing this one.

59
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,875
Seriously?

60
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,362
Give us the fucking keys, man.
We'll fucking do it.

61
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,248
Alex!

62
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:38,533
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

63
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,349
Six-figure settlement.

64
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,939
All right.

65
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,150
<i>The suspect was leaving
the rear entrance of the club.</i>

66
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,518
Are you done, Diddy?

67
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,374
Be a doll and get your mother
a large four-cheese from Tony's.

68
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:06,095
- So Trevor's living here now?
- Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

69
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:09,298
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

70
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:13,168
- You have no money in here.
- You pay for it then.

71
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,804
I know you're making money.

72
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,277
I'm done.

73
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,613
Your lips look sore.

74
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:27,515
That's how you're making your cash out there?

75
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,356
Okay, Diddy, let's go for a walk.

76
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,360
I want to go to the beach.

77
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,797
Yeah, well, it's not summer, monkeyhead.

78
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,399
I want to be a surfer.

79
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:47,469
There's no surf in Michigan.

80
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,573
Not fair.

81
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,674
Yeah, well...

82
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,044
some things you can't change, baby.

83
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,383
- No matter how unfair they are.
- What a bummer.

84
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,088
Hey, you know where there is surf?

85
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,359
California.

86
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,680
What do you say you and I move
there together? Would you like that?

87
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,866
Okay. I promise, then.

88
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:40,949
- Is that a new tattoo?
- Yeah. I got it last night.

89
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,401
- Is it a...
- Ladybug.

90
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,702
Why a ladybug?

91
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,726
What?

92
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:57,199
When my dad left, my mom started drinking,

93
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,868
and she told me that...

94
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:03,037
my dad's leaving was all my fault.

95
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,644
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

96
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:14,067
She got so fed up with the crying that she
would lock me in the trunk of her car.

97
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:16,770
Sometimes for hours.

98
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,255
But there was this...

99
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:26,795
a little hole in the trunk,
and one time a ladybug flew in,

100
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:29,131
kept me company.

101
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,033
It made me feel safe.

102
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:37,177
When I reach California, I'm gonna
color this tat, and that's the last time

103
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,506
I will mark my body.

104
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,817
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

105
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,506
I know you will.

106
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,366
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

107
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,969
No people means no five-o on patrol.

108
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,737
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

109
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,607
The guy's a shut-in,
hasn't left his house in, like, five days.

110
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:16,243
I say we do it with him in the house.
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

111
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,848
- Jesus.
- Fucking A.

112
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:21,549
Get off my fucking car, dog shit!

113
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:31,459
Shit, that's our guy.

114
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,369
Wait, is he blind?

115
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:44,356
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

116
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,592
That's kind of fucked up
to rob a blind guy, isn't it?

117
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,928
Just because he's blind
don't mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

118
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,314
We do this tonight.

119
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,242
The whole neighborhood is fucking empty.

120
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,878
This guy's the last man standing.

121
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:30,285
The lights are out. He must be asleep.

122
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,521
He's blind. Lights off doesn't mean anything.

123
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,698
It's 2 a.m. He's sleeping.

124
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,760
Let's take care of that dog first, yeah?

125
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,220
Come on, man.

126
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,916
He's chewing it.
It'll be lights out in a sec.

127
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:27,142
There's four locks. You got the other keys?

128
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,977
- I only have the one.
- Fuck me.

129
00:15:32,412 --> 00:15:34,916
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

130
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:38,620
Because the money's in there,
and the paranoid fuck doesn't trust nobody.

131
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,288
Let's check for a side door?

132
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,426
Sweet dreams, pup.

133
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,085
- What's that?
- We just have to point this

134
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:47,289
in the general direction of the master
keypad, and it'll kill the alarm.

135
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,257
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

136
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:55,364
Yes. Got it.

137
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:56,965
Shit.

138
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:00,267
- What's wrong?
- It won't open.

139
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,781
This guy isn't messing around.

140
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:17,586
There's a bolt here. I can feel it.

141
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,634
- Come on.
- That's too loud. That's too loud.

142
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,023
Fucking stop.

143
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,994
What about that window?

144
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,047
There's no bars on it. I can fit in there.

145
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:32,867
What? No, we're not
sending you in there alone.

146
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:36,604
Nobody's sending me anywhere.
I'm going myself.

147
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,309
Help me up.

148
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,613
- Here, Rocky. You only got 30 seconds.
- Okay.

149
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:47,147
Here. Come here.

150
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,940
Slow your roll, fool.

151
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,708
She must have got it by now. She's fine.

152
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:58,947
- Yeah, like you really give a fuck.
- What'd you say?

153
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:03,285
That's my bitch in there.
Of course I give a fuck.

154
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,354
Let me give you some advice.

155
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:10,474
Be a good friend, and stay
in the fucking friend zone, all right?

156
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,798
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

157
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,099
Shoes off.

158
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:06,046
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

159
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:57,632
- Hey. Hey.
- Okay.

160
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,728
<i>What does a tree need to grow?</i>

161
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>Water, seeds, soil, and... sun.</i>

162
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,603
<i>Sounds good.</i>

163
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,473
Done!

164
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,579
- What the fuck, dude?
- The guy's gassed out. He's out.

165
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,915
- He's in Sleeping Beauty mode. It's fine.
- Guys.

166
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:09,357
- That's a big-ass lock.
- If the money's in the house...

167
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:12,226
probably in there.

168
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:14,428
You think you can crack it open?

169
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,796
Yeah, I got this.

170
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,674
Fuck.

171
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,563
Jesus.

172
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,385
- Do you have anything else?
- Yeah.

173
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,553
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,922
I've got a more powerful tool.

175
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:46,827
- What the hell is that?
- It's a nine millimeter Beretta.

176
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:50,431
- Gangster-style, bitches.
- Why'd you bring a gun?

177
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:54,221
This is a soldier's house, Alex. Like I'm
gonna come in here without some chrome.

178
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:57,436
- You've never shot a gun before.
- Yeah, well...

179
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:00,809
it's time to pop that cherry 'cause I'm gonna
pop that shit like a fucking tuna can.

180
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,291
Do you have any idea
what bringing a gun to a burglary means?

181
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:07,265
Yeah, it gives me a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

182
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,535
No, it means you just gave this guy
the legal right to shoot us.

183
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:14,435
- Rocky, let's go.
- No, no, no, no.

184
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,860
- I think we should stay.
- We have to leave. This is not good.

185
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,341
You don't really think just 'cause you
jerk off to her Instagram selfies

186
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:24,899
that makes you a Romeo?

187
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,267
Think again, bitch.

188
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,116
Fuck, I'm so out.

189
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:46,303
Alex.

190
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,871
Who... who's there?

191
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:18,220
Okay, man, just chill, all right?

192
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,523
Look...

193
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:25,693
I was wasted, and I wandered in,
so that was my bad, all right?

194
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:29,246
So, I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

195
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:45,046
Stay right fucking there.

196
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:47,814
Don't you fucking move.

197
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,255
Yeah, that's right. I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

198
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:58,626
You got me? Now, you do as I say, all right?

199
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,528
Don't take one single step, all right?

200
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,636
Well, do you hear me or what?

201
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:12,138
What, are you blind and deaf all of a sudden?

202
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:15,376
Motherfucker, I said stop.

203
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,778
I think you fucking heard me.

204
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:20,797
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

205
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:24,235
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man? I'll fucking shoot you.

206
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,488
Don't you fucking test me.

207
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,562
You're a fucking pussy.

208
00:28:37,331 --> 00:28:39,801
What are you gonna do now, huh?

209
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,199
You better fucking stop.

210
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,115
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

211
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:05,893
Please. Please.

212
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,830
Please, just let me walk.

213
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,632
Let me walk. Leave me alive.

214
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,437
Please.

215
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,307
How many of you are there?

216
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:23,376
- What?
- How many?

217
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:33,989
It's just me, man, all right?
It's just fucking me. Just let me go!

218
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,857
Please let me go.

219
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,299
Just let me go.

220
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:52,873
Okay. Okay.

221
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,609
Okay.

222
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,677
Okay, I swear to God..

223
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:28,842
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

224
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:30,845
Are you okay?

225
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,281
Maybe... maybe we should call
the cops before he does.

226
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,584
We'll come clean...

227
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:38,320
Wait.

228
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,188
What?

229
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:07,248
Oh, my God.

230
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:28,669
There's a lot more than 300 grand in there.
That's got to be about a million dollars.

231
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,838
Okay, let's get out of here.

232
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,183
The storm cellar door,
door's bolted from the inside.

233
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,486
That could be our way out.

234
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,787
Let's go.

235
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:42,028
Let's go.

236
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:47,200
This way.

237
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:52,039
What? Oh, shit. The phone died.

238
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,557
Fuck.

239
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:51,625
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

240
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,910
Where is it? Do you see it?

241
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:30,964
Please help me! Please!

242
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:33,566
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

243
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:38,103
Come on. Let's go.
Look, the door's right here.

244
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:47,753
What?

245
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:52,051
Rocky? Rocky.

246
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:54,388
Rocky, listen, listen. Hey, that's our exit.

247
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,357
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

248
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:06,122
She's the one who killed his daughter.

249
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:12,639
- We have to get her out of here.
- No, no, no. Rocky, we don't have time.

250
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,343
We'll get out of here, and we'll call the cops,
and then they'll come find her, all right?

251
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:03,824
The code from the safe upstairs.
Do you remember it?

252
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:08,328
- 2978, 78, 78, 2978.
- 2-9-7-8.

253
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:12,431
Okay, got them.

254
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,736
He's coming.

255
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:21,592
- Hurry up.
- One more, one more. Fuck, fuck!

256
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,578
I almost have it. Almost... okay.

257
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:27,847
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

258
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:30,348
Go, go!

259
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:45,630
- There's the door.
- There it is.

260
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:51,470
Are you okay?

261
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:00,479
What's wrong?

262
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,651
- What's wrong?
- It's locked.

263
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:07,787
You have the keys. Don't you have the keys?

264
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:12,659
- One of these should open it.
- Come on.

265
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:17,296
Come on.

266
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:19,764
- Come on.
- Okay.

267
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:26,305
Yes.

268
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,398
Come on.

269
00:46:29,502 --> 00:46:31,534
He shot her.

270
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,705
No.

271
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:14,780
No!

272
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:17,350
No!

273
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,860
My baby.

274
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:36,568
No!

275
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:39,071
No!

276
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:42,308
No!

277
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:27,119
We have to go back upstairs.

278
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:29,589
Yeah, listen. Listen, okay?

279
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:33,059
These keys, they match the locks
on the front door. All right?

280
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,962
If we get up there, we can get out.

281
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:37,730
Okay?

282
00:48:47,706 --> 00:48:49,508
Let's go now.

283
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:06,058
Shit.

284
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:25,945
Alex?

285
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:44,723
Rocky?

286
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:06,499
Please don't...

287
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:12,751
No, please...

288
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:37,476
- Rocky?
- Alex! Alex.

289
00:51:37,576 --> 00:51:41,481
Rocky, Rocky. Rocky, let's go.
Let's go. This way. This way, come on.

290
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:44,232
This way, come on, come on, come on.

291
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:46,853
- Oh, come on.
- Where am I?

292
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:50,190
Where is it? Light. I see light!

293
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,324
Come on, come on.

294
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:12,477
Don't... run.

295
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:17,950
Rocky...

296
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:22,888
go to the door.

297
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:25,357
Try the blue key.

298
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:27,659
- Do it.
- Okay.

299
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:32,030
Easy. Easy, buddy.

300
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,602
Fuck.

301
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,508
- Rocky?
- Yeah.

302
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:47,914
- Come on.
- Easy, buddy. Easy.

303
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,583
It's okay.

304
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,041
Okay, that's a good boy.

305
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:57,324
That's good. All right.

306
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,948
That's... that's good. That's good.

307
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:10,068
Run, now. Go, go, go!
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go!

308
00:53:15,207 --> 00:53:18,376
Go! There's a door! Come on!

309
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,512
Let's go.

310
00:53:21,147 --> 00:53:24,216
Hey, move this. Come on.

311
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,610
- Are those blocked up too?
- Yeah.

312
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,911
We're trapped in here.

313
00:53:57,036 --> 00:53:59,385
Rocky, the remote. Do you have it with you?

314
00:53:59,485 --> 00:54:02,304
- Come on. Okay.
- What are you doing?

315
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:05,325
I'm pressing the panic button. If I manage
to get in range, the system will call 911

316
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:07,727
- and the police will come.
- No. Wait, we can't go to jail.

317
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,431
No. No, we won't. Okay? This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

318
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:14,036
The police won't care about us
or why we were here in the first place.

319
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:18,308
- We would've helped them get this guy.
- But then we wouldn't keep the money.

320
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:22,373
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

321
00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:28,046
Go!

322
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,853
- Alex!
- What are you doing? Go!

323
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:58,483
No! No, no!

324
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:55,140
Hey!

325
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,578
Please, let me go.

326
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,883
Please, let me go!

327
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:37,356
I...

328
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,760
I understand you. She killed your daughter.

329
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,929
You wanted her to pay. I understand that.

330
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:48,066
- I won't tell anyone.
- You understand nothing.

331
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:52,471
Only a parent could know the...

332
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:56,649
bond between a father and his child.

333
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:02,548
She should have gone to prison, but...

334
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:05,517
rich girls don't go to jail.

335
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:12,023
None of this is going
to bring your daughter back.

336
01:05:17,395 --> 01:05:19,797
That's not really true.

337
01:05:25,103 --> 01:05:28,139
Cindy took my child away from me.

338
01:05:30,175 --> 01:05:32,045
I thought...

339
01:05:33,445 --> 01:05:35,513
it's only fair...

340
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:40,518
that she give me a new one.

341
01:05:44,055 --> 01:05:47,125
She was pregnant with my baby.

342
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:52,498
You killed them both.

343
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,583
- No.
- Well, they would be alive

344
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:57,752
if you hadn't broken into my home.

345
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:01,873
No.

346
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:13,417
You have to be held accountable.

347
01:08:22,647 --> 01:08:24,249
Please.

348
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,128
Please, God.

349
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:31,789
God? There's no God.

350
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:36,362
It's a joke.

351
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:39,511
It's a bad joke.

352
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:44,336
You tell me what god would allow this.

353
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,608
What are you doing?

354
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:56,331
I'm not a rapist.

355
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,784
I never forced myself on her.

356
01:09:01,185 --> 01:09:02,888
Stop.

357
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:07,726
I promised I would set her free
just as soon as she gave me a child.

358
01:09:14,298 --> 01:09:16,568
But now she's gone.

359
01:09:16,968 --> 01:09:19,203
But I'm done waiting.

360
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:23,804
No. No, no.

361
01:09:58,476 --> 01:10:01,713
- You can't do this to me.
- There's nothing a man cannot do

362
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:05,384
once he accepts the fact
that there is no god.

363
01:10:06,384 --> 01:10:09,772
No! No. No, no, no, no!

364
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,506
No!

365
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:15,693
- No!
- You're strong.

366
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:18,396
You're young.

367
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:23,515
- You'll breed well.
- No. Get away from me.

368
01:10:23,735 --> 01:10:26,606
No! No!

369
01:10:27,206 --> 01:10:29,147
No!

370
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,212
No.

371
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:36,982
Stop.

372
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:42,987
Nine months...
and I will give you your life back.

373
01:11:22,826 --> 01:11:24,663
Are you okay?

374
01:11:24,763 --> 01:11:28,467
Rocky... Rocky, did he... Did he hurt you?

375
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,201
Rocky?

376
01:11:31,802 --> 01:11:33,732
You fucking bastard.

377
01:11:48,352 --> 01:11:52,057
Hey, Rocky. Rocky.
Rocky. Rocky, it's over. Come on.

378
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:54,825
How's that taste?

379
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:02,133
- Now what?
- Come on.

380
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,511
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

381
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:15,227
Rocky, we can't involve the cops now.

382
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:19,751
If we steal a million in cash and then lead
the cops here, he'll tell them about us.

383
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:22,721
Our blood is all over.
They'll get to us in a second.

384
01:12:23,421 --> 01:12:25,756
You got what you came for.

385
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:30,495
Now take it.

386
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:33,130
Get out of my house!

387
01:12:36,884 --> 01:12:40,721
Look, he's buying our silence.
He needs us to take the money.

388
01:12:41,338 --> 01:12:43,607
It's one or the other.

389
01:12:44,975 --> 01:12:47,411
Whatever you choose, I'm with you.

390
01:12:57,307 --> 01:12:58,956
This one.

391
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:00,926
Let's get out of here.

392
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:03,900
I need to find the key. All right.

393
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:09,233
That key won't...

394
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:12,069
I got it.

395
01:14:01,151 --> 01:14:02,943
You're worthless out here.

396
01:14:07,758 --> 01:14:09,426
Fuck.

397
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:18,042
Shit!

398
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:45,122
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!

399
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:51,875
I'm sorry, Alex.

400
01:18:51,975 --> 01:18:54,231
I'm so sorry.

401
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,417
No!

402
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:11,955
No.

403
01:21:57,662 --> 01:21:59,597
What is that?

404
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:02,600
You and me at the beach.

405
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:11,627
<i>Train service to Los Angeles
