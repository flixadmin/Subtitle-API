1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,036
I want you to be alive
after your entire family is dead.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,237
That is what will hurt you the most.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,074
<i>Michael is badly wounded.
John is dead.</i>

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,391
<i>I sent a message to Aberama Gold.</i>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,312
<i>I need you back.</i>

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,517
<i>I'll help you
'cause Michael wants me to help you.</i>

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,034
Starting now.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,474
<i>The bullet's been written.</i>

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,439
Me, as the oldest brother,
will put this bullet into his head.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,991
You said you'd bring
every man and woman out on strike.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,753
Do you have a whistle?

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,672
<i>It's almost
as if you want trouble.</i>

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,719
All right,
first come, first served.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,951
Form an orderly line, all of you.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,353
All right. All right.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,760
Right!

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,078
Have your contracts of employment
in your hand!

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,197
Bring 'em in. Get in there.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,996
Get moving.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,670
On you go. Go on.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
Keep going. Keep going.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,800
You, where are you going?

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,951
- Bradley. Foreman.
- All right.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,271
You go and see that man over there. Go.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,477
- What's your name?
- Bradley. I'm the foreman.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,512
- When did you last work here?
- 1922.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,816
How many have done
this type of work before?

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,776
They're mostly farm hands
from down Worcester way.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,792
But I'll show 'em.
Hungry men learn fast.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,240
All right. On you go.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,235
Dirty scabs! Black legs!

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,077
What bastard threw that?

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,318
Get him out here!

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,031
Bring him out!

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
It wasn't me!

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Arthur!

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Oi! Enough.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,119
Come on. Get him out. Get out!

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Get out!

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,595
All right, ten more.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Two more.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
- That's it.
- Ten.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,196
Close it up.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,476
Right. Ten bob a man.

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,269
Two pound there for you.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
What about security?

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,635
Yeah, well about that.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,514
By order of the city of Birmingham
police department,

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,480
you and your ugly workforce
are now under the protection

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,717
of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,396
- Mr Gray?
- Yeah, send him in.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,950
It's your mother.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,994
Oh, fuck.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,638
I read about it in the paper.

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,434
I have a right.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,118
I'm your mum as well.

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,554
You want me to go away?

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Yes.

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,320
I'll just leave these.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,440
They're from our orchard.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,635
You used to love these.

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,232
I hope there are no worms in them.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,470
Look,

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,955
I just wanted to say
that you're welcome to come home.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,399
To get better at home.

66
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,237
I know you got bored
in the village but

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,436
we love you.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,480
And your little brother
misses playing football with you.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,635
And your dad

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,998
passed on.

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,996
He passed on peacefully in our bed.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,389
Oh, fuck.

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,552
Now go home.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,120
I'm expecting Tommy.

75
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,716
He's due here now.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
I'll go then.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,469
I'll not be in the same room
as that man.

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,071
Come on, Poll, Tommy's expecting us.

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,473
Who's with us?

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,597
Isiah and two Lee boys.

81
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,552
Ada? How long since you've had a fuck?

82
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
What?

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,238
Been nearly two years with me.

84
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,919
Over Christmas, I counted it up.

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,957
So I've made a New Year's resolution
to change the situation.

86
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,635
Oh. Anyone particular in mind?

87
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,796
Not really.

88
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,073
Just me and someone unsuitable.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,313
<i>♪ From starry eyes colliding</i>

90
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,920
<i>♪ From Mars to someone crying</i>

91
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,069
I'll sit in the front.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,832
<i>♪ No matter what I'm hiding</i>

93
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,397
<i>♪ I get lost</i>

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,519
<i>♪ But I always come around</i>

95
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,113
<i>♪ Call when you're ready
'cause I'm ready to ride ♪</i>

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,556
So this is just to make
business official.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,996
Your official return
to the company payroll.

98
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,992
So no more talk
of New Year's resolutions

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,639
or Tommy might change his mind.

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,439
What New Year's resolutions?

101
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,075
Never mind.

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,230
I think Ada's trying to
tell me to behave myself.

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,198
Yeah. Behave yourself.

104
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,074
Behave myself or what?

105
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,592
Behave myself or fucking what?

106
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,552
Okay Polly, I'll tell you the truth.

107
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,959
After your recent troubles,
Tommy asked me to keep an eye on you.

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,110
Troubles?

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,792
Whilst working for this company
I have killed a man,

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,876
I have lost a man, I have found a son,
I have nearly lost a son,

111
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,792
I have nearly lost my own life.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,312
Now I will accept my job back

113
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,154
if the terms on offer are favourable.

114
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,593
But I will not behave myself.

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,590
Sorry I'm late.

116
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,590
Where's Arthur?

117
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,157
Do I look like his fucking mother?

118
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,990
No, Linda.

119
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Why are you here?

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,439
You all right? Is Billy all right?

121
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,712
Yes. Everything's fine.

122
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,759
Well look, lovely to see you,
but I'm late for a meeting.

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,990
They can wait.

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,359
I've got something for you.

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,630
Something for a loving husband
who's been working very hard

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,754
and is under a great deal of pressure.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,198
Something to relieve his stress.

128
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Oh.

129
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,434
It's silk. From Japan.

130
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,120
Feel.

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,189
My hands are dirty.

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,436
Good.

133
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,636
Feel all of it.

134
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,230
Feel it properly.

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,876
You, uh, you want to do this here?

136
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,275
Why not? I thought you were the boss.

137
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,074
I am the fucking boss.

138
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,277
So tell me what to do, boss.

139
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Come here.

140
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Right.

141
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,873
Before we start
this extraordinary general meeting

142
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,111
of the board
of the Shelby Company Limited,

143
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,992
I'd like to note the absence
of the Deputy Vice President

144
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,514
who has not yet arrived.

145
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,439
We will continue without his presence.

146
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,032
Item number one.

147
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
The reinstatement

148
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,876
of the Shelby Company Limited
Company Treasurer.

149
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,750
The board welcomes back
the former treasurer,

150
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,560
with generously improved
terms and conditions.

151
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,634
Due to the exceptionally
difficult circumstances

152
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,359
the company now finds itself in.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,195
The proposed treasurer
will now check the terms and conditions

154
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,760
to see if they are in order.

155
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,075
Item number two.

156
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,156
During the absence of the
Company Accountant, due to ill health,

157
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,755
all responsibility for
the keeping of company accounts

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,639
pass to the head of acquisitions.

159
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,875
Item number three.

160
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,394
The Company Treasurer,
having read the terms and condition,

161
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,312
lodges a signed contract of employment

162
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,518
agreeing to the terms and conditions
with the temporary head of accounts.

163
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,920
All those in favour of the reinstatement
of Mrs Elizabeth Gray,

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,435
to the position of Shelby Company
Limited Company Treasurer,

165
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,239
please raise your hands.

166
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,873
Why goodness, thank you.

167
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,553
Any other business?

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,149
Right. I declare this extraordinary
general meeting over.

169
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,358
Now we can talk about the real business.

170
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,880
But for that we need Arthur.

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,599
Where the fuck is Arthur?

172
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,315
- Mr Shelby...
- Fuck off.

173
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,796
- They've broken into the paint shop.
- Oh, yeah?

174
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,839
They're chucking paint around.
I think they mean to set light to it.

175
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,430
Well, you deal with it, man.
I'm fucking busy!

176
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,880
What was all that about?

177
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,439
In this sinful place
there will be temptations.

178
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,472
It's my responsibility as your wife
to help you resist those temptations.

179
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,629
By putting myself between you,

180
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,991
and the devil.

181
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,397
In the words
of my sinful Catholic mother,

182
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,279
"Keep his balls empty
and his belly full."

183
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,793
God rest her soul.

184
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Mr Shelby...

185
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,398
You have to come
to the paint shop immediately. Please.

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,560
I have to go.

187
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,479
Won't be late.

188
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,836
Sorry, ladies,
there's no smoking in here.

189
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,354
Yes, love, we know.

190
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,236
All right, he's an hour late.
Fuck him.

191
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,436
This business directly affects Arthur,
but he's not here,

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
so we'll take a vote without him.

193
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,876
What business?

194
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,315
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

195
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,957
An informant told us

196
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,954
that six years ago, Luca Changretta
came from New York to Birmingham

197
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,952
to be best man at his cousin's wedding.

198
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,600
We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn on Broadgate

199
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,909
for the photographs.

200
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,719
The photographer kept the negatives.

201
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,156
I persuaded him to give us copies.

202
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,472
And to enlarge this one.

203
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,232
That is Luca Changretta.

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,836
I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

205
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,794
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

206
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,873
which means the chances are
they are the men who come to kill us.

207
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,030
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

208
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,919
Then we put it about
that there's a reward for information.

209
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,911
We also propose that we give a copy
of this photograph to Mr Aberama Gold.

210
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,272
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

211
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,794
Tradition will just fuck us up.

212
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,070
We should wait for Arthur.

213
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,913
Arthur's not here, Ada.

214
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,037
We need Luca Changretta dead. That's it.

215
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,816
Dropping the law of the bullet

216
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,072
is part of the process of modernisation
that I was working on before I...

217
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,840
Before I was executed.

218
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,869
You weren't executed, Poll.

219
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,389
What did you call me?

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,071
Right. Let's take a vote.
I'll deal with Arthur.

221
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
All those in favour

222
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,836
of giving the photographs to Mr Gold,
raise your hand.

223
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,157
Then it will be done.

224
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,391
- Mum...
- Oh, "Mum" now, is it?

225
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,593
I smelt perfume when I came in here.

226
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,114
Yeah, it was the flowers.

227
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,989
Right, that's it.

228
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,673
Who came in here, Michael?

229
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,310
The truth is, Polly,
the woman that raised him came in here.

230
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,840
She has every right to come in here.

231
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,031
She brought him fucking apples
and she left.

232
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
We are in the middle
of a vendetta and Arthur is missing.

233
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,555
We need to find him.

234
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,836
Concentrate on what unites us.

235
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,360
- This is all temporary.
- Yeah, temporary. Right.

236
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,760

What is this, a party, eh?

247

251

- Please.
- Don't fucking move.

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,472

- Mr Shelby, please, please, please.

257
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,358
Now get the fuck out!

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,711

Shh.

262
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,874
Where are you going? Come here.

263
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,599
Fucking hit man, are you?

264
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,831
Eh? Is that what you are?

265
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,635
Arthur Shelby, eh?

266
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,879
Let's see who wanted you.

267
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,635
What about...

268
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,998
What about fucking John Shelby?

269
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Huh?

270
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,638
John.

271
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Thank you.

272
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,279
Send my guests in.

273
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,272
You wire Polo
and let him tell the family.

274
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,554
He has four kids.

275
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,200
Don't you two have
any other clothes to wear?

276
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Huh?

277
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,440
Look at me.

278
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Huh?

279
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm here as a lover of theatre.

280
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,712
They kill two of our men...

281
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,232
You complain about your fucking belly.

282
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,996
Luca.

283
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,234
Luca.

284
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,476
- With respect.
- "With respect"?

285
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,599
You raised...

286
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,229
"With respect"?

287
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,593
Open your mouth.

288
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,875
- Come on...
- Open your fucking mouth!

289
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,033
You fucking dress like them.

290
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,835
You eat like them.

291
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,314
You don't fucking talk to me
about, "With respect".

292
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,709
Sit down.

293
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,469
What do you have?

294
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,319
Arthur Shelby killed her son
in a boxing ring four years ago.

295
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,755
She would do that for us?

296
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,035
Okay.

297
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,589
Okay.

298
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,478
Anyone seen Arthur?

299
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,674
Anyone seen Arthur? Eh?

300
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,469
In your office, Tom.

301
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,416
If you're not going to show up
for a family meeting,

302
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,750
let someone know.
We thought you were dead.

303
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,036
There's 15 fucking Italians out there.

304
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,318
No there's not, there's 13.

305
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,833
I just killed two of them.

306
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,237
Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

307
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,797
I did it.

308
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,439
Me.

309
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,079
Your brother.

310
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,791
Not fucking Aberama Gold
or his punch drunk son.

311
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,109
But me.

312
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,352
Even if you don't trust me no more.

313
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,511
What the fuck are you talking about?
Arthur?

314
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,037
I got cleaned up at Ada's.

315
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,360
She told me.

316
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,393
You took a vote in my absence.

317
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,040
All right, calm down
and tell me about the men you killed.

318
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,033
You put my job out for contract.

319
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,190
Arthur...

320
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,830
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make it
my fucking job anyway.

321
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,037
Because this was all my fault.

322
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,717
It was me that shot the old man.

323
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,638
- Yeah, out of mercy.
- Aye.

324
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,999
NowJohn's dead.

325
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,991
He's dead because of me
and I'm gonna make it right.

326
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,599
Arthur, wait.

327
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,514
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

328
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,716
Through the back fucking door

329
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,711
that was supposed to be
locked and bolted.

330
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,709
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

331
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,154
Yeah. Why don't you sit down
and work it out for yourself.

332
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,672
Take a fucking vote.

333
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,238
Who is this little bear?

334
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,312
Yes. Eh?

335
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,998
Are you all right?

336
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,758
Daddy's home, isn't he?

337
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,200
Yeah, I'm all right.

338
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,078
Look, Daddy's home.

339
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,156
How's Polly?

340
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,154
Is she all right?

341
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,838
Oh, go on, Linda.

342
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,836
I mean, it was her idea,
wasn't it? Hmm?

343
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,914
The Japanese silk? Hmm?

344
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,639
I'll put him to bed.

345
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,394
You kept me away from that
fucking meeting to stop me from voting.

346
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,756
- Here we go.
- It was Polly's idea, wasn't it?

347
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,479
Eh?

348
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,031
You know what I am, don't ya?

349
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,076
I'm a working man. Yeah.

350
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,837
Fucking working man.

351
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,594
Fucking...

352
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,879
Who's lost his job.

353
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,077
Is that what I am, Linda?
Is that what I am, eh?

354
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
I don't want you dead.

355
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,758
Polly doesn't want you dead.

356
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,794
Let Mr Gold do the killing for money.

357
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,113
It's the modern way, Arthur.

358
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,473
Watch.

359
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,550
Hmm? Hmm?

360
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,354
What are you doing?

361
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,638
Now fire it into the fireplace.

362
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,389
Please.

363
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,797
- All right.
- Fire it.

364
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,514
Get rid of it.

365
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,953
Then we'll go to bed.

366
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,519
We'll do anything you like.

367
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,916
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

368
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Fire it.

369
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,794
Ah!

370
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,312
You go tell Polly

371
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,469
there are rules between a man and woman.

372
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,793
There are rules.

373
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,552
That I have to do this.

374
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,318
I have to do it.

375
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,316
John wants me to do it, Linda.

376
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,480
My brother...

377
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,799
And I'm gonna do it!

378
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,632
Was it fear or was it hatred?

379
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,959
Was what fear or hatred?

380
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,235
Isiah...

381
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,433
You had a one way ticket to Glasgow
in your pocket.

382
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,836
Your wife and kids left three days ago.

383
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,238
Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

384
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,197
Was it fear of the Italians

385
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,069
or hatred of us

386
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,231
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

387
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,717
I didn't unlock any door.

388
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,038
Here, have a drink.

389
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,673
You're gonna need it.

390
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,830
Thirty five Drumcree Street,
Parkhead, Glasgow...

391
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,799
Please, please, please, please...

392
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,672
We have allegiances
with Catholic gangs in that city.

393
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,151
Your family are safe
only at my discretion.

394
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,634
Now, explain to me why you were
catching the midnight train to Glasgow.

395
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,714
You mean you don't know?

396
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,672
I run a factory
full of black leg non-union labour.

397
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,358
I live in a street
full of men laid off or on strike.

398
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,336
Look at the photograph, Mr Devlin,
and tell me who are the men

399
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,113
- that contacted you.
- No.

400
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,476
No, you listen to me.

401
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,713
I get spat at, windows smashed,
petrol on the curtains.

402
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,998
But for fear of you
I clock in every fucking morning.

403
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,957
And today, two men are shot
and burnt on my shift.

404
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,919
And you ask me why I'm getting on
the midnight train to Glasgow.

405
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,472
Who else has the keys to that door?

406
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,755
They hang on a hook inside my office.

407
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,077
Today I left the office unlocked.

408
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,038
- Why?
- Because I forgot.

409
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,795
Because I left in a hurry.

410
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,475
Because there were men
trying to set fire to the factory.

411
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,872
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

412
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,512
You have a lot of enemies.

413
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,032
Communists. Italians.

414
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,037
Before the factory came out on strike,

415
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,354
I heard word that two Italians attended
a communist party meeting in Stechford.

416
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,233
They hardly spoke English.

417
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,751
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory,

418
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,275
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

419
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,514
Mr Shelby, my train leaves at 12:00.

420
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,037
It's just gone 11:00.
I can still make it.

421
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,437
Please. For my kids.

422
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,040
I need you here.

423
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,511
Isiah, get three of our men
with police badges

424
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,239
to watch Mr Devlin's house.

425
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,039
Mr Shelby, please...

426
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,634
Our friends in Glasgow
will take care of your family.

427
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,233
For the curtains.

428
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,590
Before you, I was
an ordinary working man.

429
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,191
Yeah, and now you're one of us.

430
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,836
<i>♪ Blackbird, blackbird
Singing the blues all day</i>

431
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,671
<i>♪ Right outside of my door... ♪</i>

432
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,756
- Who is it?
- Tommy Shelby.

433
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,110
- Is this union business?
- Yes.

434
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,635
So conduct it in the proper place
at the proper time.

435
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,999
I've come to make an improved offer.

436
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,360
I heard music.

437
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,113
What's your improved offer?

438
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,190
- Do I not get a drink?
- No.

439
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,320
Have you ever seen any of the men
in this photograph before?

440
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,550
What?

441
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,519
You're a member
of the Stechford Communist party.

442
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,794
I'm told two Italian men
attended a meeting recently.

443
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,199
Can you see either of the men
in this picture?

444
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,956
As the Small Heath coordinator

445
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,231
of the Organisation
for the Maintenance of Supplies

446
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,471
I have also been sworn in
as a Special...

447
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,556
We have reason to believe
that outside agitators from overseas

448
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,712
are attempting to foment trouble
in our factories

449
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,589
in advance of a General Strike
which could take place at any moment.

450
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,878
This is a matter of national security.

451
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,594
May I look at your badge?

452
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,913
Yes.

453
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,280
What would you like to drink, Constable?

454
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,556
Whisky.
And, actually, it's Sergeant.

455
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,119
I only have beer. Times are hard.

456
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,595
How long has it been since you've had
a bottle of M&B bitter?

457
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,990
Help yourself.

458
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,269
Have a seat.

459
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,395
You know, when this business began,
I did some research on you.

460
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,874
It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

461
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,269
KittyJurossi.

462
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,839
You were in love with Kitty's sister.
Greta Jurossi. Before the war.

463
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,593
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

464
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,712
Her parents were Italian.

465
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,916
They didn't approve of a Watery Lane
Gypsy, but you won them over.

466
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,953
With your charm. Sweetness.

467
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,430
Very, very thorough research.

468
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,357
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption.

469
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,235
And Kitty said you were at her bedside
for three months.

470
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,152
Every day, holding her hand.

471
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,757
And after she died you went away to war.

472
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,674
Kitty said that the sweet boy who left
never came back.

473
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,594
No one came back.

474
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,640
Here's the funniest thing.

475
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,589
She said in those days
you believed in things.

476
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,315
In justice. Fairness.

477
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Once you saw a man beating his horse
and you fought him.

478
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,472
He was twice your size but you beat him.

479
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,313
And then you beat him with his own whip.

480
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,671
Kitty always liked to tell tall tales.

481
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,279
She's a party member now.

482
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,677
She swears
before you enlisted in the army

483
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,036
you joined the Communist party yourself.

484
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,560
Is that true?

485
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,478
You know, when I was at the door,
I saw you through the curtains.

486
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,359
You were dancing alone.

487
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,236
I've also done my research.

488
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,073
Your sweetheart was at Passchendaele.

489
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,711
When he came back,
he was listed among the shell shocked.

490
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,877
Blew his own fucking brains out.

491
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,513
I don't know any men in the photo.

492
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,315
You haven't looked.

493
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,789
This afternoon two men came into
my factory and tried to kill my brother.

494
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,119
I believe a Stechford Communist party
member let him in.

495
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,197
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

496
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,195
Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

497
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,236
I should send you her love
from the good old days

498
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,640
and give you this.

499
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,000
Greta Jurossi and Tommy Shelby
in Blackpool.

500
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,759
Do you recognise the boy
in the photograph?

501
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,074
I'll leave that here.

502
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,358
Apologies for interrupting your dance.

503
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,477
<i>♪ I wish</i>

504
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,275

507

00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,149

510
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,796
Arthur... I need you to listen to me.

511
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,112
I need you to listen to me, Arthur...

512
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,833
The world is changing.

513
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,679
Listen to me, Arthur.

514
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,714
And listen to the sweet voice
ofJesus...

515
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,110
<i>♪ I wish... ♪</i>

516
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,391
- Finn?
- It came from Arthur's house.

517
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,429
Arthur.

518
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,195
Arthur.

519
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,589
Where is he?

520
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,790
Arthur.

521
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,195
He fired the bullet.

522
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,359
Linda...

523
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,029
Said it's the modern way, Tom...

524
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,080
It's the modern way.

525
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,318
Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,640
Yeah, it's all right.

527
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,280
It's all right, brother.

528
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,916
You did well.

529
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,753
God spoke to him, not me.

530
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,475
What are you doing here?

531
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,712
On Mondays, I do the inventory.

532
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,753
Make sure nobody's dipping their hand.

533
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,435
Well, it's my job now.

534
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,036
I'm back.

535
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,720
And there's gonna be nobody
dipping their hand with me here,

536
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,157
not unless they want it cut off.

537
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,520
I said to Arthur
while I'm stuck in this fucking place

538
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,273
I want something to keep my mind busy.

539
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,159
What? You're going to take bets?

540
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,671
I have always been able to do addition
and subtraction without pen and paper.

541
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,674
But I'll need a telephone.

542
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,672
Apparently we have special clients
who take bets by telephone.

543
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,830
Linda?

544
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,394
This is a betting shop.

545
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,076
Look.

546
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,836
Arthur said yes. Tommy said yes.

547
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,435
But did God say yes?
Gambling is a sin, Linda.

548
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,513
It's not me that's doing the gambling.

549
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,680
I'm just taking the bets.

550
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,872
The rule is that door should always
remain locked until 9:00 A. M.

551
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,791
Right. Boy. Boy, where are you going?

552
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,354
Well, Arthur's not coming in today.
He's taking the day off. So...

553
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,120
So what?

554
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,954
So today, Tommy said that I'm in charge.

555
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,834
Sorry, you're in charge?

556
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,955
Yeah. That's what he said.

557
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,353
All right, sweetheart.

558
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,389
Ladies?

559
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,672
Let's give our boss a first day

560
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,754
that he'll never forget.

561
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,952
Sending Finn to the shop was a mistake.

562
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,759
They've already found out
he's a virgin

563
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,071
and they're arranging a girl for him,
this afternoon.

564
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,356
I thought Linda was there.

565
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,998
She is. She loved the idea.

566
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,197
I know. She even swears now.

567
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,436
"Fuck".

568
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,074
Sounds funny coming from her.

569
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,311
Polly says in the end
we all turn into our mother.

570
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,992
Well, keep an eye on her.

571
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
Hmm.

572
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,357
The whore watching the Madonna.

573
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,119
Does Finn know what they have planned?

574
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,554
No.

575
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,994
Do they have someone?

576
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,353
Yes. A girl I used to work with.

577
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,718
- Is she nice?
- No.

578
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,230
She's from Aston.

579
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,439
They're paying her out of petty cash.

580
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,994
Right, well, call 'em

581
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,519
and tell them to pay extra

582
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,755
and get someone nice.

583
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,358
Nice women don't do that sort of thing.

584
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,036
Yes, they do. What about you?

585
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,480
I mean in the past. Come on.

586
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,440
Where are we going?

587
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,796
Somewhere I've not been in a long time.

588
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,598
Are we expecting somebody?

589
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,872
Tommy, I'm fucking freezing here.

590
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,673
We used to come here.

591
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,515
She'd wait for hours for me,

592
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,159
when I couldn't make it.

593
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,353
And I'd wait for her

594
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,351
if her family kept her in.

595
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,719
Who?

596
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,674
Some girl.

597
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,597
Some girl before France.

598
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,794
I've not been back here since.

599
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,959
But I wanted to come here with you.

600
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,672
Are you kissing her or me?

601
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,118
You.

602
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,512
I want Shelby Company Limited

603
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,798
to increase non-taxable
charitable contributions

604
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,759
to local charities
by twenty-five percent

605
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,076
as of now.

606
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,073
And I'm gonna build

607
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,470
two new institutes
for destitute children.

608
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,029
One in Saltley, one in Digbeth.

609
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,598
I've already identified the buildings.

610
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,239
Two former workhouses.

611
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,437
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

612
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,269
All right, come on, let's go.

613
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,955
Why?

614
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,833
Because I promised someone
I'd change the world.

615
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,672
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

616
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,359
Yeah, I know.

617
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,275
Come on.

618
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,989
Finn? Come here.

619
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,000
- How was your day?
- Yeah, it was okay.

620
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,034
Good man. Well done.

621
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,000
No trouble?

622
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,117
No. No trouble.

623
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,714
And she looked after you?

624
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,232
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

625
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,880
Not when they don't even want to do it,

626
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,675
except for the money.

627
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,759
Everything's for the money, Finn.

628
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,555
Yeah, I know. But...

629
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,199
She said, "Be a man."

630
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,630
And were you a man?

631
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,756
Yeah.

632
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,950
But then I apologised to her.
Because she looked so tired.

633
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,873
Sit down, Finn.

634
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,672
Right, listen to me, Finn.

635
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,436
She was right.

636
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,796
You need to be a fucking man.

637
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,553
People get tired.

638
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,633
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

639
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,316
I don't go round apologising.
Do I?

640
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,676
No.

641
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,070
There's an empty space here
to be filled.

642
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,829
Do you understand?

643
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,960
- Yeah.
- So...

644
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,154
Be a fucking man.

645
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,313
Okay, Tom.

646
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,878
- Champagne, please.
- Of course.

647
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
Madam...

648
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,872
Women alone are not allowed at the bar.

649
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,794
Will someone be joining you?

650
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,160
What do you think?

651
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,759
This is public enough, no?

652
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,320
Yes.

653
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
So?

654
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,831
The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds.

655
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,276
And I will ask you
to spare Finn and Arthur.

656
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,317
In return for what?

657
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,835
Tommy Shelby.

658
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,554
And, uh, why should I trust you?

659
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,513
Because you know our history.

660
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,799
You know what happened between us.

661
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,996
You are an unlikely Cassius.

662
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
Mmm...

663
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,360
You know, my mother...

664
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,993
My mother knew your mother.

665
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,631
She taught her how to read.

666
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,518
Did she tell you
that John and Arthur spared her life?

667
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,114
When Tommy wanted her dead.

668
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,794
Yeah.

669
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,072
And now she's given me
the information about you people.

670
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,235
So Tommy Shelby was right.

671
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,714
His, uh, ruthlessness

672
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,318
was justified.

673
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,599
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

674
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,792
John was a good boy.

675
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,760
Arthur tries.

676
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,478
Tommy's different.

677
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,038
You take Tommy. Spare the rest.

678
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,680
You know,

679
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,395
my mother used to say this about you.

680
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,590
She said, "That Polly Gray",

681
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,032
"that child would never
let go of a grievance."

682
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,352
And she loves to dance.

683
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,479
What do you say, huh?

684
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,718
You want to dance?

685
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,352
I don't dance any more.

686
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,192
Well, that's a shame.

687
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,273
'Cause you're dancing with me.
