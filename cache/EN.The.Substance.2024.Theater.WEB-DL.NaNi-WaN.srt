00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,677
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:53,204
<i>We love you</i>

4
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:54,694
<i>Please</i>

5
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:55,978
<i>Over here</i>

6
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,131
<i>We love you</i>

7
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,963
<i>Marko!</i>

8
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,223
<i>Nice to meet you, grandma.</i>

9
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,225
<i>My favorite.</i>

10
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,510
<i>Want to get something to eat?</i>

11
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,630
<i>Yeah, get a pretzel or something.</i>

12
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:15,855
<i>Remember her?</i>

13
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,128
<i>She was in that movie...</i>

14
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,341
<i>Forget.</i>

15
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:25,836
<i>We're going to have to let her know we're
going to be late.</i>

16
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,269
<i>Yeah, that was too long.</i>

17
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,812
<i>I let her know you're taking time.</i>

18
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,970
<i>Daddy, he owes me 20 bucks.</i>

19
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,643
<i>He's floating!</i>

20
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,951
<i>He's got you in the road!</i>

21
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:51,918
<i>Rubble!</i>

22
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:55,520
<i>Shit!</i>

23
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:27,171
You got it!

24
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,348
Feel that power, lady!

00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,437

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,215

Come on!

30

Kick!

32
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,389
Kick!

33
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,993
Oh yeah, you got it!

34
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,620
Square!

35
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,980
Think about those bikini vibes.

36
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,906
You want to... look like a
giant jellyfish on the beach?

37
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:54,322
Come on!

38
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:55,815
Cross!

39
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:57,600
Push!

40
00:04:58,573 --> 00:04:59,419
Kick!

41
00:04:59,419 --> 00:04:59,978
Come on!

42
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,052
You got it!

43
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:02,649
Hang in there, ladies!

44
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,314
You got it!

45
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,073
You got it!

46
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,679
Whoo!

47
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,760
Great work, all ladies!

48
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,786
I hope I see you next week

49
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:18,009
for Sparkle Your Life.

50
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,232
We're gonna work on the lateral abs,

51
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,848
you know, the most
difficult part to sculpt.

52
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,359
But in the meantime,

53
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,049
take care of yourself.

54
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,563
We've worked on this is your one great

55
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:32,950
great job, ladies!

56
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,339
You got it!

57
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,877
Happy birthday, thank you.

58
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:00,402
Happy birthday.

59
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,278
Oh, thank you.

60
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,053
Happy birthday.

61
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,466
Thank you.

62
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:09,132

WANHABIT.COM

65
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:27,381
I don't care if every fucking young girl

66
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:28,704
in this fucking town

67
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,217
in the next few weeks.

68
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:33,124
Look, I made it simple.

69
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:35,462
We need her young.

70
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,541
We need her hot.

71
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:39,121
We need her now.

72
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,063
How the old bitch has been able to stick

73
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,303
around for this long.

74
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,748
That's the fucking mystery to me.

75
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,263
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

76
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,584
When was that back in the 30s?

77
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,938
For King Kong?

78
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:59,046
No, I don't give a

79
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,123
fuck what we promised her.

80
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,533
This is network TV,

81
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:04,975
not a fucking charity.

82
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,260
Find me somebody new.

83
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:09,801
Now.

84
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,533
Hey, did you know that a woman's

85
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:14,786
fertility starts to

86
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,801
decrease by the age of 25?

87
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:18,369
How old is Jennifer?

88
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,717
You better get busy.

89
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,718
ELISABETH

90
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,111
It's like when you see

91
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,889
someone fart on screen.

92
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,032
People just love that.

93
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,991
I mean, that's just the way it is.

94
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:12,357
So you know what I mean?

95
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:13,845
People are just people.

96
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:18,053
And I have to give people what they want.

97
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,970
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

98
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:23,638
And people always ask for something new.

99
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,468
Renewal is inevitable.

100
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:34,079
And at 50, well, it stops.

101
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,322
What stops?

102
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:37,878
What?

103
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:39,818
What stops?

104
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,575
Um, you know, the um...

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,807
The um...

106
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,013
The um...

107
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:53,873
Oh, George!

108
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,181
Oh, oh!

109
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:57,184
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

110
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:58,227
Harvey!

111
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:01,796
George, those ratings are insane!

112
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,277
You're a genius!

113
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,335
Oh, what a mess. You're a genius.

114
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,779
That's why you'd be drinking.

115
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,291
Oh, that's hilarious.

116
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:41,016
WITH TOOTH BRIGHT
YOU GOT IT

117
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:01,574
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

118
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:02,200
because we have

119
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:03,616
X-rayed you from head to toe,

120
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,408
and you don't have so

121
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:05,408
much as a crap molar.

122
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:08,158
So, you are good to go.

123
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,741
Uh, vaccination, okay?

124
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,711
Not going on a vacation.

125
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:15,666
By the way, I just want to

126
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,936
say, my wife is a huge fan.

127
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:23,983
Um, blood type...

128
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,963
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

129
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,140
Happy birthday.

130
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:39,381
Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.

131
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,447
I, uh, had to have a...

132
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:43,455
Bye.

133
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:52,351
One moment.

134
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,616
It's just one last exam to perform.

135
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:57,966
I thought he said I was good to go.

136
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,441
Is there a problem?

137
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,743
No, it's perfect.

138
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,464
You're a good candidate.

139
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,015
I mean, are you good to go?

140
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:31,723
I wish you the best.

141
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,671
THE SUBSTANCE

142
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,932
909-555-0199

143
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,566
IT CHANGED MY LIFE

144
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,333
Lizzie?

145
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:13,369
Lizzie Sparkle?

146
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,547
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

147
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:18,885
Fred!

148
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,436
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

149
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:27,852
Oh, Fred, of course.

150
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:29,292
You haven't changed a bit.

151
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:32,520
You're still the most beautiful girl in

152
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:33,650
the whole wide world.

153
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,670
You know, I followed your career.

154
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,569
What a success.

155
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,433
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

156
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:40,820
Wow.

157
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,456
Hey, why don't we go out

158
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:44,779
maybe for a drink sometime.

159
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:45,779
Now that we're, you know

160
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,925
Reconnected?

161
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:47,838
Um...

162
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:50,566
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

163
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,333
You're super busy.

164
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:51,905
But you know what?

165
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:54,322
Why don't you give me your card?

166
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,780
I mean, you never help.

167
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,489
Um, sure, what I...

168
00:12:58,614 --> 00:12:59,072
This will do.

169
00:12:59,489 --> 00:12:59,697
Oh.

170
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,632
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

171
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:02,571
They're a disaster.

172
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,061
Oh, God.

173
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:07,571
What is that?

174
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:11,320
There.

175
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:15,278
Now you've got it.

176
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:35,169
THANK YOU FOR ALL THESE YEARS WITH US.
YOU WERE AMAZING!

177
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:52,716

178
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,331
THE SUBSTANCE

179
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,063
Have you ever dreamt of a

180
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,605
better version of yourself?

181
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,685
Younger.

182
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,380
More beautiful.

183
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,390
More perfect.

184
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:24,172
One single injection unlocks your DNA,

185
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,183
starting a new cellular

186
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,561
division that will release

187
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,811
another version of yourself.

188
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:31,987
This is...

189
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,309
THE SUBSTANCE.

190
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,669
You are the matrix.

191
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:38,901
Everything comes from you.

192
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,768
And everything is you.

193
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,567
This is simply a

194
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,208
better version of yourself.

195
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,942
You just have to share.

196
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,437
One week for one

197
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,335
and one week for the other.

198
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:54,496
A perfect balance of seven days each.

199
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,892
The one and only thing not to forget.

200
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:58,038
YOU

201
00:14:58,122 --> 00:14:58,957

202
00:14:59,041 --> 00:14:59,840

You're hired.

270
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:52,590
We want a
show that's just like you.

00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:54,197
Beautiful and happy.

272

I'm gonna let you organize

Isabella?

276

Who has time to say that?

278
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:14,214
We're gonna make you Cindy.

279
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:16,413
It's shorter, it's better.

280
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:20,337
So, I'm gonna let you organize
everything else with Cindy.

00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,707
Oh, um, before you go,

282
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,417
I just have to mention

283
00:39:26,076 --> 00:39:27,876
a small scheduling issue.

284
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,604
I have to be out of town every other week

285
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,723
to take care of my mother.

286

Who's very sick.

287
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:49,070

288
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:53,646
and we will work around
any mother, brother, fucking sick,

289
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:55,950

00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,025

291
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:58,458

292
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:04,141

00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,823
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

345
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:50,776
She moved out.

346
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,282
I'm the new tenant.

347
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:54,513
Sue.

348
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:56,934
Oliver.

349
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:58,165
Oliver.

350
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:00,075
Oliver.

351
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,719
You wanted to complain about something?

352
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:04,534
Oliver?

353
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:06,211
What?

354
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,448
No.

355
00:50:08,628 --> 00:50:10,168
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

356
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:12,681
I think it's like awesome
when there's stuff...

357
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:14,573
going on in the building,
you know what I mean?

358
00:50:16,844 --> 00:50:19,336
Um, I'm actually,

359
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:22,502
quite handy if you ever need,

360
00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:26,983
need me to be of aid in any way.

361
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:29,006
I got a sack of tools

362
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:31,773
and I got a big hammer.

363
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:35,409
You know what I mean.

364
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:40,261
Anyways, I live right here,

365
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:42,053
so you know where to find me.

366
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:42,843
Anytime.

367
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:45,086
Day or night.

368
00:50:45,737 --> 00:50:46,557
Later.

369
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,857
PUMP IT UP

370
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:42,413
Hi everybody.

371
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:47,176
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

372
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:48,327
Are you ready?

373
00:52:48,662 --> 00:52:49,460
Let's go.

374
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,584
Thank you so much everybody.

375
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:22,482
I'll see you next week.

376
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:27,918
And in the meantime,

377
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:30,793
take care of yourself.

378
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:38,333
Courtesy!

379
00:54:42,476 --> 00:54:45,131
Wonderful, wonderful.

380
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,346
That's what I said talking about

381
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:48,421
Yes.

382
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:09,529
PUMP IT UP

383
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:06,601
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

384
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:13,487
Don't eat too fast.

385
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,339
Are you all right?

386
00:58:32,295 --> 00:58:33,628
Yes, I'll be right back.

387
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:11,234
Are you all right?

388
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,537
What did you do?

389
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:01,271
You've seen me the more
beautiful than before.

390
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:41,407
No.

391
01:01:11,989 --> 01:01:14,936
TOO DRUNK TO TAKE THE BIKE HOME,
KEEP AN EYE ON HER!

392
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:15,966
TROY
325-555-0199

393
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:33,887
PUMP IT UP

394
01:02:35,236 --> 01:02:35,763
Yes.

395
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:38,040
Yes, hi.

396
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:40,552
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

397
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:48,053
I'm 503.

398
01:02:48,844 --> 01:02:49,689
Yes.

399
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:52,433
Yes, hi.

400
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:57,356
There's been a slight
misuse of the substance.

401
01:02:57,674 --> 01:03:03,752
A few extra hours were accidentally used

402
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:05,438
causing...

403
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:08,169
 an alteration

404
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:11,750
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

405
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:15,846
What has been used on one
side is lost on the other side.

406
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:17,442
There's no going back.

407
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:27,304
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

408
01:03:27,723 --> 01:03:30,134
And obviously she was drunk.

409
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,818
Remember there is no she and you.

410
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:34,057
You are one.

411
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:35,695
Respect the balance

412
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:38,311
and you won't have
any more inconveniences.

413
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:18,131
Don't you know

414
01:04:21,088 --> 01:04:21,963
Don't you know

415
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:24,463
You got to pump it up

416
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:25,630
Don't you know

417
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:29,739
Don't you know

418
01:04:30,306 --> 01:04:31,879
You got to pump it up

419
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:39,710
You got to pump it up

420
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:48,788
You got to pump it up

421
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:55,492
You got to pump it up

422
01:05:15,603 --> 01:05:17,877
Sue!

423
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:19,385
Sue?

424
01:05:20,227 --> 01:05:21,908
I just saw you on TV.

425
01:05:22,342 --> 01:05:24,019
Holy moly.

426
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:27,303
Makes me want to join your class.

427
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:28,414
Hey, you don't give

428
01:05:28,498 --> 01:05:29,660
private lessons, do you?

429
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:37,424
Hey, what about a
drink at my place tonight?

430
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:40,626
Come on, don't be shy.

431
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:44,447
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

432
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,953
All right, take your
time, but it's a date.

433
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:53,773
You know, pump it up

434
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:55,679
You got to pump it up

435
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,672
You know, pump it up

436
01:05:58,119 --> 01:05:59,744
You got to pump it up

437
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:11,532
YOUR REFILL KIT
HAS BEEN DELIVERED

438
01:06:11,616 --> 01:06:13,485
TO YOUR DEPOSIT BOX

439
01:06:37,656 --> 01:06:37,822
Sue.

440
01:07:24,017 --> 01:07:24,984
What can I get you?

441
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:30,593
Moka Latte.

442
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:41,517
It's long, isn't it?

443
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,381
Excuse me?

444
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:50,214
Seven days.

445
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,227
Did you follow me here?

446
01:08:23,413 --> 01:08:27,765
I was just curious to find out
how things were going for you.

447
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:33,501
Each time you feel a little more lonely,

448
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:35,230
 don't you think?

449
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,292
I don't know what you were talking about.

450
01:08:40,552 --> 01:08:41,466
I'm fine.

451
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:44,211
Everything's fine.

452
01:08:44,923 --> 01:08:48,074
It gets harder each time to remember

453
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,560
that you still deserve to exist.

454
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:59,789
That this part of
yourself is still worth something

455
01:08:59,872 --> 01:09:05,092
that you still matter.

456
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:10,913
Has she started yet?

457
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:15,167
Eating away at you?

458
01:09:32,538 --> 01:09:33,385
Fuck!

459
01:09:33,572 --> 01:09:34,434
Watch out!

460
01:09:43,469 --> 01:09:43,951
What?

461
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:55,486
Hey!

462
01:09:56,097 --> 01:09:56,949
Move!

463
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,612
You're still the most beautiful girl

464
01:10:29,695 --> 01:10:31,424
in the whole wide world.

465
01:10:41,212 --> 01:10:41,858
Hello?

466
01:10:42,396 --> 01:10:43,860
Hi, Fred.

467
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:45,231
It's Lizzie.

468
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:49,132
Hello?

469
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:51,876
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

470
01:10:52,575 --> 01:10:53,075
Oh.

471
01:10:53,339 --> 01:10:53,888
Wow.

472
01:10:54,241 --> 01:10:55,346
Wow, wow.

473
01:10:55,519 --> 01:10:58,005
I thought I'd never
hear from you again after...

474
01:10:58,089 --> 01:11:00,066
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

475
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:03,603
I just, I've just
been really busy lately.

476
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:07,700
So listen, I was thinking that

477
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:12,681
maybe we could get
together and grab a drink.

478
01:11:18,325 --> 01:11:19,178
Are you still there?

479
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:22,506
Sorry, I'm in shock.
I'm in shock again.

480
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:28,258
I could book Luigi's at eight.

481
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,271
Eight in Luigi's?

482
01:11:30,355 --> 01:11:30,854
It is.

483
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:34,625
I will see you tonight.

484
01:11:35,993 --> 01:11:36,519
All right.

485
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:38,789
Okay, bye.

486
01:13:35,654 --> 01:13:38,239
PUMP IT UP

490
01:16:42,634 --> 01:16:44,091
Hi everybody.

491
01:16:44,175 --> 01:16:45,044
Hi.

492
01:16:45,135 --> 01:16:46,616
Okay, here we go everyone.

493
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,828
Clear the set please.

494
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:49,449
First positions, thank you.

495
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:50,514
Roll cameras.

496
01:16:51,154 --> 01:16:54,784
And in three, two, one.

497
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:00,032
Squat, squat, squat.

498
01:17:01,698 --> 01:17:02,790
Circle those hips.

499
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,730
Circle those hips.

500
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:07,977
Contract, contract, contract,

501
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,655
contract, contract, contract.

502
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:12,765
Have between your legs.

503
01:17:18,974 --> 01:17:19,734
Cut.

504
01:17:23,869 --> 01:17:28,301
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

505
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,385
I just got distracted.

506
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:33,310
Not a problem, let's
get right back to it.

507
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:34,955
Back to one please.

508
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,453
Sorry, it's the control room now.

509
01:17:39,652 --> 01:17:42,150
The director said he saw something
bizarre on the monitor.

510
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:43,694
Bring up the replay on camera two.

511
01:17:43,818 --> 01:17:44,818
Camera two.

512
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:56,839
Forward.

513
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:04,565
Can I have my dressing gown?

514
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:05,565
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

515
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:06,756
But I go and get it.

516
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:09,109
Let's just take this frame by frame.

517
01:18:24,049 --> 01:18:25,210
I need five minutes.

518
01:20:23,774 --> 01:20:24,024
Yes.

519
01:20:24,108 --> 01:20:25,608
This balance is not working.

520
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:28,273
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

521
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:31,232
while she wastes seven days

522
01:20:31,398 --> 01:20:32,857
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

523
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,148
Remember there is no she and you.

524
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:40,397
I love everybody.

525
01:20:45,329 --> 01:20:46,062
What's happening?

526
01:20:46,146 --> 01:20:46,918
Where is everybody?

527
01:20:47,355 --> 01:20:48,395
The TV's been canceled.

528
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:50,688
What, why?

529
01:20:50,771 --> 01:20:51,321
Sue.

530
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:54,162
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

531
01:20:55,404 --> 01:20:56,024
Okay.

532
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:59,196
I'll go change him.
No, he said now.

533
01:21:16,846 --> 01:21:18,340
I'll get right to the bond.

534
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:21,536
We can't keep you on the morning show.

535
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:25,240
But why?
I just started.

536
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:28,077
Ratings are through the roof.

537
01:21:29,058 --> 01:21:30,932
We started at 42.

538
01:21:31,498 --> 01:21:33,013
Now we're up to like...

539
01:21:34,011 --> 01:21:35,024
216.

540
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:37,823
It's phenomenal.

541
01:21:38,796 --> 01:21:40,394
People love you.

542
01:21:40,653 --> 01:21:42,244
They adore you.

543
01:21:42,328 --> 01:21:45,279
They want more and more and more of you.

544
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:48,973
That is why we have
decided that we want you

545
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:53,034
to host the New Year's Eve show.

546
01:21:54,013 --> 01:21:55,180
You mean the...

547
01:21:55,263 --> 01:21:56,805
The network's biggest show.

548
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,446
50 million viewers live.

549
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,941
You can't go higher than that.

550
01:22:04,332 --> 01:22:05,655
That's gonna be intense.

551
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:10,413
We only have a few more. So are you in?

552
01:22:21,552 --> 01:22:23,674
If you don't open the
door and opportunity knocks,

553
01:22:23,758 --> 01:22:25,164
you won't get another chance.

554
01:22:26,597 --> 01:22:28,415
You of all people know this.

555
01:22:41,059 --> 01:22:43,316
Just one more day and
then I have a whole week off.

556
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:44,094
We can switch.

557
01:23:01,998 --> 01:23:03,942
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

558
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:06,717
Just one more day, okay?

559
01:23:43,017 --> 01:23:45,629
No!

560
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:15,849
Yes.

561
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:18,102
 She didn't respect the balance.

562
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:21,101
She's stealing more,
and more time from me,

563
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:25,003
completely without
consideration of the consequences.

564
01:24:25,087 --> 01:24:26,933
She's a selfish bitch.

565
01:24:27,017 --> 01:24:28,177
Would you like to stop?

566
01:24:30,962 --> 01:24:31,756
Stop.

567
01:24:31,944 --> 01:24:33,364
You are the Matrix.

568
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:35,244
If you are not satisfied,

569
01:24:35,328 --> 01:24:37,160
you can put an end to the experience

570
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:39,909
and go back to being
just you on your own.

571
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:41,655
Would you like to stop?

572
01:24:44,638 --> 01:24:46,954
Will it go back to the way it was before?

573
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:49,313
What has been
transferred won't come back,

574
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:51,033
but you can stop the experience.

575
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:53,054
As of now, would you like to stop?

576
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:56,251
To go back to being just you on your own?

577
01:24:59,025 --> 01:24:59,519
No.

578
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:03,246
No, no, no.

579
01:25:04,006 --> 01:25:05,135
I can't stop.

580
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:07,531
She just...

581
01:25:07,865 --> 01:25:08,615
REMEMBER YOU ARE ONE

582
01:25:09,909 --> 01:25:10,549
I...

583
01:25:16,156 --> 01:25:18,323
The balance just needs to be respected.

584
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:19,457
So respected.

585
01:25:23,527 --> 01:25:24,822
Stop it, stop it, stop

586
01:25:24,905 --> 01:25:26,551
it, stop it, stop it.

587
01:25:35,862 --> 01:25:36,930
<i>You are the Matrix.</i>

588
01:25:37,984 --> 01:25:40,922
<i>Congratulations, you've won $25,000.</i>

589
01:25:41,195 --> 01:25:44,070
<i>We're standing on our final chance,
and it's your second question</i>

590
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:48,658
<i>in our big question
round and play for $250,000.</i>

591
01:25:52,475 --> 01:25:55,725
<i>And you'll have just 45
seconds to come up to get</i>

592
01:25:55,809 --> 01:25:57,956
<i>the correct answer that you can't...</i>

CHRISTMAS TURKEY STUFFED
WITH FOIE GRAS

602
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:32,085
FOIE GRAS

603
01:27:36,587 --> 01:27:39,405
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

604
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:42,887
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

605
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:43,769
Are you ready?

606
01:27:43,853 --> 01:27:45,829
Let's welcome her, Siuuu

607
01:27:48,026 --> 01:27:53,134
You popped up nowhere on
our screens like a tornado.

608
01:27:53,218 --> 01:27:56,835
I don't think anybody was
really prepared for this world.

609
01:28:03,948 --> 01:28:07,312
It all started with the morning show

610
01:28:07,396 --> 01:28:12,283
and rumor has it that you are
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

611
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:16,065
Wait, just a moment.

612
01:28:16,205 --> 01:28:20,570
I'm being told that you are going to host
the New Year's Eve show.

613
01:28:20,654 --> 01:28:21,670
Can you confirm this?

614
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,360
Yes, that's right.

615
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:24,897
Yes, that's right.

616
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:30,272
Oh my God, that is huge news.

617
01:28:30,558 --> 01:28:31,347
BLOOD SASAGE
WITH APPLES

618
01:28:33,415 --> 01:28:34,981
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

619
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:35,896
Where are you from?

620
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,434
How did you get discovered?

621
01:28:37,705 --> 01:28:40,708
I want, we want to know everything.

622
01:28:43,603 --> 01:28:48,175
Well, I mean, there's
really not very much to tell.

623
01:28:48,713 --> 01:28:53,560
I'm just a girl from a
very small town in Indiana.

624
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:55,553
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

625
01:28:55,637 --> 01:28:57,811
In fact, it's not even a town.

626
01:28:57,895 --> 01:29:00,228
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village.

627
01:29:00,312 --> 01:29:03,229
It's a farm, perhaps?

628
01:29:10,335 --> 01:29:12,059
But ever since I can remember,

629
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:15,412
it has always been my
dream to be on screen.

630
01:29:15,889 --> 01:29:17,643
This is my dream.

631
01:29:17,726 --> 01:29:20,317
As a child, I used to
put on shows for my family.

632
01:29:20,587 --> 01:29:22,092
Mm, your family.

633
01:29:22,618 --> 01:29:23,816
How sweet.

634
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,751
CHRISTMAS TURKET STUFFED
WITH FOIE GRAS

635
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:30,220
So, everyone is aware that

636
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:33,409
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

637
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:37,723
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

638
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:41,568
you turned up the volume,
and you rocked their world.

639
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,159
Were you a fan of her show?

640
01:29:47,813 --> 01:29:53,847
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

641
01:29:54,513 --> 01:29:55,346
I can't really say that I

642
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:58,215
actually watched her show.

643
01:29:58,888 --> 01:30:01,095
You do know that we're not exactly from

644
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:02,137
the same generation.

645
01:30:03,342 --> 01:30:05,137
And you have to admit, it

646
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:06,387
was a bit old-fashioned.

647
01:30:09,593 --> 01:30:10,886
Jurassic Fitness, really.

648
01:30:12,428 --> 01:30:14,344
Jurassic
Fitness, it needed a change.

649
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:18,135
I'll fucking show you.

650
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:20,218
You really wanna see

651
01:30:20,302 --> 01:30:21,427
some Jurassic Fitness?

652
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:25,691
You want it?

653
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:30,349
Come on, come get your
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

654
01:30:39,009 --> 01:30:41,773
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

655
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:47,038
So, every morning, rain or shine,

656
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:49,998
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

657
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:51,885
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

658
01:30:52,798 --> 01:30:54,048
Whether I liked it or not.

659
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:56,506
I guess that's why you could say

660
01:30:56,589 --> 01:30:58,048
we have some sort of connection.

661
01:30:58,423 --> 01:30:59,713
Some sort of connection.

662
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:02,880
You wouldn't exist without me.

663
01:31:13,004 --> 01:31:14,046
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

664
01:31:14,296 --> 01:31:15,836
It is time, ladies and

665
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,295
gentlemen, for our final question.

666
01:31:18,753 --> 01:31:20,878
The question that we ask each

667
01:31:20,961 --> 01:31:24,127
and every one of our guests.

668
01:31:24,335 --> 01:31:24,502
Okay.

669
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:27,710
Would you share one of your

670
01:31:27,794 --> 01:31:30,002
little beauty secrets with us?

671
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,084
Just one little trick of yours

672
01:31:33,168 --> 01:31:34,168
that helps you look

673
01:31:34,251 --> 01:31:36,126
so incredibly stunning.

674
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:36,959
I mean, look at you.

675
01:31:37,168 --> 01:31:37,834
I don't know.

676
01:31:38,418 --> 01:31:39,084
Say it!

677
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:40,875
Say it!

678
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:42,792
Let me think.

679
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:43,625
Say it!

680
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,250
Tell them who your

681
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,833
little beauty secret is!

682
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:48,083
I guess, I would just

683
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:49,332
show them right here.

684
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:50,999
Here's your little beauty secret.

685
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:52,999
I guess I just try to be myself.

686
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:54,582
To be sincere and

687
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:56,582
grateful for all that I have.

688
01:31:57,249 --> 01:31:58,081
And to always remember

689
01:31:58,165 --> 01:31:59,248
to leave with my heart.

690
01:31:59,498 --> 01:32:01,456
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

691
01:32:07,539 --> 01:32:15,788
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

692
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:18,938
Stop it!

693
01:32:20,163 --> 01:32:20,704
Stop it.

694
01:32:21,345 --> 01:32:23,031
You're taking it from me.

695
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:25,068
That's your little secret.

696
01:32:26,434 --> 01:32:27,065
Stop it!

697
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:28,072
Stop it!

698
01:32:28,446 --> 01:32:30,343

01:32:33,111 --> 01:32:33,686
Stop it!

702
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:34,401
Stop it!

703
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:39,024
Stop it!

704
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:46,399
You have to control yourself!

705
01:33:06,211 --> 01:33:07,797
I can't go back, I forgot.

706
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:13,947
Oh, shit.

707
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:18,518
Gross old rat.

708
01:33:19,406 --> 01:33:20,445
Discussing!

THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE YOU

718
01:34:41,322 --> 01:34:42,071
Coming to bed?

719
01:34:43,798 --> 01:34:46,199
Yes, I'll be right there.

720
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:56,530
TOMORROW 9PM

721
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:51,905
Yes.

722
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:53,865
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

723
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:56,418
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

724
01:35:58,845 --> 01:35:59,419
Hello?

725
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,753
It's fucking 503.

726
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:03,391
Yes.

727
01:36:03,605 --> 01:36:04,435
Ahh!

728
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:06,218
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

729
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,639
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

730
01:36:07,844 --> 01:36:09,412
It means you've reached the end.

731
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:12,910
What do you mean the end?

732
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,669
You've drained it all out.

733
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:17,996
If you want more, you must
let the fluid regenerate.

734
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:19,988
Tell me how to do it.

735
01:36:20,072 --> 01:36:22,494
I need to stabilize myself right now.

736
01:36:22,884 --> 01:36:24,300
You simply have to switch.

737
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,286
Excuse me?

738
01:36:28,508 --> 01:36:31,220
The switch reboots the
fluid secretion process

739
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:33,711
so you can continue to
enjoy the experience.

740
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,797
No, no, no, no, no.

741
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:37,757
I can't switch, I can't.

742
01:36:38,354 --> 01:36:39,536
Especially not now.

743
01:36:39,632 --> 01:36:41,146
There is no other option.

751
01:37:41,276 --> 01:37:42,030
Babe?

752
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,915
Sue?

753
01:37:57,577 --> 01:37:58,618
Is something wrong?

754
01:38:02,978 --> 01:38:05,213
You look cranky because
you're related business.

755
01:38:10,121 --> 01:38:10,991
Sue, open the door.

756
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:13,690
Come on, Sue.

757
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:15,821
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

758
01:38:17,393 --> 01:38:18,678
Sue, open the door.

759
01:38:19,834 --> 01:38:21,377
Open the door, Sue, come on.

01:38:47,872 --> 01:38:49,820
Sue, open the door!

01:38:51,168 --> 01:38:52,461
You out!

763
01:38:53,564 --> 01:38:54,355
What the fuck?

764
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,558
What the fuck out!

765
01:38:57,642 --> 01:38:59,865
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

766
01:38:59,948 --> 01:39:01,537
Leave me alone!

767
01:39:02,772 --> 01:39:03,518
Hoee :)

768
01:39:04,366 --> 01:39:05,220
Hoee

769
01:39:10,076 --> 01:39:12,069
What the fuck?

770
01:40:05,095 --> 01:40:05,939
Yes?

771
01:40:09,482 --> 01:40:11,045
It's 503.

772
01:40:12,176 --> 01:40:13,647
I want to stop.

773
01:40:13,977 --> 01:40:14,927
Are you sure?

774
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:17,274
Once you stop, you can't go back.

775
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:21,149
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

776
01:40:21,711 --> 01:40:23,313

01:44:00,371 --> 01:44:02,060
I can't do this.

I need you.

797
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:09,888
