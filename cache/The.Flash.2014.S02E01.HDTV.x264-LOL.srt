1
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:02,547
<i>Last season, on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:04,316
What's happening to me?

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,651
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

4
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,354
- We've been searching
for other meta-humans,

5
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:10,488
like yourself.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,690
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

7
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:13,024
You were affected, too.

8
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:14,893
Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.

9
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:16,027
Yes, I did.

10
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,362
What do you say we do that?

11
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,965
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

12
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:21,733
You killed my mother!

13
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,268
Why?

14
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,703
We're enemies, rivals, opposites,

15
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,004
reverses of one another.

16
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:27,472
Just tell the police what you did.

17
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,074
Get my dad out of prison!

18
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:31,209
You could go back and save your mother.

19
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,378
A wormhole, opening the gateway

20
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,081
into time itself.

21
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,317
I always win, Flash!

22
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,752
Eddie!

23
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,387
Eddie's his ancestor. If Eddie dies,

24
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,722
he'll never be born.

25
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,857
He's being erased from existence.

26
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,860
The singularity won't stop,

27
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:50,095
not even after the Earth is gone.

28
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,663
We have to disrupt the motion.

29
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:52,897
It cannot be stopped!

30
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,599
I have to try.

31
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:19,057
- He's coming back around!
- Yeah, to die!

32
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,702
I swear one of these days I will kill you!

33
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:43,348
I was late again, wasn't I?

34
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,183
Right on time.

35
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:48,486
Whoo!

36
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,928
Two down at the same time?

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,797
Superhero double play, baby!

38
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,566
- Didn't do it alone.
- You're never alone, Barry.

39
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,301
Neither are you, Mrs. Raymond.

40
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,138
Thank you for not doing that

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,440
when I was inside you.

42
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,208
It happened one time. Let it go.

43
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,544
Snart and Rory.

44
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:16,281
You're gonna put a cop like me out of a job.

45
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,582
Just trying to help.

46
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,517
You do more than help, Barry.

47
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,654
You give the people of this city hope.

48
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,355
You're the hero, Barry.

49
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:27,058
Congratulations, everyone.

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,861
A spectacular victory.

51
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,263
A milestone, if you will.

52
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:37,869
Mr. Allen, I believe there's
nothing left I can teach you.

53
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:41,072
I believe...

54
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:45,243
that you're ready to do
all of this on your own.

55
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:03,561
My name is Barry Allen,

56
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,397
and I am the fastest man alive.

57
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,199
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

58
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,301
by something impossible.

59
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,004
My father went to prison for her murder.

60
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:15,039
Then an accident made me the impossible,

61
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,108
and I became the Flash.

62
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,710
I used my powers to find the man

63
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,945
responsible for my mother's death.

64
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:24,182
I thought I would finally
get justice for my family,

65
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:25,850
but I failed.

66
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,386
It's been six months
since the Singularity.

67
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,422
I'm on my own now.
Decided it's better that way.

68
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,625
Keeps the people I care about safe.

69
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,528
There's only one thing I can do now.

70
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,896
I run.

71
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,473
How's it going?

72
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:50,909
Hey. Uh, good.

73
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,143
How you doing?

74
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,045
Good.

75
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:57,048
So, the victim. His name is Al Rothstein.

76
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,483
He's a welder here at the nuclear plant.

77
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,286
Co-worker found him this morning.

78
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,855
So, what do you got?

79
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:06,357
Petechiae on his face and
the whites of his eyes,

80
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,826
and this bruising around his neck...

81
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,762
- Oh, so he was strangled.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,431
By someone very strong and very large.

83
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,233
Or something?

84
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,501
This wasn't Grodd.

85
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,903
Oh, thank God.

86
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,471
Look,

87
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,574
I'll let you know

88
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,375
when I find more.

89
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:26,578
So this Flash Day thing.

90
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,546
I'm hoping you're planning
on making an appearance.

91
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:31,049
Ah... I haven't decided.

92
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,817
Bar, I heard the Mayor's trying

93
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,118
to give you the key to the city.

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,286
Yeah, I don't need an award.

95
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,821
You love getting awards.

96
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,157
Like all those science
trophies you got in high school?

97
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,992
Those I deserved.

98
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:44,562
I'll let you know what I find, all right?

99
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,964
All right.

100
00:04:58,778 --> 00:04:59,978
Flash Day is almost here.

101
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,412
A special downtown rally

102
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:04,415
to honor the man who saved Central City.

103
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,652
It's been six months since
the Flash saved Central City

104
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:10,989
from the freak black hole
that erupted in the sky.

105
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,591
Joe, where are we at with
the murder at the nuclear plant?

106
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,093
Barry's still analyzing the evidence,

107
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,494
but there was definitely something weird.

108
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:17,662
Yeah, which is why I let you have

109
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,330
that Anti-Meta-Human Task Force.

110
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,399
Speaking of which, where's
your scientific advisor?

111
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,934
Ho, ho, ho!

112
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,602
Fear the beard!

113
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:31,042
It's a very distinguished look... Sir.

114
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,678
- What is all this, Mr. Ramon?
- Oh, this right here?

115
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,879
This is a little something I'm working on.

116
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:36,247
I'm cooking it up for Joe

117
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,183
and the task force to
take down meta-humans.

118
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,718
I'm think I'm going to call it The Boot.

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,121
Oh, here are the receipts.

120
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,092
Oh, um, Captain, one more thing.

121
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:50,862
You are not getting a badge, Mr. Ramon.

122
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,466
He's really stingy with
those badges, isn't he?

123
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,802
Yeah, cops are funny that way.

124
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,071
So you really think
you can get this to work?

125
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,140
Don't have me caught out on
the streets with my pants down.

126
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,975
Yes, once I finish the Boot,

127
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,978
CCPD will totally have what it
needs to take down a meta-human.

128
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,646
Especially now that Barry
has decided to go all

129
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,616
Lone Wolf McQuade and
fight crime by himself.

130
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,318
I know, right? Have you spoken to him?

131
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,952
Not really. Haven't even heard from Caitlin

132
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,454
since she started work at Mercury Labs.

133
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,923
- Hey Cisco. Hi, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

134
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,858
Hey, I was wondering if you'd
talked to Barry about the rally.

135
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,360
We was just saying.

136
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,062
I'm sorry, but, I can't believe

137
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:26,364
they're gonna give the
Flash the key to the city.

138
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,032
Although technically,
as members of Team Flash,

139
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,200
we should all be getting keys.

140
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,668
Well, you know Barry.

141
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,570
The more we try to convince
him to do something,

142
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:33,738
the less he's gonna want to do it.

143
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,506
Yeah, but he should go.

144
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,375
Someone should try and get through to him.

145
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,643
Maybe his best friend.

146
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:41,446
Joe, believe me, I've tried.

147
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,281
I meant her.

148
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:45,717
Bye, baby.

149
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,719
- Yeah.
- Okay.

150
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,592
You know, if you ever decided

151
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,494
that you didn't want to be the Flash,

152
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:32,096
you have a good future being a contractor.

153
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,031
Thanks.

154
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,134
Yeah, I'm just trying to put it all back

155
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:40,104
exactly how it was before the...

156
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,106
You know.

157
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,945
Seems like a lot of local businesses

158
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,515
are being rebuilt at night.

159
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,251
In secret.

160
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,421
I was thinking about writing
an article about it for the paper.

161
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,189
Don't. Please.

162
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,091
Look, people have heard the stories.

163
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,793
They've read the articles.

164
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,829
They've maybe even seen the
red streak racing past them.

165
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,698
but they've never seen the Flash, Barry.

166
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,333
So that's why you're here?

167
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,836
You came to talk me into
going to the rally?

168
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:14,038
'Cause I'm... I'm not gonna go.

169
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,441
People just want to thank the
man who saved Central City.

170
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:19,277
Well, they can't, 'cause that's not me.

171
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,646
You should know that, better than anyone.

172
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:30,087
Central City believes in the Flash.

173
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,192
So do I.

174
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,444
Brilliant!

175
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:27,845
He's contained the Singularity

176
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,681
by adding to its angular momentum!

177
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,650
Barry, it's stabilizing.

178
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,352
Keep doing what you're doing!

179
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,787
I'm not sure how much longer I can.

180
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:38,990
Cisco! Now what?

181
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,959
We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons.

182
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,561
How do we do that?

183
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,464
By separating in the eye of it.

184
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:50,701
The amount of energy from
the fissure should do the trick.

185
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:55,506
It's our only hope, Ronald.

186
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,975
Ronnie, no! It's too dangerous.

187
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:01,178
What if you can't escape the inrush?

188
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,248
Cait, we have to try.

189
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:41,619
Ronnie... Professor...

190
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,223
No!

191
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:22,159
Ronald... Ronald...

192
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,607
I'm so sorry.

193
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,290
Are we expecting trouble?

194
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,258
Cops always expect trouble.

195
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,362
In this city, I expect
super evil flying monsters.

196
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,331
That's a solid expectation.

197
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,804
Well, I'll be.

198
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:35,149
Good morning, Central City!

199
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:38,586
A year ago, our world changed.

200
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:42,990
Our city became ground zero for...

201
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,793
some pretty weird stuff.

202
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,262
We got a new breed of criminal:

203
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,499
Men and women who defied not only our laws,

204
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:54,702
but physics and reason.

205
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,938
But we got something else, too.

206
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,875
We got the Flash!

207
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:08,482
Our wounds run deep,

208
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,484
and I know many of you are afraid

209
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:13,154
of what threats tomorrow may bring.

210
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:15,756
But the Flash doesn't just protect us,

211
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,759
he restores hope where it was lost.

212
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:22,163
That's why I'm honored to present the key

213
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:26,534
to the man who saved
Central City: The Flash!

214
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:57,031
Flash. Flash.

215
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,019
The doors to Central City

216
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:21,989
will forever be open for you, Flash.

217
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,826
Look out!

218
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,268
You all right?

219
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,608
I got this, all right?

220
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:46,180
The man who saved Central City,

221
00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:48,382
hate to rain on your parade.

222
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,319
Oof!

223
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,674
Cisco!

224
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:15,142
Cisco!

225
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:17,778
- The Boot!
- Right!

226
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,618
Locked and loaded. Go!

227
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,857
Booted!

228
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,269
Cisco, you said this
thing would take him down.

229
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:44,538
He's not going down.

230
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:52,346
He went up.

231
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:54,148
Run! Run!

232
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:00,187
- What are you doing?
- I'm throwing, you're shooting.

233
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,039
That's Al Rothstein.

234
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,842
The body we found at the nuclear plant,

235
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,977
he's alive!

236
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:36,206
According to the coroner’s office,

237
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,587
Al Rothstein's body was in
the morgue all night,

238
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,756
so we can scratch off "zombie attack."

239
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,658
Rothstein have a twin brother?

240
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,893
Nope. Only child.

241
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,195
And get this, the night
the accelerator exploded,

242
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:49,098
Rothstein was on his
honeymoon, in Hawaii.

243
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,534
Huh. So we're looking for
a guy who's really strong,

244
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,770
can grow twice his size,
and just happens to look

245
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,672
exactly like the guy he murdered?

246
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:57,907
I would think this meta was really cool

247
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,210
if everything about him didn't
just terrify me to my core.

248
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:02,779
Is that what happened to you?

249
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,581
You looked really spooked
there for a minute.

250
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,550
- Uh...
- I actually see

251
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,319
the guy that I can ask about it right now.

252
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,988
Call you back, okay? Hey.

253
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,958
So, the hospital next to
the Flash Day rally,

254
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,994
The x-ray and CT machines
all failed at once.

255
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,395
Was that because of you?

256
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:23,633
I did not do anything that would cause that.

257
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:27,770
I'm 92% sure.

258
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:31,174
I'm going to go make that 100. Excuse me.

259
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,909
You okay?

260
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:36,446
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

261
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,617
Barry can't do this alone anymore.

262
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,386
That's his plan

263
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:44,721
and I don't know how to talk him out of it.

264
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:45,855
At this point, I'm just trying

265
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,223
not to push him farther away.

266
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,058
Well, maybe Barry has been so successful

267
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,327
at pushing you, me and everyone else away

268
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,196
because we keep letting him.

269
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,831
Let's not let him.

270
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,933
What do you suggest?

271
00:17:56,935 --> 00:18:01,504
Well, "if you keep
getting 'no' for an answer,

272
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,406
stop asking questions."

273
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:05,108
I say that. You quoting me to me?

274
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,643
What can I say? You are a very smart man.

275
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:20,123
So this is what it looks
like inside Mercury Labs.

276
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,458
Security here is way better
than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs,

277
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,826
what with people walking in and out

278
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:26,062
of the Cortex all the time.

279
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,164
- Hi Cisco.
- Sweet Sarek.

280
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,033
Is that a 6K proton splicer?

281
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,701
Yes, it is.

282
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:34,370
Dr. McGee insists on having
all the latest technology.

283
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,272
Wow.

284
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:38,841
You deserve it.

285
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:42,078
I spotted you, at the rally today,

286
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,348
and I'm guessing you saw what happened.

287
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,216
Cisco, I can't come back.

288
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,852
Okay, check this out:
we found this on a victim

289
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,387
at the nuclear power plant,

290
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,656
but the badge shows
absolutely nothing at all,

291
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:55,558
which is so weird.

292
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,361
What's also weird is that at the
same time that meta-human grew,

293
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:01,330
all the x-ray machines within a
mile radius just went belly-up.

294
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:04,233
- Cisco.
- Just... if you could just...

295
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,636
See if the badge was
tampered with or something.

296
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:07,904
I mean, if it's broken, or...

297
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,239
Whatever.

298
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,341
It'll really help.

299
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,254
Mr. Allen.

300
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,756
Barry Allen?

301
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,092
- Yeah.
- I'm Greg Turk.

302
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:31,994
I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone.

303
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,063
I don't usually make house
calls, but I've been trying

304
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,698
to get in touch with you for several months.

305
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,867
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

306
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,302
I've just, um...

307
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,270
I've been really busy with police work.

308
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:43,606
We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs.

309
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,275
As you know, Harrison Wells
left the property to you

310
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,543
as part of his living trust.

311
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:51,347
Yeah, which I did not ask him to do,

312
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,416
but I've been keeping the place up.

313
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,118
Well, It's going to take more
than cleaning the floors

314
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,353
to retain it, I'm afraid.

315
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,255
The facility and the real
estate are scheduled to go

316
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:03,793
into receivership at the
end of this week unless...

317
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,030
you watch this.

318
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,265
What is this?

319
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,934
A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.

320
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,204
What's on it? Have you seen it?

321
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,206
No. He was very specific.

322
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,442
It was only to be watched by you.

323
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:20,877
The device will send me a notification

324
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,612
after you've viewed it.

325
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,181
And at that point, I'll have
everything ready to execute.

326
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,749
I'm not going to watch that.

327
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,985
Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen.

328
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,954
I'm only here to represent
Harrison Wells' final request.

329
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:34,123
Good day.

330
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:08,157
What are you guys doing here?

331
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,793
- Working.
- So, Caitlin was right.

332
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,663
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

333
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,132
due to contact with cell
phones, microwaves,

334
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,366
televisions, et cetera.

335
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:19,602
Our bodies are natural conductors.

336
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:21,571
I think our meta's been
sucking up all the radiation

337
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,339
around him and using it to power himself.

338
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:25,274
- Which is why the x-ray
machines at the hospital

339
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,509
failed the day of the rally.

340
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:27,843
So if we want to find him,

341
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,745
we gotta look for places without radiation.

342
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,815
All right, guys, I don't want
any of you here right now.

343
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,651
Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

344
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:38,221
Barry, everyone in this
room cares about you,

345
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:40,089
but we also care about this city.

346
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,357
We all want to make a difference,

347
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,725
and that means fighting meta-humans,

348
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,760
and that means working with the Flash.

349
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,429
You can't deny us that.

350
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,097
Not anymore. Got him.

351
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,332
There's a three block dead zone

352
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,167
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

353
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,369
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

354
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:57,240
That's where you'll find your atom smasher.

355
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,577
Because he absorbs atomic power,

356
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:04,714
and he, well, smashes.

357
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:08,217
Come here.

358
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:10,086
That's a great name. Welcome to the team.

359
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:12,688
- Thank you.
- Great, guys, thank you.

360
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,290
You can go now, all right?

361
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,159
Barry, you need to let Cisco and Stein

362
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,228
figure out a way to stop this guy.

363
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,364
No, I don't.

364
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,905
Barry left his comm system behind.

365
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:32,508
We can't talk to him.

366
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,944
He's on his own.

367
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:05,337
Well, this is a curve ball.

368
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,440
I thought I was going to
have to come looking for you.

369
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,509
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

370
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:13,245
- I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
- Yeah?

371
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:14,796
Then why'd you kill Albert Rothstein?

372
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:16,331
And why do you look like him?

373
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,233
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

374
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,936
- Try me.
- I'm about to.

375
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:23,071
Is there really no way of knowing

376
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,505
what's going on in there?

377
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:27,675
I'm looking for the security cameras.

378
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:29,043
Booyah.

379
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,763
My turn.

380
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:53,568
- Dad.
- Maybe I can make it there.

381
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,870
No, you won't, and what are you
gonna do when you get there?

382
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:56,871
The Boot didn't work on him.

383
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,606
Alarm!

384
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,241
- Believe me, we're all alarmed.
- No, the alarm system.

385
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,543
You've tapped into the
surveillance cameras, correct?

386
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,779
Correct!

387
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:07,415
"Come on, feel the noize."

388
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:13,388
He said you were some kind of big hero,

389
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,357
but you don't seem worthy
of him, or this city.

390
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:25,199
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

391
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,735
I believe that's already
been well established.

392
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,555
No, thank you.

393
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:49,657
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

394
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:52,093
I'm not hungry.

395
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:54,095
It's been six months, Barry.

396
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:55,997
You gotta eat, son.

397
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,832
It's a good move,

398
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,567
being angry all the time.

399
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,035
I get it.

400
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:02,470
You miss your mom and dad, and you want

401
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:03,871
to show them that you're strong.

402
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,374
Being mad makes it easier.

403
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:10,878
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

404
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,982
It's okay to be sad. You can be sad, Barry.

405
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:17,485
Your parents will understand

406
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:20,888
if you're not strong all the time.

407
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,024
That is why I'm here.

408
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:29,630
It's okay, son. I got you.

409
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:53,788
You're good. I got you.

410
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:00,328
Where is everyone?

411
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,464
I figured you wouldn't want an
audience when you came to.

412
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:06,401
Yeah, thanks.

413
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:10,905
Iris is right.

414
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:12,573
You're not gonna do this anymore.

415
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,308
For the last six months I've
given you your space

416
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:18,679
to work all this out, come back to us.

417
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:22,750
But today proved that you'd
rather just get yourself killed.

418
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:27,722
It's better than getting my friends killed.

419
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,958
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

420
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,395
I can't. It was. Guess what?

421
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:37,598
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

422
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,368
All of the rest of us were there too.

423
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,037
Eddie and Ronnie,

424
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,807
they chose to help you stop Wells,

425
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,276
and stop that...

426
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:51,179
- Singularity.
- Singularity thing.

427
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:54,182
It's on all of us, Barry.

428
00:26:54,184 --> 00:26:58,286
So stop with this hogging
all the blame and regret.

429
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:02,323
We gotta live with it. Move on.

430
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:07,862
What do I do now?

431
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:10,898
Well, I know that you've been

432
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,936
rebuilding Central City at night.

433
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:17,805
It's just bricks and paint.

434
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:21,409
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild...

435
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,544
things that really matter.

436
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:39,760
What are you doing here?

437
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:43,064
Sorry, I should've called or something.

438
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:46,834
I just... I wanted to see you.

439
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:48,336
It's been a while.

440
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:50,571
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you

441
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:54,008
at the Flash Day celebration.

442
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,210
I was surprised.

443
00:27:56,212 --> 00:28:01,949
You, better than anyone,
know I wasn't the hero that day.

444
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:06,053
- Of course you were.
- No.

445
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,991
Cait, Ronnie died saving me.

446
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:14,595
and I should've saved him,
and I'm... I'm so sorry.

447
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:17,965
Barry, I know that you
did everything you could.

448
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,168
It wasn't your fault.

449
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,138
I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.

450
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,308
I blame myself.

451
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,143
Why?

452
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:32,413
When Ronnie first became Firestorm,

453
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:34,782
he asked me to leave Central City,

454
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:40,488
and go somewhere that we
could have a normal life.

455
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,291
And I said no.

456
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:50,665
I couldn't leave S.T.A.R.
Labs, Dr. Wells... you.

457
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:55,069
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

458
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:57,171
Being at S.T.A.R. Labs just
made me think of that

459
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:59,540
every single day.

460
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,810
Here.

461
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:05,713
Oh, you carry a handkerchief now?

462
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,682
What are you, 80?

463
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:14,755
- What's that?
- Ah, it's uh...

464
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:18,459
Apparently, in case of his death,

465
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,662
Wells had some kind of a living will.

466
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,199
And you haven't watched it yet?

467
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,302
No. No, I've...

468
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,372
been too afraid.

469
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:34,976
What if we watched it together?

470
00:29:36,946 --> 00:29:38,279
All right.

471
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:48,155
Hello, Barry.

472
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:50,157
If you're watching this,

473
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,394
that means something
has gone horribly wrong.

474
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:58,933
I'm dead and the last 15
years have been for nothing.

475
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,502
Bummer. 15 years.

476
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:03,904
You know, when I realize
that in all those years

477
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:05,706
helping raise you,

478
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,142
we were never truly enemies, Barry.

479
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:10,111
I'm not the thing you hate.

480
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:14,749
And so, I want to give you
the thing that you want most.

481
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,550
It won't matter.

482
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:20,421
You'll never be truly
happy, Barry Allen, trust me.

483
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,023
I know you.

484
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:23,624
Now...

485
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:25,660
Erase everything I said up to this point.

486
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:29,196
Give the following message to the police.

487
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,599
My name is Harrison Wells.

488
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,334
Being of sound mind and body,

489
00:30:33,336 --> 00:30:35,536
I freely confess to the
murder of Nora Allen.

490
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,772
In her home, on the night of March 18th,

491
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,473
in the year 2000.

492
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:41,142
I attacked Nora Allen in her dining room.

493
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:42,743
- Oh, my God.
- I stabbed her in the chest

494
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:44,845
- with a large butcher knife...
- He confessed.

495
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:46,914
From the drawer to the left
of the sink in the kitchen.

496
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,983
This is it.

497
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:53,754
This is what I need to free my dad.

498
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,361
Hey, Joe. Yeah, hey.

499
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:04,031
Can you have everybody
meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs?

500
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,499
Yeah. All right, thanks.

501
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,302
Yeah. All right, bye.

502
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:11,205
I'll drive.

503
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,873
Okay.

504
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:18,322
You think the video's enough?

505
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:20,491
Mm-hmm.

506
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,943
Well, sure.

507
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:26,379
- What's she saying?
- Hold on.

508
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,281
Wells gave all the right details.

509
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:31,384
It's not a done deal yet,
but the D.A. says it looks good.

510
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,921
Yeah, I'm here.

511
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,725
Is it good news?

512
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,194
- I think so.
- Henry's coming home?

513
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:43,896
Oh!

514
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,068
Okay, well...

515
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,638
that still leaves Atom
Smasher to deal with.

516
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,474
Last time you faced him, it did not go well.

517
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,010
No, it did not.

518
00:31:58,012 --> 00:32:00,813
I clearly can't stop him by myself.

519
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:03,416
So how are we gonna beat him?

520
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:07,453
Well, ever since I was
shown a drained radiation tag,

521
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:09,288
which I haven't been
able to stop thinking about.

522
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,391
- Thank you, Cisco.
- You're welcome, Caitlin.

523
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:15,027
If this guy likes radiation so much,

524
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:17,997
I say we give it to him.

525
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,943
Showtime.

526
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:39,919
What's up?

527
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,020
I see you got my message.

528
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:42,054
That light was perfect bait.

529
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:43,789
What made you think of that?

530
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,093
I don't know, I think I saw
it in a comic book somewhere.

531
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,095
You want me?

532
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,163
You're gonna have to catch me.

533
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,336
It's working, dude.
Rothstein's following you.

534
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:59,839
I must say, he's quite
agile for a man his size.

535
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:01,474
Run, Barry, run.

536
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,175
Come on.

537
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,733
Didn't think I could catch you, huh?

538
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:33,072
No, I knew you could.

539
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,607
Now, Cisco!

540
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,750
The amount of radiation
about to flood that room...

541
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,886
Atom Smasher won't be able to absorb it all.

542
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:15,114
The radiation's been cleared.

543
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:16,949
It's safe for you to go in.

544
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,369
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:40,739
I couldn't let you hurt anyone else.

546
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:43,375
Why?

547
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:44,577
Why did you want to kill me?

548
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,586
He promised he'd take me home...

549
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:57,089
if I killed you.

550
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:59,125
Who?

551
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:00,326
Who promised you that?

552
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:07,933
Zoom.

553
00:35:58,016 --> 00:35:59,550
Let's get out of here.

554
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,207
I'll race you.

555
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:05,610
You will lose.

556
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,650
Welcome home!

557
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:01,700
Gather round, everyone, please.

558
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,705
Looking at all of you,

559
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:11,242
thinking how far we've all come,

560
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:15,213
and remembering those
who are no longer with us,

561
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:20,452
I'm reminded of a Hebrew word
used during times of graduation.

562
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:27,125
Kadima. It means, "Forward."

563
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:29,327
Forward.

564
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,563
Forward.

565
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:32,497
Forward.

566
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,033
- Forward.
- Forward.

567
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,501
Forward.

568
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,936
- Forward.
- Forward.

569
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:48,913
- Well said.
- Thank you.

570
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:51,783
- You good?
- Ah, yeah.

571
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:58,256
Stuff goes to your head after
being away from it for 14 years.

572
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:01,626
I bet. All right, well, look.

573
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:04,129
I was thinking, what if, in the morning,

574
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,297
the two of us started looking
for an apartment for both of us,

575
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,268
and Iris has actually been
doing some research on

576
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,569
how to get your medical license back

577
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,805
so you could start your practice up again,

578
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:16,274
or, if you wanted, come work
with us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

579
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,576
I don't know. I mean...

580
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:21,079
- What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah, it's a party.

581
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:23,515
Come on, we can talk
about all this tomorrow.

582
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:30,088
- Talk about what?
- Barry...

583
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,626
Are you not planning on sticking around?

584
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,629
Okay.

585
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,931
Okay, do you think...

586
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:46,004
Can you be all that you are becoming...

587
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:49,541
With me here?

588
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,316
You're the only family that I have left.

589
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:04,289
Well, that's not really true, is it?

590
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:07,258
Don't you have another family in this room?

591
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,929
They need your help too, Barry.

592
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,432
When you need me, I will be here,

593
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,234
but right now, Central City
doesn't need you

594
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,869
to be Henry Allen's son.

595
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:22,540
It needs you to be the Flash.

596
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,845
My kid.

597
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:31,049
The superhero.

598
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:40,492
I have to go.

599
00:39:42,295 --> 00:39:48,967
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

600
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:51,369
Yeah.

601
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:19,297
- Hey.
- Hey.

602
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,800
Your dad get off okay?

603
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:27,906
Yeah, I just dropped him at the station.

604
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:30,074
You good?

605
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:32,577
I don't know, I...

606
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,113
Just feels like every
time I win, I still lose.

607
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:36,481
Well...

608
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:43,354
It's not bad.

609
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:46,891
No, it's not bad.

610
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:51,696
It's pretty cool. It's real cool, come on!

611
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,598
- Hey!
- Hey.

612
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,367
- Ho ho!
- Hey, guess what?

613
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:00,204
I added a little upgrade to your suit.

614
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:03,675
It's just like the one from
the future newspaper

615
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,677
Gideon showed us.

616
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,845
I was thinking, you know,

617
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,781
you shouldn't fear the
future anymore, right?

618
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,750
No, and it'll be here faster than we think.

619
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,286
Well, see, I like it. The
lightning definitely pops

620
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:16,688
more against the white.

621
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,357
And S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

622
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,726
Increased security and surveillance.

623
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:24,562
Re-coded, double firewalled,
electronic lock sets.

624
00:41:24,564 --> 00:41:26,764
Nothing is getting through
here without us knowing.

625
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:29,000
So people can't just waltz
in and out of here.

626
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,536
Exactly.

627
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:32,971
For real? Stay where you are.

628
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:34,539
Who are you?

629
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:38,476
You don't know me, but
I know you... Barry Allen.

630
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:40,578
Take one more step, it'll be
the last step you take.

631
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,180
The man asked you a question.

632
00:41:42,182 --> 00:41:45,950
Who the hell are you?

633
00:41:45,952 --> 00:41:47,919
My name is Jay Garrick,

634
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:50,088
and your world is in danger.
