1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,969
<i>Hey, this is Joss Whedon, um,</i>

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:16,308
<i>doing an unprecedented concept
of a director's commentary.</i>

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,602
<i>Um... I have a lot to say.</i>

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>I have no idea what it's going to be,
or what order it's going to come in.</i>

5
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>But if you like the sound of me babbling,</i>

6
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,195
<i>you're in for a treat.</i>

7
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>Why on earth would I make</i>
another <i>Avengers</i> movie?</i>

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>They're really hard. It was...
It was ill-advised. I see that now.</i>

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,916
(DISTANT EXPLOSION)

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,296
<i>But I think the most important thing
about the movie is that it's mine.</i>

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,257
<i>That it's all me,</i>

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>and that really because
I'm the director and the writer,</i>

13
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>I really created it all myself.</i>

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,723
<i>I think that's important to bear in mind.</i>

15
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,892
<i>Especially because,
while I've been talking,</i>

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>you've already seen
the work of two other directors,</i>

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,569
<i>not to mention
the insanely large village,</i>

18
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>possibly a metropolitan area,</i>

19
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>full of people who are working
in every frame</i>

20
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,705
<i>to fulfil whatever vision
it was I thought I had.</i>

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,584
<i>One thing about this movie
that you're gonna hear a lot</i>

22
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:28,213
<i>is how extraordinary the crew,</i>

23
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,259
<i>the post, the pre, uh,
the production people,</i>

24
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>how they not just carried or fulfilled,
but inspired this movie,</i>

25
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>which begins with
this rather iconic image.</i>

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>Um...</i>

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>A very deliberate decision on my part</i>

28
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>was to start off with the hardest thing
in the movie from the first one,</i>

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,198
<i>what we refer to as the "tie-in shot."</i>

30
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>Rather than getting
the Avengers back together,</i>

31
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,621
<i>I wanted to say right up front,
"No, they're in it.</i>

32
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,207
<i>"And here's the very climax
of the first film.</i>

33
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,627
<i>"Here's the very thing
you always showed up for,</i>

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>"all of these guys in one enormous shot</i>

35
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,593
<i>"with a big slow-mo, kind of,
uh, comic book panel moment."</i>

36
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,220
<i>And my original concept had been that</i>

37
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,098
<i>the very first frame
would be the slow-motion part.</i>

38
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:24,478
<i>Kevin Feige very rightly argued
that without some context,</i>

39
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>people just wouldn't know
what they were seeing, um,</i>

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,234
<i>and wouldn't appreciate it as much
as they would at the end of the shot.</i>

41
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,281
<i>Which, um, turned out to be very true.</i>

42
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,826
<i>When I talk about the other directors...</i>

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,747
<i>There was a short shot
of people running up the stairs</i>

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,001
<i>that my producer, Jeremy Latcham,
went ahead and got</i>

45
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>with our "C" cameraman, Sam,
while we were in Dover Castle,</i>

46
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>which is right here and played
as the interior of the fortress.</i>

47
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,637
<i>Um...</i>

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,140
<i>We were mostly stuck in big,
beautiful rooms filled with equipment,</i>

49
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,976
<i>and there are
so many lovely little spaces.</i>

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,730
<i>He said, "Shouldn't we go
and get soldiers running about,</i>

51
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,983
<i>"and show some
of the stairwells and the halls,</i>

52
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,903
<i>"and all the things that make this space
more than just big rooms?"</i>

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,364
<i>And we ended up
using a lot of that footage.</i>

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>It was just grand.</i>

55
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,828
<i>And, of course, the other director
I'm referring to is John Mahaffie,</i>

56
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,123
<i>who is an actual director,
um, the second-unit director,</i>

57
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,460
<i>who shot so much great footage
for this movie.</i>

58
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,464
<i>I shot about 100 days, he shot over 50.</i>

59
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,174
<i>And some of them are elaborate.</i>

60
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,302
<i>That's another,
what I was referring to before.</i>

61
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,765
<i>Some of the more elaborate stuff
inevitably gets shot by second unit</i>

62
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>because the characters in it are CG,</i>

63
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>and requires camera setups
that take hours and hours.</i>

64
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,024
<i>And so on the one hand,</i>

65
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,944
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
<i>I, being the most important director,</i>

66
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,948
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
<i>the director of the first unit,</i>

67
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>I'm busy getting really
the heart of the piece,</i>

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,414
<i>and he's getting these secondary shots.</i>

69
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,667
<i>Except that the "secondary shots"
he was getting,</i>

70
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,712
<i>I just used air quotes,
you can't tell, but I did,</i>

71
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>were very much
some of the most beautiful footage</i>

72
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>that was shot in the film.</i>

73
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,052
<i>And I started to feel
like Reaction-Shot Joe.</i>

74
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,723
<i>I would just see these glorious things
he'd stitch together, and then I'd...</i>

75
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,558
<i>There'd be a close-up
of somebody reacting to it.</i>

76
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>I was like, "That's me! I did that.
I'm also a part of the team."</i>

77
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,772
<i>Um...</i>

78
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,566
<i>Because the team
is how this gets done.</i>

79
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,779
<i>You're gonna find that's also part
of what we have to say in the movie.</i>

80
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>But in the making of the movie,
it's very much the same thing.</i>

81
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,034
<i>Both of these guys,</i>

82
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>Thomas Kretschmann
and Henry Goodman,</i>

83
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,792
<i>extraordinary thespians, who would
come in to do smaller roles.</i>

84
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>I actually said, "If we made a movie
with only the day players..."</i>

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,465
<i>They worked more than that,</i>

86
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,676
<i>but just literally people
who were there for just a day.</i>

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>"...we'd have the most star-studded
cast you could work with."</i>

88
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,474
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

89
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,267
<i>It's probably a terrible thing
about the industry</i>

90
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,894
<i>that you can get amazing actors</i>

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>to play these smaller roles
in franchise films, but it works for me.</i>

92
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,240
<i>So I asked the question,
"Why would I do this, again?"</i>

93
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,827
<i>And the main answer was</i>

94
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,329
<i>because I wanted to make a new movie.</i>

95
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
<i>A different Avengers movie.</i>

96
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,041
<i>And while providing the things</i>

97
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,501
<i>that people expect
from the</i> Avengers <i>movie,</i>

98
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>i.e. the tie-in shot that you saw before,</i>

99
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:42,676
<i>I also wanted to not just tell
a different story, but tell it differently.</i>

100
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,930
<i>And a lot of that can be seen</i>

101
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>in the editing and framing
and general style, the lenses.</i>

102
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,610
<i>In the first film, I was very slavish to 3D.</i>

103
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,406
<i>I was playing it as though
anything not in the vernacular of3D</i>

104
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,992
<i>was going to be
confusing for the audience.</i>

105
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,702
<i>And in the couple of years in-between,</i>

106
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,121
<i>it became clear that,
that isn't really the case.</i>

107
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:16,042
<i>And, besides, 3D really spoke
to the way I was used to shooting.</i>

108
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,586
<i>I like wide lenses.</i>

109
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,381
<i>I like understanding
the space around me very clearly.</i>

110
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,675
<i>I didn't like a lot of heavy cutting.</i>

111
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
<i>I liked shots that would deliberately go</i>

112
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>from one place to another,
very old-fashioned.</i>

113
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,516
<i>For the second film, I wanted to do</i>

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>something unlike
anything I had really done.</i>

115
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,024
<i>It's a little bit like the film
I shot right before,</i>

116
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,903
Much Ado About Nothing,
<i>which was kind of...</i>

117
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,279
<i>We had a bunch of great actors</i>

118
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,281
<i>standing around,
speaking Shakespeare,</i>

119
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,201
<i>and, as often as possible,
three cameras,</i>

120
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:54,915
<i>occasionally four, at least two,
getting them.</i>

121
00:06:54,998 --> 00:07:00,670
<i>And quick side note,
the mercenary who speaks right here...</i>

122
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,339
SOLDIER: No, it wasn't.

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,052
WHEDON: <i>That was a bit I added
very late in editing.</i>

124
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,596
<i>And that's actually Jeffrey Ford,
one of the editors,</i>

125
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>who just, uh, did it on a mic in the room,</i>

126
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,852
<i>and we liked it so well, we kept it.</i>

127
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,316
<i>You're also gonna hear his name
and Lisa Lassek's name,</i>

128
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,652
<i>those editors who...</i>

129
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,822
<i>I don't wanna say saved my life,
but I just did.</i>

130
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,284
<i>They are so much a part of
everything that works in this movie.</i>

131
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,203
<i>I'm incredibly grateful.</i>

132
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:38,041
<i>Lot of moving parts,
partially because of the way, um, I, uh...</i>

133
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,878
<i>As I said,
I wanted to shoot this differently.</i>

134
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,254
<i>Where the first one was very deliberate,</i>

135
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>this one was deliberately casual.</i>

136
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,549
Yay.

137
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,718
WHEDON: <i>That little "Yay," by the way,</i>

138
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,804
<i>for which both Robert and I
have been given credit,</i>

139
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,057
<i>was actually Jeremy Latcham,
again, saying,</i>

140
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>"He needs to make a noise there,"
um, in post-production.</i>

141
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,812
<i>And I was like, "Oh, no, he doesn't.</i>

142
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>"We could do it,
but no one's gonna hear it."</i>

143
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,652
<i>So, he gets all the credit for that.</i>

144
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,447
<i>And we have to talk about ILM, too,</i>

145
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:13,576
<i>and the extraordinary work they did
with the Hulk and with Ultron.</i>

146
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,540
<i>I mean, what they did
in the first movie was amazing,</i>

147
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>but this is a completely different level.</i>

148
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,169
<i>This is a real performance.</i>

149
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:27,048
<i>And even with all the reference
that Mark gave them,</i>

150
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>it's something that has
to be crafted pixel by pixel,</i>

151
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,012
<i>and then made human.</i>

152
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>And I can never
stop looking at these guys.</i>

153
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,560
<i>Because, again,
with all of these cameras</i>

154
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>and this very different way of shooting,</i>

155
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,481
<i>we ended up with something like that,
an over,</i>

156
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,025
<i>where you see just a blurry shoulder.</i>

157
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,779
<i>That blurry shoulder is about
as expensive as a face.</i>

158
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,951
<i>It's something we could never do
in the first movie.</i>

159
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,454
<i>But we talked about it specifically</i>

160
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:03,126
<i>as wanting to have the Hulk play
a character in the film, not an effect,</i>

161
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:09,049
<i>and to use the same casual vernacular
when we were shooting him</i>

162
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:13,511
<i>as we would with
any of the other, um, players.</i>

163
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:20,226
<i>And their thing, the idea that Natasha
has this power over the Hulk,</i>

164
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,066
<i>and obviously
this, uh, budding romance with Banner,</i>

165
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,943
<i>really came from that scene.</i>

166
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,362
<i>That's where it all started.</i>

167
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,241
<i>The idea of the lullaby
as how they deal with him</i>

168
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:40,205
<i>spiralled up into the idea that</i>

169
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,709
<i>Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff
are actually very similar.</i>

170
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:50,340
<i>And so the scene
always made perfect sense to me,</i>

171
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,469
<i>and we had Scarlett's side of it,</i>

172
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,430
<i>but we really didn't have the scene</i>

173
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,767
<i>until just a few weeks
before we delivered the film.</i>

174
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,105
<i>And even I was kind of stunned</i>

175
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:12,153
<i>by the physicality, the sensuality,
and the emotion of that encounter.</i>

176
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>And it's one of those things
where you all say, "This will work,"</i>

177
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,369
<i>but then you get to feel it,</i>

178
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,123
<i>and it's like nobody
ever told you about it.</i>

179
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,084
<i>It's an extraordinary thing
to work on something for two years</i>

180
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,379
<i>and not understand it until you see it.</i>

181
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,464
<i>Or not understand
the power it will have.</i>

182
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,591
(GROWLING)

183
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,521
<i>It's fun to kill the Avengers.
I recommend it.</i>

184
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,566
<i>I particularly like the little twitch
from the Hulk. I wanted very much</i>

185
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,362
<i>the sort of dying bison,</i>

186
00:10:54,445 --> 00:11:01,411
<i>kind of little spasmodic thing
with the spears sticking out of him.</i>

187
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,581
<i>And they gave me that.</i>

188
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,167
<i>They gave me this broken shield.</i>

189
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,419
<i>Look carefully at the way
the shield is broken,</i>

190
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,004
<i>because that's actually something</i>

191
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:17,218
<i>that I put in for just a few people.</i>

192
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,849
<i>You'll see that shape again</i>

193
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:27,187
<i>at the end of the movie
when Wanda tears...</i>

194
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:34,194
<i>With her magic, she tears
Ultron's vibranium chest apart.</i>

195
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,531
<i>And we very deliberately
had her do that,</i>

196
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,619
<i>had it come apart
in the exact same shape</i>

197
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>as his vision of disaster.</i>

198
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,335
<i>Because we wanted to say,</i>

199
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,046
<i>"She's great,
and it's great that she's so powerful,</i>

200
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,673
<i>"but what if it wasn't great?"</i>

201
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,052
<i>In a way that one-and-a-half people
would recognise.</i>

202
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:04,766
<i>I think I said, "Five people
in the audience will cheer at this."</i>

203
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,727
<i>And Kevin Feige said,
"Yes, but I will be one of them."</i>

204
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,026
<i>It was a big decision whether to
go off on her smile or this grab.</i>

205
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:22,659
<i>Ultimately,
the grab very specifically said,</i>

206
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,538
<i>"We have a problem,
and the problem is Tony."</i>

207
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:33,253
<i>And, um, one of the things that also
sort of hit me late in the game</i>

208
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,923
<i>is that you can really look at this film
and just straight-up say,</i>

209
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,800
<i>"Tony Stark is the villain."</i>

210
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,261
<i>It's not just the beard.</i>

211
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,724
<i>He's a good man
who is corrupted by his own anxiety,</i>

212
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,394
<i>by this vision of a disaster,</i>

213
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:55,108
<i>and makes what is obviously
a really bad decision.</i>

214
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>And I spent so much time in
the writing process and during filming</i>

215
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,408
<i>trying to protect Tony Stark.</i>

216
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,452
<i>Trying to make sure
that he was still a heroic figure.</i>

217
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,997
<i>And at one point I watched the movie,</i>

218
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,625
<i>and I went, "You can just go ahead
and lean into this,</i>

219
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,505
<i>"that he's now evolved into a villain."</i>

220
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,048
<i>Obviously, he's not just that.</i>

221
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,678
<i>He's redeemed,
and he is a hero in so many ways.</i>

222
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,558
<i>But it was very freeing to be able...</i>

223
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,852
<i>And I think it's not something
you get to do a lot</i>

224
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,146
<i>in something like this, narratively.</i>

225
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:39,110
<i>To just go ahead and say,
"Your guy just might not be okay."</i>

226
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:44,490
<i>And again, that's something that,
thematically, the entire movie is about.</i>

227
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>It's been commented on,
and it's not by accident</i>

228
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:53,666
<i>that the word "monster" is used
by most of the team</i>

229
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,752
<i>about either themselves or each other.</i>

230
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,378
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

231
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,464
WHEDON: <i>I have
a "Jarvis is my co-pilot" sticker</i>

232
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,548
<i>on my laptop.</i>

233
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,342
<i>Because how could you not?</i>

234
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,344
<i>That's one of those things
that I thought of</i>

235
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,971
<i>and asked for while we were shooting.</i>

236
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,306
<i>"Can we just throw that in?"</i>

237
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,436
<i>And the prop guys just disappeared
and came back with the perfect one.</i>

238
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,564
<i>And, of course,
it comes right after he says,</i>

239
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,815
<i>"Jarvis, take the wheel,"</i>

240
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,486
<i>so clearly we're already leaning
into the Jesus thing.</i>

241
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,073
<i>And that's, um, again, not by accident.</i>

242
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,909
<i>We're not saying anything specific
about religion,</i>

243
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:32,163
<i>but we are playing on
Christian iconography a great deal,</i>

244
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,501
<i>partially because both Tony Stark
and Ultron have god complexes,</i>

245
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:42,340
<i>and partially because the Vision
himself does represent an ideal.</i>

246
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,177
<i>And when he picks up
the hammer, it's...</i>

247
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,054
<i>I don't want to say a miracle,</i>
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

248
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,225
<i>But it's playing on that idea of...</i>

249
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,728
<i>When we think
of that kind of religious figure,</i>

250
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,649
<i>we are thinking of
the best idea of ourselves.</i>

251
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,734
<i>Of what we wish we could be.</i>

252
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:06,364
<i>And this play is so much
about the best and worst.</i>

253
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,075
<i>This little bit's a bit of embellishment</i>

254
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,911
<i>that Robert and I came up with
on the day.</i>

255
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,413
The two Enhanced?

256
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,707
WHEDON: <i>It's always nice to be able
to have people</i>

257
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,126
<i>who know their character so well</i>

258
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>that they can give you
what you've asked for,</i>

259
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,172
<i>but then make it feel lived in.</i>

260
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,257
<i>I love this shot.</i>

261
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,718
<i>It is very much of the idiom
of the first movie, in the sense of,</i>

262
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>"Look at this big, expensive space.
Isn't it grand?"</i>

263
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,810
<i>And I love the two of them.</i>

264
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,147
<i>I did at one point realise</i>

265
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,610
<i>that I had sort of turned Maria Hill
into a girl Friday in this movie,</i>

266
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,530
<i>because there were too many heroes
for her to do that much.</i>

267
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>But it makes it all the better, I think,
when she shows up in her old gear,</i>

268
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,955
<i>firing a gun like she should ought to.</i>

269
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,000
<i>This shot was very difficult.</i>

270
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>Again, one of the last shots we got.</i>

271
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:08,050
<i>Kevin is very leery of shots
that feel artificial,</i>

272
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>and when you are flying with someone</i>

273
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,639
<i>and you do a camera move
around them,</i>

274
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,350
<i>you're in great danger
of feeling artificial.</i>

275
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,896
<i>And so we worked hard in the colouring</i>

276
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,648
<i>and the way New York was
and in the textures,</i>

277
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,694
<i>to try and mitigate that and keep it real.</i>

278
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,779
<i>And then we went
right through that glass,</i>

279
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,866
<i>which is a beautifully crafted effect.</i>

280
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:39,290
<i>This shot is something slightly similar
to what I did in my first film,</i> Serenity,

281
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,919
<i>in that every member of the team is in it.</i>

282
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,505
<i>Not all of them speak,
but they are all visible at some point.</i>

283
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,382
<i>And we get, basically,
a tour of the place.</i>

284
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,886
<i>Obviously, because
they come in through the "A,"</i>

285
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,805
<i>it has only been referred to
as the "A-hole shot,"</i>

286
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,060
<i>but what it is for me
is a very important way</i>

287
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:04,732
<i>to explain the space of Avengers Tower
to the audience.</i>

288
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,400
<i>There is a bit of showing off.</i>

289
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,153
<i>There is a bit of,
"Look at all our grandeur."</i>

290
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:14,575
<i>But what I'm really doing is explaining
exactly where everything is</i>

291
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,870
<i>in relation to everything else,
because later on we will need to know.</i>

292
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,374
<i>Robots are down here,
and party's over here,</i>

293
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,961
<i>and Pietro is gonna be
standing on that glass later.</i>

294
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,046
<i>Charlie Wood designed the set,</i>

295
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,465
<i>and it's the biggest and one of</i>

296
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,926
<i>the most beautiful things
I've ever set foot on.</i>

297
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,512
<i>It is glorious.</i>

298
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,556
<i>Sometimes it's almost overwhelming.</i>

299
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:42,270
<i>And besides wanting to
show the scope of it,</i>

300
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:46,399
<i>to play into the epic nature of the thing,</i>

301
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,945
<i>it allowed me to come up with gags
like Pietro getting...</i>

302
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,072
<i>Like Hawkeye shooting out
the glass from under him.</i>

303
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,742
<i>And it allowed me to create action,</i>

304
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,996
<i>and also to just</i>

305
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,582
(CHUCKLING)
<i>have an enormous amount of fun.</i>

306
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,917
<i>Sometimes the least fun.</i>

307
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:10,923
<i>This particular space is so big
and that sort of holo area so empty</i>

308
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,509
<i>that it was sometimes
difficult to shoot in,</i>

309
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,012
<i>to figure out what to do with people.</i>

310
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,725
<i>But every frame is such candy</i>

311
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,105
<i>because the work these guys put into it,</i>

312
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,482
<i>building it and dressing it,</i>

313
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,611
<i>and the depth in frame
that you can get in these instances</i>

314
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>is never not exciting.</i>

315
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,576
<i>I literally finished shooting on this set,</i>

316
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,706
<i>and on that day walked into a corner
I had never been in downstairs,</i>

317
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,124
<i>and was like, "Wait a minute,</i>

318
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,086
<i>"there's 100 cool ideas
I have for this area."</i>

319
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,842
<i>There are two kinds of filming
that are really delightful.</i>

320
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,637
<i>One is this, kid in a candy store.</i>

321
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,055
<i>The other is the opposite,</i>

322
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,141
<i>when you have
kind of an impossible space.</i>

323
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,309
<i>I like that very much</i>

324
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:08,814
<i>because you become more inventive
in those instances.</i>

325
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,650
<i>You have to think on your feet.</i>

326
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,903
<i>You have to let the space
dictate the frame to an extent,</i>

327
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>and that makes it more real,
or just possibly more left of centre.</i>

328
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,120
<i>But in this instance,
I didn't mind the candy store.</i>

329
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:27,416
<i>And the "Science Brothers,"
as they are affectionately known.</i>

330
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>Any time these guys get together,
it's fun.</i>

331
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,174
<i>They're very different
in their energy as actors.</i>

332
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,054
<i>By the way, give me curved glass
and reflections that go on forever,</i>

333
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,640
<i>and there is no way I'm not shooting it.</i>

334
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,392
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

335
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,395
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

336
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,480
WHEDON: <i>Which, by the way,
was another difference in this film</i>

337
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:54,151
<i>than anything else I'd shot.</i>

338
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,364
<i>I would stop and say, "Wait a minute,
we're gonna get another setup.</i>

339
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,366
<i>"We're gonna do something</i>

340
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,745
<i>"just because I think we can
and should and it looks cool."</i>

341
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,372
<i>Generally, because of my background,</i>

342
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,792
<i>I have shot exactly
what I needed and nothing else.</i>

343
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>On this film, I shot everything I needed,</i>

344
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,505
<i>and then some things
I thought I might want.</i>

345
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,882
<i>Which during shooting
was very liberating and exciting,</i>

346
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>and because we moved so quickly,
was not a problem for the schedule.</i>

347
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,308
<i>During editing, interesting side note,</i>

348
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,811
(CHUCKLES) <i>it turned out to be
the worst idea in the world,</i>

349
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,731
<i>and I'm definitely going back
to shooting only what I need</i>

350
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,317
<i>because that amount
of choice can sometimes,</i>

351
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,113
<i>like a giant set, be too much.</i>

352
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,159
<i>This is one of those cute little ideas.</i>

353
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,952
<i>We're on a memory-head track,</i>

354
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:50,332
<i>so that we can do four different setups
in the exact same configuration</i>

355
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,003
<i>and tell the story quickly.</i>

356
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,216
<i>It's one of those cute ideas
that takes half a day at least</i>

357
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,845
<i>to give you 20 seconds of footage.</i>

358
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,308
<i>So I tried to have
fewer cute ideas after that.</i>

359
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,978
JARVIS: <i>I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

360
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,148
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

361
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,443
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

362
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,611
STARK: Thanks, buddy.

363
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,029
JARVIS: <i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

364
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,697
STARK: I always do.

365
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,415
WHEDON: <i>Oh, and now
we get to Mr. Spader.</i>

366
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,876
ULTRON: <i>What is this?</i>

367
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,630
WHEDON: <i>There's no way
I can say enough about</i>

368
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,882
<i>pretty much anybody in this cast.</i>

369
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,926
<i>But if you have to start somewhere, um,</i>

370
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>James Spader and Paul Bettany
is not a bad place to start.</i>

371
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:53,229
<i>They are so extraordinary together,
so much the people they wanted to be.</i>

372
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,358
<i>And with James we were creating
somebody completely new,</i>

373
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,903
<i>and with Paul we ended up doing
the same thing with the Vision.</i>

374
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:06,116
<i>Because I originally wrote
the Vision as Jarvis,</i>

375
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,494
<i>and then went back in and realised,</i>

376
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:13,624
<i>"No, he's much more enigmatic
and interesting than that."</i>

377
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,710
<i>And what Paul gave me</i>

378
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,840
<i>was beyond my best fantasy
of the Vision I'd read as a kid.</i>

379
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,300
<i>Didn't have a fantasy
of the Ultron I'd read as a kid</i>

380
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,262
<i>because he was always
just kind of mad.</i>

381
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,516
<i>So my idea for who he would be</i>

382
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,395
<i>was a sort of grand madness,
a weirdness.</i>

383
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,146
<i>Um... And, uh...</i>

384
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,275
ULTRON: <i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

385
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,820
WHEDON: <i>That line,
"Why do you call him 'sir'?"</i>

386
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,363
<i>Has so much menace.</i>

387
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:48,033
<i>But is also, again,
one of the central themes of the movie.</i>

388
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:54,790
<i>So much of this movie is about
power and class and privilege.</i>

389
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,044
<i>I mean, we looked at this, we were like,</i>

390
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,797
<i>"It's literally</i> Upstairs, Downstairs."
(CHUCKLES)

391
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,632
<i>There's downstairs,</i>

392
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,885
<i>the Legion who come in
through the back door,</i>

393
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,720
<i>upstairs, the heroes.</i>

394
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,640
<i>And that scene, by the way,
was added in post.</i>

395
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:20,774
<i>I felt that we could very clearly explain
the problem that Ultron was having</i>

396
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,613
<i>and create a scene
that really made you feel for Jarvis.</i>

397
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,325
<i>Kevin and Jeremy, who really fought</i>

398
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,203
<i>for Jarvis' presence
to be increased throughout the movie.</i>

399
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,248
<i>I had always intended
to make him the Vision.</i>

400
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,919
<i>They kept insisting,</i>

401
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,672
<i>"We want more. We want a visual.</i>

402
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>"We want everyone to mourn him.
We want him to be treated like a guy."</i>

403
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:55,601
<i>And I didn't really understand
the need for that the way they did.</i>

404
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,437
<i>And then putting it together,
it was clear,</i>

405
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,440
<i>"Oh, yeah, wait a minute, this guy,
he was there at the beginning.</i>

406
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,945
<i>"He was there in the first few minutes
of the first</i> Iron Man."

407
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:12,534
<i>And people have a bond with him
that is palpable and very human.</i>

408
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,792
<i>There are many versions of this scene,
some of them including the actresses.</i>

409
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,212
<i>One of the great things about
working with this many stars is</i>

410
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,633
<i>you never know who you're gonna get,
what schedule is gonna work out,</i>

411
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,177
<i>who's suddenly gonna
become available.</i>

412
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,933
<i>But when it became apparent
that neither was going to show up,</i>

413
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:40,562
<i>I thought it was important
to plant a flag on that and say,</i>

414
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:46,276
<i>"Well, that's something
that registers with our guys."</i>

415
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,446
<i>And the best way to do that
was to have them be dicks about it.</i>

416
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,244
I fly it right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet.

417
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,662
WHEDON: <i>This was, again,</i>

418
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,832
<i>something that I thought of
on the day after we shot,</i>

419
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,251
<i>or while we were shooting the first half.</i>

420
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,752
<i>And it's one of those things</i>

421
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,838
<i>without which
the first half doesn't even work.</i>

422
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,175
<i>The payoff of him being all prideful
about his successful story</i>

423
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,345
<i>is one of the funniest things in the party.</i>

424
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,806
LEE: Neither was
Omaha Beach, blondie.

425
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,433
Stop trying to scare us.

426
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,935
WHEDON: <i>I liked the idea,
the texture of the idea</i>

427
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,772
<i>that Thor has something that could
actually get Captain America drunk,</i>

428
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,985
<i>because, as he explained
in the first movie...</i>

429
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,863
<i>I don't know who that actor was,
by the way.</i>

430
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:35,409
<i>He's really good, he's very familiar,
uh, the veteran.</i>

431
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,203
<i>But we were lucky to get him. I just...</i>

432
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,039
<i>The name isn't coming to me.</i>

433
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,123
<i>Um...</i>

434
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,334
<i>No, it was so much fun
to be able to do that.</i>

435
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:49,048
<i>And he used "Excelsior" here
as "I'm so wasted, '</i>' (CHUCKLES)

436
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>Um, since I grew up with that phrase.</i>

437
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,597
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

438
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,808
WHEDON: <i>One of the other great things
about a movie like this</i>

439
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,811
<i>and the opportunities
they gave me with the actors,</i>

440
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,774
<i>the locations, the scenarios,
and the moods, and everything else,</i>

441
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,777
<i>was that you feel like
you're making 13 different movies.</i>

442
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,780
<i>And I'm very much...</i>

443
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,908
<i>Apart from actually having ADHD,
which I do,</i>

444
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,660
<i>I'm very much a fan of things
that change it up.</i>

445
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,579
<i>And this was one of the instances,</i>

446
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,082
<i>because they are both
so beautiful and charming,</i>

447
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,335
<i>where we all sort of went,
"When can we just make this movie?"</i>

448
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,090
<i>I actually said to them,
to Mark and Scarlett,</i>

449
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,009
<i>"You guys should do</i> The Thin Man."

450
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,137
<i>And they both asked me
what</i> The Thin Man <i>was,</i>

451
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:41,183
<i>which makes me feel
that, uh, the Earth is doomed.</i>

452
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:47,272
<i>But their energy there is so great,
and to be able to lean into it visually</i>

453
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,774
<i>and just go ahead and say,</i>

454
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:53,403
<i>"Let's pretend we're in the '40s,"
is a delight.</i>

455
00:26:55,322 --> 00:27:00,369
<i>And leads to, um,
the after-party that's coming up,</i>

456
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,748
<i>which is a more well-known bit.</i>

457
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,585
<i>And it's interesting because this stuff,
particularly with them,</i>

458
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,964
<i>is very sort of studied. Again,</i>

459
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:17,094
<i>because I was going into
a slightly older visual template,</i>

460
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,222
<i>the camerawork is
somewhat less frenetic.</i>

461
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,475
<i>Then we got into
shooting this next scene,</i>

462
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,146
<i>and it was also very elegant,</i>

463
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:31,817
<i>and the camera moves, it went from
here to there, and it was bombing.</i>

464
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,321
<i>And nobody was enjoying it,
the actors didn't feel funny,</i>

465
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,408
<i>their lines didn't sound funny,</i>
(CHUCKLES) <i>it just didn't work.</i>

466
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,661
<i>And to the point
where they're all standing there,</i>

467
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,665
<i>and I've got all of them
for one of the few times...</i>

468
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,293
<i>More times in this movie
than the first one,</i>

469
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,587
(CHUCKLING)
<i>but I've got every major actor</i>

470
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,339
<i>I've ever admired
standing in front of me,</i>

471
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,841
<i>and I'm just drawing a blank.</i>

472
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,552
<i>And I finally turned
to Jamie Christopher,</i>

473
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,846
<i>our awesome AD, and said,</i>

474
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,850
<i>"Can you help me?
Can you make it stop?"</i>

475
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,435
<i>And he just turned around and said,</i>

476
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,730
<i>"Thank you, everybody,
that's a good day. See you all at 8:00."</i>

477
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,945
<i>And then I just kept working,
and eventually figured out,</i>

478
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,490
<i>"Oh, I'm shooting this in a very...
Like it's</i> The Age of Innocence,

479
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,867
<i>"and it's a party."</i>

480
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,786
<i>And the whole point of this movie is
you're at the party.</i>

481
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,954
<i>You're invited.</i>

482
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,875
<i>And I realised I had literally,
with</i> Much Ado,

483
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,921
<i>just shot an entire movie where people
sit around and drink and talk.</i>

484
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:38,592
<i>And the fact that I couldn't figure out
how to shoot the after-party scene,</i>

485
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,471
<i>in a movie whose code name when
we were shooting it was "After Party,"</i>

486
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,642
<i>very deliberately, was the source
of some embarrassment.</i>

487
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:51,355
<i>But we came back in, the cameras
got looser, the lines got looser,</i>

488
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:55,317
<i>the cast got happier,
and it just started to flow.</i>

489
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,527
<i>And they're all so good.</i>

490
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,614
<i>And that montage was
one of the first things I pitched.</i>

491
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,782
You bet your ass.

492
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:08,205
WHEDON: <i>It wasn't until, um,
much later that I casually,</i>

493
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,915
<i>thinking it would not be well-received,</i>

494
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,001
<i>pitched the payoff
that will come later with the Vision.</i>

495
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,214
<i>I said, "You know, you could do this."</i>

496
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:23,011
<i>And it was Kevin who instantly knew
how important it would be,</i>

497
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,764
<i>and it is in fact the biggest
cheer moment in the film.</i>

498
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,108
ULTRON: No.

499
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,613
WHEDON: <i>I like robot stories
'cause they're Frankenstein stories.</i>

500
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,117
<i>And as you can see,
I leaned pretty heavily into that.</i>

501
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,869
<i>This guy, I always think of</i>

502
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,290
<i>as resembling the very first
movie of</i> Frankenstein,

503
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,458
<i>which I've only ever seen a still from.</i>

504
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,627
<i>But it's this weird, screaming,</i>

505
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>almost mummy-like guy
with tons of things,</i>

506
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:03,844
<i>of tattered cloth sort of
dripping off his arms.</i>

507
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:10,475
<i>And as much as puppet,
and as much as scary robot,</i>

508
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,896
<i>I wanted to evoke that,
the very first</i> Frankenstein <i>film.</i>

509
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,359
Frankenstein, <i>robots,</i>

510
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,737
<i>it all has to do with</i>

511
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,656
<i>the central human question of,</i>

512
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,409
<i>"Why am I here? What is this, please?"</i>
(CHUCKLES)

513
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,912
<i>Because we all have to ask that,</i>

514
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:34,499
<i>and we all have to feel the pain
of being brought into a world</i>

515
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,628
(CHUCKLES) <i>that was not made
to accommodate us.</i>

516
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,676
<i>And the Frankenstein story,
and most robot movies</i>

517
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,181
<i>where the robot is anything other than
a killing machine, deal with that pain.</i>

518
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,768
<i>And very baldly.</i>

519
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,896
<i>It's one of the things,
like superheroes...</i>

520
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,484
<i>By the way, that was Mark on the day,
that was not me.</i>

521
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,569
(CHUCKLING) <i>That was Mark's call.</i>

522
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,238
<i>He's a shameless physical comedian.</i>

523
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,451
<i>If you look at the DVD extras,
you'll see even more of that stuff.</i>

524
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,619
<i>God bless him.</i>

525
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,748
<i>But that idea of "Why am I here?"</i>

526
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,377
<i>The way it gets simplified in the
robot story is really fascinating to me.</i>

527
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,338
<i>Because we come back to it</i>

528
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,216
<i>because we can really ask
what it is to be human,</i>

529
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,928
<i>when we take away
every part of being human but one.</i>

530
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,973
<i>Or we take away
just one particular aspect.</i>

531
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:39,815
<i>And in this humanity,
our foibles and what we are as people,</i>

532
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,861
<i>as parents, as powerful,
as alliterative, we...</i>

533
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,281
<i>All of those questions
have to be asked in stories like this.</i>

534
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,366
Come on! That's the one.

535
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,492
<i>...is unsafe.</i>

536
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,998
WHEDON: <i>The Avengers have
so much power at the beginning of this,</i>

537
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,835
<i>and one of the things that I knew,
and I had this problem in the first one,</i>

538
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,421
<i>is nobody roots for the overdog.</i>

539
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:09,177
<i>And so it was very important to me
that they be brought down a peg,</i>

540
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:14,516
<i>but not just by circumstance,
but because they have...</i>

541
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,311
<i>In Tony's case, dramatically,
but in every case to an extent,</i>

542
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,690
<i>lost some aspect of the mission.</i>

543
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,902
<i>Lost some aspect of their humanity,</i>

544
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,448
<i>because that's the thing
about being a superhero,</i>

545
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,908
<i>it's the thing about having power.</i>

546
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:38,457
<i>When your decisions affect more than
the people around you, inevitably,</i>

547
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,000
<i>you are going to destroy something.</i>

548
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:45,130
<i>You're going to harm someone in
a way that removes you from humanity.</i>

549
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,633
<i>The more power you have, inevitably,</i>

550
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,137
<i>the less a part of
the human community you are.</i>

551
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,308
<i>And so Ultron himself says that,</i>

552
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,644
<i>although he doesn't always realise
how much it applies to him.</i>

553
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,605
<i>And once again, the Frankenstein.</i>

554
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,484
<i>And also the Pinocchio,
which was, by the way,</i>

555
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,404
<i>an idea I had for the Comic-Con teaser</i>

556
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:15,368
<i>that played so nicely,
it got used a whole bunch.</i>

557
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,662
<i>And then I ended up saying,</i>

558
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:22,709
<i>"Let's just go ahead and stick it
in the film because it is creepy."</i>

559
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,296
<i>She's picking glass
out of her feet there, by the way.</i>

560
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,009
<i>In the longer version
of the fight we had just seen,</i>

561
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:38,225
<i>Maria slid down and jumped in
after Rhodey in her bare feet.</i>

562
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,271
<i>And the jacket she's wearing,
by the way,</i>

563
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,525
<i>is Steve Rogers' bomber jacket,</i>

564
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,069
<i>which I have yet to hear
anybody comment on.</i>

565
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,655
<i>But I thought it was
an interesting little detail.</i>

566
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,908
<i>I wanted to, obviously,
make them more casual.</i>

567
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,702
<i>And we had to sort of</i>

568
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,540
<i>"de-mom" her makeup a little bit
when she arrived on set,</i>

569
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:06,545
<i>and kind of make sure she felt
as cool as everyone else.</i>

570
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,214
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

571
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,590
Thor. The Legionnaire.

572
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,052
WHEDON: <i>This was the scene,
as I mentioned,</i>

573
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,805
<i>where I, um, really struggled.</i>

574
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,978
<i>I struggled because with no central</i>

575
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,399
<i>sort of object to build around,</i>

576
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,945
<i>'cause it's an empty space where
we were gonna put a Jarvis later,</i>

577
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,824
<i>and with no intense
sort of source of light,</i>

578
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:42,163
<i>I really wasn't sure where to put people</i>

579
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,249
<i>and how to get them
where they needed to go emotionally.</i>

580
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,044
<i>Especially because Robert has
a really difficult job in this scene</i>

581
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,630
<i>of cracking up in the middle of</i>

582
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>the worst thing he's ever done.</i>

583
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:58,346
<i>And to me, it was really important,
and Robert, too.</i>

584
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,599
<i>The moment I pitched it to him,
he latched on to it.</i>

585
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:04,603
<i>He's like, "I do that
whenever I'm busted. I can't help it.</i>

586
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:09,190
<i>"It's so bad. I get nervous, I giggle."
But I also think there's something...</i>

587
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,942
<i>I feel like Tony's...</i>

588
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:15,780
<i>There's a little bit of the Asperger's,
being on the spectrum with him,</i>

589
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,659
<i>where he's just, um... He's not quite...</i>

590
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,704
<i>He's just not good at people.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

591
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,460
<i>And for me, again,
that was something to lean into.</i>

592
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,504
<i>And ultimately, my whole</i>

593
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:36,051
<i>"Tony is the villain" thesis
nicely plays into it as well.</i>

594
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:41,139
<i>And again, "villain" doesn't
necessarily mean "mwah-ha evil,"</i>

595
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:46,478
<i>because here you see his pain</i>

596
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,689
<i>and the sort of epic nature
of his heroism.</i>

597
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:56,029
<i>Which is contrasted, as usual,
with the very simple nature of Steve's.</i>

598
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,577
<i>And Tony is a guy
who likes to do the math.</i>

599
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,830
<i>And Steve is a guy
who understands the situation he's in,</i>

600
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,457
<i>and is looking out
for the people around him.</i>

601
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,753
<i>In the DVD extras,</i>

602
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,048
<i>you'll also be able to see
a scene between the two of them</i>

603
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,883
<i>that comes before this.</i>

604
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,429
<i>Ultimately, it was an attempt
to show them in the community,</i>

605
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,975
<i>and how they were a bit rebellious,
but also very much community-minded.</i>

606
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,231
<i>It became apparent that the two of them</i>

607
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,817
<i>walking into a dark room,
looking for something,</i>

608
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,945
<i>and then talking to someone
who had clearly called them there,</i>

609
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,781
<i>gave us the information
that we needed,</i>

610
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,450
<i>and also kept them
a little more mysterious.</i>

611
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,038
<i>The scene was so mundane,
and they were so...</i>

612
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,126
<i>Just such normal bickering siblings,</i>

613
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,627
<i>that it didn't...</i>

614
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,173
<i>Didn't really add to their grandeur.</i>

615
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,095
<i>This is the first time we see Ultron.</i>

616
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,265
<i>And I look back, and I'm...</i>

617
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,645
<i>The fact of him sitting in that chair
is very, sort of, based on the great,</i>

618
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,733
<i>sort of, John Buscema kind of...</i>

619
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:20,363
<i>"The tortured king and
the weight of the throne" kind of thing.</i>

620
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,409
<i>But then he stands up,
and that's how he's revealed.</i>

621
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,577
<i>And I thought,</i>

622
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,956
<i>"That's less cinematic
than it could have been," after the fact.</i>

623
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,625
ULTRON: Children...

624
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,711
WHEDON: <i>This little bit
that he says here</i>

625
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>is also really important in the theme.</i>

626
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,800
<i>Simply because
one of the first things I ever wrote</i>

627
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,929
<i>when sort of just freestyling
about Ultron in my head,</i>

628
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:50,435
<i>was that children all kill their parents,</i>

629
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,480
<i>because once you have them,</i>

630
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,107
<i>you no longer care
as much about yourself.</i>

631
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,402
<i>You accept your place
in the cycle of the world,</i>

632
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,070
<i>and you know that you'll die,</i>

633
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,073
<i>but there's something
more important to you than that.</i>

634
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,746
<i>And then,</i> (CHUCKLING)
<i>in parenthesis, I wrote,</i>

635
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,539
<i>'cause I was sending this
out as a memo,</i>

636
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,126
<i>"Don't worry, nothing like that
will ever appear in the film."</i>

637
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,753
<i>And then it actually did.</i>

638
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,548
<i>But I do think that a connection
that even I didn't make is</i>

639
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,551
<i>because so much of this
is about power...</i>

640
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:29,015
<i>Yet also, so much of it is about family,
and the responsibility we have</i>

641
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,894
<i>not just as leaders or as heroes,
but as parents.</i>

642
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:38,316
<i>There is no time when anybody
in the world understands</i>

643
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,237
<i>what the truly powerful can do</i>

644
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,989
<i>and go through, unless they're parents.</i>

645
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,450
<i>Until the moment they're parents.
And then, suddenly,</i>

646
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:51,079
<i>they have complete mastery
over somebody's mind.</i>

647
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,998
<i>Not forever.</i> (CHUCKLES)

648
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,669
<i>In the case of my kids,
not even for that long.</i>

649
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>But there is the ability</i>

650
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,468
<i>to uplift or destroy.</i>

651
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:12,600
<i>It is a perfect connection
between what is going on in this movie,</i>

652
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,855
<i>politically and thematically,
and what is going on personally.</i>

653
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,276
<i>This shot here is
one of my favourite shots in the film,</i>

654
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,239
<i>just the way Ultron listens.</i>

655
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:31,160
<i>Again, ILM, they had James Spader's
performance to work off of.</i>

656
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,996
<i>They had face-capture on him,</i>

657
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,499
<i>so he wore cameras
on his face the whole time.</i>

658
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:42,213
<i>But they really took it and used it,</i>

659
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:48,136
<i>and managed to make a man who's
made out of metal not just sound,</i>

660
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,764
<i>but move like Spader</i>

661
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,100
<i>and give the performance.</i>

662
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,477
<i>When James took the gig, he said,</i>

663
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,605
<i>"I don't wanna do voiceover work.</i>

664
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,442
<i>"I wanna be able to
give a performance."</i>

665
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,320
<i>And, my God, he did.</i>

666
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:10,408
<i>And they did such an extraordinary job
of capturing it,</i>

667
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:15,079
<i>so much so that when he is
standing there doing nothing,</i>

668
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,831
<i>I cannot stop looking at him.</i>

669
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,708
<i>I developed a huge...</i>

670
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,128
<i>Not even a man-crush,
like a teenage girl-crush on Ultron.</i>

671
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,965
<i>Like, I want a picture of him
over my bed,</i>

672
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,550
<i>and I wanna write
about him in my diary,</i>

673
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,928
<i>and I wonder if he's thinking about me.</i>

674
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,554
<i>He's just gorgeous.</i>

675
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,807
<i>'Course, there's a lot of gorgeous
to go around.</i>

676
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,310
<i>This bit, there was a lot more of.</i>

677
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:43,232
<i>We played the mystery of
"What's up with Barton?" a lot.</i>

678
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:47,528
<i>Is he still possessed? Is he villainous?
Is he something terrible?</i>

679
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,741
<i>Ultimately, we just kept the fact
that he says, "I don't have a girlfriend,"</i>

680
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,534
<i>and then later says, "Girlfriend."</i>

681
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,205
<i>My issue with it was simply...</i>

682
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,541
<i>I mean, people felt,
"Can we get some time out of here?"</i>

683
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,210
<i>My issue was, I've just felt that</i>

684
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,588
<i>people would only think
that he was talking to Fury.</i>

685
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,675
<i>Since he had been a S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent, and we've never seen Fury,</i>

686
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,386
<i>and we know that S.H.I.E.L.D. is gone,</i>

687
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,640
<i>that they wouldn't think
that he was up to something dire.</i>

688
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,434
<i>They would just think,
"Oh, he's listening to his old boss."</i>

689
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,980
<i>And the dancing I would have
to have gone through</i>

690
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,775
<i>to make that clear</i>

691
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,652
<i>that he wasn't,
just didn't seem worth the effort.</i>

692
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,779
<i>So we kept just a little bit of it. I miss it.</i>

693
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,864
<i>I miss the idea of,
"What's his dark secret?</i>

694
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,367
<i>"What's his dark secret?"
'Cause I think it's important.</i>

695
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,704
<i>His dark secret is obviously
the crux of the film.</i>

696
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,539
<i>And, I mean, the fulcrum,</i>

697
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:44,335
<i>the thing upon which
the entire film revolves, um, changes.</i>

698
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,426
<i>But I still think it works
even without all the buildup.</i>

699
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,220
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?

700
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,640
STARK: The strongest metal on Earth.

701
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,518
Where is this guy now?

702
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,732
WHEDON: <i>This is another
one of those shots</i>

703
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,734
<i>that I don't get to take the credit for.</i>

704
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,072
<i>We had so many
extraordinary cameramen,</i>

705
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,323
<i>and our pilot was amazing.</i>

706
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:19,996
<i>And Matthew went out to Bangladesh,
where these shipyards exist.</i>

707
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,165
<i>We had originally
been going to Wakanda,</i>

708
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:27,462
<i>but since we weren't using anybody
from</i> Black Panther, <i>it became...</i>

709
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,131
<i>We kept going less
and less to Wakanda,</i>

710
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,341
<i>till I referred to it as "Wa-kinda."</i>

711
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,760
<i>We're just sort of on the outskirts.</i>

712
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,637
<i>And it became a tease, and not worth it.</i>

713
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>But we wanted the vibranium dealer,</i>

714
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,228
<i>and the arms dealer, and all that.</i>

715
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:49,484
<i>So Klaue was the suggestion.
It was actually going through...</i>

716
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,860
<i>When we thought of it,</i>

717
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:55,823
<i>Jeremy went through
and looked at images of Klaue online,</i>

718
00:42:55,907 --> 00:43:01,079
<i>and some fan had put up Andy Serkis.</i>

719
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,580
<i>"What if Andy Serkis played Klaue?"</i>

720
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,083
<i>And obviously,
we were already working with Andy.</i>

721
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,920

00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,194
WHEDON: <i>Yeah,
this whole cutting pattern here</i>

867
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,946
<i>was created by Lisa.</i>

868
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,741
<i>These dreams were
obviously much longer,</i>

869
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,952
<i>but we got what we needed from them,</i>

870
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:09,043
<i>which was to know what
sort of drove everyone,</i>

871
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,964
<i>and to reopen old wounds
and to make them</i>

872
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,675
<i>as vulnerable as possible, obviously.</i>

873
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,179
<i>She remembers that she was trained</i>

874
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,892
<i>and even abused
into being an assassin,</i>

875
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:31,607
<i>and that she has a history of killing
and a very dark career.</i>

876
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,152
<i>Cap is incapable of being a part of</i>

877
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,863
<i>the community
he's constantly talking about.</i>

878
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,910
<i>And Thor feels that his powers</i>

879
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,540
<i>will destroy everything,</i>

880
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,086
<i>that he is not on the right path,
that he's out of control.</i>

881
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,216
<i>I'm not exactly sure
what Banner's dreaming right now.</i>

882
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:04,973
<i>We looked at some point-of-view shots,</i>

883
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:08,519
<i>but nothing we created</i>

884
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,689
<i>really sort of did as much
as just showing</i>

885
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,609
<i>how bonkers the Hulk was being,</i>

886
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,031
<i>because, ultimately, it doesn't matter.</i>

887
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,992
<i>What I said to the animators
and to Mark was,</i>

888
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,537
<i>"He feels like the world
is attacking him."</i>

889
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:32,668
<i>It's like he's in the middle
of a wasp's nest all the time.</i>

890
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,175
<i>One of the most difficult things
about animating the Hulk is</i>

891
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,761
<i>trying to figure out
what he's pissed about now.</i>

892
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,471
<i>'Cause when he's there for a long time,</i>

893
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,349
<i>he has to keep this very specific energy.</i>

894
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:52,229
<i>That shot in particular,
the doggy cam or dinner tray,</i>

895
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,232
<i>where you sort of attach
the camera to someone,</i>

896
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,653
<i>I first saw it in</i> Mean Streets,
<i>when Harvey Keitel's super drunk.</i>

897
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:07,077
<i>And fought very hard to keep that,
and they had to create it</i>

898
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,748
<i>stitched from bits of
what we had from the day.</i>

899
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,584
<i>But it really does give you a good sense</i>

900
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,588
<i>that the Hulk's not in his right mind,
even for the Hulk.</i>

901
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,339
<i>And the question of
what's making him angry</i>

902
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:23,051
<i>became, um,
easier and harder to answer,</i>

903
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,179
<i>because, um, the answer is everything.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

904
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,308
<i>So we knew we had
all the energy we needed,</i>

905
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,020
<i>but you still have to figure out
where he's looking,</i>

906
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,105
<i>what he thinks the problem is.</i>

907
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,734
<i>Here, for example,</i>

908
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:42,112
<i>he's flailing,
but then when he turns around,</i>

909
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,823
<i>you can see he actually
does get shot in the face.</i>

910
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,660
<i>This shot,
which is among my favourites,</i>

911
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,579
<i>is also among the most difficult,</i>

912
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:56,043
<i>because the Hulkbuster armour is...</i>

913
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,670
<i>It's known from the comics,
it's actually from after my time,</i>

914
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,924
<i>because I'm super old. But even I knew</i>

915
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,134
<i>you absolutely have to have Hulkbuster</i>

916
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:07,554
<i>because nobody is
capable of fighting the Hulk</i>

917
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,642
<i>except Tony, and the idea that</i>

918
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,895
<i>Banner himself had, had a hand
in devising this</i>

919
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,982
<i>made perfect emotional sense,</i>

920
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,945
<i>and also made for
what would be an exciting sequence.</i>

921
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,948
<i>The reason that,
that shot that I mentioned</i>

922
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,867
<i>was difficult and
not just delightful is that</i>

923
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,787
<i>Iron Man is inside the torso of this thing,</i>

924
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,416
<i>and that's a very difficult thing
to convey, to convey the size.</i>

925
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,754
<i>I look back and wonder</i>

926
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,590
<i>if I should've had him
appear behind the Hulk.</i>

927
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:48,679
<i>I wanted to do the Western standoff,</i>

928
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,139
<i>but it's very difficult,
even with people around him,</i>

929
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,517
<i>to realise this guy's 15-feet tall.</i>

930
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,478
<i>He's not quite twice the size of the Hulk,</i>

931
00:55:56,562 --> 00:56:02,067
<i>but he's up there, and when
they are all completely isolated</i>

932
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,988
<i>for most of the fight, it's very difficult
to really get the sense of that.</i>

933
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:12,953
<i>We're coming to something
that never fails to get a laugh,</i>

934
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,709
<i>which for a long time
was a real problem for me</i>

935
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,794
<i>because I didn't mean it as a joke.</i>

936
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:27,009
<i>I thought it would be cool
and obviously comic book-y,</i>

937
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,637
<i>but I didn't think of it
as a laugh moment.</i>

938
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,348
<i>And, by God, it is.
And I look at it now and I'm like,</i>

939
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:38,645
<i>"Well, it has a Warner Bros.
cartoon element to it."</i>

940
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,691
<i>But I love it when I actually don't get</i>

941
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,986
<i>the emotional gauge of what I'm doing,
because I feel like</i>

942
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,906
<i>if I'm getting more than I expected
from something,</i>

943
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,741
<i>or even something
completely unexpected,</i>

944
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:55,412
<i>it makes it more than
just efficient storytelling.</i>

945
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,706
<i>It makes it something that's alive.</i>

946
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,293
<i>There's the elevator gag.</i>

947
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:05,088
<i>Federico, one of the storyboard guys,
had worked that out,</i>

948
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,799
<i>and then we changed
the space we were in,</i>

949
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:13,180
<i>but we couldn't not have the
elevator gag because it felt so good.</i>

950
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,933
<i>Now the Hulk is
pretty much invulnerable,</i>

951
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:20,103
<i>so having him spit out a tooth
was a big deal,</i>

952
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:23,023
<i>and getting the emotional register
of that thing was a big deal, too,</i>

953
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,109
<i>because the instinct was, for everyone,</i>

954
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:30,447
<i>for him to be twitchy and monstrous
and all the things that</i>

955
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,075
<i>he had been in the scene, and
this was one of those things where,</i>

956
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,577
<i>"No, you need to take licence."</i>

957
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:40,040
<i>When he turns around,
he needs to be very quietly,</i>

958
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,377
<i>like the kind of
"calm before the storm" pissed.</i>

959
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,964
<i>I was like, "More Robert Mitchum,
more Robert Mitchum."</i>

960
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,882
<i>That's what I kept saying,
and people were like,</i>

961
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,385
<i>"We have no idea
what you mean by that."</i>

962
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,888
<i>But that kind of cool,</i>

963
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,557
<i>which may be a bit of a cheat?</i>

964
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:02,354
<i>Now this was quite a showpiece.</i>

965
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:05,649
<i>Delicate.</i> (CHUCKLES)

966
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,985
<i>I know, "delicate" is
a weird word to use right now.</i>

967
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:15,033
<i>Delicate for us, um, because even now,
many years later,</i>

968
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,830
<i>the last thing we wanna do is</i>

969
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,875
<i>egregiously evoke the spectre of 9/11.</i>

970
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:33,760
<i>And being, uh, callous about that
is unthinkable.</i>

971
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:38,974
<i>But, at the same time,
it was very important to me,</i>

972
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,519
<i>because it's part of
what this movie is about,</i>

973
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,479
<i>that there be a price,</i>

974
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,190
<i>that there be real damage, that we say,</i>

975
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:51,695
<i>"You don't just bust up a whole city,
and nobody suffers for it."</i>

976
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:56,366
<i>This, it informs the end of the movie,</i>

977
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,119
<i>and what the mission is,
and what the stakes are.</i>

978
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,583
<i>We originally shot it
that he changed back to Banner,</i>

979
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:11,214
<i>and was looking around and seeing
what he'd done, but I thought,</i>

980
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:15,093
<i>late in the game, that it would be
more effective if the Hulk himself</i>

981
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:19,222
<i>was able to register it,
and that it became stronger than</i>

982
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,975
<i>whatever spell
Tony had knocked out of him.</i>

983
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,645
<i>The only rule of science
I have in</i> Avengers <i>movies is,</i>

984
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,522
<i>"If somebody is mind-controlling you,</i>

985
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,566
<i>"then you get hit really hard,</i>

986
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,318
<i>"then it'll probably end."</i>

987
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,031
<i>That's actually all the science
that I know in the whole world.</i>

988
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:39,034
HILL: <i>...stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.</i>

989
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,329
So, run and hide?

990
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,914
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

991
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,875
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

992
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,127
(SIGHS) Neither do we.

993
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,424
(SIGHS)

994
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,469
Hey, you wanna switch out?

995
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,762
No, I'm good.

996
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:03,058
WHEDON: <i>This contains
the last vestige of the</i>

997
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,227
<i>"What the hell is Barton up to?"</i>

998
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,978
A safe house.

999
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,941
WHEDON: <i>He originally had a line,
"Where are you taking us?"</i>

1000
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,193
<i>"A place I hoped I'd never take you."</i>

1001
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,948
<i>But, on the day, all I could think was,
Tony would be like,</i>

1002
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,117
<i>"Uh, I'm definitely driving.
I don't know what that means,</i>

1003
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,701
<i>"but it sounds ominous."</i>

1004
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,538
<i>And it either sounded ominous
or heroical.</i>

1005
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,793
<i>So, him being all shifty and saying,
"Safe house," was just more efficient.</i>

1006
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,003
<i>This house, these grounds,</i>

1007
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:36,967
<i>we're on the Duke of Wellington's land
in England,</i>

1008
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,637
<i>trying to make it,
like Springfield in</i> The Simpsons,

1009
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,350
<i>every state in America,
so that they're just in America.</i>

1010
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,602
<i>"We live in America, USA."</i>

1011
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,273
<i>I have more to say
about the house and grounds,</i>

1012
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,775
<i>but first, let's talk about
the secret weapon.</i>

1013
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,610
This is an agent of some kind.

1014
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:58,238
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

1015
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,823
WHEDON: <i>And she was
a secret weapon</i>

1016
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:04,995
<i>because we had to keep Linda
out of all of the promo stuff,</i>

1017
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,790
<i>because the one secret
I was most anxious to protect</i>

1018
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,544
<i>was that Hawkeye's dark secret
is that he has a family.</i>

1019
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,423
<i>Chris there, by the way, just killing it.</i>

1020
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,426
<i>He did four hilarious reactions,</i>

1021
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,929
<i>which was great because,</i>

1022
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,348
<i>in our heads,
when the Avengers walked in here,</i>

1023
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,517
<i>it would be the strangest thing
in the world,</i>

1024
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:32,022
<i>but with only two of them in costume,
two or three,</i>

1025
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,275
<i>and the house being
so big and beautiful,</i>

1026
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,152
<i>they didn't look that out of place.</i>

1027
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:43,450
<i>And so for Evans to
keep doing very broad bits of,</i>

1028
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,786
<i>"What's going on here?"
was just a lifesaver.</i>

1029
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,288
Traitor.

1030
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:56,046
WHEDON: <i>There are two of these girls,
and if you colour them pink,</i>

1031
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,507
<i>they play John C. Reilly's daughter
in</i> Guardians of the Galaxy,

1032
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:02,177
(CHUCKLING) <i>which is not
something I knew when I shot this.</i>

1033
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,638
<i>But I'm sure</i>

1034
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,890
<i>they can do an entire
four-issue limited series</i>

1035
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:11,603
<i>as to how this girl's related
to somebody on another planet.</i>

1036
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,864
<i>This next shot some of you
may recognise from</i> The Searchers.

1037
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,368
<i>I realised I needed
that moment from Cap,</i>

1038
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,954
<i>and it's very central to his whole theme</i>

1039
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,916
<i>about not being able to be at home,
live a normal life.</i>

1040
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:39,506
<i>I did mention it to Jeremy Latcham,
who then wrote a memo to everyone</i>

1041
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:44,594
<i>because I said I need a little bit of
the interior of the house in this area.</i>

1042
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,847
<i>And he's like, "Joss wants to
do a shot from</i> The Searchers."

1043
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,599
<i>I was like, "Don't say it!"</i>

1044
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,227
<i>But as long as I don't say
anything on the DVD commentary,</i>

1045
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,438
<i>I think I should be fine, and
no one will know that I'm just a thief.</i>

1046
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,690
<i>A thief!</i>

1047
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,692
You are so cute.

1048
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,779
WHEDON: <i>This is a scene that was
in danger of being trimmed</i>

1049
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,699
<i>for the entire editing process,</i>

1050
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:12,247
<i>and ended up with
maybe one line pulled out.</i>

1051
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,876
<i>It's so crucial to see that...</i>

1052
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,465
<i>What a normal life is,
and what a normal perspective is</i>

1053
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,552
<i>on the Avengers and their life.</i>

1054
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:30,807
<i>And, again, Linda is just so earthy</i>

1055
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,228
<i>and so real, and you buy the two
of these guys together so much.</i>

1056
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:43,236
<i>She not only represents home
and hearth and how he's cool,</i>

1057
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:51,077
<i>she's so luminous that she's what
the Avengers can never have.</i>

1058
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,664
<i>And also, her face showed up
in the picture on the left,</i>

1059
01:03:54,748 --> 01:04:00,420
<i>which was a fortuitous thing
that we then highlighted even further</i>

1060
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:05,258
<i>because it looked so beautiful
in that wide shot, right there.</i>

1061
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,636
Things are changing for us.

1062
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:12,640
WHEDON: <i>She also just was dialled in
to the character from moment one,</i>

1063
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:19,189
<i>and she and Jeremy met
a couple days before we shot,</i>

1064
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:24,652
<i>and yet, the level of intimacy
is enormous.</i>

1065
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:31,659
<i>His respect for her
and for what this life means</i>

1066
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,204
<i>is so crucial.</i>

1067
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,710
<i>This is actually in Seoul, Korea.</i>

1068
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:44,631
<i>One of the great things
about doing this one</i>

1069
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,301
<i>and shooting from London
meant we could go everywhere.</i>

1070
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,012
<i>Where, in the first one,
we had to create places,</i>

1071
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,224
<i>in this one we could really go to them,</i>

1072
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,310
<i>and you find architecture like that,</i>

1073
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,897
<i>which you would not find,
even perhaps in your own imagination.</i>

1074
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,150
<i>So it's very exciting.</i>

1075
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,444
...is the next me.

1076
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,489
WHEDON: <i>Most of the stuff
in these labs</i>

1077
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:14,411
<i>was rewritten many times after the fact,</i>

1078
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:19,040
<i>and Claudia came in
to re-shoot a bunch of it</i>

1079
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,917
<i>as it sort of got moved around.</i>

1080
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,423
<i>There was so much exposition
that she and James had to give us,</i>

1081
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,884
<i>yet keep it dynamic,
which they did a good job with.</i>

1082
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,098
<i>That shot of the house and barn
is probably my last opportunity</i>

1083
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,726
<i>to explain that those places don't exist.</i>

1084
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,772
<i>They were built for the movie,
and we shot them for one day.</i>

1085
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:49,863
<i>We shot one day outside there,
and then they were gone.</i>

1086
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,656
<i>They built the interior of the house.</i>

1087
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,951
<i>The barn was an actual barn
in England.</i>

1088
01:05:55,034 --> 01:06:00,999
<i>And the design
is not completely dissimilar</i>

1089
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:05,462
<i>to the farm that I spent
a lot of my childhood on</i>

1090
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,130
<i>in Upstate New York.</i>

1091
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,634
<i>And it's a very comforting space.</i>

1092
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:15,054
<i>If that were real,
I would want to live there.</i>

1093
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,056
<i>But actually what really exists
on that field</i>

1094
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,977
<i>usually is not a house,
but very angry cows.</i>

1095
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,982
<i>Angry, angry, bitter cows.
I don't know what it is. They were just...</i>

1096
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,734
<i>They weren't pleasant.</i>

1097
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,237
That I was an Avenger.

1098
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,365
That I was anything more...

1099
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,534
WHEDON: <i>This scene,</i>

1100
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:42,040
<i>you only get the first two-thirds
of the scene in the movie.</i>

1101
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,583
<i>We cut out the end.</i>

1102
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:51,007
<i>People thought it would be,
and I agree in part, I do,</i>

1103
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,510
<i>that it would be better
to leave the question</i>

1104
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,679
<i>of whether they were together
without answering it.</i>

1105
01:06:56,763 --> 01:07:00,683
<i>But if you watch the scene
in the DVD extras,</i>

1106
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,310
<i>you see the whole scene,</i>

1107
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,438
<i>and you see just more of why</i>

1108
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,149
<i>I'm in love with these two people.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1109
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,693
<i>And I'm in love with their love,
and I'm in love with their pain.</i>

1110
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:14,781
<i>And they were so good on this day.</i>

1111
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:21,246
<i>And Mark and Scarlett only ever bring
goofy, happy energy to the set.</i>

1112
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,749
<i>But then you start the cameras,</i>

1113
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,918
<i>and they go to a place of pain</i>

1114
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:31,381
<i>that is just so human
and so excruciating.</i>

1115
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:38,721
<i>This scene caused my first-ever
completely un-ironic group hug</i>

1116
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,268
<i>because I was so proud of them
and what they did.</i>

1117
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,772
<i>I insisted we have an extra day
of shooting for this scene.</i>

1118
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:51,818
<i>We didn't need it.
They just came out and nailed it.</i>

1119
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,114
<i>This moment from her...</i>

1120
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,576
They sterilise you.

1121
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,497
WHEDON: <i>Um... That just kills me.</i>

1122
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,250
<i>That throwaway, "It's no big deal.</i>

1123
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:12,422
<i>"Then why are my eyes welling up?"
gesture is just beautiful.</i>

1124
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:21,014
<i>I love the very haunting,
weird little plaintive melody</i>

1125
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,391
<i>that Danny Elfman put over this.</i>

1126
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:32,150
<i>Their romance was a point
of contention for some people.</i>

1127
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,194
<i>Not for us, while we were making it.</i>

1128
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:39,198
<i>In fact, it never occurred to us that
there would be any reaction against it.</i>

1129
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:45,121
<i>They seemed so much
like they belonged,</i>

1130
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:51,294
<i>if not together,
in the same sort of world that...</i>

1131
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,962
<i>And the chemistry they had
from the first scene</i>

1132
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:56,507
<i>they ever played together just felt right.</i>

1133
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,636
<i>And people who thought
she was supposed to be with Clint...</i>

1134
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:04,891
<i>Well, obviously, it's very important
that he's married, that he's normcore,</i>

1135
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:07,935
<i>that his distance from the Avengers</i>

1136
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,772
<i>is caused by the fact that he actually
has a connection to the world</i>

1137
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,398
<i>and he knows they don't.</i>

1138
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:16,319
<i>But, also, I think
it's much more interesting</i>

1139
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,154
<i>for he and Natasha to be two people</i>

1140
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,282
<i>who would lay down their lives
for each other,</i>

1141
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,619
<i>but aren't interested
in sleeping with each other.</i>

1142
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,664
<i>I think that's
a more interesting dynamic, a true one,</i>

1143
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:33,002
<i>and better than just
the two of them hooking up.</i>

1144
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,088
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1145
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,799
innocent people die. Every time.

1146
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,926
WHEDON: <i>The log rip.</i>

1147
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,930
<i>We built a lot of logs for him to rip.</i>

1148
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,937
<i>It's a constant conversation
with Chris about Cap's power level.</i>

1149
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:58,444
<i>With Captain America,
and particularly with the Hulk,</i>

1150
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,613
<i>you get this thing of...</i>

1151
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,282
<i>Okay, Sergio Leone.
Sorry. There, I said it.</i>

1152
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:08,037
<i>You get this thing of, "One moment,</i>

1153
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,373
<i>"I'm having a normal fist fight
with some guy,</i>

1154
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,583
<i>"and the next moment,
I can jump two storeys."</i>

1155
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,960
<i>So which is it?</i>

1156
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:19,632
<i>I'm embarrassed to say
that "Hello, Deere" was Robert's.</i>

1157
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,259
<i>That's one of those moments
where I just kick myself,</i>

1158
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,136
<i>I'm like, "How did I miss that?"</i>

1159
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,595
Was she ever not working for you?

1160
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,305
FURY: Artificial intelligence.

1161
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,142
You never even hesitated.

1162
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,228
It's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1163
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,439
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1164
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,524
WHEDON: <i>There was
a certain level of uncertainty</i>

1165
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:40,778
<i>about whether
the Eugene O'Neill line would play,</i>

1166
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:45,366
<i>and, after the hammer moment,
it might be the biggest crowd-pleaser</i>

1167
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,201
<i>with every audience we've played it for,</i>

1168
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:50,997
<i>and I'm not sure why, honestly,
but I'm very pleased.</i>

1169
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,665
STARK: I saw it.

1170
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,500
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1171
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,754
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1172
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,505
The whole world, too.

1173
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:00,965
Because of me.

1174
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,093
WHEDON: <i>The idea of playing
Tony's confessional.</i>

1175
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:08,097
<i>Because there was a long period
where it was like,</i>

1176
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,100
<i>"Well, does he tell everyone
he had a vision?"</i>

1177
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:14,771
<i>And we had lines in it for quite a while</i>

1178
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,482
<i>that indicated he had said something,
or said something off-screen,</i>

1179
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:22,445
<i>but you don't bring Nick Fury in
without a reason.</i>

1180
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:25,865
<i>And although it was important to say
that they were flying on their own,</i>

1181
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,827
<i>we knew we wanted to see Nick,</i>

1182
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:34,373
<i>and to have him be the first person
that Tony can actually talk to,</i>

1183
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:39,337
<i>and for that to become,
in a way, the sea change for Tony,</i>

1184
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,298
<i>even though he's about to do
something even more absurd</i>

1185
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:48,721
<i>than what he's already done,
is important for the whole group.</i>

1186
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,142
I like the look.

1187
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,062
WHEDON: <i>This is actual
Royal Holloway, University of London.</i>

1188
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,774
<i>Again, any time
we could go to the place,</i>

1189
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,527
<i>let it be the place that we said it was,</i>

1190
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:11,494
<i>and that wasn't all the time,
but was as much as possible.</i>

1191
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,579
<i>Obviously, that scene was
a little bit longer.</i>

1192
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,040
<i>All of Stellan's stuff, there was more of.</i>

1193
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,835
<i>Again, enjoy your DVD extras.</i>

1194
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:22,421
<i>The "Thor and Stellan go to
a cave together" subplot</i>

1195
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:26,759
<i>is one of the more complicated issues
in the movie.</i>

1196
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,763
<i>People either think
there's too much of it or not enough,</i>

1197
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,976
<i>but what we have
gets us where we need to go.</i>

1198
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,019
I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1199
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,187
Nexus?

1200
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,231
WHEDON: <i>This scene, difficult,</i>

1201
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:46,779
<i>not unlike the scene in the lab,
even though we had the table.</i>

1202
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:50,366
<i>Just difficult to get the energy.</i>

1203
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:54,537
<i>It's a very bucolic kind of setting.</i>

1204
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:58,624
<i>It's very deliberately
the opposite of the Helicarrier.</i>

1205
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,377
<i>I mean, he mentions the Helicarrier,</i>

1206
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,548
<i>Fury does, on purpose,
because it's important for him,</i>

1207
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,633
<i>A, because later on
he's gonna show up with it,</i>

1208
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,094
<i>and if you had forgotten it exists,</i>

1209
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,221
<i>you don't want that moment
of like, "What?"</i>

1210
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:16,893
<i>But also because this portion
of the movie last time,</i>

1211
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,936
<i>where everybody's sort of
searching their soul</i>

1212
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,064
<i>and wondering what the heck to do
and conflicting,</i>

1213
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,775
<i>came on the Helicarrier last time.</i>

1214
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,403
<i>And it was a very kind of science-fiction,</i>

1215
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,946
<i>kind of comic-book-y space,</i>

1216
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,033
<i>and the whole point of
coming to the Bartons' farm</i>

1217
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,743
<i>was to do the opposite of that.</i>

1218
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,537
<i>To bring them, literally,
back down to Earth.</i>

1219
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:40,875
<i>But having done that,</i>

1220
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:45,504
<i>you then have to allow
for this moment of respite</i>

1221
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:50,509
<i>from the giant action set pieces,
two more of which are coming up,</i>

1222
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:56,098
<i>and, at the same time, keep some
kind of energy and momentum.</i>

1223
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:04,148
<i>For some reason,
every time we did a shot on Mark,</i>

1224
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,859
<i>when he got to the line,
"Has anybody seen Helen Cho?"</i>

1225
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,736
<i>He called her Anita.</i>

1226
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,785
(CHUCKLING) <i>I mean,
we came back the next day</i>

1227
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,953
<i>and did more coverage,</i>

1228
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,580
<i>and as soon as we were off him,
he was fine.</i>

1229
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:23,584
<i>And as soon as we came back on him,
it was Anita.</i>

1230
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,003
<i>I have no idea why. Nobody knows why.</i>

1231
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:28,965
<i>But, oh, my God,
it made us laugh so hard.</i>

1232
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:34,095
<i>Poor man. It's so random. "Anita Cho."</i>

1233
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:39,809
<i>But when he did nail it, he did nail it.</i>

1234
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,310
<i>You look at that shot where he says,</i>

1235
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,354
<i>"Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?"</i>

1236
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,481
<i>The camera is moving here,
he's looking there.</i>

1237
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,650
<i>It's very precise.</i>

1238
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,653
<i>And that's an interesting thing
with Mark,</i>

1239
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:56,242
<i>because I think he's probably
the best actor of his generation.</i>

1240
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,038
<i>But that precision is not natural to him.</i>

1241
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,666
<i>I have to sort of go,
"I need you to do this thing."</i>

1242
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:09,213
<i>And because what makes him so great
is he's so honest in his stuff,</i>

1243
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:13,009
<i>it doesn't come from,
"And we land here,"</i>

1244
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,011
<i>which is a very sort of
comic book vernacular</i>

1245
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:19,515
<i>and very much the way
I've always created that sort of,</i>

1246
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:23,352
<i>"Everything is precise and musical
and it goes..."</i>

1247
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,271
<i>And then it goes to the next thing.</i>

1248
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,857
<i>He's not that,</i>

1249
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:33,195
<i>because everything he says
sounds like it just came from him.</i>

1250
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,240
<i>He doesn't play characters.</i>

1251
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,868
<i>He just becomes them. He just exists.</i>

1252
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,079
<i>So it was interesting to work that out.</i>

1253
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,165
<i>We pulled out
some of the rail for this shot</i>

1254
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,001
<i>because I was like,
"I'm going</i> Gone with the Wind, <i>guys."</i>

1255
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,210
<i>I'm going full-out.</i>

1256
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,091
<i>I'm going full Western,
full melodrama, all of that stuff.</i>

1257
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,885
<i>And that scene between the two of them</i>

1258
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,679
<i>was obviously part
of my ongoing campaign</i>

1259
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:01,766
<i>to ensure the belief
that Hawkeye is a dead man.</i>

1260
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:08,397
<i>Even to the point where he says that
that's his last project at the house.</i>

1261
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,067
<i>Really meaning,
"This is my last mission."</i>

1262
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,152
<i>I mean, he might as well say,
"Don't worry, honey.</i>

1263
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,571
<i>"It's just one more job.
It's perfectly safe."</i>

1264
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,824
<i>And then walk under a ladder.</i>

1265
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,995
<i>He's like Dead Meat in</i> Hot Shots!

1266
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,332
<i>And it's all a ruse.</i>

1267
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,293
How do you find it?

1268
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,128
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1269
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,589
WHEDON: <i>This is not
actually in Oslo, okay.</i>

1270
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,175
<i>That part is a total lie.</i>

1271
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:44,683
<i>The idea, though,
that Tony is searching his world,</i>

1272
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,268
<i>the world of science,</i>

1273
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,105
<i>and Thor is searching
the world of magic.</i>

1274
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,775
<i>Obviously, there was
a much longer scene with Thor,</i>

1275
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,276
<i>but there was also
at one point a version</i>

1276
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,862
<i>where we just intercut
the two enormously,</i>

1277
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:00,699
<i>the cyber search and the dream search.</i>

1278
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:05,621
<i>And in the end,
we went with the least amount of stuff</i>

1279
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:10,292
<i>to explain what knowledge
Thor needs to come back with.</i>

1280
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,295
<i>Chris is great, and very patient with me,</i>

1281
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:19,135
<i>because he's trying hard
not to be irrelevant.</i>

1282
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,636
<i>And it's tough with Thor</i>

1283
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,389
<i>because he doesn't speak
the way people do,</i>

1284
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,640
<i>he doesn't live the way people do.</i>

1285
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,226
<i>He can't just sort of be the casual guy,</i>

1286
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,646
<i>although Chris is hilarious
at throwaway jokes.</i>

1287
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:36,110
<i>And I kept saying to Chris,
"I'm gonna figure this out.</i>

1288
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,863
<i>"I'm gonna give you
something really exciting."</i>

1289
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:44,827
<i>And whether or not I succeeded
is open to some debate.</i> (CHUCKLES)

1290
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,539
<i>But, God knows,
everything I've thrown at him,</i>

1291
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:54,461
<i>he's done so well that it makes you
want to protect the character,</i>

1292
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:59,175
<i>because he's the only one who's...
Well, he ain't from around here.</i>

1293
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,762
You said we would destroy
the Avengers, make a better world.

1294
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,930
It will be better.

1295
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,850
WHEDON: <i>That fist, curling up in frame
on the left there,</i>

1296
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,852
<i>that's another example of something</i>

1297
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:14,523
<i>that could never have been done before</i>

1298
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,525
<i>with what we could do in the first film.</i>

1299
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,651
<i>Um...</i>

1300
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:22,239
<i>Just these casual frames.
They're a little static.</i>

1301
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:27,369
<i>Some of Ultron's stuff
was devised later,</i>

1302
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,121
<i>was sort of honed later.</i>

1303
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:32,583
<i>And this we actually shot on the day.</i>

1304
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:37,838
<i>And the space was a little small</i>

1305
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,007
<i>and didn't afford a lot of opportunities,</i>

1306
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:44,553
<i>but I realised that I was so
into the things they were saying</i>

1307
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:48,057
<i>that I felt like I dropped the ball
a little bit, visually.</i>

1308
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,351
<i>And that's the case with Ultron.</i>

1309
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:54,521
<i>In some cases, because
we were building it after the fact,</i>

1310
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,566
<i>and we had a plate of the background</i>

1311
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,777
<i>that we were then
animating him in front of,</i>

1312
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:06,617
<i>so actual camera movement was
more difficult to put in late in the game.</i>

1313
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:12,790
<i>And sometimes I think
I just missed some opportunities.</i>

1314
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:15,834
<i>I look at all the opportunities
I've missed.</i>

1315
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,545
<i>I look at this movie as a series
of compromises and failures.</i>

1316
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:22,466
<i>Just so you know,
I'm not actually gonna emphasise that,</i>

1317
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,677
<i>and I'm talking to my shrink about it.</i>

1318
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,892
<i>But the things about it that I love,
I love very much.</i>

1319
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:36,855
<i>But I always think,
"I could've done better there."</i>

1320
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,275
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1321
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,235
- He's uploading himself into the body.
- Where?

1322
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:46,198
WHEDON: <i>And this is Claudia,</i>

1323
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:52,329
<i>who is so impressive,
doing the hardest thing in the movie,</i>

1324
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,040
<i>emotional exposition,</i>

1325
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,210
<i>where we give her
a ton of dialogue to say,</i>

1326
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,796
<i>then we add to it later,</i>

1327
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:04,133
<i>and she's still emotional and cool.</i>

1328
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,343
ROMANOFF: No manifest.

1329
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:07,886
That could be him.

1330
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,014
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1331
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,390
Right above you, Cap.

1332
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,309
On the loop by the bridge.

1333
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:18,188
WHEDON: <i>Coming to Seoul was
a real opportunity for us.</i>

1334
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,482
<i>Not a lot of people had shot there.</i>

1335
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:26,030
<i>And we had to sit down with
one of their ministers of culture,</i>

1336
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:30,242
<i>and explain what it was
we were trying to do,</i>

1337
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:37,666
<i>and make sure that we were gonna
show Seoul in a good light.</i>

1338
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,170
<i>And, in fact, why we liked the city was</i>

1339
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,714
<i>because we knew we were
gonna have a chase</i>

1340
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,841
<i>throughout the whole city and...</i>

1341
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:51,013
<i>Not the whole city, it's one of
the most enormous cities in the world.</i>

1342
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,891
(CHUCKLING)
<i>But through some lovely bits of it.</i>

1343
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:59,605
<i>And we wanted a place that
was very modern and very exciting,</i>

1344
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,441
<i>and not gritty in the same sense.</i>

1345
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,902
<i>We wanted everyplace
to register as itself.</i>

1346
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:08,030
<i>Johannesburg, Seoul.</i>

1347
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,949
<i>And then we wanted
to fly under buildings,</i>

1348
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,285
<i>when clearly he could have
flown over them,</i>

1349
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,496
<i>just because they were there
and they were pretty.</i>

1350
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,289
You know what's in that cradle?

1351
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:24,129
WHEDON: <i>I've talked about ILM
and the extraordinary work they did,</i>

1352
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,215
<i>which I can't say enough about.</i>

1353
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,385
<i>But, as is the case with movies like this,</i>

1354
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:35,432
<i>there's hundreds of houses
doing various effects and various bits.</i>

1355
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:40,396
<i>This whole sequence,
the Ultron portion of it,</i>

1356
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,565
<i>most of the major work in it
was done by Dneg.</i>

1357
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:49,738
<i>And the houses are really good
about helping each other out.</i>

1358
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,825
<i>Some of these shots were shared
by, like, four different houses.</i>

1359
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,992
<i>Somebody's doing a background,</i>

1360
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,161
<i>somebody's doing
a stunt face replacement,</i>

1361
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,873
<i>somebody's doing a digital creature.</i>

1362
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:03,919
<i>And with the Vision,
somebody at one house did body,</i>

1363
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:08,006
<i>one did face, one did cape,
one did background. It was just...</i>

1364
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:12,928
<i>But they're all very cooperative,
they're very inventive,</i>

1365
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,931
<i>and everybody brings that extra quality.</i>

1366
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:20,436
<i>A lot of these low-angle shots you see</i>

1367
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:25,607
<i>of Cap going over camera,
her going through alleys,</i>

1368
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:29,945
<i>were shot with
a little remote-controlled car,</i>

1369
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:33,782
<i>which honestly is my favourite thing.</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1370
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:38,996
<i>I like the remote-control car
way more than the motorcycle</i>

1371
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,831
(LAUGHS) <i>because it's just so cool.</i>

1372
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:46,587
<i>This moment here, um,
Bryan Andrews, storyboard artist,</i>

1373
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,381
<i>who has done a lot of great stuff for us,</i>

1374
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,926
<i>came in after the fact and looked at this.</i>

1375
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,345
<i>And we had knocked all the cars over.</i>

1376
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:59,391
<i>It was Bryan's idea
to add Captain America</i>

1377
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,061
<i>to what we referred to
as the "car ballet."</i>

1378
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:09,151
<i>And it took something that was pretty,
but pointlessly destructive,</i>

1379
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:13,405
<i>and turned it into a moment of peril
for one of our guys,</i>

1380
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:19,786
<i>and made it not just more exciting,
but worthy.</i>

1381
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:26,293
<i>And that kind of feedback,
and having those new eyes</i>

1382
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:30,088
<i>is so crucial and so exciting,</i>

1383
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:34,718
<i>because it just keeps getting better.</i>

1384
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,722
<i>The thing about a sequence like this</i>

1385
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:45,062
<i>is it's always about the connection
between the players.</i>

1386
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,689
<i>The more you can connect them,</i>

1387
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,108
<i>the more we would add dialogue
between them.</i>

1388
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:56,698
<i>It wasn't just stunt, stunt, stunt.
You felt their humanity.</i>

1389
01:23:56,782 --> 01:23:59,034
<i>There was an emotional thread
going through here</i>

1390
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,286
<i>for Scarlett when we shot it,</i>

1391
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,790
<i>that she had been rejected
by Banner very brutally.</i>

1392
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:11,964
<i>If you see the entire sequence on DVD,
it's a rough thing,</i>

1393
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:18,554
<i>and it made her have
this kind of self-destructive,</i>

1394
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:22,099
<i>just brave kind of fatalism.</i>

1395
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:29,106
<i>And then some of this stuff was shot
after that had been cut,</i>

1396
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,525
<i>but most of it beforehand,</i>

1397
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:34,611
<i>and so you end up with
someone who's playing something</i>

1398
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:37,906
<i>that is no longer in the film.</i>

1399
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,244
<i>And it's just a very delicate process
to make sure that you don't have</i>

1400
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:48,500
<i>some inexplicable
emotional malaise from her.</i>

1401
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:52,546
<i>But luckily she's the kind of person
who hides that sort of stuff,</i>

1402
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:57,426
<i>and as a character, she plays
on the surface as very in control.</i>

1403
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:01,305
<i>And so we were able to cut it together</i>

1404
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:03,974
<i>without it seeming strange.</i>

1405
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,646
<i>But it also means that</i>

1406
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:14,610
<i>one of the emotional arcs
of this sequence disappeared,</i>

1407
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,654
<i>and then you end up
relying on spectacle,</i>

1408
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:18,905
<i>which is the last thing that you want,</i>

1409
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,075
<i>even though the spectacle
is beautifully put together.</i>

1410
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:28,457
<i>And you have the kids
going from villain to hero,</i>

1411
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,126
<i>which is a major plot turn.</i>

1412
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,921
<i>And you have Ultron
disappearing with Widow,</i>

1413
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:40,385
<i>so you're servicing the story,</i>

1414
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:47,392
<i>but emotionally there's not as much
going on as there would have been.</i>

1415
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,691
<i>And that's complicated because</i>

1416
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:58,570
<i>once you start a sequence this massive</i>

1417
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,281
<i>without that particular emotional hook,</i>

1418
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:05,160
<i>it's very easy for people
to get pummelled.</i>

1419
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,747
<i>But by bringing the kids in,
by cutting it down,</i>

1420
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:15,629
<i>and just by the beautiful job
Jeff did cutting it,</i>

1421
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,381
<i>I think it sustains.</i>

1422
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,634
<i>But I'm always gonna look at what's not.</i>

1423
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:27,182
<i>Almost all of that was in Korea,
or shot with plates from Korea.</i>

1424
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:32,187
<i>This is actually in England,
in Longcross,</i>

1425
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,775
<i>a place we used for a few of the sets
and exteriors near Shepperton,</i>

1426
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,568
<i>where we shot most of it,</i>

1427
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:41,863
<i>that they dressed up very specifically</i>

1428
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,659
<i>and brought the trains.</i>

1429
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:49,496
<i>I think we brought them from Korea,
the two train cars that we had.</i>

1430
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:51,915
<i>Dressed them in.</i>

1431
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,669
<i>One of the things I love about
having all these characters</i>

1432
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:59,965
<i>is the way their alliances
can shift and change,</i>

1433
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:03,510
<i>and Captain America's
never expressed anything</i>

1434
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,262
<i>but sympathy for these guys,</i>

1435
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:06,888
<i>even while he was fighting them.</i>

1436
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,143
<i>So for him to suddenly
say one mean thing,</i>

1437
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,270
<i>and then, boom, they're allies.</i>

1438
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:17,482
<i>It's exciting,
but it also feels emotionally logical,</i>

1439
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:21,695
<i>and then it brings us back
to the idea that Tony is the villain.</i>

1440
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:29,536
<i>One of the true villainous moments
he has is telling Hawkeye,</i>

1441
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:32,873
<i>"Why don't you disappear?" and
I'm gonna make an evil eyebrow face,</i>

1442
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:36,585
<i>because I'm about to do
something crazy.</i>

1443
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:40,839
<i>And the idea that
he's gonna lean into the very thing</i>

1444
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:46,303
<i>that is wrong with him
is interesting to me,</i>

1445
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:51,349
<i>because the idea that
the worst thing about us is useful</i>

1446
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,104
<i>gives this thing texture.</i>

1447
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,941
<i>Look at the reflection of Jarvis
in Bruce's glasses.</i>

1448
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,778
<i>That's something that...</i>

1449
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,363
<i>That level of detail is...</i>

1450
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:08,492
<i>Because, of course, Jarvis is not there,
that was added later.</i>

1451
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:13,413
<i>And that level of care and detail</i>

1452
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:18,210
<i>is in every frame of this movie.</i>

1453
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:22,130
<i>Our VFX head, Chris Townsend,</i>

1454
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:26,802
<i>was running 97 different houses.</i>

1455
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,973
<i>And one of the things
I love about Marvel is that</i>

1456
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,976
<i>good enough is never good enough.</i>

1457
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:40,774
<i>And the level of texture
and detail and character</i>

1458
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:46,238
<i>that they put into VFX doubles,</i>

1459
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,490
<i>this sort of amorphous character.</i>

1460
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,492
<i>It's so complicated figuring out,</i>

1461
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:54,496
<i>"How do we make him
feel like a program that's talking?"</i>

1462
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,748
<i>Give him personality, but not too much.</i>

1463
01:28:57,707 --> 01:28:59,543
<i>Make him not cartoony.</i>

1464
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,003
<i>Make him feel integrated into a universe</i>

1465
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,172
<i>that is, at its base, very grounded.</i>

1466
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:08,635
<i>We're asking that question
about every effect, every day.</i>

1467
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:14,975
<i>And the stuff they gave me
is so human on every level.</i>

1468
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,352
<i>And ultimately these stories never work.</i>

1469
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,438
<i>This scene was created in post.</i>

1470
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,149
<i>There was some amusement</i>

1471
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:26,820
<i>at the literal translation
of what had been post-viz.</i>

1472
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:31,783
<i>On the left the... I don't want to
say phallic, uh, implement of...</i>

1473
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,619
<i>But if you look carefully at it, oh, yeah.</i>

1474
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:39,541
<i>And we sort of laughed about it,
but then I decided I wanted to keep it,</i>

1475
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,877
<i>since, as he becomes more aggressive,</i>

1476
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,629
<i>the idea that his iconography
becomes more male.</i>

1477
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:49,175
<i>When he's just a program,
it's very Georgia O'Keeffe in the lab,</i>

1478
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:53,722
<i>and then now
he's becoming pure aggression.</i>

1479
01:29:55,223 --> 01:30:01,396
<i>This is also one of my favourite
performances from James and ILM.</i>

1480
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:08,570
<i>The love and poignancy
of his dream deferred,</i>

1481
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:13,450
<i>and how insane it makes him.</i>

1482
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,912
<i>We had another version of the scene
that was just too civilised,</i>

1483
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:18,246
<i>something I do a lot,</i>

1484
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:21,541
<i>where people are
just holding a cup of tea</i>

1485
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:25,587
<i>instead of ripping their own faces
and guts apart.</i>

1486
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,758
<i>And Scarlett, with no lines,
giving me beautiful stuff,</i>

1487
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:34,930
<i>and the idea obviously
of somebody doing the infamous</i>

1488
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:38,266
<i>and, in fact,
somewhat clichéd Nietzsche quote,</i>

1489
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:41,144
<i>but then putting a genuine spin on it.</i>

1490
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:45,106
<i>A very literal one.
It was very exciting and fun.</i>

1491
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:51,696
<i>And designing his final armour
to be different,</i>

1492
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:56,451
<i>it was super tough
to find something that worked.</i>

1493
01:30:56,534 --> 01:31:01,957
<i>It covers his face and some of
the greatness of his delivery a little bit,</i>

1494
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,417
<i>and I think we all regretted
that a little bit.</i>

1495
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,630
<i>But it also brings him
more towards the Ultron</i>

1496
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,883
<i>that we know from the comics,</i>

1497
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:18,765
<i>and gives us that distance
that we need to get into the final act.</i>

1498
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,226
- ROGERS: Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1499
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:22,560
You don't know what you're doing.

1500
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:25,063
And you do?
She's not in your head?

1501
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:27,148
WHEDON: <i>Once again, internal conflict</i>

1502
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,693
<i>is the thing that makes
these things work.</i>

1503
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:34,406
<i>And that's fairly badass of Banner.</i>

1504
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:36,700
WANDA: You don't know what's in there.
ROGERS: This isn't a game!

1505
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,747
- No, no. Go on.
- (POWERING DOWN)

1506
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,250
- You were saying?
- (GUNSHOT)

1507
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:50,130
WHEDON: <i>As I said, this moment came
from just walking the set and saying,</i>

1508
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,965
<i>"Well, they are talking a lot,
and he's very fast.</i>

1509
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,758
<i>"Why wouldn't he just... Oh, okay."</i>

1510
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:59,347
<i>And then, of course, the call back,
which I threw in late in the game.</i>

1511
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:00,640
<i>It was just very necessary,</i>

1512
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:03,059
<i>because you would
not remember that phrase</i>

1513
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,477
<i>from the beginning
of the movie to the end.</i>

1514
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:07,689
<i>And at the end of the movie,
it becomes quite important.</i>

1515
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:10,608
<i>Watch her particularly in this moment,</i>

1516
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:15,739
<i>when she casts a spell through herself,
boom, to him.</i>

1517
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:20,160
<i>All of that movement
was very specifically choreographed.</i>

1518
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,370
<i>It's probably the first thing that
I worked on.</i>

1519
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:28,418
<i>I worked with Jennifer White,
a dancer and a choreographer,</i>

1520
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,880
<i>with Lizzie, and the three of us
spent a lot of time</i>

1521
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,133
<i>with me translating
what are very literal moves</i>

1522
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:40,346
<i>to create the language of her magic,</i>

1523
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,266
<i>so that people would understand it
and not just think,</i>

1524
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:45,143
<i>"Oh, she can do anything she wants."</i>

1525
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:48,229
<i>It would be like throwing a magic punch.</i>

1526
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:49,981
<i>And besides, it meant choreography,</i>

1527
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:53,109
<i>and if you've seen the movie,
you know I like a lot of that.</i>

1528
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,654
<i>That shot of Scarlet, which is one
of my favourites in the film as well,</i>

1529
01:32:56,738 --> 01:33:01,618
<i>because she's been desperate to keep
this from happening more than anyone,</i>

1530
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:04,746
<i>because she's seen
the apocalyptic vision that it contained,</i>

1531
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:07,082
<i>and yet, when she sees the Vision,</i>

1532
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:12,420
<i>what's on her face is clearly
fear/I am falling in love with you.</i>

1533
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:15,799
(CHUCKLES) <i>And as I grew up
reading the comics,</i>

1534
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:19,177
<i>where they actually fall in love
and get married,</i>

1535
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,931
<i>it's nice to throw to that a little bit
without overplaying it.</i>

1536
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:28,937
<i>This was another moment that
came from just walking the set.</i>

1537
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,774
<i>And originally, there was a big fight
between him and Thor</i>

1538
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:37,737
<i>as he was still becoming
a conscious guy, and then</i>

1539
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:42,659
<i>we pulled that out, but it all led to
the moment where he is at the window,</i>

1540
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,453
<i>'cause I thought,
"First of all, look at this cool window</i>

1541
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,205
<i>"and I need a reason
to shoot outside it."</i>

1542
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:51,793
<i>But, more importantly,
the stages of his self-awareness</i>

1543
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:55,213
<i>involve seeing the world,
the outside world,</i>

1544
01:33:55,296 --> 01:34:00,218
<i>outside of himself,
and then seeing himself in reflection.</i>

1545
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,887
<i>And those feel like two separate stages</i>

1546
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:07,976
<i>of any human understanding
of existence.</i>

1547
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:12,480
<i>And he goes through that,
and is complete.</i>

1548
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:15,733
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1549
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:21,489
WHEDON: <i>There's a lot of buys
in something like this.</i>

1550
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:25,535
<i>And to have a purple guy show up</i>

1551
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:30,498
<i>in the beginning of the third act,
uh, it's a big buy.</i>

1552
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:34,669
<i>And so to be able to
have these little moments</i>

1553
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:40,133
<i>that help explain the story of
his rather convenient consciousness,</i>

1554
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:47,265
<i>it's both necessary
and an exciting piece of texture.</i>

1555
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:51,144
<i>I can barely talk
about how cool Bettany is,</i>

1556
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:55,023
<i>and what great work
they did on his face,</i>

1557
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:59,277
<i>both in makeup, and then after the fact,</i>

1558
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,362
<i>because all the rendering
of textures on his face</i>

1559
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:08,036
<i>made it very easy to give him
what we refer to as digital Botox,</i>

1560
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:11,372
<i>to take away the expressiveness
in his eyes,</i>

1561
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,834
<i>and so the little wrinkles and things</i>

1562
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,920
<i>that you wouldn't expect
to see on an android,</i>

1563
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:22,800
<i>that you need for him
to be what Bettany brought,</i>

1564
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:26,888
<i>is actually very difficult to render
and very beautifully accomplished.</i>

1565
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:33,895
<i>This moment when he asks,
"What will you do?"</i>

1566
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,398
<i>This was part of my recalibration
of the Vision</i>

1567
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,734
<i>from Jarvis to the Vision,</i>

1568
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:42,320
<i>where he basically lays it out,</i>

1569
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,489
<i>"You can't really stop me."</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1570
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:50,745
<i>I wrote him before as,
I would say, polite.</i>

1571
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:54,666
<i>And here, he has his own thing,</i>

1572
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,753
<i>his own agenda
that goes beyond humanity.</i>

1573
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:03,341
<i>And later on has</i>

1574
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,844
<i>what is, for me, the most
important moment in the movie,</i>

1575
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:12,016
<i>based on his understanding
of life beyond us and our agenda.</i>

1576
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,518
I'm not what you are,

1577
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,396
and not what you intended.

1578
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,815
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1579
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,067
WHEDON: <i>And then,
of course, there's this.</i>

1580
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:33,204
<i>The great thing is,
we set it up for the whole movie</i>

1581
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:37,875
<i>without anybody realising
we were setting something up.</i>

1582
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,377
Well done.

1583
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,005
WHEDON: <i>Chris improv'd that line</i>
(CHUCKLES)

1584
01:36:42,088 --> 01:36:43,589
<i>In the moment, which I love.</i>

1585
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:49,304
<i>But it's also not just a trick,</i>

1586
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:51,264
<i>it's an important piece of storytelling.</i>

1587
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:54,976
<i>Not just because of who the Vision is
and what he's going to mean,</i>

1588
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:59,772
<i>but because we need to trust him.</i>

1589
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,817
<i>And there's no better way to say,</i>

1590
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,196
<i>categorically,</i> (CHUCKLES)
<i>"we can," than that.</i>

1591
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:12,785
<i>Now, you'll hear Tony talking about
"Someone's gonna die,"</i>

1592
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,247
<i>over a picture of Hawkeye
looking at his wife once again,</i>

1593
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:19,876
<i>leaning into the...
"He's definitely going out."</i>

1594
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:31,346
<i>This speech,
which got tweaked somewhat,</i>

1595
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:35,892
<i>there was a point at which
I almost didn't shoot it</i>

1596
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,561
<i>because we shot a lot of footage,</i>

1597
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:41,189
<i>and I thought,
"Well, we know what we're doing here."</i>

1598
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:46,652
<i>But it became very, very crucial to me.</i>

1599
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:50,031
<i>First of all, I thought Chris killed it,
and the footage looked wonderful.</i>

1600
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:54,035
<i>But most importantly,
the idea that Ultron could be right,</i>

1601
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:57,538
<i>that the Avengers could just be
a destructive bunch of thugs,</i>

1602
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:03,753
<i>is important not only to articulate,
but for them to internalise,</i>

1603
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:12,261
<i>so that you understand their idea
of the stakes of what's coming.</i>

1604
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:16,057
ROGERS: <i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

1605
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,523
WHEDON: <i>This, again, is a frame</i>

1606
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:26,901
<i>you would never have seen
in the first movie.</i>

1607
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:33,533
<i>This very tight close-up, long-lens thing
is a different vernacular,</i>

1608
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:38,496
<i>but I never felt it was more effective
than it was there.</i>

1609
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:40,706
BANNER: Natasha!

1610
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:43,042
Natasha!

1611
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:46,504
WHEDON: <i>Now, this is an
interesting piece of footage</i>

1612
01:38:47,713 --> 01:38:49,298
<i>because I wrote this scene...</i>

1613
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:54,303
<i>We had a very different scene
with the Hulk and Ultron,</i>

1614
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,139
<i>and it did not play.</i>

1615
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:01,269
<i>It was good, but you just... It didn't fit.</i>

1616
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,896
<i>And I kept saying,
"Well, we've got to do something else."</i>

1617
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,023
<i>So I wrote this scene,</i>

1618
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:09,944
<i>and the scene in between
the two of them that comes after,</i>

1619
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,530
<i>and we did it in reshoots.</i>

1620
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,991
<i>And what's interesting about it is</i>

1621
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:18,786
<i>we never actually got them
on the same day.</i>

1622
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,289
<i>And I'll explain more
when we see them again.</i>

1623
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:34,135
<i>These pieces pounce... This is on
the outside of London. So is this.</i>

1624
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,429
<i>A huge complex
where we built this church,</i>

1625
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:38,973
<i>and where we built that bridge,</i>

1626
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:40,975
<i>and basically turned it into</i>

1627
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:44,187
<i>our biggest piece of real estate
in Eastern Europe.</i>

1628
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:45,271
Uh...

1629
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,982
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1630
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:52,820
WHEDON: <i>And then where Hawkeye
and the Scarlet Witch are</i>

1631
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:55,323
<i>is in northern Italy,</i>

1632
01:39:55,406 --> 01:39:58,534
<i>very close to
where the exterior of the fortress,</i>

1633
01:39:58,618 --> 01:40:01,996
<i>which is actually Fort Bard
in the Italian Alps, is.</i>

1634
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,332
<i>So that we still had
that European flavour,</i>

1635
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:08,044
<i>but we got some old world
and some more modern.</i>

1636
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,965
<i>And really give it a realistic feel,</i>

1637
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,926
<i>'cause unlike every other place we shot,</i>

1638
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,720
<i>there is no Sokovia.</i>

1639
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:21,766
<i>We didn't feel
we could take an actual city</i>

1640
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,018
<i>and rip it out of the ground.</i>

1641
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:27,271
<i>That seemed irresponsible,
even by our standards.</i>

1642
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,732
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

1643
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:33,528
Go!

1644
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,156
WHEDON: <i>Another thing that's...</i>

1645
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,662
<i>This kind of thing is insanely complex,</i>

1646
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:46,374
<i>but made more so by the fact
that I was very determined</i>

1647
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,209
<i>that we would have a passage of time.</i>

1648
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:51,003
<i>That there would be
a pre-dawn sequence,</i>

1649
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:55,091
<i>and then there would be dawn
when the sun was just rising,</i>

1650
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:59,220
<i>and then there would be morning.</i>

1651
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:03,641
<i>So that we would feel
the toll of this thing,</i>

1652
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,853
<i>because I wanted it to
feel like it took a lot.</i>

1653
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:17,321
<i>But inevitably you end up
reorganising certain things</i>

1654
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:20,241
<i>and repurposing them,</i>

1655
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:26,914
<i>so we had to go in
and kind of recolour certain things.</i>

1656
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:30,293
<i>Make certain things
more pre-dawn purple,</i>

1657
01:41:30,376 --> 01:41:33,421
<i>and then brighten up some other things.</i>

1658
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,548
<i>Occasionally the seams show,</i>

1659
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:39,760
<i>but, in general,
they did a really good job</i>

1660
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:43,014
<i>of keeping it all together.</i>

1661
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:46,392
<i>And the main plot points were all
where they were supposed to be,</i>

1662
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:50,479
<i>so most of the footage
we were able to use intact.</i>

1663
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:56,861
<i>And, again, Ben Davis, our DP,
who is just a phenomenal master,</i>

1664
01:41:58,404 --> 01:42:00,781
<i>really leaned into the difficulty</i>

1665
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:04,201
<i>of what it was he was going to
have to accomplish.</i>

1666
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:08,789
<i>And there was so much to get,
and so much footage,</i>

1667
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:12,084
<i>and so much epic stuff.</i>

1668
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:17,548
<i>And then I started
putting restrictions of time</i>

1669
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:22,845
<i>and when we could shoot,
and he just worked it all out.</i>

1670
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:28,309
<i>Just one of those guys
who does not ever remark</i>

1671
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,020
<i>upon the fact that his job is impossible,</i>

1672
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:33,939
<i>and I'm grateful for it.</i>

1673
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:42,698
<i>The voice in Tony's head
was originally a different actress,</i>

1674
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:47,828
<i>but, again, the "girl Friday" thing</i>

1675
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,331
<i>was something that
I liked very much, but...</i>

1676
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:55,503
<i>And Friday was one of
his HUD personalities from the comics,</i>

1677
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,339
<i>but when she came on as American,</i>

1678
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:01,676
<i>the only way to establish who she was
as a sort of different person</i>

1679
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,344
<i>was to have banter between them,</i>

1680
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:06,222
<i>which literally meant establishing</i>

1681
01:43:06,305 --> 01:43:09,350
<i>an entirely new character
after the Vision.</i>

1682
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,769
<i>So to give her the accent,</i>

1683
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,271
<i>it sort of made
a little piece of shorthand.</i>

1684
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,357
ULTRON: <i>When the dust settles,</i>

1685
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,901
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

1686
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:20,528
<i>will be metal.</i>

1687
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:25,157
WHEDON: <i>This is, again,
some of ILM's most beautiful work,</i>

1688
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,034
<i>and flying around that place.</i>

1689
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,664
<i>So he's playing the scene
with Dominique,</i>

1690
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,874
<i>one of Scarlett's stand-ins.</i>

1691
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,377
<i>She is playing the scene, because
they shot them on different days,</i>

1692
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:41,799
<i>with Sean Maher, my old crony
from</i> Firefly <i>and</i> Much Ado.

1693
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,595
<i>He seemed like he would be a good fit,</i>

1694
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:49,140
<i>since we knew we couldn't get
them both at the same time.</i>

1695
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:53,185
<i>And, oddly enough,
from that back angle,</i>

1696
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:55,604
<i>his jaw looks exactly
like Mark Ruffalo's.</i>

1697
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,733
<i>So, it's complicated.</i>

1698
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:02,069
<i>It's a classic Marvel problem,
when you make these giant movies</i>

1699
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,071
<i>that you can't actually get the actors</i>

1700
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:08,784
<i>on the same day, occasionally,
for intimate scenes.</i>

1701
01:44:08,868 --> 01:44:11,871
<i>Frustrating, but you work around it,</i>

1702
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:16,333
<i>and luckily Dominique and Mark
are both really strong actors</i>

1703
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,794
<i>and gave their counterparts
a lot to work with.</i>

1704
01:44:23,048 --> 01:44:26,260
<i>This stuff is always deadly.</i>

1705
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:30,264
<i>Creating some kind of sense of scale</i>

1706
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:35,186
<i>that is realistic is so difficult.</i>

1707
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:40,775
<i>And this work, which is pure digital,
is, to me, just really staggering.</i>

1708
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:45,446
<i>But to keep the sense,</i>

1709
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:50,409
<i>and, I think, in shooting and in editing...</i>

1710
01:44:50,493 --> 01:44:54,246
<i>Not editing, but in sort of the way
we were looking at post-vis</i>

1711
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,458
<i>and kind of setting these things up,</i>

1712
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:03,214
<i>I feel like I could've been clearer
about the feeling of that floating city.</i>

1713
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,591
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1714
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:10,137
WHEDON: <i>This was
all added after the fact,</i>

1715
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:11,639
<i>but it's one of my favourite bits,</i>

1716
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:16,018
<i>and Evans was more than happy
to have that little speech.</i>

1717
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:21,816
<i>And this was also added to give</i>

1718
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,485
<i>a very useful sense of
the scale of the thing,</i>

1719
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,946
<i>and the height of it.</i>

1720
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,739
<i>That is Dominique, by the way.</i>

1721
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:30,908
<i>She had a bigger role in the film.</i>

1722
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,243
<i>You saw her at the beginning
of the film,</i>

1723
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:36,330
<i>her and her little brother,
and they had a bigger role.</i>

1724
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,665
<i>Once again, I wanted...</i>

1725
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:40,793
<i>When she calls out for him to be saved,</i>

1726
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:43,629
<i>I wanted them to be
more than just extras,</i>

1727
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:46,507
<i>I wanted us to know
that Pietro knew them</i>

1728
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:49,051
<i>and that it was important to save them.</i>

1729
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:53,013
<i>But at the end of the day,
as I often find in these movies,</i>

1730
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:55,474
<i>people really just
wanna see the Avengers.</i>

1731
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,602
WANDA: How could I let this happen?

1732
01:45:58,894 --> 01:45:59,854
BARTON: Hey, hey, you okay?

1733
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,856
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.

1734
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,816
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares?

1735
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:08,404
WHEDON: <i>Now, this scene,
obviously, is a favourite.</i>

1736
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:10,114
<i>We have what I refer to,</i>

1737
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:13,158
<i>and I'm not the first person
to use the phrase, as inoculation.</i>

1738
01:46:13,242 --> 01:46:14,618
We're fighting an army of robots,

1739
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:17,121
and I have a bow and arrow.

1740
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,289
None of this makes sense.

1741
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:19,540
(BARTON GRUNTING)

1742
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,959
WHEDON: <i>Where he says the thing
we're all thinking.</i>

1743
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:30,092
<i>And it plays,
and it's also his little power talk,</i>

1744
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,636
<i>his little pep.</i>

1745
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,680
<i>It's emotional.</i>

1746
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:38,350
<i>His whole relationship
with these characters...</i>

1747
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:39,935
<i>I knew what I wanted to do with Pietro,</i>

1748
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:44,481
<i>and I knew that he was gonna have
a relationship with them</i>

1749
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:46,400
<i>that was incredibly contentious.</i>

1750
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:49,111
<i>But part of it came simply from the fact</i>

1751
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:52,990
<i>that all of their action together in Italy</i>

1752
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,909
<i>was because it was the first thing
we were shooting,</i>

1753
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:57,661
<i>and they were the only actors available.</i>

1754
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:03,709
<i>And everybody else was off
having babies or doing publicity</i>

1755
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,961
<i>or making another Marvel movie,</i>

1756
01:47:06,045 --> 01:47:09,173
<i>or one of the 19 movies they had
all made during this. I mean...</i>

1757
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,177
<i>So they said,
"Well, we're gonna start in Italy,</i>

1758
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,678
<i>"and you've got these three characters."</i>

1759
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:18,974
<i>And so what was
a sort of matter of convenience</i>

1760
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,476
<i>became a real arc.</i>

1761
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:26,273
<i>I said, "Well, okay, then these guys
are really gonna have a relationship</i>

1762
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:28,108
<i>"that progresses
and means something."</i>

1763
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:33,530
<i>And for the guy
who likes Pietro the least,</i>

1764
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:35,950
<i>who discounts him completely,</i>

1765
01:47:36,033 --> 01:47:39,286
<i>and who is sort of a father figure
to these kids,</i>

1766
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:41,497
<i>for Pietro to prove himself</i>

1767
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:45,626
<i>the truest hero of the bunch
by saving him</i>

1768
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:48,295
<i>is, I think, much more interesting
and emotional</i>

1769
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,549
<i>than if it just happened to happen.</i>

1770
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:58,472
<i>This is definitely a point at which,</i>

1771
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:04,395
<i>putting things together,
it turns into crowd-pleasing gags</i>

1772
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,982
<i>that are gags.</i>

1773
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:10,192
<i>This is a point in the movie where I...</i>

1774
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:17,366
<i>When we were putting it all together,
I felt a little bit,</i>

1775
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,787
<i>"We've lost the mission,
we're doing cool gags,</i>

1776
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,456
<i>"but what we're not doing
is setting up moments</i>

1777
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,209
<i>"so that when something
like this happens,</i>

1778
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:29,128
<i>"it means everything it could."</i>

1779
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:35,509
<i>The difficulty in taking
something like this</i>

1780
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:38,804
<i>is not having these moments,
it's earning them.</i>

1781
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:40,180
<i>It's setting them up,</i>

1782
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:41,515
<i>and making sure
that when they happen,</i>

1783
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,267
<i>they mean something.</i>

1784
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,019
<i>This was another specific piece
of magic,</i>

1785
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:48,605
<i>the idea that she's actually
pulling energy out of the ground.</i>

1786
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:53,360
<i>For me, there was the idea,
a little bit, of,</i>

1787
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:56,697
<i>"She's using Sokovia itself,</i>

1788
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:00,409
<i>"again, which she sort of represents,
against them."</i>

1789
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,163
<i>And here, he had a different line,</i>

1790
01:49:04,246 --> 01:49:06,123
<i>"I hate that kid.
I really don't like that kid."</i>

1791
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:10,335
<i>And I said, "Well,
maybe try 'No one will know, '</i>

1792
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:12,046
<i>"or something, and then just riff."</i>

1793
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:14,214
<i>And then all of this is just Jeremy.</i>

1794
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:19,595
<i>Which just killed us all on the day,</i>

1795
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:23,223
<i>and is one of my favourite things
in the film.</i>

1796
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:26,810
<i>And, again, plays very heavily
into what's to come.</i>

1797
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:31,273
<i>Getting to create the look for these two,</i>

1798
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:38,864
<i>the look for their magic,
was extremely exciting.</i>

1799
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:44,078
<i>And whenever we got her red
up against his blue,</i>

1800
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:45,913
<i>to me, it's very dazzling,</i>

1801
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,248
<i>and putting, again,
that stuff to the movement,</i>

1802
01:49:48,332 --> 01:49:49,708
<i>it's some of the last stuff to come in,</i>

1803
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,878
<i>and so you're always going,
"Well, I think it looks cool."</i>

1804
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,799
<i>But then when it finally
does come together,</i>

1805
01:49:56,882 --> 01:49:58,425
<i>it's much more than that.</i>

1806
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:01,595
<i>Obviously, that scene was
a little joke moment,</i>

1807
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:02,930
<i>but it was also there to show</i>

1808
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:06,141
<i>that he can't actually
always outrun a bullet.</i>

1809
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:07,601
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1810
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,061
FRIDAY: <i>That could vaporise the city.</i>

1811
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:12,189
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

1812
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:16,151
(PANTING)

1813
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:20,280
WHEDON: <i>In addition
to the passage of time,</i>

1814
01:50:20,364 --> 01:50:24,034
<i>we also wanted to, obviously,
go in and out of the clouds</i>

1815
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:26,620
<i>to change the light up that way.</i>

1816
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:30,624
<i>And anything I could do
to make Ben Davis' life harder,</i>

1817
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:35,170
<i>he used to make my movie look better.</i>

1818
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:36,463
ROMANOFF: Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

1819
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,842
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

1820
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:43,595
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1821
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:48,142
WHEDON: <i>Again,
there's a little bit of missing context</i>

1822
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:51,311
<i>when she talks about
she's ready to die up there.</i>

1823
01:50:51,395 --> 01:50:54,982
<i>Originally, that had been part of a run of</i>

1824
01:50:55,065 --> 01:51:01,488
<i>she was still feeling upset
about things going south with Banner,</i>

1825
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:03,574
<i>but at this point
that's a different relationship.</i>

1826
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:08,036
<i>But because it's such a soldier thing,
it still played.</i>

1827
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:13,667
<i>And this, we're actually using
the Alan Silvestri cue</i>

1828
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,546
<i>from the first time the carrier takes off
in the first movie.</i>

1829
01:51:17,629 --> 01:51:21,049
<i>We used some of Alan's stuff
throughout the movie</i>

1830
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:25,220
<i>because it really connected us
to the other movie when we needed to,</i>

1831
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:27,764
<i>but never more than here.</i>

1832
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:29,933
FURY: <i>Nice, right?</i>

1833
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:33,395
WHEDON: <i>It really does,
when we saw the finished effects,</i>

1834
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:34,521
<i>which were so beautiful, I thought,</i>

1835
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:37,524
<i>"Oh, yeah, this was
a science-fiction movie at one point."</i>

1836
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:40,944
<i>And there, Fury's got his mojo back,
he's got his coat back,</i>

1837
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:42,571
<i>Hill's back at her station.</i>

1838
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:46,700
<i>All of this, the set you see,
is exactly what we had.</i>

1839
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:51,622
<i>We didn't have even any reference
of the old set,</i>

1840
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,749
<i>so we had to build a lot of it digitally,</i>

1841
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:57,502
<i>or take it from tails of shots
from the first movie.</i>

1842
01:51:57,586 --> 01:52:00,047
<i>That shot of the rafts coming out
is also one of my favourites.</i>

1843
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,966
<i>I think it's kind of the mission statement
of the movie.</i>

1844
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:04,635
This is not so bad.

1845
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:07,804
WHEDON: <i>And I love Aaron so much
in that moment.</i>

1846
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,306
Let's load them up.

1847
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:19,650
WHEDON: <i>To bring the carrier back...
So, for example, what's behind her?</i>

1848
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:24,112
<i>It's just a shot we took people
out of from the first movie</i>

1849
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,114
(WHISPERING)
<i>because we really couldn't</i>

1850
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,824
<i>actually build the entire set again.</i>

1851
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,201
<i>It's way too big.</i>

1852
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,416
<i>Getting the two of these guys
flying together</i>

1853
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:40,003
<i>and bantering together again is</i>

1854
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:45,259
<i>just a really nice bit of personal texture,</i>

1855
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,594
<i>and a way to sort of lead us</i>

1856
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:51,014
<i>towards where we're going
with the end of the movie</i>

1857
01:52:51,098 --> 01:52:52,891
<i>in terms of the Avengers lineup.</i>

1858
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:59,273
<i>The reason I had him
talking about War Machine</i>

1859
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:02,401
<i>in the first place was that, again,</i>

1860
01:53:02,484 --> 01:53:05,028
<i>like Fury mentioning the Helicarrier,</i>

1861
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:07,531
<i>for people who are not
familiar with that universe,</i>

1862
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:11,618
<i>I needed people to know that he has
an Iron Man suit that he flies around in,</i>

1863
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,245
<i>and is a superhero.</i>

1864
01:53:13,328 --> 01:53:15,455
<i>So that when he showed up,</i>

1865
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:19,334
<i>people wouldn't not know
what that was.</i>

1866
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:23,922
Oh, God!

1867
01:53:24,256 --> 01:53:30,429
WHEDON: <i>Aaron, there, is obviously
from</i> Captain America 2.

1868
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,556
<i>I thought his little sequence in</i> Cap 2

1869
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,600
<i>was one of my favourite parts
of the movie,</i>

1870
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:42,816
<i>and so when Fury had collected
a bunch of people to run the carrier,</i>

1871
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:46,153
<i>I thought it would be emotionally
effective if he was one of them.</i>

1872
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,322
...and as long as there is life
in my breast...

1873
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:51,241
I am running out of things to say!

1874
01:53:51,408 --> 01:53:52,659
Are you ready?

1875
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:55,829
WHEDON: <i>If there's one thing
Hemsworth is absolutely great at,</i>

1876
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:59,875
<i>it's undercutting Thor's pomposity.</i>

1877
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,462
<i>He can sell the Asgardian thing,</i>

1878
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:07,341
<i>but when he gets to do
something casual, he's such a delight.</i>

1879
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:13,555
<i>This was obviously, again,
one of the most difficult</i>

1880
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:17,184
<i>and sort of giant 3D-friendly shots</i>

1881
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:19,436
<i>that I insisted, "We need this.</i>

1882
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,645
<i>"We need the roller-coaster ride.</i>

1883
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:22,564
<i>"We need to remember
that we're up in the air."</i>

1884
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:24,983
<i>And then later on
in the process was like,</i>

1885
01:54:25,067 --> 01:54:29,363
<i>"But I also want him to be
doing some math during it."</i>

1886
01:54:29,446 --> 01:54:33,450
<i>Because the idea that he is
in the middle of a firefight,</i>

1887
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:37,871
<i>and he's doing calculations,
being a scientist in his head,</i>

1888
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:41,208
<i>that, for me, it's what makes him cool,</i>

1889
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:46,421
<i>and it's what keeps the fighting from,
again, just being a punch-a-thon.</i>

1890
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:47,547
Romanoff.

1891
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:49,966
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1892
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:51,134
ROMANOFF: <i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

1893
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,803
Not all of us can fly.

1894
01:54:57,516 --> 01:54:58,558
(PANTING)

1895
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,310
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1896
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:02,521
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1897
01:55:04,272 --> 01:55:06,483
WHEDON: <i>So this is where the movie</i>

1898
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:10,028
<i>kind of unabashedly
turns into</i> Rio Bravo.

1899
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:12,989
<i>Little bit</i> of Zulu, Dawn of the Dead.

1900
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,366
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1901
01:55:14,825 --> 01:55:16,076
<i>If you've read the comic books,</i>

1902
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,037
<i>there are very famous panels
by George Pérez</i>

1903
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:22,290
<i>of just a sea of Ultrons
attacking the Avengers,</i>

1904
01:55:22,374 --> 01:55:27,003
<i>and that, to me,
was what I wanted to evoke.</i>

1905
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:32,884
<i>I also think that the work
of Bryan Hitch, who did the</i> Ultimates,

1906
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:39,099
<i>which is really in many ways
the father of the MCU,</i>

1907
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:41,101
<i>particularly the</i> Avengers,

1908
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:46,440
<i>that style of very muscular action,
is going on here.</i>

1909
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:47,858
<i>But most importantly,
what's going on here</i>

1910
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:51,570
<i>is not a sort of laid out, literal fight.</i>

1911
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:56,575
<i>The detail work in the backgrounds
of shields and arrows,</i>

1912
01:55:56,658 --> 01:56:02,873
<i>and the idea of all the teamwork
and all of the things that are going on.</i>

1913
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:06,001
<i>What specifically is going on
is much less important to me in this</i>

1914
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:10,922
<i>than the idea of this fight,
than the feeling of it.</i>

1915
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:15,135
<i>Rather than set up specific stakes</i>

1916
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:18,680
<i>beyond "We must protect this"
and "Here they all come,"</i>

1917
01:56:18,763 --> 01:56:24,478
<i>what I wanted to do was just show
the feeling of an Avenger.</i>

1918
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:28,690
<i>It's the closest I feel like
I've ever come to panel art</i>

1919
01:56:28,773 --> 01:56:33,445
<i>and, to be specific, Thor there has
ripped out someone's spine and head</i>

1920
01:56:33,528 --> 01:56:35,655
<i>and is hitting other people
with his head,</i>

1921
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:39,493
<i>which means that this movie is,
at least on one level, awesome.</i>

1922
01:56:40,535 --> 01:56:45,081
<i>I feel about the sequence that
there are more missed opportunities,</i>

1923
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,335
<i>that I should have spent
months more fine-tuning it,</i>

1924
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:53,590
<i>but I also feel that
it is as beautiful as anything</i>

1925
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:57,594
<i>I've ever put on film.</i>

1926
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:03,350
<i>I feel this combination of
despair and extraordinary elation</i>

1927
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:05,227
<i>when I watch it, I just want...</i>

1928
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:07,270
<i>Again, I want to
make sure I've earned it,</i>

1929
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:09,356
<i>and I want to spend even more time</i>

1930
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:12,943
<i>watching Thor hit people
with somebody's head.</i>

1931
01:57:14,986 --> 01:57:17,864
<i>The rhythm of it
was done very musically.</i>

1932
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:21,326
<i>That big hero theme
is another piece by Danny Elfman,</i>

1933
01:57:21,409 --> 01:57:25,914
<i>and among the most important,
if not the most important, in the film.</i>

1934
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:30,710
<i>And it came in
somewhat late in the process,</i>

1935
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:37,092
<i>but then Jeff Ford re-tweaked
everything to fit its rhythm.</i>

1936
01:57:37,175 --> 01:57:40,136
<i>Its rhythms were very close
to what we had been using,</i>

1937
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:45,475
<i>but then, uh, we had to play to it.</i>

1938
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:54,568
<i>The musicality and the physicality
are what interest me there.</i>

1939
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:57,696
<i>I wished I could've hurt more people,</i>

1940
01:57:57,779 --> 01:58:01,575
<i>I wished I could've taken
more of a toll on the characters.</i>

1941
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:05,912
<i>The complexity of
not just how we shot it,</i>

1942
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:07,706
<i>but when we had all the people,</i>

1943
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:10,959
<i>and what came before and after what,</i>

1944
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:13,503
<i>meant that you couldn't be</i>

1945
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:15,964
<i>as specific as I would have
liked in that sense,</i>

1946
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:22,679
<i>but it's still... That sequence is, for me,
the reason we show up.</i>

1947
01:58:24,097 --> 01:58:27,058
<i>And this sequence is, for me,
the reason I show up,</i>

1948
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:28,602
<i>where two people are in an apocalypse,</i>

1949
01:58:28,685 --> 01:58:31,521
<i>talking about eating in the dining room.</i>

1950
01:58:32,188 --> 01:58:36,192
<i>That says more about their relationship
than anything else I could've done,</i>

1951
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:40,447
<i>and it's something
that I always love about Marvel,</i>

1952
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:43,033
<i>is that they're not afraid
of that conversation.</i>

1953
01:58:43,825 --> 01:58:47,829
<i>Even at this late and very
sort of momentous stage,</i>

1954
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:50,290
<i>they're like,
"Yeah, you should totally have...</i>

1955
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:52,500
<i>"They should talk about re-decorating.</i>

1956
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:53,960
<i>"That makes perfect sense."</i>

1957
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:55,879
<i>And I don't feel that
there are a lot of studios</i>

1958
01:58:55,962 --> 01:58:59,090
<i>who would've embraced that
in the same way.</i>

1959
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:03,803
<i>Again, you can hear someone saying,
"You're safe now,"</i>

1960
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:05,555
<i>as he gets on the boat.</i>

1961
01:59:06,181 --> 01:59:11,061
<i>I couldn't be more shameless
about trying to convince everyone</i>

1962
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:13,229
<i>that Hawkeye's gonna die.</i>

1963
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:20,236
<i>Oh, no. One more time, back in.
Yeah, no.</i>

1964
01:59:20,695 --> 01:59:21,905
<i>It's over.</i>

1965
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:29,162
<i>This also came late.
I think it was Jeff Ford's idea</i>

1966
01:59:29,245 --> 01:59:32,999
<i>that we knew Thor was
gonna hit it from up top,</i>

1967
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:36,628
<i>but the idea that Iron Man's
down below came late.</i>

1968
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:40,340
<i>Iron Man's action usually
gets enhanced late in the film</i>

1969
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:44,010
<i>because, like the Hulk and Ultron,
he's not there.</i>

1970
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:47,055
<i>He doesn't exist,
that's a CGI character, and so</i>

1971
01:59:47,138 --> 01:59:53,186
<i>you think you know what you
want him to do, and then you find,</i>

1972
01:59:53,269 --> 01:59:56,439
<i>"Wait, there's a way
to up the stakes here."</i>

1973
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:01,027
<i>This is another thing that I feel like</i>

1974
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:03,071
(CHUCKLING)
<i>other studios wouldn't let you do,</i>

1975
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:05,532
<i>is have him just singing
like that, to himself.</i>

1976
02:00:08,076 --> 02:00:12,497
<i>And then getting genuinely brutal.</i>

1977
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:15,667
<i>I wanted this to be unlovely.</i>

1978
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,545
<i>And when I said to Jeremy,</i>

1979
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:21,840
<i>"Just look at it and know
that your death is imminent,</i>

1980
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,050
<i>"and that you're okay with it."</i>

1981
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:28,555
<i>The look on his face was, um, priceless.</i>

1982
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:35,270
<i>And the cut to Wanda with the sound</i>

1983
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:39,649
<i>of what's going on here
before anything happens,</i>

1984
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:43,695
<i>is revealed, rather, is also great.</i>

1985
02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:46,489
<i>I almost didn't wanna cut
to that overhead shot of him</i>

1986
02:00:46,573 --> 02:00:50,952
<i>because he did that fall,
just face-planted, so beautifully</i>

1987
02:00:51,035 --> 02:00:54,664
<i>that I wanted people to see.</i>

1988
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:59,919
<i>But then I couldn't resist the hyperbole
of being directly above him</i>

1989
02:01:00,003 --> 02:01:01,963
<i>when he landed on the ground.</i>

1990
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:07,719
<i>Emotional hyperbole,
let's face it, that's my jam.</i>

1991
02:01:14,809 --> 02:01:16,936
<i>We shot that...</i>

1992
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:22,901
<i>That's one of the first scenes we shot,
and then we re-shot it, where she...</i>

1993
02:01:24,194 --> 02:01:26,571
<i>They have their last exchange,
and then she senses he's dead,</i>

1994
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:31,993
<i>and goes down on her knees,
and the first time we shot it, she wept.</i>

1995
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:39,209
<i>And just an enormous amount of snot
came flying, just pouring down.</i>

1996
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:42,003
<i>It was very realistic,
it was kind of awesome.</i>

1997
02:01:42,212 --> 02:01:44,506
<i>She was laughing about it afterwards,
she's like,</i>

1998
02:01:44,589 --> 02:01:47,091
<i>"I probably should have
warned you that would happen."</i>

1999
02:01:47,175 --> 02:01:50,804
<i>So we dialled that
back the second time.</i>

2000
02:01:50,887 --> 02:01:56,267
<i>But she still conveys such
extraordinary grief and gravitas,</i>

2001
02:01:56,351 --> 02:02:00,730
<i>and her bit with Ultron after</i>

2002
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:04,901
<i>is one of my favourite things
I've ever put on film.</i>

2003
02:02:07,487 --> 02:02:10,573
<i>As much as this process was difficult,</i>

2004
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:14,911
<i>that's something I end up
saying a lot in this movie.</i>

2005
02:02:27,757 --> 02:02:29,050
Wanda.

2006
02:02:29,717 --> 02:02:33,012
If you stay here, you'll die.

2007
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:38,017
WHEDON: <i>He had different lead-ins
to her line, "I just did."</i>

2008
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:43,106
<i>I liked the idea that what he said

how the movie was gonna end,</i>

2152
02:11:56,033 --> 02:12:01,580
<i>he just lost it because you don't say it,
you don't finish the sentence.</i>

2153
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,791
<i>You let the audience
finish the sentence.</i>

2154
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:07,336
<i>And you also say, "There is more."</i>

2155
02:12:09,296 --> 02:12:14,760
<i>This whole sequence is my favourite
of these that I've seen.</i>

2156
02:12:14,844 --> 02:12:16,887
<i>The idea of...</i>

2157
02:12:18,013 --> 02:12:20,599
<i>The post-credits sequences
in Marvel are always really good.</i>

2158
02:12:20,683 --> 02:12:22,893
<i>This one, I thought,
is lovely because it...</i>

2159
02:12:23,144 --> 02:12:27,106
<i>The idea that they have been
immortalised in statue.</i>

2160
02:12:27,189 --> 02:12:31,026
<i>There's a statue at the beginning
you see before Grand Central,</i>

2161
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:35,364
<i>which is the heroes of New York,
and its cops and first-responders,</i>

2162
02:12:35,448 --> 02:12:39,243
<i>and we had a whole sequence
about the unveiling of that,</i>

2163
02:12:39,326 --> 02:12:42,121
<i>and then it was taken out,
but we made sure we kept</i>

2164
02:12:42,204 --> 02:12:44,165
<i>the statue in the movie.</i>

2165
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:47,585
<i>So, to put these guys in marble,
it elevates them,</i>

2166
02:12:47,668 --> 02:12:48,961
<i>but, to me, it also grounds them</i>

2167
02:12:49,044 --> 02:12:52,798
<i>in a way of saying, "Yeah,
these guys were veterans of a war</i>

2168
02:12:52,882 --> 02:12:56,343
<i>"that they fought to the last,</i>

2169
02:12:56,427 --> 02:12:59,472
<i>"and, in some cases,
gave the last full measure."</i>

2170
02:12:59,555 --> 02:13:05,311
<i>And that they should be remembered,
and that an era is over.</i>

2171
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:09,064
<i>And as this is my goodbye
to the world of Marvel,</i>

2172
02:13:10,107 --> 02:13:11,901
<i>it seems like a nice one.</i>

2173
02:13:18,073 --> 02:13:20,618
<i>But there's still this guy.</i>

2174
02:13:24,955 --> 02:13:29,335
<i>This was exactly what I pitched,
again, before the movie.</i>

2175
02:13:32,004 --> 02:13:35,674
<i>Loki failed, Red Skull failed.</i>

2176
02:13:37,343 --> 02:13:39,261
<i>Ronan failed.</i>

2177
02:13:40,596 --> 02:13:42,890
<i>So, it's time.</i>

2178
02:13:42,973 --> 02:13:47,353
<i>Third movie, it's time,
which is somebody else's problem.</i>

2179
02:13:47,436 --> 02:13:49,021
<i>There is one more thing I have to say.</i>

2180
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:52,066
<i>I'm not going to speak through
48 minutes of credits,</i>

2181
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:53,359
<i>though you should watch them all</i>

2182
02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:57,321
<i>because every person listed in them
did extraordinary work,</i>

2183
02:13:57,404 --> 02:13:59,907
<i>and I'm enormously grateful.</i>

2184
02:14:00,950 --> 02:14:05,955
<i>And I apologise to all the people
I didn't mention because I should've.</i>

2185
02:14:06,038 --> 02:14:11,168
<i>But I did promise that I would say
something about an Easter egg.</i>

2186
02:14:12,086 --> 02:14:13,921
<i>I don't...</i>

2187
02:14:14,588 --> 02:14:17,550
<i>Usually, I try not to be self-indulgent.</i>

2188
02:14:18,342 --> 02:14:21,387
<i>I just had a feeling
there was a connection</i>

2189
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:26,809
<i>between the evils of this world
and the evils of all worlds.</i>

2190
02:14:28,185 --> 02:14:31,063
<i>And there is that one shot
in Thor's dream</i>

2191
02:14:31,146 --> 02:14:34,191
<i>of three guys in an archway,
wearing three masks,</i>

2192
02:14:34,275 --> 02:14:36,986
<i>and the masks are very expressionistic,</i>

2193
02:14:37,069 --> 02:14:39,989
<i>so it might be hard
to see exactly what they are,</i>

2194
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,324
<i>and we only held on them for a moment.</i>

2195
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:47,621
<i>And they were originally
seen over a line of Thor's</i>

2196
02:14:47,705 --> 02:14:49,540
<i>that was taken out, where he says,</i>

2197
02:14:49,623 --> 02:14:52,626
<i>"It's been a long journey,
and dark forces followed me."</i>

2198
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:56,338
<i>And the idea that
there is something bigger at stake,</i>

2199
02:14:56,422 --> 02:14:58,799
<i>which we hit in
his revelation of the jewels,</i>

2200
02:14:58,882 --> 02:15:03,721
<i>but "dark forces"
was when you cut to those guys.</i>

2201
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:09,476
<i>Basically, though expressionistic,
they are based on three animals,</i>

2202
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:12,605
<i>a wolf, a ram, and a hart.</i>

2203
02:15:12,688 --> 02:15:17,192
<i>And some of you might know
what that means to me.</i>

2204
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:21,113
<i>Thank you for listening. We're done.</i>
