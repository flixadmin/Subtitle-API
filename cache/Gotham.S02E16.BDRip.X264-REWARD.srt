1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,215
<i>I heard
they let you out of Arkham.</i>

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,841
Yes. I'm sane.

4
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,053
- I'm Elijah Van Dahl.
- Oh, Oswald Cobblepot.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,263
- You're related to Gertrud?
- My mother.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:13,765
She never told me.

7
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,058
Told you what?

8
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,393
That I had a son.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,104
You have a home now, and a father.

10
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,689
<i>A big happy family.</i>

11
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,608
- Is this a dream?
- It's not a dream, my boy. You're home.

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,403
- Hello, Officer Pinkney. Can I come in?
- Sure.

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,157
Murder weapon was a crowbar.

14
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,492
Your fingerprints were on it.

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,660
I was set up!

16
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,495
<i>Detective Gordon guilty on all counts.</i>

17
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,455
How can you not be with us?

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,290
Birthdays,

19
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,792
and first steps,

20
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,168
and skinned knees.

21
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,629
You need to go somewhere.
Start a new life.

22
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,631
Jim, don't do this. I love you.

23
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:50,593
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Jim, I love you. Don't do this. Jim!

24
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,685
On your feet. Let's go.

25
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,446
<i>Step out.</i>

26
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,699
<i>Line it up.</i>

27
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,495
<i>Face your right. Walk.</i>

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,855
<i>Lights out!</i>

29
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,638
<i>Get out there.</i>

30
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,649
<i>Lights out!</i>

31
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,429
<i>Keep it moving.</i>

32
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,598
<i>Stay in line.</i>

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,101
<i>Stop.</i>

34
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:08,356
Prisoner Gordon,
step out of line and remain silent.

35
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,278
<i>Let's move.</i>

36
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,036
Several weeks with no incidents, Gordon.

37
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,163
I'm impressed.

38
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,625
Not what I expected.
Word was you were a troublemaker.

39
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,502
I just wanna do my time.

40
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,798
Well, it's time to move you.

41
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,758
Where to?

42
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,135
F Wing.

43
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,095
World's End,

44
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:40,847
general population.

45
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,891
This should not come as a surprise to you.

46
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,894
Protective custody
is just a temporary privilege.

47
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:49,606
<i>One which can't be sustained
for a sentence as long as yours.</i>

48
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,066
Now, perhaps you have an appeal pending.

49
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,528
In which case,
I can prolong this arrangement.

50
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,118
That's got to sting just a little, no?

51
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,746
<i>Your people seem to have abandoned you.</i>

52
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,373
Being convicted for murder
has its downsides.

53
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,626
<i>Don't fret so.</i>

54
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:14,005
I'm sure you'll see a lot
of familiar faces over in F Wing.

55
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:18,051
Many of which you arrested yourself.

56
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,110
It's payback time.

57
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,123
What's up?

58
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,091
<i>And there goes the flying scissor kick...</i>

59
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,301
That one wasn't mine?

60
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,889
If you show yourself to be a team player,
anything's possible.

61
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,145
You a team player, Gordon?

62
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,315
I love it.

63
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,028
Oh, and I forgot to pass on
my good friend's regard.

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,239
Ex-Commissioner Loeb says hi.

65
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,910
Follow the rules
and perhaps you'll survive.

66
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,121
Break them and you most certainly won't.

67
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,707
It's why they call this wing
"World's End."

68
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,084
For most here, it's exactly that. The end.

69
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,129
Only way out, parole,

70
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,505
or a body bag.

71
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,925
And nobody gets parole.

72
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:59,027
It's true, I swear it. Clear as day.
A ghost.

73
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,613
She was this pale old woman
in a long black dress.

74
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,907
- She was this close.
- What did you do?

75
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,035
Oh, I ran away screaming of course.

76
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,372
Do you believe in ghosts, Oswald?

77
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,792
Yes, I do. I've seen them.

78
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,711
This house has several of them.

79
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,797
But don't worry,
they're all quite friendly.

80
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,133
Don't listen to him.
There are no ghosts here.

81
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:23,885
<i>Oh, there's ghosts all right.</i>

82
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,636
This house was built by my grandfather.

83
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:30,892
He died here. His wife and two sisters
also passed away upstairs.

84
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,102
And my poor, dear parents.

85
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,315
Yes, many ghosts.

86
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,566
Hmm.

87
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,903
How did you meet?

88
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,155
That's a boring story, really.

89
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,531
No. Let me tell it, dear.

90
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,493
After my mother died,
I sat alone in this house for months,

91
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:49,994
barely got out of bed in fact.

92
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,372
Finally, I found a diner
not too far from here.

93
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:57,168
I'd go there every day at the same time,
order the same thing.

94
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,378
Chicken soup and a seltzer.

95
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,172
Grace was my waitress.

96
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,132
<i>And I grew very fond of her.</i>

97
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,052
She told me of her two poor children,
Sasha and Charles.

98
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,846
<i>And how they suffered at the hands
of their abusive father.</i>

99
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,515
<i>I had to help.</i>

100
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,683
I offered her refuge and she accepted.

101
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:15,478
And this house heard laughter once again.

102
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,648
Then one thing led to another.

103
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,983
Love blossomed.

104
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,985
And here we are.

105
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,324
But you are my only true blood relative,
Oswald.

106
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:42,255
- Oh, my poor dear! Are you hurt at all?
- No, no, I'm, I'm fine.

107
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,548
Clumsy girl.

108
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,468
To family.

109
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,928
- Family.
- To family.

110
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,305
- To family.
- To family.

111
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,399
Dent, they got him
in general population now, F Wing.

112
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,402
You know what that means?
Everyone we've ever put away is in there.

113
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,112
<i>Stop saying that!</i>

114
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,406
<i>There's always something you can do.
A retrial.</i>

115
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,825
Or have him transferred to another prison
for God's sake.

116
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,121
You know what. Just keep doing
what you always do, which is nothing!

117
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,917
Ed.

118
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,843
He's wasting away in that place while
the real killer is out there somewhere

119
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,428
eating donuts and getting laid.

120
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,931
The real killer?
The fingerprints on the murder weapon...

121
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,433
Jim is innocent.

122
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,060
He didn't kill Pinkney.

123
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,065
Well, gee, I mean,
that's unfair. If that's true.

124
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,026
What are you gonna do about it?

125
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,030
I wish I knew. I wish I knew.

126
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,787
My health forbids me
from drinking,

127
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,165
but at least I can watch you
enjoy this sherry.

128
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,125
- Hmm.
- It was my father's favorite.

129
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,669
Is that him?

130
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,256
<i>No, that's my
great grandfather Manfred.</i>

131
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,344
He started a small tailor's shop
in Gotham many, many years ago.

132
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,430
Made suits for the city's elite.

133
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,227
My father became an apprentice
like every son before him.

134
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,646
- You were an apprentice, too?
<i>- I was.</i>

135
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,481
Had rather a flair for it.

136
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,943
But it was not to be.

137
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,363
When my father succumbed to illness,

138
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,492
my mother held me close to her.

139
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,078
Homeschooled me.

140
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:40,790
She felt a need to protect me
from the temptations of the city.

141
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,879
All this time I've been afraid to ask
about your mother.

142
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,010
I'm so sorry I abandoned her.

143
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,973
Had I known I was also abandoning you...

144
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,977
<i>Dear God, I'm such a cowardly fool.</i>

145
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,355
<i>Did she have a happy life?</i>

146
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:09,110
No. Not a happy life. But a good one.

147
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,280
She never hurt a soul.

148
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:17,868
I was not always a good son
and she never spoke a word of reproach.

149
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,371
"Not always a good son"?

150
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,209
I find that hard to credit.
A nice, young man like you?

151
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,046
Believe me.

152
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,842
I've done bad things.

153
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,308
We're all sinners, my boy.

154
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,230
It's time for your medicine, my love.

155
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,201
Thank you.

156
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:04,915
Doctor gave them to me for my heart.
Better safe than sorry.

157
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,461
You have a visitor, Mr. Gordon.
This way, please.

158
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,296
<i>I'm not going back to the hole.</i>

159
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,132
- He promised.
- The warden's the one who's moving you.

160
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,593
What? This wasn't our agreement.

161
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,930
<i>No, you listen.
This isn't fair, I paid for this cell.</i>

162
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,807
<i>It's mine, you feel me? Mine!</i>

163
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,063
This way, please.

164
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,488
A lot of business going on.
The warden get a cut?

165
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,281
Almost there.

166
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,871
I want the boy scout dead by week's end.

167
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,218
Damn, you look good, brother.

168
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,220
This place agrees with you.

169
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:45,850
Maybe I'll check in and lose a few pounds.
Hmm? Get a cool tat.

170
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,560
You don't need to check up on me.

171
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,021
You kidding? Highlight of my week
to see your smiling face.

172
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,901
Look, I spoke to Dent,
he's looking into reopening the case.

173
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,486
But you got to keep your nose clean.

174
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,656
Last thing you can do is do more time
'cause you lost your temper, all right?

175
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,367
Shouldn't be that hard,
everyone seems really nice around here.

176
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,369
I've been looking for Penguin,
see what he's got to say.

177
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,164
He's laying low someplace.
But don't worry. I'll find him.

178
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,790
How's Lee?

179
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,918
She's been writing to me a lot.

180
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,547
The letters stopped a few weeks ago.

181
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,883
Know why?

182
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,805
I didn't want to be the one
to tell you this.

183
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,393
Tell me what?

184
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,482
They lost the baby, Jim.

185
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,945
I'm so sorry.

186
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,047
How is she?

187
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,509
I don't know.

188
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,013
I think she's fine. She moved down south.
No one's heard from her since.

189
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,100
Hey. Don't let this beat you.

190
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,440
It was good to see you, Harv.

191
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,442
Jim, I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

192
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,405
Jim, don't let this break you.
Don't give up hope.

193
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,324
Jim! Jim!

194
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,917
Where you going, pig?

195
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,798
My little brother ran with the crew
that pulled off a few bank jobs last year.

196
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,926
The papers called them the Red Hood gang.
Remember them?

197
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,303
You put a bullet in my brother's head.

198
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,888
Whoa!

199
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,308
Who's this?

200
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,311
How about I have my friends
on the outside pay her a visit?

201
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:57,481
Show her what she's been missing.

202
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:07,992
Hey, hey, hey guys, cool it, cool it. Huh.

203
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,953
Peace. Peace.

204
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,329
Don't.

205
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,331
It's all right, Mr. Gordon, I got this.

206
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,584
Now, come on now, guys,
let's just take a deep breath.

207
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,336
Yeah!

208
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,511
Get back to your cells!

209
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,182
You!

210
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,853
Assume the position. Now. Now.

211
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,230
<i>- Disperse.</i>
<i>- Back it up. Back it up.</i>

212
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,193
Take inmate Weaver to the hole
and these two to the infirmary.

213
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,321
Get up. Get up.

214
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,031
Let's go. You heard him.

215
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,927
- Father?
- What? Who?

216
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,097
It's okay. You, you were sleepwalking.

217
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,390
Oh.

218
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,225
Oh, I was.

219
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,477
My father's office.

220
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:05,025
- Here, let me, let me get you a chair.
- No, help me back to bed, won't you?

221
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,527
Of course.

222
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:18,747
<i>They're for my condition.</i>

223
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,792
- Your heart?
- I have a hole in it.

224
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,003
<i>Keeps getting bigger apparently.</i>

225
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,965
I think my demons are feeding on it.

226
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,138
You have demons?

227
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,348
Sadly, I do.

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,893
You, too, I fear.

229
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,105
There is so much I haven't told you.

230
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,316
So much that I'm ashamed of.

231
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,405
I was a criminal.

232
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:56,535
I've done horrible things.

233
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,707
Hurt people, manipulated, lied.

234
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,377
For power, for revenge.

235
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,051
I've killed people, Father.

236
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,851
Our lives together started
the moment I met you at the cemetery.

237
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,479
Nothing before that concerns me.

238
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,732
I forgive you
for all of your past transgressions.

239
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,028
Be free of them and live here in peace.

240
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,714
We showed them, huh?

241
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,386
- Look, uh, whatever your name is--
- Puck.

242
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,891
Well, Peter, actually.
But people call me Puck.

243
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,644
Stay away from me, okay?
I don't need your help.

244
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,896
Can't do that, Detective Gordon.

245
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,734
- I'm not a detective anymore.
- Oh, I know.

246
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,362
You're way more than that.

247
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,240
You're a true hero.

248
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,119
Two winters ago my little sister
was abducted by child snatchers.

249
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,664
Three days she was gone.

250
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,084
Then you found her,
and you busted the scum that took her.

251
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,295
You saved her life and dozens of others.

252
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,090
Right there, that's a true hero.

253
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,717
I was just doing my job.

254
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,511
No, sir.

255
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,683
- What are you in for?
- A girl.

256
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,893
Beautiful girl.

257
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,939
I asked her out and she said yes.
She was classy.

258
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,692
I couldn't make her take the bus,
so I snatched a car.

259
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,443
Well. Borrowed it.

260
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,573
I was gonna take it back.
Cops didn't believe me.

261
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,533
So, here I am.

262
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,285
What'd they give you?

263
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,996
- Six years.
- Steep.

264
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,164
Hey, I can't complain.

265
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,835
I broke the law, right?
And the law is the law.

266
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,630
I'm not gonna be like my grandfather.
He died in here.

267
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,926
Wouldn't let me and my father visit him
after a while, but finally we did.

268
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,636
Last time I saw him

269
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,805
he was different.

270
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,516
Didn't recognize him.

271
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,311
That's not gonna happen to me, no, sir.

272
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,146
I won't die in here.

273
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,697
Then stay away from me.

274
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:45,037
What are these prisoners still doing here?
Get them to their cells immediately.

275
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,168
And watch this one.

276
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,671
He just lost a child.

277
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,176
Makes him mad. That's right.

278
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:03,597
I hear everything, I see everything.

279
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,267
Everything you know, I know.

280
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,187
I know something you don't know.

281
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,397
Yeah? What's that?

282
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,901
I know what kind of man you are.

283
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,115
Get him out of here. Now.

284
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,040
- Gin!
- Oh.

285
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,209
Elijah, brace yourself.

286
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,003
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

287
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,713
Oh, dear.

288
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,590
Charles was at the public library today.

289
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,592
Research for the novel I'm writing.

290
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,179
I was reading some old newspapers
and I made an alarming discovery.

291
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,225
My dear, Oswald is not the nice,
young man he says he is.

292
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,394
If we didn't lead
such sheltered lives here,

293
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,354
we would know what the whole world knows.

294
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,815
He's a notorious criminal.

295
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,776
We've been sheltering a killer.

296
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,074
We could've all been raped
and murdered in our beds.

297
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,534
Raped and murdered.

298
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,664
They call you the Penguin?

299
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,044
To be fair,

300
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,131
I never raped anybody.

301
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,425
Oh, well, that's a mercy, now isn't it?

302
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,094
My son told me about his past.

303
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,014
He just didn't tell me how famous he was.

304
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,974
You're too modest, son.

305
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,811
Elijah. A violent criminal in our house?

306
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,939
Grace, relax. He's changed. Redeemed.

307
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,109
- You're not this man anymore. Are you?
- No, sir.

308
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,237
But how? How do you know?
How do you know he's not?

309
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,114
I've looked into his soul.

310
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,241
I've seen his beautiful heart.

311
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,250
"The Dapper Gangland Kingpin"! Oh!

312
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,046
What now?

313
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,630
What now?

314
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,675
Plan B.

315
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:05,594
What's plan B?

316
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,806
You are, my dear.

317
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:22,819
Good morning.

318
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,989
Uh, good morning.

319
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,578
I was hoping to spend
a little time with you, Mr. Penguin.

320
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,663
Okay.

321
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,084
But, um, uh, please, call me Oswald.

322
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,503
I'm not that man anymore.

323
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,047
There isn't a little bit of Penguin left?

324
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,382
A little bad boy?

325
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,426
No.

326
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,346
I got a little bad girl in me.

327
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,060
Whatever you've got planned
for the old man, I want in.

328
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,269
"In"?

329
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,105
We could do great things, you and me.

330
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,689
I suppose. I hadn't--

331
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,400
If you and me work together,
we could have it all.

332
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,444
We could squeeze my mom and brother out.

333
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,654
Why would we do that?

334
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,656
I don't know.

335
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,368
I guess we're just
a couple of crazy, mixed up kids.

336
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,955
Good heavens!

337
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,792
Restrain yourself, woman.
I'm practically your brother.

338
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,210
What are you thinking?

339
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,218
He didn't bite.

340
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,719
Should I try?

341
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:33,640
No. I don't think he's faking.
I think he's kind of simple.

342
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,687
Huh.

343
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,031
Gordon. Gordon.

344
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:55,412
Watch yourself.
Weaver's coming out the hole. Now.

345
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,164
Already?

346
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,333
Nothing happens around here
like it's supposed to.

347
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,186
Your day's coming, Gordon.
You're a dead man!

348
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,315
Take a look at your boyfriend over there.

349
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,819
Puck!

350
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,449
Who's gonna help you now, pig?

351
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,624
<i>Hey, you like that, Gordon?</i>

352
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,675
Let it go. Don't extend your sentence.

353
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,484
Ah.

354
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,488
Jim didn't kill that kid, we all know it.
Thing is, who did?

355
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,366
I mean, who'd set him up that way?

356
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,412
I just don't know how much longer
he can stay alive in that place.

357
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,500
I guess I'm asking for your help.

358
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,669
Funny, huh?

359
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,963
You have every right to tell me
to go to hell.

360
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,340
But I...

361
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,593
I got no one else to turn to.

362
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,638
Hmm.

363
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,432
You know, Harvey,

364
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,686
it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.

365
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,951
You like the fabric? It's Italian.

366
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,203
I love it.

367
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,956
A man can say so much about himself
by what he wears.

368
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,874
I couldn't agree more.

369
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,590
I weep for today's casual youth.

370
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,895
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.
It's been so long.

371
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,278
Are you all right?

372
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,159
Father?

373
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,662
Help! Help! Someone call for an ambulance!

374
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,372
<i>Charles!</i>

375
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,167
<i>Help! Help, Grace!</i>

376
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,210
What did you do to Elijah?

377
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,838
- Nothing.
<i>- Help!</i>

378
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,468
Coming, my dear!
Clean up this mess and call the doctor.

379
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,605
Go on.

380
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,691
Hard at it, I see.

381
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,735
Thanks for getting me my old job back.

382
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,029
Your friend Puck is pretty banged up.

383
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,823
Might do him some good if you were
to come see him in the infirmary.

384
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,118
Yeah, no.

385
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,912
I'm not his friend.

386
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,205
He thinks you are.

387
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,626
The kid's gonna die in here
one way or another.

388
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,300
We'll be quick.

389
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,145
Hey.

390
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,482
How you holding up?

391
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,150
Cool.

392
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,779
They said I have a clot or something.

393
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,573
But I just feel seasick.

394
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,284
Thanks for coming to see me.

395
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,662
Means a lot.

396
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,997
I'm sure they'll take
good care of you in here.

397
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,084
- You hang in there, huh.
- Listen.

398
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,339
Don't give up hope.

399
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:19,884
I feel your sadness.

400
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,262
I do.

401
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,391
But you gotta choose life, you know?

402
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:29,894
Okay.

403
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:32,689
Choose life.

404
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,066
Good.

405
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,362
But listen, kid, uh,

406
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,365
when you get better,

407
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,161
you learn the lesson here
and you stay the hell away from me.

408
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,290
<i>I'm not a hero and I'm not your friend.</i>

409
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,376
I'm just a convict.

410
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,471
Tonight's movie night.

411
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,724
Everyone in the main hall together
with the lights off.

412
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,392
Be ready.

413
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:13,062
- For what?
- Just be ready.

414
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,576
His condition has gotten worse.

415
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,495
The hole has gotten bigger,

416
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,914
and now there's an infection.

417
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,583
I've given him antibiotics
and rehydrated him,

418
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,628
but I fear it will have
little consequence.

419
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,047
It's time for him
to get his affairs in order.

420
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,424
He may not have long.

421
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,766
I'm going to have them
make you some nice chicken soup.

422
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:50,934
You need your strength.

423
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,393
How kind.

424
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,607
<i>Come here, my boy.</i>

425
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,279
Don't listen to doctors, son.

426
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,450
<i>I've proved them wrong
so many times I've lost count.</i>

427
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,788
You and I will have many more years
to spend together.

428
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,208
Trust me.

429
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,130
But perhaps we should speak
with my lawyer, dear.

430
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,842
I have some things
I'd like to go over with him.

431
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,136
So much has changed these past weeks.

432
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:30,807
Of course. I'll have him stop by. Mmm-hmm.

433
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,532
Right.

434
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:31,618
He's called for his lawyer.

435
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,911
- He's going to change his will?
- Yes.

436
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,789
And when he dies,
Cobblepot will get what's rightfully ours.

437
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,334
<i>That old man was a shriveled up wreck
when I met him.</i>

438
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,044
I made him feel young again.

439
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,339
I brought him back to life,
and what has this gutter rodent done?

440
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:48,009
Played stupid board games
and whined about his wretched mother.

441
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,387
That vermin has to go.

442
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,389
But he likes it here.

443
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,725
<i>How can we persuade him to go?</i>

444
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,186
How do you get rid of rats?

445
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,482
- Glue traps?
- No, silly.

446
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:08,112
Hello, hello.
Father is feeling much better,

447
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,864
but he is resting

448
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,116
so he will not be joining us tonight.

449
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,119
Well, that's fine. Let's eat, hmm?

450
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,748
- Thank you.
- Oh...

451
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,309
<i>I'm a pretty bride.
Look, everybody</i>.

452
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,274
Yo, show's over.

453
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,943
Come on, Officer.

454
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,475
Yo, get down.

455
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,439
What are you doing? He's mine!

456
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:26,941
He's mine.

457
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:32,280
Stay down. You're dead. You understand?

458
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,574
You understand?

459
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,577
You're done, pig.

460
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,371
Get him out of here.
Clear them out of here.

461
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,539
<i>Come to order.</i>

462
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,999
<i>Get them out of here.</i>

463
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,799
We're gonna need a body bag.

464
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,460
Bullock? What the hell are you doing here?

465
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,378
What's it look like?
We're getting you out of here.

466
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,546
Come on, let's go.

467
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,715
Fake blood, retractable knife.
I can't believe it worked.

468
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,884
Wait. Wait.

469
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,722
Harvey, what if this is
where I'm supposed to be?

470
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,224
What? Let's go.

471
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,726
Bullock.

472
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,937
You sure?

473
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:47,396
Are you tripping?

474
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,732
A lot of good men put their butts
on a live rail for you.

475
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,567
Me, him, Don freaking Falcone.

476
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,028
Where walking around somewhere is
the guy that killed Pinkney,

477
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,739
framed you and destroyed your family. Hmm?

478
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,742
He's walking around while
you're standing there all blue and misty.

479
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,494
Well, screw your self-pity and let's go!

480
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:02,745
Amen.

481
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:04,997
All right.

482
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,501
But I need one more favor.

483
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,602
Hello?

484
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:30,439
Detective Gordon?

485
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:31,607
We're out of here.

486
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:34,026
We need to move as quickly
and quietly as you can.

487
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,445
- You mean like escaping?
- Like that.

488
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,114
But that's against the law.

489
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:40,908
Yeah. Like you said, choose life.

490
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,952
Told you, didn't I?

491
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,830
Whether you like it or not, you're a hero.

492
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:51,961
Prisoner Gordon.
You're supposed to be dead.

493
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm as surprised as you are.

494
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,966
What brought you back to life?

495
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,760
- Friends.
- Friends.

496
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,680
It's good to have friends.

497
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,683
But where are they
when you need them, huh?

498
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,897
Man, that felt good.

499
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:15,109
- Sorry I got you into all this.
- Are you kidding?

500
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,528
Never felt more alive. Now.

501
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,363
Hit me hard, make it look good.

502
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:22,491
Just don't touch the teeth.
I just had them fixed.

503
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,414
My dear mother. She was so young.

504
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,625
Oswald.

505
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,004
Thank you so much, Grace.

506
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,353
I lied to you, son.

507
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:52,855
Oh.

508
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,524
My father was never physically ill.

509
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,736
He only suffered a deep melancholy.

510
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,073
<i>He was plagued by dark impulses,</i>

511
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,533
evil thoughts of violence.

512
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:10,039
Mother said many in his family
had the same affliction.

513
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,713
<i>I remember the sound of the gunshot.</i>

514
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,548
<i>I was outside his room.</i>

515
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,592
I screamed for my mother to get the key.

516
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,970
<i>I saw the warm gun in his hand.</i>

517
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,930
The blood.

518
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,182
His face.

519
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,396
Mother said never to talk about it.

520
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,273
<i>For years after the funeral
we never left the house.</i>

521
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,318
I don't pretend to understand
my father's torment.

522
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,239
But I think that perhaps you do.

523
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:49,620
I feel for you and I beg of you, my son.

524
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,540
Never give in to the pain as he did.

525
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,917
<i>You are loved</i>

526
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,752
and you are not alone.

527
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,548
And the sun will come up tomorrow.

528
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,136
Thank you, Father.

529
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,349
Now, I feel like a drink.

530
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,728
But, but, your health?

531
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,188
To hell with that.

532
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:25,364
I want you to have it all, my son.

533
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,700
This house and all that's in it.

534
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:31,537
Keep it just the way it is,
a piece of history,

535
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:33,956
our history...

536
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,667
Gotham's history.

537
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,546
First thing tomorrow
I'll have my lawyers draw it up.

538
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:49,972
Father?

539
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,060
- Father, no.
<i>- Elijah!</i>

540
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,481
- Did he, did he drink that?
- Yes.

541
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,900
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

542
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:02,943
Sasha, call an ambulance. Call an...

543
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,665
Stay with us, Father,
help is on the way.

544
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,379
No!

545
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,814
We made it, buddy.

546
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,734
Wait here.

547
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,247
Don Falcone had all the contacts
inside of Blackgate.

548
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,374
He made this whole thing happen.

549
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,212
Thank you.

550
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,923
I'm not sure I can ever repay you.

551
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:10,177
That won't be necessary.
I'm happy to help an old friend.

552
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:11,971
What now?

553
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:16,058
You're asking me?
Two hours ago I was a dead man.

554
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,853
I have people that will get you
out of the country.

555
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,397
Or I can arrange
a safe place for you in Gotham.

556
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,232
Your choice.

557
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,000
What do you wanna do?

558
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,503
I wanna go find Lee.

559
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,174
And to do that I have to clear my name.

560
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,093
And to do that
I have to go to back to Gotham.

561
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,387
So there's your answer.

562
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,684
Part of me says run.

563
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,979
<i>I'm breathing fresh air.</i>

564
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,399
I can't go back inside.

565
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:09,612
If you run, you've got to keep running.

566
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,656
Some people can live with that.

567
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,078
You're a fighter, Jim.
You got knocked down.

568
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,207
Do you stay down?

569
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,709
Or do you get back up?

570
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,591
What do you think, kid?

571
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,596
Puck?

572
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:42,478
No, no, we made it. Come on, come on, no.

573
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,939
Come on, don't give up. Puck.

574
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,275
He's gone.

575
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,736
Jim, he's gone.

576
00:43:58,929 --> 00:43:59,972
