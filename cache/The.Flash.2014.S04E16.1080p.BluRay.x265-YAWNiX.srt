1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,171
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,260
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,713
<i>"I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me."</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,348
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,177
<i>"It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back."</i>

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,138
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,727
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,351
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,778
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,821
<i>This is where
I came out of the Speed Force.</i>

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,658
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,452
DeVoe orchestrated everything to get
the people he wanted on the bus.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,247
But why does he need their powers?
I can't figure out his end game.

15
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,370
We got a planner. Just like Thawne.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,043
I hereby deem Barry Allen's appeal

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,916
- denie...
- Wait!

18
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,874
- DeVoe?
- Not DeVoe. It's Ralph.

19
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,711
Barry Allen
is hereby ordered released immediately.

20
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,551
Some people don't think
you should be back on the force.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,511
When do you think I can come back?

22
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,934
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,556
I call this my "thinking cap."

24
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,477
<i>He only wants the bus metas.
He wants their powers.</i>

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,230
- All of them.
- We know a bus meta?

26
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,276
There's three more people out there
who need our help,

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,776
and we need to find them
before DeVoe does.

28
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,527
What if...

29
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,741
What if I just, like,

30
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:26,372
breach all three of the bus metas
to, like, Earth-2?

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,664
How about this?

32
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,495
We alter each bus meta's DNA

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,547
by performing inter-cellular surgery?

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,875
And what, and turn them into chickens?

35
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,127
Yeah.

36
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,011
We're not Frankenstein-ing
innocent people.

37
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,633
Listen, Ramon.

38
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,093
DeVoe wants these bodies.

39
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,303
Maybe we change the bodies,
we keep these people safe.

40
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,684
I'm sorry. Don't you have like six PhDs?

41
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,140
- Seven.
- Yeah, which one of them

42
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,350
is in mad science?

43
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,106
Mad science is just an area of study.

44
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,402
It's not a degree. Okay? And by the way,

45
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,613
I don't see you coming up
with any other ideas.

46
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,908
You know why? 'Cause it's
bedtime over here on Earth-1.

47
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,236
Do you know what bedtime is?
Do they have that on Earth-2?

48
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,071
- Bedtime...
- It's this thing where we just

49
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,908
shut down to recharge our batteries.

50
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,788
- Oh, my gosh.
- I highly recommend it.

51
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,330
- Harry.
- You're still here? What?

52
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,924
No matter what you think,

53
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,550
DeVoe has already thought of it.

54
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,798
So why don't you just go home,

55
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,964
recharge, start again in the morning,
all right?

56
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,932
I'm gonna keep going.

57
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,766
Good night.

58
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,240
Maybe you have thought of everything.

59
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,826
Just like Thawne.

60
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,957
What is all this?

61
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,587
This is gonna give us the edge

62
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,635
we finally need
to be smarter than DeVoe.

63
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,056
Or for me to be smarter
than DeVoe, actually.

64
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,636
Take a look at this.

65
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,722
What is that?

66
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,805
This is an intelligence booster.

67
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,515
You put this thing on Dibny here,

68
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,599
and even he will be able

69
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,105
to understand Poinsot's Construction.

70
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,524
You put it on a real genius,

71
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,155
I'll finally be able to out-think
the Thinker.

72
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,238
You know what?
I'm not sure this "thinking cap"

73
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,365
is the best idea you've ever had.

74
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,491
It's an intelligence booster.

75
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,913
Looks like a thinking cap.

76
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,116
You don't like it, blame yourself.

77
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,872
- You gave me the idea.
- What?

78
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,919
You're the one that said
DeVoe planned all this,

79
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,917
just like Thawne,
in order to stop Barry,

80
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,997
and you said

81
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,209
that DeVoe became the Thinker
the same night you became the Flash

82
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:43,046
and so I hacked into the security
footage of that night

83
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,928
to see how he did it.

84
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,641
This is why he is so smart.

85
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,264
DeVoe boosted his intelligence

86
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,066
with neurochemical engineering

87
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,359
powered by the dark energy from

88
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,731
the Particle Accelerator explosion,

89
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,734
and if we build our own,
we can do the exact same.

90
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,491
Wait. You want to blast your brain

91
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,193
with ten billion joules of dark energy?

92
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,779
I've harnessed energy from the
Particle Accelerator explosion before,

93
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,159
and I can do it again.

94
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,117
Yeah, but, Harry, re-engineering
your brain's neurochemistry, that's...

95
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,200
DeVoe did it.

96
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,748
So can I.

97
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,004
How many more metas have to die

98
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,294
before we finally stop DeVoe?

99
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,168
Uh... not... not me. I mean...

100
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,380
I say we go for it, right? Right, guys?

101
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,256
What do you think?

102
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,884
I say we explore it.

103
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,595
- Yeah, I agree.
- Ramon?

104
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,352
No, this is way too risky.

105
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,648
Of course, it's risky,

106
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,818
but if we succeed,
we will save the lives

107
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,611
of the four remaining bus metas,

108
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,150
including a member of our team.

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,402
You're talking about
intense amounts of dark energy

110
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,201
going right into your brain,
right into that cap,

111
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,074
that turned
a mac-and-cheese-loving pacifist

112
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,496
into a homicidal maniac.

113
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,744
You put that cap on,
what's it gonna do to you?

114
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,291
I ran the numbers dozens of times.

115
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,289
The math and the chemistry
check out. I can do this.

116
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,747
- I don't think you can.
- I can with your help.

117
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,256
Not this time.

118
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,424
All right, let's keep coming up
with more ways to solve this.

119
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,340
Just so I'm clear on this,

120
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,096
someone finally came up
with a way to stop

121
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,973
this La-Z-Boy-riding lunatic,

122
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,139
and we just might not do it?

123
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,188
That's really cool, guys.

124
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,445
- I got this one.
- Yeah, thanks.

125
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,036
It's the only way.

126
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,373
I'm gonna do it
with or without his help.

127
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,793
Hey, Ralph.

128
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,871
Look, don't worry, okay?
We're gonna figure this out.

129
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,331
Yeah, everybody keeps saying that,

130
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,416
and each time we almost get DeVoe,
he gets away.

131
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,546
Every time he gets away,

132
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,252
he's one step closer to getting me.

133
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,837
Hey! That is not going to happen.

134
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,048
Well, I can't
take that chance anymore, Iris.

135
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,928
So, if anyone needs me,
I will be downstairs

136
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,101
in my tiny guest quarters
until this is over.

137
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,894
There are still three bus metas
out there.

138
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,564
And we're gonna need your help
to find them and protect them.

139
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,812
Iris, the only person I need to protect
from now on

140
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,109
is good ol' Ralphy boy.

141
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,440
You are part of this team.

142
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,439
Yeah, and I'm the only one with a body

143
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,069
that DeVoe is trying to snatch.

144
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,407
You don't have any concept

145
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,486
of how dangerous it is for me out there.

146
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,991
Yes, I do.

147
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,165
- How could you?
- Because I am the leader of this team.

148
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,163
Yeah, that's right. You are.

149
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,039
But you're always back there, hiding,

150
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,294
safe and sound.

151
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,081
While the rest of us
are out in the field,

152
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,091
putting our lives on the line.

153
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,115
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

154
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,060
Hey, sorry I'm late.

155
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,736
Some drama in the Cortex.

156
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,529
- Thanks for the coffee.
- It's all good.

157
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,028
You okay?

158
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,155
Yeah, I'm, you know...

159
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,116
Cecile's in her third trimester,

160
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,697
so it's definitely getting serious.

161
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,657
You guys have any names picked out yet?

162
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,413
Uh, yeah, a few.

163
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,121
Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

164
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,750
No, you're not,
because you're not gonna know

165
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,082
until Cecile tells you.

166
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,134
- All right.
- Anyway,

167
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,261
I talked to Singh

168
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,255
about getting you back in the lab.

169
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,339
Yeah, and?

170
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,514
It's gonna be awhile.

171
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,887
Why? I thought

172
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,094
Judge Hankerson and Singh
had everything they needed.

173
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,554
We thought so, too,

174
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,265
but the mayor wants to sit down
with the DeVoes herself.

175
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,933
Seriously?

176
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,609
Look, we can't find Marlize,

177
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,941
so the only chance we got

178
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,489
is to get Ralph to use his
nauseating powers

179
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,111
to impersonate DeVoe again.

180
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,985
I'll ask him, but right now

181
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,070
he'll barely leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

182
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,247
What happened to that whole
buddy system thing you had going on?

183
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,869
It's not enough for him, I guess.

184
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,417
Then I don't know, Barr.

185
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,254
I should be out there, helping people.

186
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,330
Putting bad guys away.

187
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,165
Right now, we should be trying
to stop DeVoe

188
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,750
and finding those last few bus metas

189
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,803
'cause I got a bad feeling
one of them is gonna show up soon.

190
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,313
Next time, it'll be your hand.

191
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,980
Now,

192
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,892
everybody on the floor.

193
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,732
Dude, you got a death wish?
Do what he says.

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,831
Stealing is a sin.

195
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,252
You shouldn't be using the powers
you've been given this way.

196
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,621
I'll use them any way I see fit,

197
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,967
including frying you to a crisp

198
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,338
if you move any closer.

199
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,382
I don't think you will.

200
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,424
You don't want to hurt me
or anyone in this bank.

201
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,972
You can still walk away from this.

202
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,101
But the moment you touch that money,

203
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,683
your life changes forever.

204
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,732
Now, you don't really want that, do you?

205
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,897
Maybe you're right.

206
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,488
Or maybe you've got a death wish.

207
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,867
What the hell?

208
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,166
My powers, they're gone.

209
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,713
No, no, no!

210
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,588
Hey, buddy, you're a real...

211
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,343
hero.

212
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,145
- Cisco.
- Hmm?

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,476
What have you got?

214
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,986
Oh, you know, the usual.

215
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,360
Just loads and loads of dark matter.

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,989
Makes sense. Eyewitnesses said
this guy melted this vault door

217
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,786
with fire from his hands.

218
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,872
Hmm, figures. And not just any fire.

219
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,076
This fire melted through ten inches
of reinforced steel.

220
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,872
I mean, that would take over
6,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

221
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,706
ten times the thermal output
of Rory's heat gun.

222
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,088
Well, here's where it gets weirder.

223
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,008
Apparently, shortly after,
his powers stopped working.

224
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,380
"Stopped working"?

225
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,758
Yeah, so if he was one of our bus metas,

226
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,433
I guess we have one less to worry about.

227
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,310
How would his powers stop working?

228
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,595
Erik Frye.

229
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,890
Six months ago, were you on the 405 bus?

230
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,265
Please.

231
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,235
Do I look like someone
who takes public transit?

232
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,233
All right, then, Mr. Frye,

233
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,985
how long have you had your powers?

234
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,487
A few years.

235
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,318
You're an OG meta.

236
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,903
And you just started using them now?

237
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,533
Here, yeah.

238
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,537
Once Flash showed up,
I took this act on the road.

239
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,620
Doesn't matter anymore, though.

240
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,376
Right, you don't
have your powers anymore.

241
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,132
'Cause they just disappeared,

242
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,011
vanished into thin air? Huh?

243
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,671
All right, Cisco.

244
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,555
He's clear.

245
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,009
You have any idea how this happened?

246
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,517
One minute, I had powers.

247
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,846
The next, nothing.

248
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,147
Can you get him out of here?

249
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,479
That's right. Get him out of here.

250
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,606
No rights?

251
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,777
Yeah, get him out of here.

252
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,114
I can't believe his powers
disappeared like that.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,408
How does someone lose their powers?

254
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,740
So, I can think
of a couple of ways

255
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,866
this might have happened.

256
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,575
If this Erik Frye metastasizes
solar radiation to create heat,

257
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,001
we could put him in the dark
to de-power him.

258
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,248
But it was still broad daylight.

259
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,878
Okay, maybe his internal
biochemistry has been altered

260
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,209
to create its own internal
thermal combustion,

261
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,760
and he just ran out of fuel.

262
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,462
Okay, so if this guy

263
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,889
is not one of the bus metas,
then that means that

264
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,261
there's still three more out there

265
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,933
before DeVoe gets to me,

266
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,395
so I'm safe... Safer. I'm safer.

267
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,891
Those are innocent people, Ralph.

268
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,065
I'm innocent.
I'm still gonna get terminated.

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,517
God.

270
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,186
I'm Sarah Connor.

271
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,481
No. I'm gonna go back to my room,
get some comfort food.

272
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,982
Ralph.

273
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,284
The way I see it,

274
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,113
Frye walks into the bank
with his fire powers,

275
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,698
meets this other guy,

276
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,455
and then his powers are gone.
Coincidence, I think not.

277
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,254
So you think this guy
did something to Frye?

278
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,377
I think we can ask him some questions.

279
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,716
I interviewed every eyewitness
in that bank.

280
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,963
Nobody knew who he was.

281
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,128
Cisco, why don't you cross-check
the deposits from today

282
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,680
with Dad's witness list?

283
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,803
Way ahead of you.
Everyone on the list checks out,

284
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,429
except Matthew Kim,

285
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,636
an EMT out of Central City General.

286
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,891
Barr, let's go ask some questions.

287
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,723
Oh, I'll go.

288
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,686
Barry, you can stay here.

289
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,735
Um, okay, I...

290
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,811
Well, you know, I never go out

291
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,272
into the field,
so I thought, you know...

292
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,824
Yeah, I mean, you're the boss.

293
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,527
Okay, Caitlin, why don't you see

294
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,657
how this power-stealing thing works,

295
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,737
and, Cisco, why don't you use

296
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,323
the satellite's tracking parameters
to scan the city for dark matter?

297
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,908
Mm-hmm.

298
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,034
Okay.

299
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,788
I'll just come running, if you need me.

300
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,293
Okay. Thanks.

301
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,711
Can I hang out in here?

302
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,386
Can you...

303
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,392
Do you mind...
Can you save the eating till later?

304
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,098
We're actually trying
to save lives here.

305
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,733
This is really good though.

306
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,106
- Is it?
- Yeah.

307
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,771
You put this together pretty quick, huh?

308
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,611
Yes, I did, for a test run.

309
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,241
Oh.

310
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,824
I can feel my neurons firing.

311
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,204
Firing at a rate
20 times their normal rate.

312
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,372
And that's without
the addition of dark matter.

313
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,292
I can feel my brain's
processing systems evolving.

314
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,758
There's a 67% chance

315
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,427
you're gonna spill
that mustard on the floor. Oh!

316
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,591
Okay, how did you do that?

317
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,849
Well, I simply
analyzed your eating habits

318
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,594
and extrapolated them into
a predictive behavior model,

319
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,771
all within four seconds.

320
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,269
The cap is working.

321
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,439
Eh, cool, but not quite convinced.

322
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,731
No? Really, you're not convinced?

323
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,362
All right, then.

324
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,485
The answer is none.

325
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,238
And have a little more respect
for your body, will you?

326
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,655
It's a veggie dog, man.

327
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,082
I'm not talking
about the veggie dog, man.

328
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,579
I'm talking about the wiping the mustard
on the pants,

329
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,080
causes the pant movement,
which indicates

330
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,796
a lack of clothing-to-bodily friction,
which can mean only one thing.

331
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,415
Right.

332
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,258
What kind of underwear am I wearing?

333
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,677
And the answer

334
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,046
is none.

335
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,137
You got all that
from your fancy metal cap?

336
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,802
- Yes, I did.
- It's impressive, Harry.

337
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,270
Except for one very small thing.

338
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,347
Which is?

339
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,269
Your head is on fire.

340
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,351
It's not...

341
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,371
When I mentioned
spending more time together,

342
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,124
I meant family barbecues,
not questioning people of interest.

343
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,207
I know. I just want people to know
that I'm not afraid

344
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,087
to go out in the field
every once in a while.

345
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,167
Who says you are?

346
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,718
- Ralph.
- Ralph?

347
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,421
He should talk.
He won't even leave the building.

348
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,757
I know, but he made me wonder, you know,

349
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,221
what kind of leader constantly
puts everyone else's life on the line

350
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,973
except their own?

351
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,136
Baby.

352
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,807
We all know you're fearless.

353
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,937
Whenever you've been needed
on the field, you've gone.

354
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,818
So don't let Ralph get in your head.

355
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,978
Excuse me.

356
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,945
CCPD. We're looking for an EMT
named Matthew Kim.

357
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,026
- Yes, he's right through there.
- There?

358
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,443
Thank you.

359
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,580
Matthew Kim.

360
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,787
Detective Joe West, CCPD.

361
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,994
We'd like to ask you some questions

362
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,831
about the attack
at Central City Bank this morning.

363
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,841
I wouldn't know anything about that.

364
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,546
Really? 'Cause I have
a dozen witnesses that saw you

365
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,053
stand up to the man
that melted the vault.

366
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,806
He was going to hurt people.

367
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,597
It was my duty to help them.

368
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,603
Any reason you left
without making a statement?

369
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,946
I need to finish restocking my inventory
before another call comes in.

370
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,690
- I can't help you.
- Look, Matthew,

371
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,195
we know you had something to do
with the guy at the bank

372
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,322
losing his powers.

373
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,408
We need to know, what did you do to him?

374
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,498
Why? So you can steal mine?

375
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,575
No. No.

376
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,043
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down.

377
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,250
I said, put it down.

378
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,252
He didn't deserve
those powers.

379
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,512
He was hurting people.

380
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,797
Flash.

381
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,050
You're not the only one
that's been blessed with powers.

382
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,679
I'm helping people, too.

383
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,808
Not like this.

384
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,692
You did this, not me.

385
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,989
I got him.

386
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,486
I lost my speed.

387
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,079
What do you mean, you lost your speed?

388
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,083
Uh, guys, I think I found it.

389
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,929
This is amazing.

390
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,141
Yeah, it is.

391
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,351
Well, I've run every test
I can think of.

392
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,850
EKG, cellular regression synthesis,
brain chemistry,

393
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:05,981
and dark matter confirms it.

394
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,274
Iris is a speedster.

395
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,606
So what about Barry?

396
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,145
Um...

397
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,525
Everything that was a part of you,

398
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,782
your speed, connection to
the Speed Force, the dark matter,

399
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,785
it's all a part of Iris now.

400
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,960
- Can you...
- Reverse it?

401
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,541
I don't know. I can try.

402
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,799
So Matthew Kim isn't just removing DNA.

403
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,127
He's transferring it
to anybody he touches.

404
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,634
He's not getting rid of metas.
He's creating new ones.

405
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,134
Well, that's not the only thing.

406
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,308
Guess who's got an apartment
just a block away

407
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,057
from the 405 bus line
and rides it every day to get to work.

408
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,473
So, Matthew is our bus meta,

409
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,230
not Frye, which means that
DeVoe is gonna come after him

410
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,309
sooner or later.

411
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,653
And if DeVoe gets Matthew's abilities,

412
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,944
he could take away all our powers.

413
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,320
Unless we get him on our side first.

414
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,952
Then he can remove
the meta DNA from DeVoe.

415
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,121
- Would that work?
- I mean, yeah.

416
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,957
It could. As best I can tell,
Matthew's abilities

417
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,205
work by melting down
the highly concentrated bonds

418
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,628
between DNA.

419
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,376
That makes them totally pliable,

420
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,206
so he can extract them
and infuse somebody else

421
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,587
with the exact same meta DNA.

422
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,628
"Melting highly concentrated bonds."

423
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,633
Melting Point.

424
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,844
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I gotta write that down.

425
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,387
Okay, great, so you guys figure out

426
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,059
how to get this Mr. Melting Point

427
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,387
in the same room as DeVoe

428
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,971
and not get his brains sucked out.

429
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,352
I'm gonna go get a couple of bear claws
and go back to my room.

430
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,649
It's not Mr. Melting Point.
Look, it... it's just Melting Point.

431
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,072
You know, somebody out there
has Frye's fire powers right now.

432
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,366
We need to find them as much as
we need to find Matthew.

433
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,488
I'm on it.

434
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,537
And I'll see if there's a way
to reverse this.

435
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,035
Well, until then, what do we do?

436
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:52,746
We train.

437
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,541
Okay.

438
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,430
Ramon! Where...

439
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,094
There you are.

440
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,179
What are you doing?

441
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,684
I'm updating some software.

442
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,017
Oh, good, so nothing.
Great. I need your help.

443
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,271
Try Ralph.

444
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,895
Ralph's useless, all he does is eat.

445
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,273
What do you want?

446
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,908
Do you have a micro-filament
compression wrench

447
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,326
with a cobalt-retrieving clamp?

448
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,825
Yeah.

449
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:27,581
Yeah, where is it?

450
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,950
Why? So you can work
on your death cap?

451
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,330
- Not a death cap.
- It's a death cap.

452
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,410
No, it isn't.

453
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,791
I hear there's plenty of tools
on Earth-2.

454
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,622
- Well, I'm on Earth-1.
- You need a lift?

455
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,127
- I'll breach you there right now!
- "I'll breach you there right now!"

456
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,209
- That's not what I sound like!
- "That's not what I sound like!"

457
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,293
Fine.

458
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,182
Cisco, why can't you just help him?

459
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,803
Why am I the only one who thinks
putting a rageaholic

460
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,763
and dark matter together is a bad idea?

461
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,315
He's trying to stop DeVoe.
That's not a bad idea.

462
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,019
He's trying to match his intellect

463
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:01,232
with a madman whose innovations
are warping his brain.

464
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,987
Have you not seen <i>Spider-Man 2?</i>

465
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,693
- No.
- How can you live with yourself?

466
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,779
It might be dangerous,
but it also might work.

467
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,405
And we're kind of running out of ideas.

468
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,582
Besides, Harry is gonna do this
whether you help him or not.

469
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,790
So maybe there's some way
to make this thinking cap

470
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,290
and to keep him safe.

471
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,424
She can move.

472
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,134
Hey, Iris.

473
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,303
- You might just want to...
- I can't slow down.

474
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,014
That's okay. All right,
just gradually ramp your speed down.

475
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,474
Otherwise, you're going to...

476
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,190
Do that?

477
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,234
Whoa.

478
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,110
Hey, you okay?

479
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,068
- Come here. Are you good?
- Yep. I'm straight.

480
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,903
Thank God for speed healing, huh?

481
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,787
Yeah.

482
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,493
Hey, I know this isn't easy on you.

483
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,165
Hey, I'm fine.

484
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,704
Barry.

485
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,502
I am. I...

486
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,254
I lost my speed.

487
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,346
I lost my job at the CCPD.

488
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,845
Just feels like DeVoe

489
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,559
is slowly taking everything away
from me.

490
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,445
He hasn't taken everything away.

491
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,900
What if I never get it back?

492
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,486
Hey.

493
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,747
Caitlin is gonna find something. Okay?

494
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,199
Hmm.

495
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,662
Until then, you just have

496
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,374
to watch me like I've watched you
these last three years.

497
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,881
Yeah, I guess so.

498
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,845
Wow, that's super annoying.

499
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,602
What's happening?

500
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,180
Baldwin Tower's on fire.
CCFD is responding,

501
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,810
but there's people on the top
floor they can't reach.

502
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,018
Okay, Caitlin,
Killer Frost is on fire duty,

503
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,103
Ralph, Cisco, suit up.

504
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,233
- Yeah.
- Not a chance.

505
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,531
This could just be a trap
for DeVoe to get us out in the open.

506
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,903
I think we got a bigger problem.

507
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,529
We don't have a Flash anymore.

508
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,944
Yeah, we do.

509
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,784
I don't think she's ready
for all that. I mean, she...

510
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,115
You just got your powers.

511
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,420
Um... no, I wanna do this.

512
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,041
Okay, okay, all right,
we'll monitor from here, then.

513
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,716
Okay, well, you can't
go out there wearing that.

514
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,129
Oh, right.

515
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,051
Sorry, Caitlin.

516
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,134
Mask.

517
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,265
Right.

518
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,682
Thank you, Jesse Quick.

519
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,143
Nice.

520
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,727
Please be careful.

521
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,076
Guess you're on comms.

522
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,402
Yeah.

523
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,613
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. How do I...

524
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,081
- Other monitor.
- Wrong monitor.

525
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,668
I'm here.

526
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,839
Oh, boy.

527
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,919
Okay, Iris, there are five people
trapped on the 14th floor.

528
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,262
<i>Just get them out of there
as fast as you can.</i>

529
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,641
I did it.

530
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,728
<i>Great work. Okay, now you've got to
get back in there</i>

531
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,403
to put out the fire.

532
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:28,984
Right.

533
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,282
Guys, I'm here. What do I do?

534
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,459
You know what to do. Use your arms.

535
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,832
Create a wind funnel,
suck all the oxygen out of the room.

536
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,542
And the fire'll go out.

537
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,670
Just like he's done 1,000 times.

538
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,292
You got this, girl.

539
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,099
It's making it worse.

540
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,392
She is rotating her arms
the wrong way, or?

541
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,186
Go the opposite direction, okay?

542
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,945
Iris, what was that?

543
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,818
Iris?

544
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,116
My leg is pinned. I can't move.

545
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,586
- Okay, you have to phase through it.
- What? I don't know how.

546
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,006
You have to vibrate
your whole body. Okay?

547
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,837
You just... You have to feel it.

548
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,337
I can't. I can't move. I can't do it.

549
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,420
We're running out of time, Barry.

550
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,218
The integrity of the room is failing.

551
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,886
The ceiling is gonna collapse.

552
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,219
Barry, the whole place is going up.

553
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,225
Are you okay?

554
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,736
Yeah.

555
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,903
Thank you.

556
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,910
There's still a little-bit
of irritation in your lungs

557
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,791
from all the smoke
you inhaled last night,

558
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,746
but you should be good to go soon.

559
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,673
Your leg is already healed.

560
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,125
We shouldn't have let her go out there.

561
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,630
You weren't ready.

562
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,383
I saved a lot of people
last night, Ralph.

563
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,590
Yeah, and Cisco had to save you.

564
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,801
Look, we just need to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

565
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,430
We have to find Matthew Kim

566
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,262
and whoever he transferred
Eric Frye's powers to.

567
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,188
How close are you to reversing this?

568
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,183
- I don't know that I can.
- What?

569
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,108
I was up all night trying
every conceivable solution.

570
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,523
Dark matter splicing,
pattern DNA cloning,

571
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,070
even regrowing meta-enhanced
stem material

572
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,402
on a cellular level.

573
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,785
Nothing will work.

574
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,659
I cannot replicate
Melting Point's powers.

575
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,699
So unless we find him and get him

576
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,125
to reverse what he's done...

577
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,663
Iris is Team Speedster
on a permanent basis.

578
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,045
Great, that's, uh... That's great.

579
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,589
I'm gonna go work on my will.

580
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,011
Ralph...

581
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,732
Harry.

582
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,355
Harry, I know you hear me.

583
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,940
Another team member hurt
by one of DeVoe's meta.

584
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,741
- I know.
- And we can fix it, but no!

585
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,159
- I know.
- You know what else?

586
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,112
Snow wasn't the only one
who was up all night working.

587
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,196
I was up all night working.

588
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,371
I'm almost done. I'm almost finished.

589
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,121
- But you won't help me finish.
- I'm gonna help you finish.

590
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,918
- Finish...
- The thinking cap.

591
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,290
I'm gonna help you
finish the thinking cap.

592
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,042
It's an intelligence booster.

593
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,794
Actually, it's called
an intelligence booster.

594
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,215
Two conditions.

595
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,292
What are your conditions?

596
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,675
One, we stimulate your synapses
without using dark matter.

597
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,306
Fine, no dark matter.

598
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,724
And two?

599
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,931
The minute you start acting like
Locutus of Borg

600
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,887
and start assimilating everybody
with your Borg chair...

601
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,102
You can vibe me back to my Earth. Okay?

602
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,024
Okay.

603
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,144
Let's go.

604
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,621
Take it easy.

605
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,457
It's just day two.

606
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,245
Oh, man.

607
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,839
You're right about running.

608
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,754
It's so peaceful.

609
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,421
So calming.
Actually makes it easy to think.

610
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,387
Look, you just got your speed.

611
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,467
You know that, right?

612
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,848
I don't think
anyone'll hold it against you

613
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:28,928
if you took a minute.

614
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,139
Maybe just let
Cisco and Caitlin handle this.

615
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,225
Just run point. Like always.

616
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,525
Just stay here like I always do?

617
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,072
No, I... you know I didn't mean that.

618
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,822
No, I know you didn't. I did.

619
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,785
Iris...

620
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,746
You think that...

621
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,948
What, that you need

622
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,578
to prove to the team
that you're not afraid?

623
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,790
No, not to all of you. To me.

624
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,630
Barry, when I was a reporter,

625
00:27:55,716 --> 00:28:00,131
I was always in the field
putting myself in danger for a story.

626
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,379
And after last year,

627
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,514
for some reason, that just stopped.

628
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,052
Maybe it was because of Savitar,
maybe because...

629
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,270
you were gone into the Speed Force.

630
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,397
I don't know, but...

631
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,062
I quit my job,

632
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,318
I joined this team,

633
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,896
and now, for the most part,

634
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,403
I just stay here
while all of you are out there

635
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,984
putting your lives on the line.

636
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,536
- Because of our powers.
- No, it's not just that, Barry.

637
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,581
And it took me getting these powers
to realize it.

638
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,625
But now that I'm the one that has it,

639
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,998
it's my turn to do
what all of you have been doing.

640
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,288
To prove to myself that

641
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,590
that fearlessness that I had
is still in me.

642
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,346
<i>Guys, I think we found
Frye's missing powers.</i>

643
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,936
Then go get 'em.

644
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,523
Satellite's tracking temperature
at the same intensity

645
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,779
- as the bank robbery. So...
- That's him.

646
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,701
- Yeah.
- So who's that?

647
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,075
Matthew Kim.

648
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,747
Kim's going to try and steal his powers.

649
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,290
All right, let's go.

650
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,492
No!

651
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:16,786
You guys run point.

652
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,998
I can do this.

653
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,042
You sure about this?

654
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,717
I have to, Barry.

655
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,466
All right,
but remember, he can't touch you,

656
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,089
- or he'll take your powers away, too.
- Right.

657
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,345
Also, I'm not sure my clothes
are gonna work this time.

658
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:31,968
I have a fix for that.

659
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,850
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, though.

660
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,930
Thanks, Cisco.

661
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,017
I got hangers.

662
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,770
All right, here we go.

663
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,731
Don't make us shoot you. Stand down.

664
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,908
Oh, I don't think so, copper.

665
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,072
Not until I get my money.

666
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,380
- This is a mistake.
- Down, now! Take him down!

667
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,463
Hold your fire.

668
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,844
You need to stop this.

669
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,301
Oh, I just got going, pal.

670
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,845
Wait.

671
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,181
You're that hero from the bank,
aren't you?

672
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,607
I am.

673
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,769
And I need you to stop this.

674
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,606
So you can take my powers
like you did his?

675
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,030
I don't think so.

676
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,483
You just gave them to me.

677
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,363
What are you talking about?

678
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,036
You didn't know that?

679
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,160
When you took powers from him,
you gave them to me.

680
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,872
And now I'm gonna get
what he couldn't. Money!

681
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,719
I think you've done
enough saving for today.

682
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,262
I'll take it from here.

683
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,186
How about we just end this right now?

684
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,605
That sounds fun.

685
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,058
'Cause I was just warming up.

686
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,437
What's wrong?

687
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,021
Can't stand the heat?

688
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,072
All right, Iris,
we need you to run around him,

689
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,946
create a vortex.
The lack of oxygen should

690
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,948
<i>- extinguish the flame.</i>
- Can't get close to him.

691
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,699
Temperature is at 800 degrees.

692
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,780
Like, how hot is that?

693
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,240
It's hot as lava.

694
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,620
Guys, we need a plan.

695
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,451
I got a plan, lady!

696
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,622
It's called, "Give me my money
before I unleash hell"!

697
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,705
Yeah!

698
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,876
What the hell is that?

699
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,465
That is a thermal cyclone.

700
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,387
That fire is gonna get too close
to those apartments.

701
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,306
And thousands of people will die.

702
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,725
What do we do?

703
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,259
We turn this thing on.

704
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,436
- Harry, no. Don't.
- Iris needs answers.

705
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,139
- We haven't tested...
- She needs answers.

706
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,223
<i>Come on, guys, what do I do?</i>

707
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,353
Do it.

708
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,981
<i>Barry, come on,
I need an answer!</i>

709
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,236
Hang on, Iris. Hang on.

710
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,571
There are 4,827 ways this could go,
and all those ways will fail except one.

711
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,531
If Iris uses her speed
to draw enough water

712
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,617
from Central City Bay into her wake,

713
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,246
she could extinguish that blaze.

714
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,123
You want her to create a tidal wave?

715
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,174
It's our only hope.

716
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,843
Iris, I need you to run
as fast as you can.

717
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,679
- On the water.
- On the water? What?

718
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,098
Make sure, when you run,
you dig your heels in,

719
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,891
<i>you move back and forth
in a tight formation.</i>

720
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:18,968
Why?

721
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,137
So you drag as much water
ashore as possible,

722
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,517
<i>put out the cyclone.</i>

723
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,224
You want me to make
a 100-foot tidal wave? Are you crazy?

724
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,604
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

725
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,357
You told me
that you used to be fearless.

726
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,271
I know that you still are.

727
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,573
<i>You're the bravest person
that I know. You can do this.</i>

728
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,117
I know you can. We all do.

729
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,533
Now, run, Iris. Run.

730
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,055
<i>That's it.</i>

731
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,267
That's it. Now...
And then, tight formations, okay?

732
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,350
<i>Tight formations.</i>

733
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,024
<i>That's it, Iris. Keep going.</i>

734
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,108
Keep going.

735
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,037
Everybody, back!

736
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,338
Move, now!

737
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,721
Long live rock 'n' roll.

738
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,012
Yes!

739
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,020
Nice work.

740
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,102
She did it.

741
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,400
Nice work, Flash.

742
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,464
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

743
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,299
I thought I was cleaning up the city,

744
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,422
but I was just making it worse.

745
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,845
We stopped him.

746
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,014
He's in Iron Heights,
and that's all that matters now.

747
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,099
You sure you both want to do this?

748
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,268
It's your call.

749
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,524
I have to say,
running on water is really fun.

750
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,024
But... if you guys will have me back,

751
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,201
I would love to get back behind
the console again.

752
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,912
- Of course.
- Please, and thank you.

753
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,910
You're ready?

754
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,162
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Let's see.

755
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,451
- Okay.
- All right, here?

756
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,036
Okay.

757
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,842
That's it?

758
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,215
You okay, baby girl?

759
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,175
I think so.

760
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,473
How about you, Flash?

761
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:11,974
I feel great.

762
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,065
My boy's back.

763
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,318
Well, that's the last time
I'm using this power.

764
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,991
This city was almost destroyed
because of me.

765
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,943
But you had no idea that would happen.

766
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,695
Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself, pal.

767
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,073
I thought I was chosen
for a higher purpose.

768
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,251
This can't be the plan for me.

769
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,620
Maybe you were chosen for a bigger one.

770
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,580
What do you mean?

771
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,211
The guy we mentioned, Clifford DeVoe.

772
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,631
He isn't gonna stop until
he gets all the bus metas,

773
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,470
which means we have to stop him.

774
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,468
We could use all the help we could get.

775
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,513
Are you sure I can make a difference?

776
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:48,594
Absolutely.

777
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,476
DeVoe's shown weakness
against other bus metas in the past.

778
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,725
With your help,
we might actually have a chance.

779
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,194
How do we start?

780
00:35:58,782 --> 00:35:59,772
I'll give you the tour.

781
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,107
All right.

782
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,825
No offense, I like my powers.

783
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,374
So, Barr,

784
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,954
you never made
your own tidal wave before.

785
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,505
No, I haven't.

786
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,666
You go, girl.

787
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,555
So what do you say? You want to teach
an old dog a new trick?

788
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,726
All right. Training, 6:00 a.m.?

789
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,178
Ooh, don't be late.

790
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,729
- You got it, boss.
- Welcome back.

791
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,110
Hey, Ralph.

792
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,020
Hey.

793
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,690
You know, Matthew

794
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,071
is gonna need a buddy, too.

795
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,155
Well, that's assuming he stays.

796
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,242
After he finds out that DeVoe has gotten
everyone he's come after,

797
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,161
he'll be terrified.

798
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,497
Just like I am.

799
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,173
Look, Ralph.
I know what you're going through.

800
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,846
No, Iris, you don't.

801
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,260
Yes, I do.

802
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,306
Last year, when I thought
that Savitar was going to kill me,

803
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,396
I was scared out of my mind.

804
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,065
How did you deal with it?

805
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,901
It was really hard.

806
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,062
But then I realized

807
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,489
that if I hid from him,
if I hid from the world,

808
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,404
then Savitar had already won.

809
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,403
So I made the decision

810
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,242
to not give in to the fear.

811
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,916
I chose to keep living.

812
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,295
Look,

813
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,878
what I said before about

814
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,506
you never putting your life on the line,

815
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,970
I was wrong.

816
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,556
You make

817
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,188
one hell of a Flash

818
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,433
in or out of the costume.

819
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,441
Thanks.

820
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,536
- You going up?
- Yeah.

821
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,201
I think maybe it's time

822
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,578
that Clifford DeVoe
paid the Mayor another visit.

823
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,159
Hmm.

824
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,546
I thought you were

825
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,712
never leaving S.T.A.R. Labs.

826
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,344
Well... I think maybe it's time
I started living again, too.

827
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,638
Plus, we're definitely out
of veggie dogs.

828
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,183
Hey, thanks, Iris.

829
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,898
Fresh from this little place in Keystone
that Cecile recommended.

830
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,977
Wow.

831
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,564
Those cravings of hers
are getting really intense, huh?

832
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,944
Yeah, tell me about it.

833
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,570
It's a good thing I'm a speedster again.

834
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,363
You know you didn't have
to give up your speed, right?

835
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,032
I mean, I would have never asked you to.

836
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,663
I know.

837
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,204
Why did you do it?

838
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,750
You know what makes a great speedster?

839
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,138
It isn't their speed.

840
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,307
It's being the light that everyone needs

841
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,601
when the world goes dark.

842
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,140
It's the kind of person they are.

843
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,311
The kind of person
that always wants to help.

844
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,609
That's why being the Flash

845
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,646
is your destiny.

846
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,065
It's your way of helping others.

847
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,280
But it isn't mine.

848
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,662
This is.

849
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,926
I'll leave you to it.

850
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,138
All right, take it off.

851
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,014
Take it off, Harry. That's enough.

852
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,930
We're already 20 percent over
your suggested safety limits.

853
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,431
You've got to give it
a little more time.

854
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,137
No, that's it. I'm shutting it down.

855
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,642
No, we're almost there.
We're almost there!

856
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,474
You're not breaking bad, Locutus!

857
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,560
All right?
I'm disengaging the photon flow.

858
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,688
All right.

859
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,453
I don't need it anymore.

860
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,416
You got the names?

861
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,832
The last two remaining bus metas.

862
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,632
Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

863
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:18,656
