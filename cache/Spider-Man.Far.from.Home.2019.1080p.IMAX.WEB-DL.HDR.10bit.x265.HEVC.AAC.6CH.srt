1
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,564
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,899
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:20,736
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,492
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:28,043
That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending...

6
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:34,508
Who are you?

7
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,597
You don't want any part of this.

24
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,969
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

25
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,092
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

26
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:08,768
- This year has been nothing short of...
- **** is crazy. It's insane.

27
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:09,854
- Jason.
- What?

28
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,141
No swearing.

29
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,972
It's the last day of school. We're good.

30
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,150
Historic.

31
00:03:15,193 --> 00:03:18,686
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

32
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,990
<i>including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.</i>

33
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,693
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

34
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:26,787
<i>brought us back.</i>

35
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,744
They called it "the Blip."

36
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,417
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i>

37
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:38,089
<i>But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.</i>

38
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:42,168
- My little brother is now older than me.
- Yeah, it's math.

39
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:45,300
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

40
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,598
and had already taken midterms,

41
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,347
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.

42
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:52,099
It's totally unfair.

43
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,304
It's not right.

44
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:58,314
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

45
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,854
<i>As we draw this year to a close,</i>

46
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:03,155
<i>it's time to move on...</i>

47
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:07,326
<i>- to a new phase of our lives.
- Pray nothing crazy happens again</i>

48
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:09,495
<i>because are The Avengers even
a thing anymore?</i>

49
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,494
<i>- Does anyone even have a plan?</i>
- I have a plan.

50
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,917
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

51
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,585
- Mm-hm.
- Second, I'm gonna buy

52
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:19,414
a dual-headphone adapter and watch
movies with her the whole time.

53
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,624
- Okay.
- Three, when we go to Venice...

54
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,654
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

55
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:24,964
- True.
- So I'm gonna buy her

56
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:28,139
a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia

57
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,635
- because of, well...
- The murder.

58
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,592
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

59
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:33,973
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

60
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,646
- give her the necklace.
- Oh.

61
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,598
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

62
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:42,069
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

63
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,487
Oh, don't forget step seven.

64
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,565
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

65
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,865
- Why?
- We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.

66
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:50,866
- Ned.
- Look,

67
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,323
I may not know much, but I do know this:

68
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,783
Europeans love Americans.

69
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,668
- Really?
- More than half of them are women.

70
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,337
Okay. Sure.

71
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:03,336
But I really like MJ, man, okay?

72
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:06,169
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

73
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,925
Sometimes I catch her looking at me,
I feel like I've stood up...

74
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:11,077
- She's coming. Don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?

75
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:14,936
- Excited about the science trip?
- Hey, we're talking about the trip.

76
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,479
- Yeah, and Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?

77
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,479
I don't... I don't have a plan.

78
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:25,195
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

79
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,772
Like a grandmother?

80
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:30,197
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

81
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,822
Oh, okay, well...

82
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,577
that was a real roller coaster.

83
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:36,703
By the way, travel tip:

84
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,876
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

85
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,295
so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.

86
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,873
Smart. Will do.

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,427
Ugh.

88
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:52,052
Dude, I think that went really great.

89
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,427
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

90
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,480
the family that was living there
was very confused.

91
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,229
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

92
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:06,437
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was... It was really a mess.

93
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,113
Thank you for coming out

94
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,691
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

95
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:14,574
And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,418
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

97
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,969
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

98
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,799
And thank you, Spider-Man.

99
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:38,887
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!

100
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:46,686
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

101
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,296
That was so cool.
I was so nervous.

102
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,239
I was a little stiff. I
wasn't in the pocket.

103
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,284
- I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,907
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

105
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,363
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.

106
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,868
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,238
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

108
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,294
Hey, sorry I'm late.

109
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,710
- Happy. Hey.
- Oh, you look lovely.

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,757
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,880
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

112
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,263
- It's a new beard.
- It's my... My Blip beard.

113
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,011
I grew it in the Blip.

114
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,800
It's a Blip beard.

115
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,101
I see. Yeah.

116
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,521
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced at the office.

117
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,691
Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.

118
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:28,269
- The amount's nice too. They're generous.
- Oh, ha-ha.

119
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,821
- Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

120
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,406
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.

121
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,370
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

122
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:40,114
Will do.

123
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:45,870
What just happened?

124
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,956
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

125
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,042
- Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,924
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

127
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,096
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

128
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:59,516
If it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

129
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:01,723
Apparently not.

130
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:08,692
- No caller ID. That's him.
- I don't wanna talk to Fury.

131
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:09,778
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

132
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:12,150
If you don't talk to him, I have to,
and I don't want to.

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,448
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.

134
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,822
- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

135
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,655
- You don't send Fury to voicemail.
- Hear that? They're calling me.

136
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,410
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,083
I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

138
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,036
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

139
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,917
I promise you, I'll call him.

140
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,044
After my trip.

141
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:32,966
Hey!

142
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,429
Yeah, hi... No, no, he's not ghosting you.

143
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:41,842
Okay, one question at a time.

144
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,349
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

145
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:45,805
Uh, no, I'm not.

146
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,061
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

147
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,831
If the aliens come back, what will you do?

148
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:52,144
Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?

149
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,571
Sean Winford, <i>Queens Tribune.</i>

150
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,489
What is it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

151
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,033
Those are some big shoes to fill.

152
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,450
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

153
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,334
Okay.

154
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,341
Hungry?

155
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:58,085
Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha.

156
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:01,547
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

157
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,974
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

158
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,098
What's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

159
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:10,898
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

160
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,854
You deserve it.

161
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:16,363
Yeah.

162
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:18,073
You know what?

163
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:22,155
You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.

164
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,579
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

165
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:29,207
No.

166
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,257
No. No, I'm not.

167
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:45,549
- Yeah!
- Can you help me get my stuff up?

168
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:47,805
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

169
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:51,354
- Middle seat gets both armrests.
- Give me a tablet.

170
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:54,104
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

171
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,230
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

172
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,155
- I can't chaperone these kids alone.
- Yo, Parker.

173
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,199
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

174
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,699
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.

175
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,324
- Ma'am?
- Mm-hm?

176
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:11,125
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

177
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,371
I'll take that.

178
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:14,920
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

179
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,958
Classic MJ, right?

180
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,337
Did you know Brad was coming?

181
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,343
It... It's so weird.

182
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:28,346
One day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

183
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,428
and suddenly, we Blip back,

184
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:34,140
and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.

185
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:37,567
- Not all the girls are after him.
- No, man, they're all after him.

186
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:38,939
Yeah. Here.

187
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,693
Anyway, on to more important things.

188
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,242
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play
<i>Beast Slayers</i> the whole time.

189
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,614
Are you excited?

190
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,329
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

191
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,037
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

192
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:56,086
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

193
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:58,960
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

194
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:03,419
Please.

195
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,224
Hey, guys.

196
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,395
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

197
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,599
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

198
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:20,857
Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats
with him, that would be...

199
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,108
He's allergic to perfume?

200
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,195
Yeah, yeah, because it...

201
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:26,900
It makes his eyes water,

202
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,281
- and he can't really...
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

203
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:30,453
Oh, uh...

204
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,748
From experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

205
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:36,123
I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.

206
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:40,001
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

207
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,548
Peter, let's get you out of there.

208
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,466
- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,

209
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,886
- you take Ned and Peter's seats.
- That's all right.

210
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:48,385
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

211
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,887
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

212
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:54,728
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

213
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:56,314
Let's go!

214
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,566
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

215
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:12,036
So did you want to play <i>Beast Slayer?</i>

216
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,123
Nope.

217
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,500
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

218
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:19,078
- No.
- Got it. Ahem.

219
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,585
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

220
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,800
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

221
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,344
We had a fake funeral for her.

222
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,514
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,636
Wanna see the video?

224
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,639
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

225
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,221
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

226
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,274
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

227
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,940
<i>Good afternoon,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

228
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,774
<i>Our flight time will be eight hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.</i>

229
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,036
Oh.

230
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:02,255
Oh!

231
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,598
Nice picture.

232
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:57,097
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

233
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,473
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

234
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,146
Dude, don't worry, okay?

235
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,349
- I'm sure that's nothing.
- Hey, babe.

236
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,683
- Huh?
- Can you hold this?

237
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:06,484
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

238
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:16,329
What was that?

239
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:20,745
Uh, well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

240
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,326
we have a lot in common.

241
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,958
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

242
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,790
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

243
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,591
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

244
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:33,136
And that boy met a woman.

245
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,965
A very strong and powerful woman.

246
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,892
And now that boy's a man.

247
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,594
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

248
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:48,276
There's nothing in there. I swear.

249
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,786
These, no.

250
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,675
Sorry. Sorry.

251
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,828
- I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
- Wait, wait, wait.

252
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:21,872
- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, thank goodness.

253
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:59,382
Looks like we're here.
They're doing renovations to the place.

254
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:02,013
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

255
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,560
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

256
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:04,762
Come on, man.

257
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,524
- Everyone, here we are.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

258
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,609
- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Come on in.

259
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,232
This place is sinking.

260
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,439
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

261
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,900
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

262
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,781
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

263
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,954
<i>- ¡Vamonos!</i>
- It's <i>"andiamo."</i>

264
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,247
<i>- Andiamo!</i>
- There you go.

265
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,915
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

266
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,958
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

267
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,964
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

268
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,466
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's... Oh!

269
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:41,555
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

270
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:55,864
Oh!

271
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,074
- Three, two, one.
- Say "pizza."

272
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,410
- Pizza!
- Pizza time!

273
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,102
Hi.

274
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,684
I'm looking for a, uh...

275
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:46,238
It's perfect.

276
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,130
<i>Boh.</i>

277
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,915
What?

278
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,045
<i>Boh.</i>

279
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:01,011
The most perfect word.
Italians created it, I just discovered it.

280
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,179
- What does it mean?
- It can mean a million things.

281
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,972
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."

282
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,971
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."

283
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,769
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.

284
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:12,518
- Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.
- Eh.

285
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,521
Hey. German? American.

286
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,068
- A rose for you.
<i>- Boh.</i>

287
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,319
- Whoa.
<i>- "Boh"</i> is my new superpower.

288
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,991
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

289
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,577
So, what's in the bag?

290
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:29,531
Oh, uh... <i>Boh.</i>

291
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,501
Nice.

292
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:40,671
Whoa, cool.

293
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,528
What was that?

294
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,585
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:26,054
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

296
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,597
Guys, we gotta go!

297
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,811
- What is that?
- I don't know.

298
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,729
- What'll you do?
- Left my suit in the hotel.

299
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:36,681
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

300
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,336
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out of here.

301
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
- Go!
- Just go!

302
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:50,912
Get out of here. Go!

303
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,703
Oh, my God.

304
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:03,927
Come on.

305
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,515
Oh, no, you don't.

306
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,195
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

307
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:23,292
Excuse me, sir!

308
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,089
I... I can help. Let me help.

309
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,837
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

310
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,135
I need to lead it away from the canals.

311
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:57,952
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

312
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,658
Oh, this is it.

313
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:00,913
It's closed.

314
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:02,790
What do you mean? Till when?

315
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
November.

316
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:06,752
- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

317
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,147
Oh, come on.

318
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:29,354
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

319
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,498
Who is that guy?

320
00:24:29,591 --> 00:24:31,628
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

321
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,075
Yeah! Yeah!

322
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,509
It's aliens. It has to be.

323
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:24,640
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench

324
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,063
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

325
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:28,390
and got hydro powers.

326
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:31,567
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

327
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:34,066
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

328
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,278
Being a man of science...

329
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:40,735
witches.

330
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:42,695
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

331
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,451
Good thing I packed your suit.

332
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,375
<i>- I can't believe you forgot it.</i>
- Yeah.

333
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:50,204
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

334
00:25:50,297 --> 00:25:54,837
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.

335
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:56,088
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

336
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:58,340
- I was trying to help him...
- Happy, that's my lunch.

337
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,591
Don't eat that one.

338
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:02,719
- Happy's there?
- Yeah, it's Happy.

339
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:04,971
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

340
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:07,224
<i>And he's hanging around the office.</i>

341
00:26:07,314 --> 00:26:09,727
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want... Hi, Peter.

342
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:11,273
Hey, Happy.

343
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:16,188
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

344
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,219
- What are you doing...?
<i>- Glad you're having a good time.</i>

345
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,280
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

346
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:26,747
So how's the plan going?

347
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:30,789
There's been setbacks, for sure.

348
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,371
Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.

349
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,465
<i>I know. Love you.</i>

350
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:35,758
Bye.

351
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:38,960
Who is that guy?

352
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,592
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

353
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,799
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

354
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:45,724
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

355
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,803
What? He's just awesome, okay?

356
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:52,231
He protects the neighborhood
and he's inspiring.

357
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,434
He inspires me to be a better man.

358
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,861
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

359
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,820
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

360
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:05,866
<i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i> is Italian
for "man of mystery."

361
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:09,120
- They don't actually know who he is.
- Mysterio.

362
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:11,459
- Cool name.
- Cool name.

363
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:13,921
- Babe.
- Babe.

364
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:15,921
So how much of that did you see?

365
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:17,965
Not much. I was running.

366
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,885
Right. Me too. I was also running...

367
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,087
away.

368
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:25,507
So Paris tomorrow.

369
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,310
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

370
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:31,934
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

371
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,640
to create an army of the insane.

372
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,065
Oh.

373
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,986
Which is why it's my favorite destination
on the whole trip.

374
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,614
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

375
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:44,199
Nothing.

376
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:47,279
It's dead.
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

377
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:49,204
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

378
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,455
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

379
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:53,544
That's nice.

380
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:55,670
Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.

381
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:57,918
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and...

382
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:06,472
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

383
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,139
You're Nick Fury.

384
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:13,479
And you just shot Ned.

385
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,852
It's a mild
tranquilizer. He'll be all right.

386
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:19,144
So good to finally meet you.

387
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,944
I saw you at the funeral,

388
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,569
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

389
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:25,615
That would've been inappropriate.

390
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,739
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

391
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:31,618
The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.

392
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,576
You avoided me, and now you're here.

393
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,376
What a coincidence.

394
00:28:36,463 --> 00:28:38,625
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

395
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:42,008
I used to know everything.

396
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:45,758
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

397
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:48,555
No intel, no team.

398
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:50,850
And a high school kid

399
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:53,895
is dodging my calls.

400
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,562
Here's what I do know:

401
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:03,439
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

402
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,949
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

403
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:15,288
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

404
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:16,493
A village was...

405
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:19,371
Just making the rounds.

406
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:22,923
See if anyone needs any counseling
after today's traumatic events.

407
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:25,547
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

408
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:28,880
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

409
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,510
Oh, he's passed out.

410
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,764
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

411
00:29:35,522 --> 00:29:38,856
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

412
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:42,151
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening...

413
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:45,355
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

414
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,156
Um... He's asleep, Betty.

415
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:48,608
Oh, already?

416
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,450
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- Okay.

417
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:52,324
That's why it's imperative...

418
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:56,875
Hey, boys. So that canal water
today was filled with dangerous bacteria...

419
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,704
Another person touches that door,
we are going to attend another funeral.

420
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:03,835
- Suit up.
- Let me know if you start vomiting.

421
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:09,504
Stark left these for you.

422
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:11,015
Really?

423
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:25,607
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

424
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:30,695
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a <i>Star Wars</i> reference.

425
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:37,869
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

426
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,575
You'd be feigning anonymity

427
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,082
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

428
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:48,469
Come on.

429
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:50,554
Yeah.

430
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,263
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

431
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,979
That is Dimitri.

432
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:04,308
And this is Mr. Beck.

433
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:07,655
Mysterio?

434
00:31:08,114 --> 00:31:09,114
What?

435
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,034
Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.

436
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,657
Well, you can call me Quentin.

437
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:22,418
You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.

438
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:24,416
We could use someone like you
on my world.

439
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:26,213
Thanks.

440
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,710
I'm sorry. Your world?

441
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,509
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

442
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,131
Just not yours.

443
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:33,929
There are multiple realities.

444
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:37,133
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

445
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:40,344
Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

446
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,304
I thought that was theoretical.

447
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,686
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

448
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,938
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

449
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,020
How does that even work
with all the quantum...?

450
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:50,114
It's insane.

451
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:54,492
Sorry. It's really cool.

452
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,980
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

453
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,333
Anyway...

454
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,963
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

455
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:09,210
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

456
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:11,839
Air, water, fire, earth.

457
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:14,466
The Science Division had
a technical name.

458
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:16,639
We just called them Elementals.

459
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:19,138
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

460
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,014
Turns out, the myths are real.

461
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:22,891
Like Thor.

462
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:26,065
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

463
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:28,564
These myths are threats.

464
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,312
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

465
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,647
We mobilized and fought them,

466
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,404
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

467
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:38,452
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

468
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,745
All we did was delay the inevitable.

469
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:44,121
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

470
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,371
Our satellites confirm it.

471
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,170
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

472
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:49,997
There's only one left: fire.

473
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,009
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

474
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:57,926
It's the one that took my family.

475
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:02,844
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,395
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

477
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:09,647
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

478
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,525
I'm sorry, did you say Prague? Heh.

479
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:19,111
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

480
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:22,697
And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

481
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,578
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

482
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,330
I know, but that was an accident.

483
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,331
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

484
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:31,296
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

485
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:33,090
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

486
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:34,712
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

487
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,214
Don't invoke her name.

488
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,261
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

489
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:40,931
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

490
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,384
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

491
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:46,016
my class will figure out who I am, then...

492
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,666
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

493
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,225
Okay.

494
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,730
I understand.

495
00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:55,197
I'm sorry, what?

496
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:57,989
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

497
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,783
and become suspicious.

498
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,031
Dimitri.

499
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:04,364
Take him back to the hotel, please.

500
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:05,368
Yes.

501
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,450
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

502
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:09,501
And, uh, good luck.

503
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,959
See you, kid.

504
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:14,130
Yeah, see you.

505
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:17,964
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

506
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:26,473
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

507
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:29,431
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

508
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:31,311
Hey, are you sure you're good?

509
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,108
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

510
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:34,526
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

511
00:34:34,612 --> 00:34:37,446
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

512
00:34:37,532 --> 00:34:39,385
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

513
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,616
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

514
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:42,864
- I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.

515
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:45,697
Good news. We're going to Prague. Huh?

516
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,032
- What?
- Prague?

517
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:51,119
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

518
00:34:51,212 --> 00:34:54,171
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

519
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:55,257
All I heard was crying.

520
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:58,342
- Look at our upgraded ride.
- Whoa, bro, you see that?

521
00:34:58,428 --> 00:34:59,589
It's pretty sick.

522
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,218
- I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
- Oh, come on.

523
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:05,891
Peter, what...? What's going on?

524
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:10,179
I think Nick Furyjust hijacked
our summer vacation.

525
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:13,607
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh...

526
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,355
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

527
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:16,731
Awesome.

528
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:19,609
Yeah. Awesome.

529
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:45,219
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

530
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:48,096
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

531
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,284
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

532
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:14,084
Say EDITH."

533
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:19,207
<i>Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.</i>

534
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,168
<i>- Retinal and biometric scan accepted.</i>
- Hello?

535
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,719
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

536
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:24,966
<i>I am EDITH,</i>

537
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:28,891
<i>Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

538
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,684
- So he made you for me?
<i>- No.</i>

539
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,183
<i>But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.</i>

540
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,981
- Cool.
<i>- Would you like to see what I can do?</i>

541
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:45,366
<i>EDITH stands for "Even dead,
I'm the hero."</i>

542
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:47,408
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

543
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:48,611
Yeah, he did.

544
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,789
<i>I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

545
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,912
<i>including multiple defense satellites,</i>

546
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:57,370
<i>as well as back doors
to all major telecommunication networks.</i>

547
00:36:58,506 --> 00:36:59,506
Whoa.

548
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,590
Is MJ texting?

549
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:12,263
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

550
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,571
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

551
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:34,577
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

552
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,784
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

553
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:38,494
Ten minutes, everyone.

554
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,797
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

555
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,214
- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

556
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:47,465
It's beautiful.

557
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:49,598
What?

558
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:03,770
Hello.

559
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:05,149
Close the door.

560
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:10,199
Um...

561
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,365
I'm Peter Parker.

562
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,787
Take off your clothes.

563
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:16,949
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

564
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:19,410
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

565
00:38:19,504 --> 00:38:21,587
So I made you this, another suit.

566
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,628
Oh, uh, thank you.

567
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,509
I'm sure it fits fine.
I don't need to try...

568
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,503
Take off your clothes.

569
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:29,972
Okay.

570
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:32,975
Sure.

571
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,935
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

572
00:38:37,021 --> 00:38:39,354
This is weird.

573
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:44,185
- No, no, no. Don't...
- Whoa!

574
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,861
Uh...

575
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:50,817
- Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
- This is not what it looks like.

576
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,117
- Just...
- Yeah.

577
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:54,069
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

578
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:57,952
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

579
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,458
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

580
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:02,537
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

581
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,919
If you want to hook up with some
random European chick, that's on you.

582
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:08,843
- That's not what that was.
- I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

583
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,215
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

584
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,467
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

585
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:16,801
- You cannot show her that photo, dude.
- I'm sorry, man. I have to.

586
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:18,844
She deserves the truth.

587
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:22,268
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

588
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,270
and, everybody, back on the bus.

589
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,317
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

590
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:33,405
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

591
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:36,111
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter. How can I help you?</i>

592
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:39,164
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ...

593
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,459
<i>Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?</i>

594
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,454
Um, Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

595
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,585
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

596
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:49,041
Is Brad a target? Um...

597
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,758
- Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

598
00:39:57,852 --> 00:40:00,936
<i>Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.</i>

599
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,264
- Initiating what, now?
<i>- Intercept point determined.</i>

600
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,223
<i>- Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.

601
00:40:28,883 --> 00:40:30,966
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

602
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:33,169
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

603
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:35,502
- I'm really paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...

604
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:37,766
I'm so sorry.

605
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,261
- EDITH, don't kill Brad.
<i>- Do you want me to cancel</i>

606
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,768
<i>- the drone strike on Brad Davis?</i>
- Did you punch Flash?

607
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:46,519
- No.
<i>- Firing.</i>

608
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:51,069
Oh, look out!

609
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:56,529
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

610
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:57,985
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

611
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,287
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

612
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:03,674
<i>- Commencing second strike.</i>
- Peter.

613
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:06,702
- Plant your fanny and buckle up now.
- Look at the baby mountain goats!

614
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:08,958
- Baby mountain goats?
- I see them.

615
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:25,479
I don't see any mountain goats.

616
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,022
You missed them.

617
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:29,521
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

618
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,610
What?

619
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:33,520
...but your new look, I love it.

620
00:41:34,282 --> 00:41:35,523
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

621
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:38,529
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

622
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,619
Oh, man.

623
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:42,829
Let's try that again.

624
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:46,203
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

625
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,786
- I...
- Yeah. Weird.

626
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,050
Ow.

627
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,201
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

628
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:23,696
Wow, this place is so classy.

629
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:25,280
Yeah, so why are we here?

630
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:27,081
Speak for yourself.

631
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:28,704
I'm home.

632
00:42:28,794 --> 00:42:30,376
What can I say?

633
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:32,705
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

634
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:36,417
Everyone get settled, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

635
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,093
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

636
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:41,422
- Yeah!
- Hello?

637
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:43,928
<i>Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.</i>

638
00:42:44,018 --> 00:42:46,351
<i>Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?</i>

639
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:47,268
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:48,641
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.

641
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:50,973
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

642
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,810
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

643
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:57,021
- I'm still your guy in the chair.
- No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

644
00:42:57,114 --> 00:42:59,822
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

645
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,242
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

646
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:04,911
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh... Here in the city.

647
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:07,284
- We're here.
- I know. It's not good.

648
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,582
I'm figuring it out.

649
00:43:08,668 --> 00:43:12,036
You have to do something, please.
We're counting on you.

650
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,711
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

651
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:16,541
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

652
00:43:16,634 --> 00:43:18,421
- It's about time.
- Serious?

653
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,127
<i>Parker? Parker!</i>

654
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,132
Yes, sir.

655
00:43:21,222 --> 00:43:23,509
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

656
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,965
Are we boring you?

657
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:27,551
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

658
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:29,181
He had obstacles.

659
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:31,138
I removed them.

660
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,064
They still won't evacuate the city.

661
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:35,277
Idiots.

662
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,606
So, what's the plan, Parker?

663
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:41,523
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

664
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:44,405
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

665
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:47,579
- and then Mr. Beck and I will...
- My name is Mysterio.

666
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,123
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

667
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:54,544
Peter, listen to me.

668
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,213
The best hope you have, the only hope,

669
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,793
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

670
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:02,878
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

671
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:05,840
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

672
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:09,472
If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.

673
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:12,430
After that, there's no way to stop it.

674
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:18,523
Hey, my friends are here.

675
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:20,774
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

676
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:23,949
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

677
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:28,370
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

678
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:34,832
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

679
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,833
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

680
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:42,918
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

681
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:52,265
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

682
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,267
He just...
He felt bad about snapping at you.

683
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,393
Really?

684
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:58,308
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

685
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:01,190
How you feeling?

686
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:04,693
Uh...

687
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:09,487
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

688
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,993
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

689
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:16,998
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

690
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,296
and now it's all ruined.

691
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:29,135
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

692
00:45:31,268 --> 00:45:32,679
It's a hard path.

693
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,521
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

694
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:39,482
People look up to you...

695
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,483
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

696
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:46,573
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

697
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:51,821
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

698
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:53,746
turn around, run away from all this.

699
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:57,827
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

700
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,628
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

701
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:03,591
Me too.

702
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:05,963
But you're worried about your friends.

703
00:46:06,053 --> 00:46:07,053
Yeah.

704
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,764
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

705
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:16,062
Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

706
00:46:16,147 --> 00:46:17,147
They'll be all right.

707
00:46:18,774 --> 00:46:23,565
It's really nice to have somebody to
talk to about superhero stuff, you know?

708
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:26,156
Anytime.

709
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:31,194
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

710
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,201
See you out there.

711
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,292
All right.

712
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:44,206
Sorry, that's Italian.

713
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:50,587
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

714
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,547
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey. Uh...

715
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:55,224
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

716
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,018
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

717
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:58,766
Good news.

718
00:46:58,856 --> 00:47:00,438
We're going to the opera!

719
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:02,106
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

720
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:04,776
- Don't look at me.
- What happened to the carnival?

721
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:06,319
This is upgrade living.

722
00:47:06,405 --> 00:47:10,319
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

723
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:13,368
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

724
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:17,824
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

725
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:20,876
Uh... I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

726
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:22,452
Thank you, Ned.

727
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:25,539
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

728
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:28,421
the best four hours of our whole trip.

729
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,922
Four hours?

730
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:32,504
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

731
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:38,176
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

732
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,683
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

733
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:42,730
instead of the biggest party in the world.

734
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:44,603
Again, don't look at me.

735
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:47,189
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

736
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:48,645
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

737
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,534
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.

738
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,156
Yeah, the rush out.

739
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:59,532
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

740
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:01,662
Let's go.

741
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:05,127
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

742
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,673
- You look really pretty.
- And therefore, I have value?

743
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:18,641
No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...

744
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,218
I'm messing with you.

745
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:23,145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

746
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:26,191
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

747
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:28,769
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

748
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,603
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

749
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:32,405
Want to go in on a pair?

750
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:35,825
- You mean, sit next to each other?
- Yeah.

751
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:37,652
<i>Are you in position?</i>

752
00:48:37,746 --> 00:48:39,612
- No.
- Okay. No...

753
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:42,290
<i>- Why the hell not? Parker?</i>
- you don't want to sit next to me,

754
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:46,040
- or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
- I didn't mean that. Uh...

755
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,543
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

756
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,462
I'll save you a seat next to me.

757
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:54,260
- A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.
- Awesome.

758
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:56,137
Okay.

759
00:48:56,223 --> 00:48:58,431
<i>- Parker.</i>
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

760
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:03,054
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

761
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,346
Okay. Be careful.

762
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:06,648
And whatever you do,

763
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:09,477
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

764
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,273
Yeah, Ned, I know.

765
00:49:11,363 --> 00:49:12,363
- Okay.
- Okay?

766
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:14,022
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

767
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:32,007
<i>Parker! You better be on your way.</i>

768
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:33,128
Coming.

769
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:41,641
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

770
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:43,935
- Oh, I... I don't...
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

771
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:46,479
Come on, let's go. Come on.

772
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:04,990
All right. I'm in position.

773
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:08,498
As soon as I see something, Beck,
I'll... I'll let you know.

774
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:10,670
<i>- Roger that.</i>
<i>- How's the suit?</i>

775
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:11,997
The suit's great.

776
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:15,255
It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

777
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,301
<i>- Parker!</i>
- Okay, I'll shut up.

778
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:19,880
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

779
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,306
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

780
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:25,636
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just...

781
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:28,267
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

782
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:31,145
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

783
00:50:39,952 --> 00:50:41,284
Don't worry, babe.

784
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,703
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

785
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:45,405
You'll feel a thousand times better.

786
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:53,083
- Energy spiking.
- We have seismic activity.

787
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:06,885
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?

788
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:09,062
- You know what to do.
- On your lead, Spider-Man.

789
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:16,487
No, come back!

790
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,188
Come back and help us!

791
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,113
You're up, kid.

792
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:40,468
- Wait, wait. Is that...?
- Oh.

793
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:42,887
- Do you think that's Spider-Man?
- Uh...

794
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:45,215
No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

795
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,050
I actually read about him. It's not him.

796
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:02,649
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

797
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:03,950
He's getting bigger!

798
00:52:04,578 --> 00:52:06,319
What's his name? What's his name?
Uh...

799
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:07,995
It's Night... Night Monkey.

800
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,492
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

801
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,119
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

802
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,202
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

803
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:15,503
- Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck!
- What?

804
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:17,330
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

805
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:33,314
Are you okay?

806
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:38,480
On to Plan B?

807
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,983
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

808
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:43,611
I go left, you go right! Now!

809
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,757
Okay, shoot him!

810
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:02,218
Yeah!

811
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:06,592
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

812
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:16,772
<i>Spider-Man, keep your distance.</i>

813
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:18,691
<i>I'm trying!</i>

814
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:20,737
<i>Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.</i>

815
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:22,315
<i>Okay. I'm on it!</i>

816
00:53:31,915 --> 00:53:34,749
- Aah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

817
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:46,795
Whoa, what is that?!

818
00:53:54,605 --> 00:53:56,062
Betty! Betty!

819
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,669
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

820
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:27,926
No, no, no.

821
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:35,518
It's too late.

822
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:38,847
Whatever happens...

823
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,557
I'm glad we met.

824
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:42,483
Beck, what are you doing?

825
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:46,104
What I should have done last time.

826
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:52,110
Beck, don't do it!

827
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,866
Beck!

828
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:19,188
Mr. Beck?

829
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:23,558
Oh, thank God.

830
00:55:32,577 --> 00:55:36,366
I would kiss you, but I think I
threw up in my mouth a little.

831
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,496
I might have a mint.

832
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:44,249
So it's over?

833
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,080
That was the last of them.

834
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:49,258
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

835
00:55:49,344 --> 00:55:52,928
We need to stay vigilant.

836
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:55,507
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

837
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,469
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

838
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:00,804
You should join us.

839
00:56:02,816 --> 00:56:05,604
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

840
00:56:15,996 --> 00:56:19,114
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

841
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:22,450
- Mr. Fury, I...
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

842
00:56:23,754 --> 00:56:27,293
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

843
00:56:28,425 --> 00:56:29,836
Stark chose you.

844
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:32,760
He made you an Avenger.

845
00:56:32,846 --> 00:56:34,758
I need that.

846
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:37,135
The world needs that.

847
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,430
Maybe Stark was wrong.

848
00:56:42,814 --> 00:56:44,021
Was he?

849
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:47,600
The choice is yours.

850
00:57:02,459 --> 00:57:03,666
Let's get a drink.

851
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:08,583
I'm not 21.

852
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,639
Hey.

853
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,059
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

854
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:23,145
Yeah.

855
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,347
Fury was right.

856
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,899
Tony did a lot for me...

857
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:30,977
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

858
00:57:31,822 --> 00:57:32,938
Do you?

859
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:35,023
Yeah. I mean...

860
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:39,490
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

861
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,411
He wanted me to be better than him.

862
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:44,491
- And Fury wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want?

863
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:47,160
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

864
00:57:49,214 --> 00:57:51,797
- I don't know.
- What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

865
00:57:51,883 --> 00:57:54,626
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip.

866
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:57,006
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

867
00:57:57,097 --> 00:58:00,181
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

868
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:03,635
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

869
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:07,480
- and give her a kiss.
- Oh.

870
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:08,566
Shut up, man.

871
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:11,730
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.

872
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,651
Why not?

873
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:14,729
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

874
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:18,983
- My God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

875
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:21,156
- Are those the...?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

876
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:24,739
They were just on the floor? Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.

877
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:25,833
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

878
00:58:29,462 --> 00:58:31,374
I actually really like them.

879
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:33,922
- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.

880
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:35,758
They look really stupid.

881
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:37,178
Oh.

882
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:39,511
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

883
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:41,051
You try them on.

884
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:42,848
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

885
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:45,096
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

886
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:54,310
What do you think, kid?

887
00:58:59,242 --> 00:59:01,074
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

888
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:04,779
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

889
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:05,873
What?

890
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,245
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

891
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:10,167
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

892
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:12,836
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

893
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,960
He knew every mistake I ever made.

894
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,383
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

895
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:18,801
Why give it to you?

896
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:22,847
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

897
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:25,220
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

898
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,769
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

899
00:59:28,855 --> 00:59:30,266
You're probably right.

900
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:33,521
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

901
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,569
And it's not me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

902
00:59:36,655 --> 00:59:39,489
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

903
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:42,533
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

904
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:45,657
No. Peter, come on. No.

905
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,324
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>

906
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,283
Hi. Yeah, um...

907
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,083
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

908
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:57,506
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

909
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:01,962
<i>- Any transfer will require confirmation.</i>
- Stark gave you the glasses.

910
01:00:02,055 --> 01:00:05,469
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

911
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:07,891
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

912
01:00:07,978 --> 01:00:10,971
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

913
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:12,680
He'd want you to have them.

914
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:14,310
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

915
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:15,401
Confirm.

916
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:20,775
Welcome to the Avengers.

917
01:00:29,207 --> 01:00:30,323
They look good on you.

918
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,210
Thank you.

919
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,670
It's an honor.

920
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:36,130
Yeah.

921
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,833
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

922
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:42,094
Where you headed?

923
01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:44,886
- I'm gonna go find MJ.
- Good luck, kid.

924
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:47,386
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward.

925
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,301
Yeah.

926
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:52,136
- See you later, man.
- See you.

927
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:26,219
See? That wasn't so hard.

928
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,306
Yes!

929
01:01:28,475 --> 01:01:31,309
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

930
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:39,683
<i>Okay, we got EDITH.</i>

931
01:01:39,778 --> 01:01:41,690
Get these connected to our system.

932
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,193
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

933
01:01:44,282 --> 01:01:46,865
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

934
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:48,692
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

935
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:50,494
Yeah!

936
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,947
Okay, toasts!

937
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,248
Give me that, Doug.

938
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:58,161
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

939
01:01:58,254 --> 01:01:59,540
Boo!

940
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,247
The jester king.

941
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:05,836
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

942
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,886
that he was unfit to wield.

943
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:10,297
Like the holographic system I designed.

944
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:13,100
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

945
01:02:13,186 --> 01:02:15,394
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

946
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,311
and renamed...

947
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,937
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

948
01:02:23,196 --> 01:02:27,065
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

949
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,948
<i>He renamed my life's work "BARF."</i>

950
01:02:32,038 --> 01:02:33,245
<i>I told him it was a mistake,</i>

951
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:35,493
that my technology could change
the world.

952
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:38,085
And then...

953
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,456
he fired me.

954
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:43,289
Said I was...

955
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:45,792
unstable.

956
01:02:47,512 --> 01:02:50,220
- To Tony.
- To Tony!

957
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:53,887
- Next, to William.
- William!

958
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:57,721
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

959
01:02:58,148 --> 01:03:00,390
With a box of scraps!

960
01:03:00,483 --> 01:03:02,349
The integration of my illusion tech

961
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:04,686
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

962
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,112
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

963
01:03:07,198 --> 01:03:08,530
And it's just the beginning.

964
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:10,573
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

965
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,971
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

966
01:03:11,995 --> 01:03:14,988
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

967
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:18,245
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

968
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:21,042
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

969
01:03:21,129 --> 01:03:22,836
I mean, everybody bought it.

970
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:24,333
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

971
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:26,586
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

972
01:03:26,676 --> 01:03:28,838
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

973
01:03:28,928 --> 01:03:31,090
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

974
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:32,547
Inspired idea.

975
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,053
- To Janice.
- Janice!

976
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:37,556
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

977
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:41,514
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

978
01:03:41,608 --> 01:03:42,608
but to a child.

979
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,232
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

980
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:47,153
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

981
01:03:47,238 --> 01:03:50,151
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

982
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:52,699
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

983
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:55,368
the most qualified, and no one cares.

984
01:03:55,455 --> 01:03:58,869
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

985
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,541
no one will even listen.

986
01:04:03,588 --> 01:04:06,956
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

987
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:10,092
With our technology and with EDITH,

988
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:15,048
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

989
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:16,222
Yeah!

990
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:18,972
Then everyone will listen!

991
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:25,308
- Not to a boozy man-child.
- No!

992
01:04:25,401 --> 01:04:27,893
Not to a hormonal teenager.

993
01:04:27,987 --> 01:04:30,104
No!

994
01:04:30,198 --> 01:04:31,279
To me...

995
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:34,575
and to my very wealthy crew.

996
01:04:35,078 --> 01:04:36,910
- To us.
- To us.

997
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:39,989
- To Mysterio!
- To Mysterio!

998
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:43,042
- To Peter Parker.
- To Peter Parker!

999
01:04:44,295 --> 01:04:45,331
Poor kid.

1000
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,297
Let's get to work.

1001
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,507
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

1002
01:04:54,597 --> 01:04:56,839
- We almost died.
- It's fine. It's fine.

1003
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:58,674
Hey, I'm done with the mission.

1004
01:04:58,768 --> 01:05:01,010
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

1005
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:03,187
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

1006
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:04,980
Of course our parents want us home.

1007
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:07,854
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1008
01:05:07,944 --> 01:05:11,733
Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't... Put some clothes on.

1009
01:05:11,823 --> 01:05:13,030
We're booking flights.

1010
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:15,358
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

1011
01:05:15,451 --> 01:05:17,192
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1012
01:05:19,038 --> 01:05:21,621
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

1013
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,995
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1014
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:25,951
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

1015
01:05:26,629 --> 01:05:29,337
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1016
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:32,590
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1017
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:35,965
- Hey.
- Where were you?

1018
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:39,465
- Um, I got lost.
- We were worried about you.

1019
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:40,723
Oh.

1020
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:43,223
- Good thing you're back.
- Yeah.

1021
01:05:43,938 --> 01:05:46,681
- So much for Paris.
- It would've been fun.

1022
01:05:46,774 --> 01:05:49,437
- Yeah. Night.
- Night.

1023
01:05:50,987 --> 01:05:52,273
You look ni...

1024
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:00,871
Okay.

1025
01:06:01,748 --> 01:06:02,748
Oh!

1026
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:03,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

1027
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,162
Look, um...

1028
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:11,919
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun

1029
01:06:12,008 --> 01:06:15,922
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

1030
01:06:16,012 --> 01:06:17,753
Yes.

1031
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:19,964
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1032
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:21,219
Yes.

1033
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,098
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1034
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:27,020
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1035
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:29,606
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1036
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:31,479
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Heh.

1037
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:38,066
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1038
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:47,996
- Hey.
- Hey.

1039
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:49,452
Where do you wanna go?

1040
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:51,286
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1041
01:06:51,381 --> 01:06:52,381
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1042
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:01,714
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1043
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:03,424
To see the city a bit.

1044
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:06,970
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1045
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:10,977
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1046
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:15,026
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1047
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:21,942
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1048
01:07:22,036 --> 01:07:23,948
for a while.

1049
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:26,873
Yeah?

1050
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:29,783
It's our last night in Europe,

1051
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:33,871
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1052
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:35,501
I'm just gonna tell you.

1053
01:07:37,844 --> 01:07:39,801
- MJ, I...
- "I'm Spider-Man."

1054
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:43,088
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1055
01:07:43,182 --> 01:07:44,218
That you're Spider-Man.

1056
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:48,686
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1057
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,847
I've been watching you for a while now.

1058
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:54,228
It's kind of obvious.

1059
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:56,445
I'm not Spider-Man.

1060
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:58,942
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1061
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:01,068
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1062
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:04,778
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1063
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:07,830
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?

1064
01:08:07,915 --> 01:08:09,577
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1065
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,000
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1066
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:15,079
- Then you're Spider-Man.
- I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1067
01:08:15,173 --> 01:08:18,507
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1068
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:21,006
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1069
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:23,587
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1070
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:25,138
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1071
01:08:25,224 --> 01:08:27,216
That's what it said on the news,

1072
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,643
and the news never lies.

1073
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:33,810
- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?

1074
01:08:35,693 --> 01:08:39,152
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1075
01:08:40,364 --> 01:08:41,571
I mean, maybe.

1076
01:08:42,033 --> 01:08:44,241
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1077
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:51,240
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1078
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:55,754
Yeah.

1079
01:08:56,964 --> 01:08:58,921
Why else would I be watching you?

1080
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,718
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe...

1081
01:09:09,852 --> 01:09:11,263
What the hell was that?

1082
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:14,145
I don't know.

1083
01:09:25,368 --> 01:09:27,906
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1084
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:31,284
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1085
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:33,661
It... It looked so real.

1086
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:36,118
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1087
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:40,213
- Wait, does that mean that...?
- The Elementals are fake?

1088
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:43,755
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1089
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:46,883
There was fire and destruction, and...

1090
01:09:48,432 --> 01:09:49,843
Who would do something like that?

1091
01:09:59,777 --> 01:10:00,938
Mysterio.

1092
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,274
I am Spider-Man.

1093
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:12,075
- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious?

1094
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:13,871
- Mm-hm.
- You're 100 percent serious?

1095
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:15,199
Because it's not funny.

1096
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:16,204
No, I'm not joking.

1097
01:10:16,294 --> 01:10:18,502
Because I was...
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1098
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:20,454
- MJ...
- So why are you here?

1099
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:23,507
- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,

1100
01:10:23,593 --> 01:10:25,334
but we have to get out of here, okay?

1101
01:10:25,428 --> 01:10:28,546
Okay. Okay. I can't
believe I figured it out!

1102
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:32,470
You took everything from me!

1103
01:10:33,686 --> 01:10:35,222
This is for my family!

1104
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,064
Pause.

1105
01:10:45,031 --> 01:10:46,693
- Pause.
- Oop.

1106
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:48,274
Sorry.

1107
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:51,284
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1108
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,406
Yep. Stand by.

1109
01:10:57,084 --> 01:10:59,952
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1110
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:03,539
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.

1111
01:11:03,633 --> 01:11:05,090
Kill image.

1112
01:11:05,176 --> 01:11:06,508
De-cloak drones.

1113
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,381
All right, weapons.

1114
01:11:09,764 --> 01:11:11,721
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1115
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,548
Weapons only. Stand by.

1116
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:24,734
- Nice.
- Stop.

1117
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,488
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something...

1118
01:11:28,574 --> 01:11:33,035
Just dou... You know what?
Double the damage and then run it again.

1119
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,611
You want me to double it up?

1120
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:36,071
- Yeah.
- All right.

1121
01:11:36,457 --> 01:11:37,457
Cover your ears.

1122
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:48,675
Whoo! That is good! That's good.

1123
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:51,302
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1124
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:53,881
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1125
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:57,389
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1126
01:11:57,478 --> 01:11:58,389
All right, well done.

1127
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,062
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1128
01:12:01,148 --> 01:12:03,606
- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1129
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:06,356
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1130
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:09,483
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

1131
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,189
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1132
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:14,492
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1133
01:12:15,496 --> 01:12:18,830
But when its new savior descends,

1134
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:21,454
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1135
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:25,337
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1136
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:26,880
Of course. Do you wanna try...?

1137
01:12:26,966 --> 01:12:28,878
No, no, that's...
What's going on with my hand?

1138
01:12:28,968 --> 01:12:30,300
Why is that happening?

1139
01:12:30,386 --> 01:12:33,675
Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1140
01:12:33,764 --> 01:12:34,764
It's fine.

1141
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:38,100
Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1142
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:40,427
It's... It's one drone.

1143
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:43,355
- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.

1144
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:46,479
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1145
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:50,233
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1146
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:53,781
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1147
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:57,077
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

1148
01:12:57,163 --> 01:12:59,496
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1149
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:02,751
Right?

1150
01:13:05,254 --> 01:13:07,120
William, can you look at me?

1151
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,416
Pull up EDITH.

1152
01:13:12,386 --> 01:13:13,386
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1153
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,306
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1154
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:18,427
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1155
01:13:19,685 --> 01:13:22,143
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1156
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:24,272
<i>Located.</i>

1157
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:26,941
Shit.

1158
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:32,191
You know, William, one day,

1159
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:34,739
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1160
01:13:34,825 --> 01:13:39,115
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1161
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,622
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?

1162
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:49,375
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1163
01:13:49,465 --> 01:13:52,082
You had access to killer drones?

1164
01:13:52,176 --> 01:13:55,544
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1165
01:13:55,638 --> 01:13:57,174
You almost killed Brad?

1166
01:13:57,264 --> 01:14:01,178
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...

1167
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:04,386
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1168
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,314
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin

1169
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,231
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1170
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:15,856
Just... Ahem.

1171
01:14:34,593 --> 01:14:35,959
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1172
01:14:36,053 --> 01:14:38,136
The costume looks great...

1173
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:43,050
for the costume party
at the prince's castle.

1174
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,601
She knows. I told her.

1175
01:14:45,271 --> 01:14:46,933
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1176
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,226
Oh.

1177
01:14:49,733 --> 01:14:51,850
- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.

1178
01:14:52,486 --> 01:14:53,486
Oh.

1179
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:57,523
- Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
- But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1180
01:14:57,616 --> 01:14:59,824
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1181
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,493
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1182
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,038
Whoa. That's crazy.

1183
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:06,205
Yeah.

1184
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,453
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1185
01:15:11,547 --> 01:15:12,547
It's been mostly me.

1186
01:15:13,382 --> 01:15:15,920
Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1187
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,343
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin, okay?

1188
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:19,761
Got it. Easy.

1189
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:22,510
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1190
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:26,101
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1191
01:15:26,187 --> 01:15:27,598
You're gonna need this.

1192
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:32,020
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1193
01:15:40,075 --> 01:15:42,067
So you know too.

1194
01:15:42,161 --> 01:15:43,197
It's cool.

1195
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:46,496
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1196
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:10,429
- Excuse me. Do you know where...?
<i>- Nacht</i> Monkey!

1197
01:16:10,522 --> 01:16:12,855
No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1198
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:16,945
Get in.

1199
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:26,487
- Mr. Fury...
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1200
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,742
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1201
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,411
Okay.

1202
01:16:31,919 --> 01:16:32,919
Ahem.

1203
01:16:36,006 --> 01:16:37,006
Right.

1204
01:17:02,366 --> 01:17:06,576
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1205
01:17:06,662 --> 01:17:08,153
He's talking about EDITH.

1206
01:17:08,247 --> 01:17:11,331
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1207
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:14,330
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1208
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:15,911
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1209
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:18,668
That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1210
01:17:19,216 --> 01:17:22,550
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1211
01:17:22,886 --> 01:17:26,220
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1212
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:27,923
was created by this?

1213
01:17:28,017 --> 01:17:30,134
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1214
01:17:30,686 --> 01:17:35,397
Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1215
01:17:35,482 --> 01:17:37,144
Who else did you tell about this?

1216
01:17:38,068 --> 01:17:40,310
Parker? Parker!

1217
01:17:40,404 --> 01:17:42,896
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1218
01:17:43,532 --> 01:17:45,569
What? Hill?

1219
01:17:50,873 --> 01:17:52,284
No, it's just an illu...

1220
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:54,578
Fury!

1221
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:02,253
<i>Wow, Peter, wow.</i>

1222
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:04,380
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1223
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:08,009
<i>Fury always had to die, but not you.</i>

1224
01:18:08,098 --> 01:18:09,214
Stop hiding, Beck!

1225
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:13,969
<i>I tried to help you walk away.</i>

1226
01:18:14,063 --> 01:18:16,055
<i>Now you're making me do this.</i>

1227
01:18:20,736 --> 01:18:23,444
<i>You told me, you were just a kid.</i>

1228
01:18:24,573 --> 01:18:27,862
<i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i>

1229
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:29,908
- Help me!
- MJ!

1230
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:32,077
Oh, God!

1231
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:37,201
- Peter, what's going on?
- I know this isn't real.

1232
01:18:37,628 --> 01:18:38,628
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1233
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:42,789
- MJ! MJ!
- Aah!

1234
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:48,503
<i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter.</i>

1235
01:18:49,848 --> 01:18:51,055
Whoa!

1236
01:19:01,777 --> 01:19:03,063
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1237
01:19:26,385 --> 01:19:28,502
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1238
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:42,934
<i>You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.</i>

1239
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:48,818
<i>I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1240
01:19:49,283 --> 01:19:50,694
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1241
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:53,527
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1242
01:20:17,144 --> 01:20:21,058
<i>If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.</i>

1243
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:37,036
<i>Deep down, you know I'm right.</i>

1244
01:20:48,175 --> 01:20:52,590
<i>You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.</i>

1245
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:56,639
<i>And now you have...</i>

1246
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,061
Fury.

1247
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:14,775
Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1248
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:16,905
Who'd you tell?

1249
01:21:16,995 --> 01:21:19,829
- Um...
- I know you told someone, so just tell me.

1250
01:21:19,915 --> 01:21:21,622
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1251
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,951
- Who else did you tell?!
- Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1252
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:27,378
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1253
01:21:28,924 --> 01:21:29,924
What?

1254
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:32,630
You are so gullible.

1255
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,756
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1256
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:36,138
Just a...

1257
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:38,224
sucker.

1258
01:21:39,142 --> 01:21:41,429
- And now all your friends have to die.
- Oh, my God.

1259
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:49,184
It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.

1260
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:56,198
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1261
01:21:57,995 --> 01:21:59,236
I really am sorry.

1262
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:10,163
- EDITH.
<i>- Yes, Quentin.</i>

1263
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:12,749
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1264
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,752
I need them to fly home from London.

1265
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:56,469
Hi.

1266
01:22:57,638 --> 01:22:58,674
Where am I?

1267
01:22:59,056 --> 01:23:01,139
Municipal holding facility.

1268
01:23:01,224 --> 01:23:04,934
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1269
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,263
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1270
01:23:08,732 --> 01:23:09,732
Thanks.

1271
01:23:11,985 --> 01:23:13,066
You guys are nice.

1272
01:23:14,404 --> 01:23:16,236
You speak really good English.

1273
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,106
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1274
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,492
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.

1275
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:24,987
Bye.

1276
01:23:25,082 --> 01:23:26,082
Guard!

1277
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,787
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1278
01:23:28,877 --> 01:23:30,789
- Yeah, she's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?

1279
01:23:30,879 --> 01:23:31,744
Yeah.

1280
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:40,802
Yeah.

1281
01:23:41,556 --> 01:23:42,672
Yeah.

1282
01:23:43,308 --> 01:23:45,095
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1283
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:51,101
You guys okay?

1284
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:05,036
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1285
01:24:05,122 --> 01:24:07,330
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1286
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,332
Everyone is so nice here.

1287
01:24:10,419 --> 01:24:12,581
Uh... Okay.

1288
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:18,884
Okay.

1289
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:23,630
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey, uh...

1290
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:27,308
I messed up. I need a... I need a ride.

1291
01:24:28,562 --> 01:24:30,849
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1292
01:24:30,939 --> 01:24:32,521
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1293
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:37,063
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1294
01:24:37,154 --> 01:24:40,113
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1295
01:24:41,116 --> 01:24:43,073
Yeah, no problem. Ha-ha.

1296
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,696
Thanks.

1297
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:45,786
Did you get that?

1298
01:25:07,225 --> 01:25:09,717
Peter? Are you okay?

1299
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:12,599
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1300
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:16,182
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1301
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:19,018
Only I would know... Uh...

1302
01:25:19,112 --> 01:25:20,899
Remember when we went to Germany?

1303
01:25:20,989 --> 01:25:22,821
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1304
01:25:22,908 --> 01:25:26,697
They didn't list the titles, but I could
tell by the price it was an adult film.

1305
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:29,621
- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1306
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:34,166
It's so good to see you.

1307
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,912
You'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1308
01:25:38,924 --> 01:25:40,756
Okay, hold still.

1309
01:25:40,842 --> 01:25:42,049
There we go.

1310
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:49,556
Ouch.

1311
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:52,602
- I thought you had super strength.
- It still hurts.

1312
01:25:55,106 --> 01:25:57,223
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1313
01:25:59,194 --> 01:26:01,277
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God, Happy.

1314
01:26:01,363 --> 01:26:03,070
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1315
01:26:03,156 --> 01:26:05,569
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1316
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:08,571
I trusted Beck. Right?

1317
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:12,618
I thought he was my friend. I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,

1318
01:26:12,707 --> 01:26:14,949
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1319
01:26:15,043 --> 01:26:17,626
so please do not tell me to relax.

1320
01:26:19,631 --> 01:26:22,374
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1321
01:26:25,428 --> 01:26:26,885
I just really miss him.

1322
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:29,339
Yeah, I miss him too.

1323
01:26:32,477 --> 01:26:33,888
Everywhere I go...

1324
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:36,603
I see his face.

1325
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:41,185
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1326
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:47,239
and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1327
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:50,493
You're not Iron Man.

1328
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,412
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1329
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,662
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1330
01:26:57,752 --> 01:26:59,243
Not even Tony.

1331
01:27:00,714 --> 01:27:02,671
Tony was my best friend.

1332
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:03,873
And he was a mess.

1333
01:27:04,426 --> 01:27:07,464
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1334
01:27:08,388 --> 01:27:11,301
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1335
01:27:13,727 --> 01:27:16,936
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1336
01:27:17,022 --> 01:27:20,106
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1337
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:26,403
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1338
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:29,907
What are you gonna do about it?

1339
01:27:35,498 --> 01:27:36,909
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1340
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,993
But I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1341
01:27:40,086 --> 01:27:43,045
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1342
01:27:43,131 --> 01:27:46,044
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1343
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:47,716
Give me your phone.

1344
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:49,043
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1345
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:50,628
Okay. Here.

1346
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:53,055
- What's your password?
- "Password."

1347
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:56,350
- No, what is your password?
- "Password," spelled out.

1348
01:27:56,436 --> 01:27:58,598
Head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1349
01:27:58,688 --> 01:28:00,048
I don't feel good about it either.

1350
01:28:00,106 --> 01:28:03,144
<i>Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1351
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:05,226
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1352
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,312
- Yeah, I need a suit.
- Suit?

1353
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,251
Okay, um...

1354
01:28:31,054 --> 01:28:33,546
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1355
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:43,352
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1356
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:51,573
What?

1357
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:53,490
Nothing.

1358
01:28:53,576 --> 01:28:56,068
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1359
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:02,158
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1360
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:09,832
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1361
01:29:11,428 --> 01:29:15,138
Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1362
01:29:15,223 --> 01:29:18,261
to a factor of 25 percent,

1363
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:21,139
and give me complete manual control
over detonation.

1364
01:29:21,604 --> 01:29:23,766
<i>♪ Forget the hearse 'cause I never die ♪♪</i>

1365
01:29:24,357 --> 01:29:27,350
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1366
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:30,312
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1367
01:29:30,405 --> 01:29:32,897
- I thought that was over.
- It's the biggest one yet.

1368
01:29:32,991 --> 01:29:34,732
- Where?
- London.

1369
01:29:34,826 --> 01:29:37,239
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1370
01:29:37,328 --> 01:29:40,366
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1371
01:29:42,792 --> 01:29:45,079
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1372
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,456
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1373
01:29:46,546 --> 01:29:49,163
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1374
01:29:49,257 --> 01:29:50,919
No, I'm talking about Peter.

1375
01:29:51,009 --> 01:29:53,092
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1376
01:29:53,178 --> 01:29:55,886
Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman

1377
01:29:55,972 --> 01:29:58,385
in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,

1378
01:29:58,475 --> 01:30:00,341
like back at the opera, huh?

1379
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:03,803
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1380
01:30:03,897 --> 01:30:06,355
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1381
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:11,519
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1382
01:30:11,613 --> 01:30:12,649
George Orwell.

1383
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:13,980
- Thank you, MJ.
- Yeah.

1384
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:18,694
Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1385
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:21,029
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1386
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:22,784
Yeah, what's that about?

1387
01:30:22,874 --> 01:30:25,582
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1388
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:26,810
I was trying to take a...

1389
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:28,832
Let's just put all this
craziness behind us

1390
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:31,710
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1391
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,417
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class.

1392
01:30:34,511 --> 01:30:35,752
Okay.

1393
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:38,838
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1394
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:41,424
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.

1395
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:45,182
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1396
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:46,807
- Okay?
- Look at this, guys.

1397
01:30:46,898 --> 01:30:48,434
Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.

1398
01:30:48,525 --> 01:30:51,984
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1399
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,173
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1400
01:30:54,197 --> 01:30:56,154
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1401
01:30:56,241 --> 01:30:58,028
All right.

1402
01:30:58,118 --> 01:30:59,859
I have the kids.

1403
01:31:03,748 --> 01:31:05,239
I got here as fast as I could.

1404
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:08,747
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1405
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:09,837
Damn it.

1406
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:13,331
Pulse is spiking.

1407
01:31:13,424 --> 01:31:16,633
- I'll take another look.
- Soon as you see something, report.

1408
01:31:17,053 --> 01:31:19,010
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1409
01:31:19,097 --> 01:31:21,805
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1410
01:31:23,017 --> 01:31:24,224
God help us all.

1411
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:27,727
Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1412
01:31:27,814 --> 01:31:30,648
<i>- William, launch the drones.</i>
- Copy that, brother.

1413
01:31:30,733 --> 01:31:34,397
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1414
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:42,443
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1415
01:31:42,537 --> 01:31:45,200
Get those wrinkles out. I could be
shaking hands with the queen.

1416
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,781
<i>- Guterman?</i>
- Almost in position.

1417
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:49,458
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1418
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:54,539
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1419
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:55,873
EDITH?

1420
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:57,503
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1421
01:31:57,594 --> 01:31:59,301
Show me my loose ends.

1422
01:32:00,054 --> 01:32:02,922
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1423
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:04,177
<i>- Copy.</i>
- All right.

1424
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:05,348
Start the show.

1425
01:32:07,312 --> 01:32:09,395
Let's save the world, people.

1426
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:13,520
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1427
01:32:14,569 --> 01:32:17,653
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1428
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:20,197
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1429
01:32:24,329 --> 01:32:25,820
That doesn't look good.

1430
01:32:25,914 --> 01:32:27,871
But it's fake,
there's nothing to worry about.

1431
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:32,077
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1432
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:33,536
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1433
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:38,333
- What?
<i>- Happy Hogan here.</i>

1434
01:32:38,426 --> 01:32:40,509
- I know. What do you want?
<i>- Over at Mr. Stark's,</i>

1435
01:32:40,595 --> 01:32:42,211
<i>going through his belongings.</i>

1436
01:32:42,305 --> 01:32:44,297
<i>- There was a surfboard you left behind.</i>
- What?

1437
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:46,994
<i>People there said they didn't think
Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:</i>

1438
01:32:47,018 --> 01:32:51,604
<i>- "Appearances can be deceiving."</i>
- It's not mine. And don't ever call again.

1439
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:03,695
Fury's got the coded message.
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1440
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:06,072
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1441
01:33:06,162 --> 01:33:08,279
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1442
01:33:08,373 --> 01:33:09,493
- We're close.
- We're close.

1443
01:33:09,582 --> 01:33:10,948
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1444
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,125
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go...

1445
01:33:14,128 --> 01:33:16,666
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1446
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:18,918
You'll make it back.
You'll give it to her yourself.

1447
01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:20,374
- Okay? You got this.
- I got this.

1448
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:23,302
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1449
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:26,301
All I have to do is get inside the
illusion, then I can take it down,

1450
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:29,350
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1451
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:31,848
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1452
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:35,021
True, but this time...

1453
01:33:35,108 --> 01:33:37,942
How do I explain this?
Uh... I have a sixth sense.

1454
01:33:38,027 --> 01:33:41,566
The Peter-tingle.
That's what you're talking about, right?

1455
01:33:41,656 --> 01:33:42,863
It's not working, though.

1456
01:33:42,949 --> 01:33:44,940
I heard it wasn't
working right now. Is it?

1457
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:45,692
It is working.

1458
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:48,323
- I don't know if it's working...
- So you got the Peter-tingle.

1459
01:33:48,413 --> 01:33:50,655
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1460
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:54,037
- You get that Peter-tingle back online.
- I got this.

1461
01:34:08,725 --> 01:34:11,388
- Cue the lightning.
- Cuing lightning.

1462
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:20,851
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1463
01:34:20,945 --> 01:34:21,945
Oh, my.

1464
01:34:23,781 --> 01:34:26,774
- What did the bus driver say?
- Bus driver's gone.

1465
01:34:26,868 --> 01:34:28,200
- What?!
- Where?!

1466
01:34:28,286 --> 01:34:31,120
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it
under control!

1467
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:35,415
- Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.
- I'm doing my best, Julius!

1468
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:37,834
- Look...
- Oh, the witches are back.

1469
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,752
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1470
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:47,386
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1471
01:34:50,141 --> 01:34:52,303
Come on, let's go! Aah!

1472
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,568
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1473
01:35:24,217 --> 01:35:25,958
This way. This way!

1474
01:35:26,052 --> 01:35:27,509
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1475
01:35:27,595 --> 01:35:29,302
- Flash!
- Follow that cursed hand.

1476
01:35:29,389 --> 01:35:31,005
This way, kids. Follow me.

1477
01:35:31,099 --> 01:35:34,217
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1478
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,596
Follow me, kids!

1479
01:35:36,646 --> 01:35:37,853
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1480
01:35:37,939 --> 01:35:40,852
Oh, no. Theyjoined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1481
01:35:40,942 --> 01:35:42,649
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1482
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:44,601
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1483
01:35:44,695 --> 01:35:46,482
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1484
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:47,779
He's gonna save us!

1485
01:35:51,285 --> 01:35:53,072
If Mysterio knows we know...

1486
01:35:53,162 --> 01:35:55,245
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1487
01:35:55,331 --> 01:35:56,572
We should go.

1488
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,366
Kill that witch! Pa-pow!

1489
01:36:00,962 --> 01:36:03,500
This is for my family!

1490
01:36:05,174 --> 01:36:06,961
Get somewhere safe, Fury.

1491
01:36:07,051 --> 01:36:08,633
<i>I don't see this ending well.</i>

1492
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:12,759
I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.

1493
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,557
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1494
01:36:16,644 --> 01:36:19,182
- I can. It's a little loud out here.
- I like the new suit.

1495
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:22,390
- Thanks.
- Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1496
01:36:22,483 --> 01:36:24,975
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1497
01:36:25,069 --> 01:36:26,526
- Still the play?
- Uh-huh.

1498
01:36:26,612 --> 01:36:28,979
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1499
01:36:29,073 --> 01:36:30,939
Copy. Stay sticky.

1500
01:36:34,078 --> 01:36:36,161
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1501
01:36:36,247 --> 01:36:39,661
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1502
01:36:53,723 --> 01:36:55,760
Beck, report!

1503
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,263
Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1504
01:36:58,352 --> 01:37:01,720
"It's all the Elementals.
They're merged into something..."

1505
01:37:01,814 --> 01:37:03,806
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1506
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,892
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1507
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:12,647
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1508
01:37:15,953 --> 01:37:16,784
Is that...?

1509
01:37:21,876 --> 01:37:23,242
Be ready for anything.

1510
01:37:23,336 --> 01:37:24,417
Yeah.

1511
01:37:30,343 --> 01:37:32,756
Ah. It's not real, it's
not real, it's not real!

1512
01:37:37,183 --> 01:37:38,890
Whoa.

1513
01:37:39,477 --> 01:37:40,638
That's awesome.

1514
01:38:06,504 --> 01:38:08,496
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1515
01:38:08,589 --> 01:38:10,922
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1516
01:38:11,008 --> 01:38:13,008
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1517
01:38:19,809 --> 01:38:21,892
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1518
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:25,016
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.

1519
01:38:29,652 --> 01:38:31,518
I hope this works.

1520
01:38:47,712 --> 01:38:48,712
You got me?

1521
01:38:53,801 --> 01:38:54,801
I got you.

1522
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:57,002
<i>Boss, the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1523
01:39:00,725 --> 01:39:01,932
I see you.

1524
01:39:05,896 --> 01:39:07,933
- EDITH, give me protection.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1525
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:25,493
- Just kill the illusion. Kill it.
- I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1526
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,041
They'll see what I want them to see!

1527
01:39:28,127 --> 01:39:31,086
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1528
01:39:31,172 --> 01:39:33,255
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1529
01:39:36,135 --> 01:39:38,422
- William, render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1530
01:39:38,512 --> 01:39:40,674
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1531
01:39:40,765 --> 01:39:42,006
There you are.

1532
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:46,809
Easy.

1533
01:39:51,108 --> 01:39:52,440
Who the hell is that?

1534
01:39:54,153 --> 01:39:55,269
- Ned!
- Happy!

1535
01:39:55,363 --> 01:39:57,650
I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1536
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,902
- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1537
01:39:59,992 --> 01:40:01,904
- Get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?

1538
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:04,281
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1539
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,492
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1540
01:40:09,585 --> 01:40:12,544
- Happy, are you okay?
<i>- We're okay. Just get Beck.</i>

1541
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:14,997
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1542
01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:21,670
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1543
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,686
There you are.

1544
01:40:40,116 --> 01:40:41,778
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1545
01:40:41,867 --> 01:40:43,779
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1546
01:40:47,707 --> 01:40:48,298
Go!

1547
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,120
Into the vault! The
walls are 8 feet thick.

1548
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:51,325
Go into the vault!

1549
01:40:51,419 --> 01:40:52,705
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1550
01:40:55,756 --> 01:40:56,756
Take cover!

1551
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:16,860
Okay.

1552
01:41:21,574 --> 01:41:22,574
Yeah?

1553
01:41:22,867 --> 01:41:24,358
<i>No. No.</i>

1554
01:41:28,622 --> 01:41:29,908
I see you.

1555
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:33,126
Get that thing out...

1556
01:41:38,674 --> 01:41:39,835
Go!

1557
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,302
How does Cap do that?!

1558
01:41:58,110 --> 01:42:01,319
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1559
01:42:01,405 --> 01:42:03,692
<i>- I'm here. I'm here.</i>
- Happy, thank God.

1560
01:42:03,783 --> 01:42:05,274
I bought us some time.

1561
01:42:06,911 --> 01:42:08,698
- But not much.
<i>- I'm trying to get to Beck,</i>

1562
01:42:08,788 --> 01:42:10,450
but I can't shake these drones!

1563
01:42:25,346 --> 01:42:26,346
Gotcha.

1564
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:49,738
Going up!

1565
01:43:26,824 --> 01:43:28,156
Finally.

1566
01:43:28,242 --> 01:43:32,236
- Hey, William, how we doing?
- Illusion almost back up.

1567
01:43:32,329 --> 01:43:34,036
<i>I don't know how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1568
01:43:49,221 --> 01:43:50,507
Oh, great. No webs.

1569
01:44:04,194 --> 01:44:06,436
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1570
01:44:09,116 --> 01:44:11,859
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1571
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:15,738
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1572
01:44:16,665 --> 01:44:19,328
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1573
01:44:19,418 --> 01:44:22,035
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1574
01:44:22,129 --> 01:44:24,246
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1575
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,004
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1576
01:44:28,093 --> 01:44:29,800
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1577
01:44:29,887 --> 01:44:31,298
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1578
01:44:31,388 --> 01:44:32,754
I'm sorry, okay?

1579
01:44:32,848 --> 01:44:35,841
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts people's feelings.

1580
01:44:37,186 --> 01:44:39,269
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1581
01:44:43,317 --> 01:44:44,774
We're sharing, right?

1582
01:45:23,857 --> 01:45:25,393
Your lies are over, Beck.

1583
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:30,103
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1584
01:45:30,197 --> 01:45:31,608
EDITH?

1585
01:45:39,373 --> 01:45:41,865
Just give me the glasses.

1586
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:43,075
You want these?

1587
01:45:45,254 --> 01:45:46,254
Come and get them.

1588
01:45:56,348 --> 01:45:57,884
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1589
01:46:22,624 --> 01:46:25,241
- Why aren't these drones firing?
<i>- You're in the strike zone.</i>

1590
01:46:25,335 --> 01:46:30,126
<i>- The chance of getting hit is...</i>
- No, fire all the drones now!

1591
01:46:48,484 --> 01:46:49,484
Beck!

1592
01:46:53,363 --> 01:46:54,399
Beck.

1593
01:46:55,532 --> 01:46:56,989
You lied to me.

1594
01:46:57,701 --> 01:46:59,863
- I trusted you.
- I know.

1595
01:47:00,412 --> 01:47:02,324
That's the most...

1596
01:47:02,414 --> 01:47:04,155
disappointing part.

1597
01:47:05,793 --> 01:47:07,750
You're a good person, Peter.

1598
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:11,795
Such a weakness.

1599
01:47:13,842 --> 01:47:15,083
Stark was right.

1600
01:47:16,095 --> 01:47:17,506
You do deserve them.

1601
01:47:29,233 --> 01:47:30,895
You can't trick me anymore.

1602
01:47:34,905 --> 01:47:36,521
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1603
01:47:37,658 --> 01:47:40,992
<i>Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1604
01:47:41,078 --> 01:47:43,912
<i>- Execute all cancellation protocols?</i>
- Just do it.

1605
01:47:43,997 --> 01:47:45,863
- Execute them all.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

1606
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,131
Give me the spear.

1607
01:47:57,427 --> 01:47:58,634
That's a halberd.

1608
01:48:03,642 --> 01:48:04,642
Thank you.

1609
01:48:08,814 --> 01:48:12,182
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1610
01:48:13,819 --> 01:48:16,983
People, they need to believe.

1611
01:48:18,532 --> 01:48:19,898
And nowadays...

1612
01:48:22,286 --> 01:48:24,073
they'll believe anything.

1613
01:48:34,965 --> 01:48:35,965
Is he...?

1614
01:48:37,593 --> 01:48:38,709
Is this real?

1615
01:48:40,304 --> 01:48:42,216
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1616
01:48:57,362 --> 01:48:58,819
Whoo! Yeah!

1617
01:48:58,906 --> 01:49:00,488
Hey, where you going?

1618
01:49:08,207 --> 01:49:09,493
- MJ.
- Hey.

1619
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,536
- Hey.
- Hey.

1620
01:49:11,627 --> 01:49:13,243
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1621
01:49:13,337 --> 01:49:15,750
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1622
01:49:15,839 --> 01:49:17,171
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1623
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:21,300
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1624
01:49:21,386 --> 01:49:24,094
and they were following us,
and then theyjust stopped.

1625
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:27,427
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1626
01:49:28,852 --> 01:49:29,852
Did you get him?

1627
01:49:33,106 --> 01:49:34,768
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

1628
01:49:36,235 --> 01:49:37,316
brought that.

1629
01:49:38,237 --> 01:49:39,978
In case you needed some help.

1630
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:41,530
Thanks.

1631
01:49:43,742 --> 01:49:48,203
Anyway, uh, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1632
01:49:48,288 --> 01:49:50,655
I think he works for you or something.

1633
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:52,285
He...

1634
01:49:52,376 --> 01:49:54,618
- He gave me this.
- No.

1635
01:49:55,045 --> 01:49:56,045
No.

1636
01:49:57,339 --> 01:49:58,830
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1637
01:49:58,924 --> 01:50:01,041
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1638
01:50:01,134 --> 01:50:04,627
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1639
01:50:08,558 --> 01:50:09,890
And you kissed me.

1640
01:50:09,977 --> 01:50:12,560
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1641
01:50:12,646 --> 01:50:17,016
I don't really have much luck
when it comes to getting close to people.

1642
01:50:18,235 --> 01:50:20,318
Um... So I lied.

1643
01:50:22,281 --> 01:50:26,366
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1644
01:50:30,831 --> 01:50:32,322
That's great.

1645
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:36,208
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1646
01:50:36,295 --> 01:50:38,332
- Good.
- Yeah.

1647
01:50:38,422 --> 01:50:40,038
Sorry it's broken.

1648
01:50:40,132 --> 01:50:42,294
I actually like it better broken.

1649
01:50:44,177 --> 01:50:45,293
I really like you.

1650
01:50:46,972 --> 01:50:48,463
I really like you too.

1651
01:51:03,363 --> 01:51:04,649
Okay. I should...

1652
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:07,699
I should probably get back to the class.

1653
01:51:07,784 --> 01:51:08,784
I'll go and...

1654
01:51:10,287 --> 01:51:11,823
- Yeah. I don't know.
- Okay.

1655
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:15,115
Just in case.

1656
01:51:23,133 --> 01:51:24,590
Yeah, no.

1657
01:51:24,676 --> 01:51:27,919
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1658
01:51:28,013 --> 01:51:30,096
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1659
01:51:30,182 --> 01:51:31,468
I gotta go.

1660
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:35,973
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1661
01:51:36,063 --> 01:51:38,680
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1662
01:51:38,774 --> 01:51:41,016
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1663
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:42,145
It worked.

1664
01:51:42,235 --> 01:51:44,978
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1665
01:51:45,072 --> 01:51:46,688
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1666
01:51:50,327 --> 01:51:51,327
Where's Parker?

1667
01:51:51,411 --> 01:51:52,743
He's with a girl.

1668
01:51:52,829 --> 01:51:55,412
I need to speak with him.

1669
01:51:56,124 --> 01:51:58,036
- He'll call you.
- He'll...?

1670
01:52:02,381 --> 01:52:04,418
Okay. Great.

1671
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:06,298
Well, he better.

1672
01:52:06,385 --> 01:52:08,342
Or it's your ass.

1673
01:52:08,929 --> 01:52:11,888
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1674
01:52:16,561 --> 01:52:21,807
<i>♪ Hey, little girl
I want to be your boyfriend ♪</i>

1675
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:29,072
<i>♪ Sweet little girl
I want to be your boyfriend ♪♪</i>

1676
01:52:29,157 --> 01:52:30,989
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1677
01:52:31,076 --> 01:52:34,945
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1678
01:52:35,038 --> 01:52:36,038
Ouch.

1679
01:52:36,415 --> 01:52:37,701
Except for me.

1680
01:52:38,208 --> 01:52:39,119
Aww. Thanks.

1681
01:52:39,209 --> 01:52:40,916
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1682
01:52:41,002 --> 01:52:42,002
See you later.

1683
01:52:42,045 --> 01:52:44,662
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1684
01:52:44,756 --> 01:52:50,002
Uh... I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1685
01:52:50,095 --> 01:52:52,678
- Oh, we broke up.
- Oh, we broke up.

1686
01:52:52,764 --> 01:52:54,096
No. What? Why?

1687
01:52:54,182 --> 01:52:56,549
Men and women grow apart,

1688
01:52:56,643 --> 01:52:59,602
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1689
01:53:01,398 --> 01:53:03,390
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1690
01:53:06,736 --> 01:53:07,736
Hello, Gerald.

1691
01:53:09,072 --> 01:53:10,563
Could Mother not make it?

1692
01:53:12,534 --> 01:53:13,534
Oh.

1693
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:18,321
- May!
- I promise you...

1694
01:53:18,415 --> 01:53:20,657
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1695
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:25,082
I'm so glad you're okay.

1696
01:53:25,172 --> 01:53:28,131
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1697
01:53:28,216 --> 01:53:30,082
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1698
01:53:30,177 --> 01:53:32,294
- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.

1699
01:53:33,388 --> 01:53:35,721
- I got you some hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.

1700
01:53:35,807 --> 01:53:36,718
I know my boy.

1701
01:53:36,808 --> 01:53:40,176
<i>I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.</i>

1702
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:41,977
<i>I faced a lot of deception.</i>

1703
01:53:42,063 --> 01:53:44,931
<i>And I'm tired of the lies.</i>

1704
01:53:45,025 --> 01:53:47,187
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1705
01:53:50,322 --> 01:53:51,358
Are you dating?

1706
01:53:52,282 --> 01:53:53,614
- Yes.
- Not really.

1707
01:53:54,618 --> 01:53:56,405
- What?
- Well...

1708
01:53:56,495 --> 01:53:58,452
- I think...
- Summer fling.

1709
01:53:58,538 --> 01:54:00,530
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1710
01:54:00,624 --> 01:54:02,414
I still don't know
where it's going to go.

1711
01:54:02,426 --> 01:54:03,788
Open to wherever
it might lead.

1712
01:54:03,877 --> 01:54:05,914
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1713
01:54:06,004 --> 01:54:09,918
- We'll always be friends, no matter what.
- I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1714
01:54:10,008 --> 01:54:12,500
...because we all are interconnected.

1715
01:54:12,594 --> 01:54:13,710
- Bye.
- We are.

1716
01:54:32,447 --> 01:54:33,563
Sorry!

1717
01:54:38,495 --> 01:54:39,576
Whoa!

1718
01:54:45,126 --> 01:54:46,126
Whoo!

1719
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:55,422
Woo-hoo!

1720
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,938
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

1721
01:55:12,404 --> 01:55:14,361
- It's fine.
- You ready?

1722
01:55:14,447 --> 01:55:16,109
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love this.

1723
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:18,065
Okay! Okay!

1724
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:19,991
- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?

1725
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:23,287
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1726
01:55:25,292 --> 01:55:27,955
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking!

01:57:52,355 --> 01:57:53,596
Uh...

1748
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:56,182
Whoo. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1749
01:57:56,276 --> 01:57:58,814
Let's just... Never,
never doing that again.

1750
01:57:58,903 --> 01:58:00,610
- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.

1751
01:58:01,197 --> 01:58:02,466
I should probably get out of here.

1752
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:04,152

<i>This is breaking news.</i>

<i>We come to you with revelations
about last week's attack in London.</i>

1755

<i>An anonymous source provided
this video.</i>

<i>A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.</i>

1760
01:58:26,014 --> 01:58:27,630
<i>Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason.</i>

1761
01:58:27,724 --> 01:58:30,011
<i>He has an army of weaponized drones,

You gotta tell him.

1780
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:36,103
It was fine.

1781
02:07:36,188 --> 02:07:38,180
The little boy handled it.

1782
02:07:38,274 --> 02:07:39,890
We helped.

1783
02:07:39,984 --> 02:07:41,191
- Talos.
- Come off it.

1784
02:07:41,277 --> 02:07:43,769
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1785
02:07:43,863 --> 02:07:46,230
I mean, that was all very convincing.

1786
02:07:46,324 --> 02:07:49,943
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1787
02:07:50,036 --> 02:07:53,245
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1788
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:58,200
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1789
02:07:58,294 --> 02:08:02,083
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1790
02:08:02,173 --> 02:08:05,632
And, uh, it was very touching, you know?

1791
02:08:05,718 --> 02:08:07,505
Really, really quite touching.

1792
02:08:07,595 --> 02:08:08,836
- Talos.
- Um...

1793
02:08:08,929 --> 02:08:13,219
And, uh, you know, shortly after that,

1794
02:08:13,309 --> 02:08:16,268
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

1795
02:08:16,354 --> 02:08:18,516
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

1796
02:08:18,606 --> 02:08:20,097
I don't know what to say to that,

1797
02:08:20,191 --> 02:08:21,807
<i>so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...</i>

1798

Everybody back to work!

1799
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:55,511
Who's got my shoes?
