37 HOURS AGO

2
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,943
How's Hyun-su?

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,030
He lost his memory.

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,074
How much of it?

5
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,368
I'm not entirely sure.

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,081
Well, if that's the case,

7
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,959
I hope he lost all his bad memories too.

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,922
He wouldn't want that.

9
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,259
Without his memories…

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,305
he would really be a monster.

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,564
Ji-su.

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,358
I have a favor to ask.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,154
What is it?

14
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,576
I don't think I can be with everyone
for much longer.

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,956
From now on, you have to be the one

16
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
who protects this place.

17
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,754
Protect the people here…

18
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,632
and Eun-yu.

ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

20
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:50,753
SWEET HOME

21
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,966
Make a left here.

22
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,196
GREEN HOME APARTMENTS

23
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,073
You can't be serious!

24
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,659
Why would we come back here?
Are you crazy?

25
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,870
This is a mistake.

26
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,330
Let's just go back.

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,040
To where?

28
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:27,957
What?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,917
You saw that place.

30
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,127
Did it look safe to you?

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,339
Does this "shelter" even exist?

32
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,716
Why won't you tell us where it is?

33
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,385
We don't know if you're infected.

34
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,887
Anyone could be infected.

35
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,722
You're not immune to monsterization.

36
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,725
Anyone could turn into a monster.

37
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,061
You don't know when or how.

38
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,611
We can't…

39
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,696
go any further.

40
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,117
Wait here for a minute.

41
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,286
I'll be right back.

42
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,002
He might not be…

43
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,214
the Eun-hyeok you remember.

44
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,632
You're wrong.

45
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,885
He promised he'd come back.

46
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,429
No matter what.

47
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,141
I won't believe anything else…

48
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,938
until I see him with my own eyes.

49
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,338
Fuck.

50
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,632
You better think this through.

51
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,343
You're making a big mistake.

52
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,970
Is that a threat?

53
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,264
I got nothing to lose.

54
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,144
And this is how you threaten someone.

55
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,480
Damn it.

56
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,771
GREEN HOME

GREEN HOME RULES OF SURVIVAL

TURNING: LEE EUN-HYEOK

61
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,420
I'll come back.

62
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,757
Don't worry.

63
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,218
I'll come back safe.

64
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,429
Just kill them.

65
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,183
With them out of the picture,
we're just innocent survivors.

66
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
Let's just kill these assholes
and be on our way!

67
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,520
It's as simple as that!

68
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,771
Choose wisely.

69
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,690
Don't you want the vaccine?

70
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,900
There's a vaccine?

71
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,201
It does say here
that a vaccine is being developed.

72
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,578
You took Hyun-su.

73
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,329
Then a vaccine can be made, right?

74
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,081
Not anyone can get it.

75
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,875
But maybe survivors who saved soldiers
from an armed assailant could.

76
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,804
-Hey, what are you doing?
-I can't fucking die like this!

77
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,351
Drop the gun!

78
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,526
Drop it!

79
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,541
You little bitch.

80
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,002
Get up.

81
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,588
Get up, you bitch.

82
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,548
Get up.

83
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,216
Get the fuck up.

84
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,301
Come here.

85
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,803
Come here, you fucking bitch!

86
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,226
Fuck you!

87
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,479
Come here.

88
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,651
-You motherfucker!
-You need to see this.

89
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,194
There's nothing but corpses!

90
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,946
They're…

91
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,823
the Crow Platoon.

92
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,167
They're still warm.

93
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,585
It couldn't have been long.

94
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,671
There must be…

95
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
a monster nearby.

96
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,275
Tie them all up.

97
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,485
We're returning to the shelter.

98
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,488
-But the survivors…
-Do they look like survivors?

99
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,616
I swear I could kill all of them myself.

100
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,201
If they're lucky, they'll live.

101
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,078
But if they die, that's their fate.

102
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,913
I tried to help you, sir.

103
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,165
-You know that. Please take me.
-Get off me!

104
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,750
Please, sir!

105
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,337
Sergeant!

106
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,713
What are you waiting for?

107
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,340
Tie them up and get in!

108
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,469
I said let's go!

109
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,180
You want to die with them?

110
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,195
I kept the knots loose.

111
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,782
Once we leave, look for a place to hide.

112
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
Ms. Im?

113
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,145
It's Ms. Im.

114
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,814
But she turned into a monster.

115
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,825
What now?

116
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,495
I'm fucking sick
and tired of these monsters.

117
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,622
Fucking die already!

118
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,553
What was that for?

119
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,514
What?

120
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,765
I'm doing my job.

121
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,100
She was human, sir.

122
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,560
No, she's a monster.

123
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
If I say she is, she is.

124
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,902
Monster…

125
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,403
It's a monster.

126
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,615
Come on, get up.

127
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,458
And what if she isn't?

128
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,335
Does that even matter?

129
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
Sir.

130
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,964
This is a war.

131
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,718
And it has to be us humans that win

132
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,512
after killing all these fucking monsters!

133
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:38,520
I can't see…

134
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,466
I can't see…

135
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:28,237
I'll kill you…

136
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,837
Found you…

137
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,163
Let go.

138
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,456
Are you trying to get us killed?

139
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,738
Found you…

140
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,399
This is Crow One. We got a man down.

141
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,859
-Calling for medical support.
-Hurry up!

142
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,736
Keep going!

143
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,363
He's in a critical state.
Requesting medical support.

144
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,033
Have a few men guard the injured
and continue the mission.

145
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,995
Third floor's clear.
Entering the fourth floor.

146
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,373
Rescue the Third Platoon and extract.

147
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,374
Keep your eyes peeled!

148
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,003
Monster on your six!

149
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,345
Open fire!

150
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,391
This is Crow Four.

151
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,435
We've taken out the monster,

152
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,562
but five men are injured and two are dead.

153
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,443
Extract the Third Platoon's entry team

154
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,362
and join the main element
with the injured.

155
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,447
Recon, do we have eyes
on the Second Platoon?

156
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,458
You see anything?

157
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,962
The building is blocking the view.

158
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,007
No line of sight, sir.

159
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,217
Get back down.

160
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,426
We'll be going there.

161
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,428
Count us out.

162
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,847
Pack it up, UDT.

163
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,307
We're heading back.

164
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,852
What are you doing?

165
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,195
They're barely awake, sir.

166
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,282
They're starving, injured, and exhausted.

167
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,866
You heard them.

168
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,994
We lost our vehicle and we're out of ammo.

169
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:27,911
So what?

170
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,664
We abandon the Second Platoon?

171
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,837
Yes, abandon them.

172
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,672
Just abandon them.

173
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,925
Abandon the dead
and protect our men who are alive.

174
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,802
Hey, Seok-chan.

175
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,138
Yes, sir.

176
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,515
What did Central Command
tell us six hours ago?

177
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,060
To return immediately.

178
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,645
This is insubordination, sir.

179
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,192
Men who aren't UDT, you can come too.

180
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,953
I'll take responsibility
for my insubordination when I return.

181
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,955
But Sergeant First Class Kim,

182
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,583
how will you
take responsibility for yours?

183
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
Shoot me, sir.

184
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,054
You'll get us all killed anyway.

185
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,015
Do it.

186
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,227
Just like you did to your family.

187
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,495
Injured men and UDT,

188
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,789
return to base with Sergeant Kim.

189
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,881
Let's go.

190
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,267
That was Ms. Im, wasn't it?

191
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,437
I think so.

192
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,315
She's the mom

193
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,650
from Room 1504, right?

194
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,360
Yes.

195
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,029
Didn't she turn into a monster?

196
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,447
That's what you said earlier.

197
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,157
She did.

198
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,327
Was she resisting it like Hyun-su did?

199
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,828
That's right.

200
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,247
Her eyes didn't turn black or anything.

201
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,540
She just had human eyes.

202
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,292
But she was all naked.

203
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,877
She's a monster, not a human.

204
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,755
Well, she's a good monster!

205
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,550
-She protected us!
-All monsters are evil, okay?

206
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,010
They should all be killed.

207
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,053
No!

208
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,763
You're wrong!

209
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,097
You disrespectful punk.

210
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,724
Why are you yelling at a kid?

211
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,603
Ma'am, are you okay?

212
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,745
Ji-su.

213
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,748
Ji-su, are you okay?

214
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,502
No, thanks to you.

215
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
You were too reckless this time.

216
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,346
Eun-yu.

217
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,267
We're not here because we're luckier
or better than others.

218
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,478
We barely survived
at the cost of their lives.

219
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,230
Don't let them be in vain.

220
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,194
I'm sorry,

221
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,363
but I'm never giving up.

222
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,573
I haven't seen him for myself.

223
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,118
So Eun-hyeok is still alive to me.

224
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,958
And I'll find him no matter what.

225
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,767
What's going on?

226
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,894
Why did you stop?

227
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,441
There's a survivor.

228
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,904
Are you going to let him in?

229
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,239
That's a bad idea!

230
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,867
My duty is to bring survivors
to the shelter.

231
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,119
Why are you so committed
to a duty you didn't sign up for?

232
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,620
I'm scared.

233
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,122
Don't try to be a hero.

234
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,459
Let's just go, okay?

235
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,419
We won't tell anyone.

236
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,920
No one will know.

237
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,548
Let's just go.

238
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:14,883
But I'll know.

239
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,135
What are you…

240
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,153
Where are you headed?

241
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,738
The shelter.

242
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:15,360
BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU

243
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,150
We meet at last.

244
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,029
Thanks for coming,

245
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,739
Cha Hyun-su.

246
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,994
So?

247
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,415
What do I need to do?

248
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
You'll find out soon enough.

249
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,381
You seem to be cooperative.

250
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,011
Yes.

251
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,431
If it means…

252
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,476
all of this will end.

253
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,104
All right, Cha Hyun-su.

254
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
I believe in you.

255
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,478
Type Red.

256
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,105
Blood makes them aggressive.

257
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,945
Are you the savior
who can end all of this?

258
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,281
Show us what you've got.

259
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,536
Begin the first test on MH-5, Cha Hyun-su.

260
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,135
So MH-6 here was the special infectee
who kidnapped MH-5?

261
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,136
Yes, sir.

262
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,929
And he was shot to death?

263
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,223
Are you sure he's dead?

264
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,393
No vital signs whatsoever.
We double-checked.

265
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,439
He was definitely a monster,
so how is he dead?

266
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,408
Could it be a similar case to MH-1?

267
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,160
MH-1 didn't die,

268
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,454
but this one also doesn't show
any monster-like responses.

269
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,790
Blood, bone marrow,
skin tissue, pituitary gland…

270
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,125
Collect everything you can.

271
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,252
We have to compare them
to samples from MH-1.

272
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,881
MH-5 will be brought here soon.

273
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,674
Make sure to prepare for it.

274
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,426
It could be our last chance.

275
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:14,057
All the data and experience
we got from MH-6 and MH-1

276
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,808
must be applied to MH-5.

277
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,069
What are you doing?

278
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,862
Come on, Cha Hyun-su.

279
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,323
I know you can do it.

280
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,222
Stop!

281
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,224
Stop it!

282
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:15,089
I want to stop hurting.

283
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,524
Help me.

284
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,613
Help.

285
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,705
Help.

286
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,831
No.

287
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,919
He's human.

288
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,175
He's human.

289
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,723
No!

290
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,266
Was it you

291
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,810
who told me to cooperate?

292
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,354
Was that you?

293
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,692
Why did you kill him?

294
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,112
Why the hell did you kill him?

295
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,282
He didn't attack me.

296
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,491
He was suffering.

297
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,869
You didn't have to kill him.

298
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,206
He had no value as a test subject,
so we discarded him.

299
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,919
Was it because he was a monster?

300
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,505
Because monsters must be killed?

301
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,887
How are you any different from them?

302
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,350
What exactly are you?

303
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,689
He used to go berserk
at the sight of blood.

304
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,777
Dozens of soldiers died at his hands.

305
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,615
But he stopped attacking
after a short brawl with you.

306
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,913
We've never seen a monster
show self-control until now.

307
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,000
Not once.

308
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,644
You…

309
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,651
What did you do to him?

310
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,697
What on earth did you do?

311
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,452
I don't know.

312
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,039
Well, then who does?

313
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,959
Try to remember.

314
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,461
This is why we brought you here.

315
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,133
Answer me first.

316
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,096
Can you develop…

317
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,182
a vaccine with my help?

318
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,520
I saw the flier that said a vaccine
could be made using special infectees.

319
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,273
Is that why you're here?

320
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,900
-Is it true?
-The vaccine's already been made.

321
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,528
But it's all gone now.

322
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,782
So make it again.

323
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,869
You just need me, right?

324
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,247
Would you be fine

325
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,624
even if you had to die?

326
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,668
I wouldn't be here
if I was afraid of death.

327
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,421
No, you'll probably beg me to kill you.

328
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,715
You already know.

329
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,884
The MHs' ability to regenerate

330
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,221
is like a blessing to us,
but it's a curse for you.

331
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,558
You can't die even if you want to.

332
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,018
You're a "Monster Human."

333
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,395
It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

334
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,606
I came up with it.

335
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,443
An MH, a monster…

336
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,904
Call me whatever you want.

337
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,323
I don't care.

338
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,411
You'll do better than the others.

339
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,540
I have a feeling
that a very special MH will be born.

340
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,919
Get some rest.

341
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,215
It'll be rough starting tomorrow.

342
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,752
One more mistake
and you'll set off the alarm.

343
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,342
Ms. Seo Yi-kyung?

344
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,389
He's in Area C5.

345
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,978
Follow me.

346
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,605
What's there?

347
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,191
Do you know me?

348
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:51,986
Right.

349
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,238
You don't know me, do you?

350
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,489
But I know you.

351
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,865
I'm Sang-won's friend.

352
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,450
Are you coming or not?

353
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,160
Why are you helping me?

354
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,080
For old times' sake?

355
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,585
They're headed
toward the research facility.

356
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,503
Split up and look for them.
There's no time.

357
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,464
You heard the man. Let's go.

358
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,487
He's still here.

359
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,534
In such…

360
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,789
a pitiful state.

361
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,339
Must have been a long trip,
but I don't know if he'll be able to talk.

362
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,842
He probably won't.

363
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,219
But who knows?

364
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,554
You're his fiancée.

365
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,957
Have you been waiting for me?

366
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,028
Statistically, reality sucks.

367
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,619
Ignorance is bliss, as they say.

368
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,249
Do you still want to see him…

369
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,670
even if he's a monster?

370
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,842
I just have to see how Sang-won responds

371
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,719
to seeing you again.

372
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,518
This kind of stimulus is hard to come by.

373
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,436
You're crazy.

374
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,442
What brings you soldiers--

375
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,580
How could I not make that audition?

376
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,916
What's wrong with my face?

377
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,419
It's so unfair.

378
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,922
So ridiculous.

379
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
I did well…

380
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,219
God damn it.

381
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,701
Mr. Soldier.

382
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,559
Mr. Soldier…

383
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,354
What's wrong?

384
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,690
I'm too scared to pee.

385
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,218
Stupid fucking audition…

386
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,471
Nothing's wrong with my face.

387
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,307
What's wrong with my face?

388
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,268
Fuck this shit.

389
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,688
How could I not make it?

390
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,078
How do I look?

391
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,254
How do I look?

392
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,090
Am I pretty?

393
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,927
Mister…

394
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,056
Something's wrong with your face.

395
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,234
Take a good look.

396
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,945
My face is perfect.

397
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,585
Does my face look weird?

398
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,257
I said, how do I look?

399
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,347
Am I pretty?

400
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,265
Am I--

401
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,478
Move.

402
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,077
Get out!

403
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,388
Don't shoot my face…

404
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,642
My face…

405
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,235
What's wrong with my face?
Let me see a mirror.

406
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,513
Why is my face…

407
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,726
I'm not pretty!

408
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,901
This is not my face!

409
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,161
My face!

410
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,225
This is not my face!

411
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:43,285
Take a close look at my face.

412
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,915
Am I pretty?

413
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,144
You look fucking disgusting.

414
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,075
My face…

415
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,578
Not my face…

416
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,080
No…

417
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,003
My face…

418
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,613
Please wake up!

419
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,784
Su-yeong…

420
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,954
Su-yeong!
