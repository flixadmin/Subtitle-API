1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,590
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,729
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:25,484
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,118
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,163
You opened your lab
after Nora Allen's murder.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,541
What were you doing in Central City
before that?

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,835
And here I thought we were just two guys
having a friendly drink.

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,215
- What?
- I just noticed you don't smile too much.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,385
The explosion that put you in a coma
also killed my fiancé.

15
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,844
Ronnie!

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,056
- He was a hero.
- I didn't want him to be a hero.

17
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,642
I wanted him to be my husband.

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,811
Don't look for me again.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,983
Everyone has a hero.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,193
Someone they look up to or admire.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,404
Someone they just wish they could be.

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,616
It's easy to believe in heroes.

23
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,452
What's hard is when our heroes
stop believing in us.

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,539
Oh, Barry, there's an intersection
coming up. Hurry.

25
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,291
This should slow them down.

26
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,757
Guys, which way?

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,177
- Left. Right.
- Right. Left.

28
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,097
You both hear you're telling me
two different things, right?

29
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,267
Barry, listen up. Listen carefully.
Here's what you're going to do.

30
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,313
Now, Queen is trying to make it
to the bridge, but I have a shortcut.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,357
And left. Left. Right.

32
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,568
- I see her.
- Make her go west before Fremont.

33
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,528
- Okay, how?
- I recommend a detour.

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,908
The King is headed for the interstate.

35
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,580
What entrance?

36
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,873
Attaboy.

37
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,712
Check...

38
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,882
Got the keys!

39
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,634
Mate.

40
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,972
- Give me some. Ha, ha.
- Yo.

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,934
- Efficiently done, Mr. Allen.
- We need a picture.

42
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,979
I'm pretty sure rule number one
of having a secret identity...

43
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,982
Is not taking pictures
in your super suit without a mask on.

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,192
Oh, come on. Please?

45
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,611
This is just for us. Just
to document all this.

46
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,073
Who knows? Maybe people in the future
will wanna know how all this happened.

47
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,077
All right, if you want the future to have
the whole story, we all need to be in it.

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,580
- Let me put on some makeup.
- The future does not care about your makeup.

49
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,332
Mm-mm.

50
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,418
Big smiles.

52
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,463
Three, two, one.

53
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,840
Ha.

54
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,218
- Does that count as a selfie?
- Absolutely.

55
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,137
Sick. Damn, I look good.

56
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,390
Thanks for talking me through things
out there.

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,642
My pleasure. Well done.

58
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,687
It was bit of a rush. Feeling like a...

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,563
- A hero.
- Yep.

60
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,358
You're pretty good at it.

61
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,365
- Hey.
- Hey.

62
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,286
You do realize the whole point of moving
out is not being at home anymore, right?

63
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,496
Ha-ha-ha.

64
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,665
I forgot a few things.

65
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,251
So how is it living back in the house?

66
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,461
- Hey, Bar.
- Yo.

67
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,004
Babe.

68
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,966
Spaghetti a la me.
You sure you don't wanna stay for dinner?

69
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,011
Thanks, but Eddie is painting all day,
and I swore that I would help.

70
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,473
Although I'm really just gonna do that
thing where I get paint on my hair and nose.

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,228
Ha, ha. Oh, hey, someone from Central City
Picture News called you the other day.

72
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,064
- I left the number on the fridge.
- Why didn't you tell me?

73
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,315
Chill. I just did.

74
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,822
Hey, I heard that some members of
the Royal Flush Gang are headed to prison.

75
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,658
- Aah!
- Is that a good scream or bad scream?

76
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,493
Good. So good.

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,914
I just got offered a job as a reporter
at Central City Picture News.

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,041
- Awesome.
- The editor's a fan of my blog.

79
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,044
- That is amazing.
- Oh, my God.

80
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,005
Oh, God.

81
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,029
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,428
Harrison Wells.

83
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,060
Hello?

84
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,771
We both know what you did.

85
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,244
It's time to pay the piper.

86
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,104
Come in.

87
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,985
Look, Joe. I apologize for all of this.

88
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,821
It really feels like a case of so much
for so little.

89
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,906
The police should not have been called.

90
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,784
I got a prank call
before all this happened.

91
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,829
This feels like more than just a prank,
doctor.

92
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,666
Well, there are those who feel
I did not suffer enough...

93
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,503
for the particle-accelerator explosion
last year, and some of them act on it.

94
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,842
Dr. Wells. Dr. Wells, are you okay?

95
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,510
Dr. Snow, I'm fine.

96
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,263
A little chilly. Otherwise, I'm fine.
Hello, Cisco.

97
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,475
Make yourselves at home as best you can.
I'm gonna make a hotel reservation.

98
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,356
- This place is so sick.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,233
Hey, what took you guys so long?

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,986
- We got lost.
- We've never been here before.

101
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,990
- Really, never?
- He tends to keep his private life private.

102
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,460
A precipice in front and wolves behind.

103
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,171
In other words, you're between a rock
and a hard place.

104
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,547
Check.

105
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,092
The king is dead.

106
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,764
Checkmate.

107
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,228
Dr. Wells?

108
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,647
There he is.

109
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:23,568
Hartley, allow me to introduce you
to Cisco Ramon.

110
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,489
Mr. Ramon here is one of the finest
mechanical engineers I have ever seen.

111
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,952
Wow, I can't believe Harrison
Wells said that about me.

112
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,718
He should prove to be an invaluable member
of your team, trust me.

113
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,247
You I trust.

114
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,168
I don't foresee myself trusting someone
who showed up to his first day of work...

115
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,171
in a billion-dollar research facility
wearing a T-shirt...

116
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,509
that says "Keep
calm and Han shot first."

117
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,762
Huh. Would you give us a minute, Cisco?

118
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,098
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,271
I realize you don't have to explain
your hiring decisions to me...

120
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,234
but maybe for the sake of a fun
exercise, we could pretend you did.

121
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,736
I have a good feeling about him.

122
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
Just as I did about you.

123
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,074
Oh.

124
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,492
Hartley.

125
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,746
You're still my guy.

126
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,667
Nothing and no one
is ever gonna change that.

127
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,881
I canvassed the street.

128
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,092
No other reports of vandalism.

129
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,636
No strange cars.

130
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,807
Get this, Wells says he's right there
when it happened.

131
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,518
All that glass shattering down around him.

132
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,022
- He can't walk.
- And he didn't have a scratch on him.

133
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,671
There's no point of impact.

134
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,257
No rock or bat...

135
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,718
or any solid object went through
these windows.

136
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,929
It's as if they just shattered themselves.

137
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,434
This wasn't some teenage prank?

138
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,353
No, it wasn't.

139
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,482
But you don't want our help.

140
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,025
Why?

141
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,321
Because I already know who did this.

142
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,239
Hartley Rathaway.

143
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,326
Who is Hartley Rathaway?

144
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,080
Hartley Rathaway is the prodigal son.

145
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,624
And he has returned.

146
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,965
Rathaway possesses one of the finest
scientific minds I've ever encountered.

147
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,051
Any ties to Rathaway Industries?

148
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,845
His grandfather founded it,
his father expanded it.

149
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,972
Hartley was set to inherit the throne.

150
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,350
- What happened?
- He came out to his parents.

151
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,768
Old money, old values.

152
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,230
They were estranged when we met
but brilliant.

153
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,398
I couldn't have built the accelerator
without him.

154
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,818
You guys have never even mentioned
his name.

155
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,655
That's because Hartley
had a challenging personality.

156
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,491
What she means is he was mostly a jerk.

157
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,244
But every once in a while...

158
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,703
he could be a dick.

159
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,167
Let's just say that Hartley, like many
outliers, had trouble relating to his peers.

160
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,255
- Yes, but he was always your favorite.
- The chosen one.

161
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,674
He referred to himself like that.

162
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,052
So if you two were so close,
why would he target you?

163
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,391
Hartley left S.T.A.R. Labs about a year ago
after we had...

164
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,725
a disagreement.

165
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,477
About what?

166
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,399
Look, don't worry. We'll stop him.

167
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,401
I won't let him hurt you, any of you.

168
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,112
Let's get back to my lab.

169
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,122
I could have gone my whole life
without seeing that jerk again.

170
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,421
- Yo, this place is so dope.
- What a coincidence.

171
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,425
We were thinking of making
"Yo, this place is so dope" our new slogan.

172
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,386
If you're so convinced
Dr. Wells made a mistake hiring me...

173
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,430
why don't you try proving it to him?

174
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,142
Magnetic flux is measured by what?

175
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,186
Hall-effect pickup.

176
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,563
The dual of a parallel RC circuit?

177
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,192
Series RL circuit. I can go all day, pal.

178
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,613
Hartley, it looks like you have met
your match.

179
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,867
- I am Dr. Caitlin Snow. It's nice to meet you.
- Cisco Ramon. Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,037
And just ignore Hartley. We all do.

181
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,998
Tell your boyfriend I need the specs
on the synchrotron by end of day.

182
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,960
Actually, it is the end of Ronnie's day.
We are leaving early.

183
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,006
My boyfriend is taking me out of town
for our one-year anniversary.

184
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,218
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Thanks. I'll see you guys on Monday.

185
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,594
See you.

186
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,765
She seems nice.

187
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,392
You don't.

188
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,019
I give you a week.

189
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,854
Max.

190
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,619
Hi. I'm Iris West.

191
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,080
- It's my first day.
- I can see that.

192
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,998
Really, does it show?

193
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,167
The fact I've never seen you before shows.

194
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,755
Mr. Bridge, nice of you to make
an appearance at a staff meeting.

195
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,007
I do love a good shmear.

196
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,594
- Everyone, welcome Iris West, our new cub.
- Hi.

197
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,721
Anyone wanna volunteer
to be her mama bear?

198
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,852
- Mason, you pick a bad day to show up.
- I don't nanny.

199
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,564
I lost the ability to make a
joke back in '05. Today you do.

200
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,944
Deadlines. All new stories are due
on my desk at the end of the day.

201
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,029
Oh, actually, I had an idea for a piece.

202
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,367
There's this program in Keystone that helps
battered women get back on their feet.

203
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,203
Ah. That sounds really great, West.

204
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,831
Actually, any thoughts on a piece
about the Flash?

205
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,750
Something you haven't written about yet?
Something new?

206
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,878
Um...

207
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,631
No, not currently.

208
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,552
All right. Sally forth,
everyone, sally forth.

209
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,557
Everything has a natural frequency.
Since sound is expressed as a vibration...

210
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,728
if the pitch of the sound matches the natural
vibration frequency of an object, then...

211
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,445
So you're saying that can
happen to anything, not just glass?

212
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,031
Oh, yeah.
I think that's absolutely what happened...

213
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,243
to the window at Wells' house.
He's using some kind of sonic technology.

214
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,665
I'm getting this feeling that Wells
is hiding something.

215
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,168
About what's going on
with this Rathaway character.

216
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,627
Don't touch that.

217
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,924
I mean, it sounds like this Hartley guy was
a pill before he went all super villain.

218
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,177
So I get why he never mentioned him.

219
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,347
Like he never mentions his girlfriend
that got killed.

220
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,723
No.

221
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,725
How do you know about her?

222
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,769
He's taken up a big part of our lives.

223
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,437
I wanted to know more about him.

224
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,607
Well, if you wanna know more about him,
you could just ask me.

225
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,777
Sounds like you don't know him
as well as you think.

226
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,615
Joe, multiple 911 calls.

227
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,492
Rathaway Industries is under attack.

228
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,952
Sector cars are en route.

229
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,290
- Hey.
- Barry, it's Caitlin.

230
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,043
I think I know why you're calling.

231
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,186
Get down, on the ground.

232
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,902
It's over, Rathaway.

233
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,029
You know my name.

234
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,531
I know some names too.

235
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,866
Caitlin Snow.

236
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,660
Cisco Ramon.

237
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,620
Harrison Wells.

238
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,957
I can hear their radio waves emanating
from your suit.

239
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,252
About 1900 megahertz.
Is that them on the other end listening?

240
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,462
Are they gonna hear you die?

241
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,258
No. They're gonna hear you
get your ass kicked.

242
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,759
Okay.

243
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,319
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says.

244
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,281
Smart enough to have figured out
who Wells really is.

245
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,367
You see, I know his secret.

246
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,879
Being scooped up by a guy clad in head-to-toe
leather is a longtime fantasy of mine.

247
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,922
So thanks.

248
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,259
Well, well, the gang's all here.

249
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,636
You've lasted a lot longer
than I'd have thought, Cisco.

250
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,889
And you didn't last 10 seconds
against the Flash.

251
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,225
- I was thinking of calling myself Pied Piper.
- Hey.

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,479
I assign the nicknames around here.

253
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,063
Although that one's not bad.

254
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,735
Caitlin, never did get that wedding invite.

255
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,446
- Shut the hell up.
- Stay in front of me.

256
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,209
Scanner's detecting foreign metallic
objects in your ears. Take them out.

257
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,295
I can't. I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

258
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:48,090
My hearing was severely damaged. Without
these, I'm in pain you can't imagine.

259
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,511
We all lost something that night.

260
00:16:54,805 --> 00:17:00,019
Heh. Very clever, repurposing the
antiproton cavities into confinement cells.

261
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,897
- Wells' idea, I'm sure.
- It was mine, actually.

262
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,117
Hartley, don't make this more difficult
than it has to be.

263
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,124
Enough, Hartley.

264
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,546
Give us a minute.

265
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,218
- See you soon, Cisco.
- Doubt it.

266
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,689
God, I wish I had taken a language
in school.

267
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,692
How did you know
we were working with the Flash?

268
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,610
I wrote a hexagonal algorithm...

269
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,406
tracking all of his sightings,
extrapolating a theoretical exit trajectory.

270
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,950
In other words...

271
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,037
every time he ran from the scene of the
crime, he ran in this general direction.

272
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,040
You are brilliant.

273
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,712
And any anguish you have been through...

274
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,381
because of me was never my intent.

275
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,676
Not bad.

276
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,846
As far as heartfelt apologies go.

277
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,349
Except that wasn't for my benefit.

278
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,269
That was for you, Flash.

279
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,939
It feels good to have the great
Harrison Wells behind you, doesn't it?

280
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,608
But one day...

281
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,277
this man will turn on you...

282
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,405
in a flash.

283
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,240
And even you won't see it coming.

284
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,493
My only hope is that he leaves you
in better shape than he left me.

285
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,454
If you're lucky, you'll only be dead.

286
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,417
Because every day,
I have to live with the agonizing...

287
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,170
piercing screaming in my ears.

288
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,552
Heh. I almost forgot. I told your pet I
know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.

289
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,931
Have fun letting him in on that one.

290
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,188
I assume you were all listening.

291
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,400
Hartley was telling the truth.

292
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,780
I have not been honest with you.

293
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,198
With any of you.

294
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,414
The accelerator.

295
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,253
Hartley warned me that there was indeed a
chance that the accelerator could explode.

296
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,802
His data did not show
100 percent certainty.

297
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,388
Just that there was a risk
but it was a real risk...

298
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,765
and yet I made the decision...

299
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,686
that the reward...

300
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,978
that...

301
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,357
everything we could learn...

302
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:55,653
that everything we could achieve,
that all of that...

303
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,660
simply outweighed that risk.

304
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,286
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:13,045
The next time you choose to put our lives
and the lives of the people that we love...

306
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,380
atrisk...

307
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,466
we'll expect a heads-up.

308
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,189
After the explosion,
when everyone else left you...

309
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,485
Caitlin and Cisco stood by you.

310
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,990
You owe them more than an apology.

311
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,326
They might seem to get more than that
with Hartley so intent...

312
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,162
on sending me to the next world.

313
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,705
What...?

314
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,583
That wouldn't make it right with them.

315
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,006
You broke their trust, our trust.

316
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh. Hi, chief. Is that
what people call you?

317
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,651
Uh, no. Not really.

318
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,739
Listen, eyewitnesses say that the Flash
thwarted an attack downtown today.

319
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,991
- Look into it.
- Uh, yeah, sure.

320
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,201
Great.

321
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,204
- Mason, you're looking rumpled today.
- Mm-hm.

322
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,875
So, what are we working on?

323
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,545
I am following up on a lead
on corruption at the DWP.

324
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:41,383
You, I think you just got your assignment
from Larkin, didn't you?

325
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,844
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

326
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,265
I know that Larkin hired me because he thinks
that I have some sort of in with the Flash.

327
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,101
- But I am serious about being a journalist.
- Why?

328
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
Because you write a blog?

329
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,688
My mother writes a blog.

330
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,193
I may not have a lot of experience,
but I do have...

331
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,402
Spunk.

332
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,196
Grit.

333
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,156
Gumption.

334
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,575
What is this, a chick-lit novel?

335
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:18,170
No, no, no. I am having the worst day ever.

336
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,340
We both can't be having
the worst day ever, okay?

337
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,260
I was really looking forward
to getting some complaining in.

338
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,220
Well, fire away.

339
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,390
Okay, well, turns out
that the real reason they hired me...

340
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,602
ils because they think I have some sort
of connection to the Flash, which I don't.

341
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,563
Not anymore.

342
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:40,317
And I've been teamed up with Mason Bridge,
who is a legend, who I admired...

343
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,947
before he told me I was a worthless,
talentless millennial.

344
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,122
Well, the people we admire
aren't always who we'd like them to be.

345
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,041
Well said.

346
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,712
So I'm screwed.

347
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,464
No. Look.

348
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,594
If this Mason guy doesn't see
what a talented journalist you are...

349
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,721
then he's probably a lousy writer.

350
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,473
He won the Pulitzer. Twice.

351
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,392
I think.

352
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,477
Oh. Good for him.

353
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,399
Thanks, Barry.

354
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,778
Having someone
believe in me, it's a small...

355
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,698
really, really big thing.

356
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,835
Where's Dr. Wells?

358
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,545
I'm not sure.

359
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,297
Barry was right.

360
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,090
Hartley was using sonic resonance.

361
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,552
The intensity regulator's measuring
decibels. But you know what's weird?

362
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,512
He had it set to the lowest setting.

363
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,097
What do you mean?

364
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:57,019
Well, he could've completely destroyed his
father's building if he wanted to in one blast.

365
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,021
So why not just do it and leave?

366
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,024
I mean, why stick around
and run the risk of getting caught?

367
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,861
Unless he wanted to be caught.

368
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,372
Dr. Wells, there's been a pipeline breach.

369
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,624
Hartley.

370
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,543
Stay here.

371
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,724
Not now.

372
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,640
Cisco, can you hear me?

373
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,519
- Hey, what's up?
- Hartley escaped. He's loose in the facility.

374
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,563
Okay.

375
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,943
Okay, your turn.
Why are you having the worst day?

376
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,496
Tell me, Harrison.

377
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,457
Am I still your guy?

378
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,462
Hey, are you okay?

379
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,715
Yeah. Cisco and Dr. Wells.

380
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,054
He's gone.

381
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,477
Hey.

382
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,437
Welcome back, Mr. Ramon.

383
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,232
Oh.

384
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,609
Oh, man.

385
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,570
- Caitlin.
- Hey, she's fine.

386
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,198
You need to rest. You have a concussion.

387
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,866
You're lucky.

388
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,535
Please tell me you got him.

389
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,581
I guess the attack on his family's company
was a fake-out so we'd catch him.

390
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,750
Give him direct access to S.T.A.R. Labs.

391
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,419
- But why?
- Should've know he was up to something.

392
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,839
- This is my fault.
- Hey, man, this is on me too.

393
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,884
- I shouldn't have left before...
- This is no one's fault but mine.

394
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,554
I earned the blame.
I'm not interested in sharing it.

395
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,099
Hartley doesn't think
I've paid for my crimes.

396
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,228
He's right. He won't stop until I do.

397
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,481
Where are you going?

398
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,151
To earn back your trust.

399
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:42,077
Hmm. Now, what were you doing
in my accelerator?

400
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,081
I thought it was our accelerator.

401
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,295
Because it will be our fault if we turn this
thing on and blow a hole in Central City.

402
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,261
You are wagering the lives of everyone
in this building. Everyone in this city.

403
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:03,765
If you don't have the courage to admit
you could be wrong, I will do it for you.

404
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,602
Hartley Rathaway.

405
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,273
Your position at S.T.A.R.
Labs is terminated.

406
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,233
If you think you can shut me up...

407
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,152
Oh, I know I can, Hartley.

408
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,156
Because if you breathe one word of any kind
of unsubstantiated accusation...

409
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:24,161
I'll make sure the only job you get in
physics is teaching it to high school juniors.

410
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,263
What is going on here?

411
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,058
Press conference.

412
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,689
Thank you for coming on short notice.

413
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,359
And for those of you
that read the 10-volume report...

414
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,488
issued by the Norris Commission,
well, I commend you on your tenacity.

415
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:05,327
You already know, then, the
circumstances that led to the explosion...

416
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,621
of the S.T.A.R. Labs
particle accelerator.

417
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,916
Or rather, you think you do.

418
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:15,003
Now, the commission's finding
was that the catastrophe...

419
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,339
was caused by a chain of events...

420
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,426
that nobody could have predicted,
including myself.

421
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,974
The truth is, I was warned there was a
chance the particle accelerator might fail.

422
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,477
I was warned by a
former colleague. A friend.

423
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:35,649
I chose to ignore the warning,
and in so doing...

424
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,901
I let down all of you.

425
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,822
As a new friend pointed out...

426
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,159
I failed this city.

427
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,163
I failed this city,
and I failed those who trusted me the most.

428
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,167
But coming forward today...

429
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,840
It's my hope I'm taking the first step
toward regaining that trust.

430
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,677
And your trust as well.

431
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,973
- Are there any questions?
- Mr. Wells...

432
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,601
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding the particle accelerator?

433
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,856
Ms. West.

434
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,899
Do you have a question for me?

435
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,156
I don't believe you answered my colleague's
question, Dr. Wells, so I'll ask it again.

436
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:28,827
Do you have any intention of rebuilding the
particle accelerator, either now or in the future?

437
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,333
Of course not.

438
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,585
Thank you for your answer, doctor.

439
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,754
- It's my pleasure.
- Dr. Wells. Dr. Wells.

440
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,339
No further questions.

441
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,800
Hey.

442
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,844
What was that?

443
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,221
Gumption.

444
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,642
- Hartley made contact yet?
- What makes you so sure he will?

445
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,771
Because he's Hartley,
and he'll wanna have the last word.

446
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,272
Cisco, you should be resting.

447
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,693
The answer to why Hartley fooled us into
catching him is in here, and I'm gonna find it.

448
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,996
You have nothing to prove.

449
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,289
Not true.

450
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,835
Do you know why I hired you, Cisco?

451
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,215
You said you saw something in me. I know.

452
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,883
What I saw was humanity.

453
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,222
You and Hartley, Cisco, you're
both brilliant. You both have mental...

454
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,477
sparks, but his brilliance subtracted
from the experience of working here...

455
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,314
whereas your brilliance, your heart...

456
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:43,819
your warmth, your
humor, it just adds to it.

457
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,284
There's no chosen one, Cisco.

458
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,830
There's no second or third favorite.
Never was.

459
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,581
It's just us.

460
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,005
What's that?

461
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,050
Nice gambit, Harrison, but this isn't over.

462
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,846
Hartley, what do you want? What do you
want? I already gave my mea culpa today.

463
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,848
The city already hated you.

464
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,185
You don't think I noticed that press
conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?

465
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,648
No, no, no, I've played with you too
many times to let you get away with that.

466
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,694
This is between you, me and the Flash.

467
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,780
You don't wanna play for those
kind of stakes with me, Hartley.

468
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,032
Actually, I really do.

469
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,451
What do you say?

470
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,035
One last game of chess?

471
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:38,415
You and I both know that the winner of the game
is the one who makes the next to last mistake...

472
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,041
and you have a move in mind.

473
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,378
You're right, and I'm already at the board.

474
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,840
So why don't you move
your precious scarlet knight...

475
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,389
while I take out a few pawns?

476
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,237
- All right. All right, Cisco, where do I go?
- I can't trace his signal.

477
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,364
He could be sending messages
from anywhere.

478
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,533
Cisco, scan for seismic activity.

479
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,536
If Hartley's using sonic blasts,
the vibrations could cause tremors.

480
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,055
Look, over here.
Quake activity but no fault line.

481
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,474
I think he's on Cleveland Dam.

482
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,269
Barry. Don't underestimate him.
He's brilliant.

483
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,022
Well, good thing I'll have you in here.

484
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,656
Rook to Knight 4.

485
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,927
You need to disarm
Hartley immediately. Do you hear me?

486
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,637
He is a master of distraction.

487
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,806
He is a master of hiding his true endgame.

488
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,651
Aha.

489
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,238
- Uh-oh.
- "Aha" what?

490
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,408
I figured out what Hartley stole,
why he let himself get caught.

491
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,829
- Which brings us to the "uh-oh."
- He has all the data on Barry's molecular scans.

492
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,082
- Why would he want that?
- He can get Barry's frequency.

493
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,127
Barry, you need to get out of there.
Get out immediately.

494
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,303
It's over!

495
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,388
You lose.

496
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,681
Amazing.

497
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:03,059
He replaced me with you, a total moron.

498
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,895
I got you with the same trick twice.

499
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,946
I got the idea
watching you and Harrison chit-chat.

500
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,199
To use your suit's own
speakers to kill you.

501
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,827
That feeling?

502
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,371
That's your organs shearing apart.

503
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,459
And you activated the frequency
when you disarmed me.

504
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,462
In chess, we call that a discovered attack.

505
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,922
You don't see it until it's too late.

506
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,216
Right, Harrison?

507
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,763
Barry's vitals are bottoming out.
We need to do something.

508
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,181
What are you doing?

509
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,601
Barry's on the travel road of the dam
at rush hour surrounded by cars.

510
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,020
Those cars are gonna have satellite radio.

511
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,981
Satellite sends a signal,
song comes out the speaker...

512
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,609
I know how satellite radio works.
How does that help?

513
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,153
I'll have a satellite send something
other than a song.

514
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:58,406
Hartley is about to hear something
he was not expecting.

515
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,744
A sound wave that'll meet the frequency of
and destroy his weapons.

516
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,625
You don't seem so special anymore.

517
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:14,673
Given how easy it was to bring you down,
I wonder if Harrison will even miss you.

518
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,436
No, no, no.

519
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,121
Checkmate.

520
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,002
Barry, can you hear me?

521
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,587
Sort of.

522
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,349
- Okay.
- How do you feel?

523
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,311
Fine. There is a little ringing in my
ears. But other than that, I'm good, so...

524
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,731
You're speaking very loudly.

525
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,025
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It'll pass.

526
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,778
Nice moves.

527
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,239
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

528
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,576
I think I'm gonna take my doctor's advice
and go lie down.

529
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,454
- What a great idea.
- Heh.

530
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,582
Man, I feel like I'm hungover times 10.

531
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,834
Not surprised.

532
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,381
It's difficult for me...

533
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,634
to admit when I'm wrong.

534
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,931
Certainly in front of an entire city,
but also...

535
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,853
Also to my closest friends.

536
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,649
So I hope one day...

537
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,154
to restore your trust and faith in me.

538
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,616
That day was today.

539
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,702
Yeah.

540
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,712
Not every hero wears a mask.

541
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,800
Some heroes save the day
in the simplest of ways...

542
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,635
by just being there for us.

543
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,139
Or letting us know we're believed in.

544
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,060
If I'm any sort of hero today,
it's not because of my speed.

545
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,064
It's because I learned how
from the people in my life.

546
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,608
All of them.

547
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,739
Hey.

548
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,491
Hey.

549
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,411
Man, that press conference today
was something else.

550
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,541
Dr. Wells. Took a lot of guts to do that.

551
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,959
I have to give him that.

552
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,711
He has his moments.

553
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,713
What's up?

554
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,384
- Must have been hard for you.
- What, to be this handsome?

555
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:06,970
Raising me.

556
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,264
Oh. No.

557
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,642
Well, a kid who loved math and chemistry.

558
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,437
Whose idea of a fun afternoon
was doing experiments in the garage.

559
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,189
- Ha, ha.
- It couldn't have been easy.

560
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:24,696
Soon as I started AP classes, you had
no clue how to help me with my homework.

561
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,406
- No.
- You must have always felt...

562
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:31,619
like you were competing
with Richard Dawkins and Neil Tyson...

563
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,914
and Henry Allen too.

564
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:39,669
But look, none of them,
no one, could ever replace you.

565
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,255
Not even Wells.

566
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,551
- Aw.
- Ha, ha.

567
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,974
- All right, I'll see you at home.
- All right.

568
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,518
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, Barry.

569
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,813
Hey. What did you find out?

570
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,775
I searched Wells' entire
house like you said.

571
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,985
There was nothing.

572
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,157
Are you sure you wanna do this,
investigate Wells?

573
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,534
Hundred percent.

574
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,263
Your evil hearing aids
won't help you escape this time.

575
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,225
So I'd get comfy.

576
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,145
You must be enjoying this, Cisco.

577
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,438
I am.

578
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,817
If that scares you, I can't imagine how
you're gonna feel when you let me out of here.

579
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:50,406
Hmm. Maybe I'm going deaf, because I could've
sworn you just said I'm gonna let you out.

580
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,742
And very soon too.

581
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,288
Why would I ever do that?

582
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,583
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

583
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,130
I know what really happened to him
that night.

584
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,009
And I know how to save him.

585
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,849
Warning. Tachyon output
has passed acceptable tolerance range.

586
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,435
Continued exposure is not recommended.

587
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,813
Increase to maximum, Gideon.

588
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,524
Increasing to maximum, doctor.

589
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,986
Speed force absorption at 35 percent
and rising.

590
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,862
I'm not stabilizing.

591
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,324
I can't hang on to my speed.
It comes and goes and I cannot control it.

592
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:38,121
Gideon, for how much longer
is the tachyonic device viable?

593
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,999
Calculations inconclusive.

594
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,419
- I'm sorry, doctor.
- Well, that's okay, Gideon.

595
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,006
This is only meant to be a temporary fix.

596
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,009
The real endgame is almost here.

597
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:59,033
