1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,001
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,771
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,321
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,450
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,445
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,682
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,081
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,651
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,764
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,486
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,642
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,443
H.R.: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,284
I'm free!

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,603
- Who are you?
- I am the future, Flash.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,683
I can't spend
the rest of my life wondering

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,285
<i>if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.</i>

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,528
I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,284
You just want
your own meta-human specialist

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,527
to try and find you a cure.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,727
That's not the only reason.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,881
I wish I could believe that.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,690
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,524
- You're into me.
- GYPSY: Even if I was...

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,727
You couldn't handle me.

25
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,881
I'm marrying that woman.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,804
- Iris West, will you marry me?
- Yes.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,002
GUARD: <i>Looks like we may need
to find a new job.</i>

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,800
Heard Stagg Industries
may be getting bought out.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,161
By Who?

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,481
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,323
All I know is,
we got millions of dollars of tech,

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,131
like whatever that thing is,

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,841
that no one's using.

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,483
Then, surely, you gentlemen won't mind
if I abscond with some of it.

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,686
This piece, in particular.

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,001
How did you get in here?

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,844
Believe me,
that's the least impressive of my tricks.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,726
Hands up, pal.
Do it now, or I'll shoot. Stop!

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,604
How the hell did he do that?

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,040
Maybe you can figure out how I did it,

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,363
but I doubt you'll have time.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,161
It's just beautiful. You know what?

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,886
- It matches the sparkle in your eyes.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,930
Barry, your grandfather
had really good taste in jewelry.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,241
- BARRY: Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,921
Okay, so break it down. How did it happen?

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,481
Um...

48
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,607
We were at the apartment,
and Barry sang to me,

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,367
and then he proposed.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,524
My God, that's so romantic! You sing?

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,806
Not as good as Joe.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
Shut up, Barry.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,481
Well, okay, that reminds me,

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,730
my sister has four tickets
that she can't use, to <i>Hamilton.</i>

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,086
- <i>Hamilton?</i>
- On the house.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,846
I thought that maybe we could make it
a double if you guys were interested.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,604
Yeah, we're interested. When?

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,761
First weekend of July.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,761
July.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,888
Yeah, does that not work for you guys?

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,206
No, that works great. We'll be there.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,761
All of us.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,567
Don't! Don't do this.
Please, I'm begging you, just...

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,761
Barry.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,610
You lose, Barry.

66
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,645
No!

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,806
Well, everything's the same.

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,929
The future has not changed.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,323
All right, well, we have two months
to make sure that it does.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,641
CAITLIN: <i>Okay, well,
we should approach this</i>

71
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,609
the same way
we approach any other problem.

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,966
Start with what we know.

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,969
Problem can't be solved
if it's not understood.

74
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,286
Therein lies the rub.

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,727
I feel like we can't understand
any of this till it actually happens,

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,245
<i>just like Savitar's prophecies.</i>

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
Precisely, and just like
the newspaper headlines.

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,210
<i>Well, all bar one.</i>

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,163
It's a crime scene. We've got to go.

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,765
- Stagg Industries?
- All right.

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,002
Julian, before you go,

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,642
there was an envelope delivered for you
from the Central City Opera.

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,970
Yes, you'd mentioned
that you'd never gone before, so...

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,886
<i>Well, I got them for us a while back,
but now...</i>

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,003
Just go with whoever you'd like.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,361
Huh.

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,686
Looks like things between you and Julian
are a little frosty, huh?

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,768
- It's too soon for the cold puns, yeah.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,921
<i>Thought so.</i>

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,049
He still doesn't trust me after I lied

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,089
about taking a piece
of the Philosopher's Stone.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,720
You did what you felt you needed to do
to get rid of your powers.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,003
I know that, and you know that, but he...

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,450
He'll come around. Watch.

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,567
I don't know that he will, Cisco.

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,203
Hey, Barr. Anything?

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,766
Nothing yet.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,328
How the hell did this thing
get filled with water

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,324
and those poor dudes get trapped in here?

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,686
Beats me.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,048
There's no water access
in the entire wing.

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,766
Instead of sprinklers,
every floor uses a halon gas system

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,207
that absorbs all the oxygen
if there's a fire.

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,120
What about the security cams?

105
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,206
None of them, either.
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses don't want

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,283
- any of their "secrets" to get out.
- Yeah.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,602
Julian, please tell me
you found something.

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,961
Nothing yet, Detective.

109
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,011
No fingerprints, no DNA,
just two rather plump-looking corpses.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,566
What about the stolen tech?

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,961
Nothing. No one's saying a thing.

112
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,849
Everyone is incredibly
tight-lipped about it.

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,081
Of course they are.

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,369
Look, I'll make some phone calls, see if
I can pry those lips open, all right?

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,891
Okay. I'll keep working on it.

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,081
This is the last thing
we need to be dealing with right now.

117
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,846
Yeah, I feel the same way,
but we can't just do nothing.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,604
Iris ain't gonna let us
get away with that.

119
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,003
I know, Joe,
but we're running out of time.

120
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,283
Yeah, that's why you and me
need to solve this case fast.

121
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,601
Yeah.

122
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,725
Sometimes, I wish you hadn't told me
what was gonna happen.

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,929
Yeah, I know.

124
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,204
Hold on. What's up?

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,643
Looks like we got a robbery in progress
over at Kord Industries.

126
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,447
Great. Thanks. Now Kord Industries.
That's two in one day.

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,846
That's two in under 12 hours.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,843
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure
it's the last one.

129
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,523
I don't think that's yours, pal.

130
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,806
Flash.

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,169
You didn't think I'd wanna come meet
the newest resident of Iron Heights?

132
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,609
No, I assumed that you'd show.
I just didn't expect you to be so young,

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,321
Barry Allen.

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,324
Now, how do you know who I am?

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,289
I'm from the future.

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,724
You don't believe me?
Let's see. 2017. Hmm.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,925
How are things going
with your doomed love, Iris West?

138
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,051
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?

139
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,091
You know Savitar.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,322
I know everything about him

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,201
and you.

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,361
What the hell?

143
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,690
Gypsy. Still seeking revenge, I see.

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,365
I'm gonna get it this time.

145
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,567
We'll see.

146
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,121
No!

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,323
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,006
CAITLIN: <i>As in "hocus pocus"?</i>

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,764
Well, he's certainly got a lot of tricks.

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,481
Yeah, we think he has some sort
of nanotechnology built into his body.

151
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,802
<i>Allows him to do some extraordinary feats.</i>

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,364
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it.
And believe me, I have seen it all.

153
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,491
So that card trick he played on Barry,
the water tank at Stagg,

154
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,291
that's all some futuristic tech
that he's masking as magic?

155
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,329
CAITLIN:
<i>Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.</i>

156
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,130
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is

157
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,561
"indistinguishable from magic."
"indistinguishable from magic."

158
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,206
Before you showed up,
he said he was from the future.

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,321
The future?

160
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,802
He is. 64th century.

161
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,687
Great. Another criminal from the future.
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?

162
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,490
Sixty-fourth century.

163
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,322
What exactly are you after him for?

164
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,760
He's at the top
of the collectors' most-wanted list.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,684
<i>Showed up on my Earth a few years back,</i>

166
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,045
did a string of robberies that ended
with a lot of people losing their lives.

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,842
Showed up again a couple weeks ago,
looted some tech companies, came here.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,128
To do the same thing? Why?

169
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,642
He must have needed
our Earth's tech for something.

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,121
Well, whatever it is,
we can definitely help you figure it out

171
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,045
'cause I don't know about you guys,
but ever since last time you were here,

172
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,000
I've been looking forward
to some Gypsy-Vibe action!

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,204
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.

174
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,841
Yeah, I just wanna catch him,

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,606
so I can bring his ass back to Earth-19
and put him down.

176
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,729
Don't worry. We can help you do that.

177
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,400
We should check and see
if Julian's gotten anything.

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,006
I'll go ask him.

179
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,286
In the meantime, we can figure out
where this guy disappeared off to.

180
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,289
- <i>Lend me a hand?</i>
- Stupid.

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,761
I know that look.

182
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,122
What is going on
inside that head of yours?

183
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,484
This guy knew what was going on
with you and me, and Savitar.

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,964
If he knows something
about Savitar, then...

185
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,128
He might be the key to saving you.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,282
This is the first real lead we've gotten.

187
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,811
But, guys, what about Gypsy?

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,571
I mean, if she gets a hold of him,
she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.

189
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,327
We can figure that out later.
Right now, we just need to find him.

190
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,761
I got nothing.

191
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,086
Why can't I find you?

192
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,402
I told you, this guy is smart.

193
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,684
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,731
Whatever he's doing,
it renders him invisible to us.

195
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,370
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him,

196
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,284
then I guess
we'll have to find him another way, right?

197
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,841
What are you doing?

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,209
I'm putting some search parameters
into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,488
to see if anybody
vibrates at a different frequency

200
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,926
than Earth-1 folk.

201
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,362
Wish we had a satellite
that could do that on my Earth.

202
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,489
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.

203
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,881
Oh.

204
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,844
I could hook you up, girl.

205
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,526
<i>How about this?</i>

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,531
I spend a few days on Earth-19.

207
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,290
I'll set you up
with something state-of-the-art.

208
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,891
You know, the only thing is,
I would need a place to crash, so...

209
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,562
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,281
That kiss,
that wasn't "I'll see you around."

211
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,408
That was like,
"That needs to happen again, real soon."

212
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,730
Or did I misread that?

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,889
I've been preoccupied.

214
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,371
Is that the only reason?

215
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,605
Great timing!

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,560
Looks like David Copperfield's
not too far from us.

217
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,603
He's at one of Mercury Labs'
satellite offices.

218
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,127
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.

219
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,288
Let's grab the speedsters and go.

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,448
Man, you just can't help yourself,
can you?

221
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,969
- You brought the whole team this time?
- Mmm-hmm.

222
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,043
ABRA KADABRA: <i>Well, that wasn't
very smart, was it?</i>

223
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,970
Oh. This guy sucks.

224
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,248
I can see
why you wanna bring him down so badly.

225
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,967
Do yourself a favor. Give it up.
There's nowhere for you to go.

226
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,970
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.

227
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,848
Really? I think I just did.

228
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,605
It's a hologram.

229
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,606
Upon further inspection, there was
some rather odd particulate residue

230
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,125
found at Stagg Industries.

231
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,971
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology
that Gypsy was talking about.

232
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,326
But what's it made out of?

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,960
Not exactly sure. It's definitely organic,

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,925
but it seems to have some sort
of metallic hydrogen properties.

235
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,167
<i>Frankly, it's...</i>

236
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,322
Beyond your understanding.

237
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,130
You make a move, you'll regret it.

238
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,051
Do you know how many times
I've heard that, Detective?

239
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,167
<i>Told you.</i>

240
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,127
Damn it.

241
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,201
Go, go, go!

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,201
Guys, move to the side.

243
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,203
Now I can get what I came for.

244
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,491
Everybody okay?

245
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,927
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.

246
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,241
Maybe not.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,924
You let me go,
I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,731
It's the key to defeating him,
the key to stopping him.

249
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,241
What secret?

250
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,722
I know who he is. I know his name.

251
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,560
Hand him over.

252
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,571
GYPSY: Why'd you lock him up?

253
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,930
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.

254
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,287
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.

255
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,320
Fine. Get what you need from him,
but when you're done, he's mine.

256
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,843
You are gonna die
for all the things you've done.

257
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,563
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.

258
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,931
I'm gonna talk to her.

259
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,491
GYPSY, darling.

260
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,528
You said you knew who Savitar is.

261
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,441
I know everything about the God of Speed.

262
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,602
Hallowed be his name.

263
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,761
Like what?

264
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,565
That he's unstoppable,

265
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,564
<i>that he was the first speedster,</i>

266
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,128
and that you defeat him,

267
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,086
but not until after he takes
what matters the most to you,

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,287
Iris West.

269
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,329
Tell us who he is, now.

270
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,645
I don't think so.

271
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,964
<i>It's frustrating, isn't it?</i>

272
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,890
Knowing that you're going to die
unless I give the Flash what he wants.

273
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,761
All that power, all that speed,
and yet you're still too slow.

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,928
This isn't a game or a trick.
This is about my daughter's life.

275
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,529
And it's my life
if you hand me over to that collector.

276
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,366
<i>It's simple.</i>

277
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,489
Let me out,
and I'll tell you who Savitar is.

278
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,406
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.

279
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,770
<i>The decision lies with you, Barry.</i>

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,441
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him
before we find out who Savitar is.

281
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,806
No, we cannot.

282
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,246
Then what are we supposed to do?

283
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,842
I don't know.

284
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,685
What is it with you and this guy?

285
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,808
It's like you're hell-bent
on taking him back with you.

286
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,247
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,925
He's killed people here, too.

288
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,406
No one you know or care about.

289
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,725
Did he take somebody from you?

290
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,170
Is that what this is about?

291
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,608
What this is about, Cisco,
is he needs to be brought to justice,

292
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,164
and I am not gonna let anything
or anyone prevent me from doing that.

293
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,687
CAITLIN: You're lucky.
This could've been a lot worse.

294
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,847
I'm fine, really.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,004
"It's merely a flesh wound,"
as the Monty Python boys would say.

296
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,289
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.

297
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,921
Of course.

298
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,401
Listen, I've been trying to find
the right time to say this,

299
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,649
and now seems to be as good a time as any.

300
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,528
I was so focused
on not hurting you as Killer Frost

301
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,049
that I forgot
that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow,

302
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,763
and, for that, I'm very sorry.

303
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,205
So I understand
if you don't trust me anymore,

304
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,649
but maybe you can find it in your heart
to forgive me?

305
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,767
You're good to go.

306
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,320
Thank you.

307
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,969
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.

308
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,611
I mean, a guy like Kadabra,

309
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,167
he should have no say
whether you live or die.

310
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,727
How do we even know
that he's telling the truth?

311
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,360
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks
since he got here.

312
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,369
I mean, maybe this is one of them.

313
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,891
It's not, Iris.

314
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,569
So, what, you wanna let him go?

315
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,921
I mean, it just feels like our only move.

316
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
He's a murderer.

317
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,768
I know he's a murderer, but, I mean,
how many murderers have we put in prison?

318
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,004
How many bad guys have we taken down?

319
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,970
I mean, don't we deserve one win
after everything that we've done?

320
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,964
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.

321
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,210
You should know that better than anyone.

322
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,684
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't shown up,

323
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,047
we'd still be in the same place
we are right now.

324
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,329
But he did, and if he knows
who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.

325
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,608
- Barry.
- Iris, he can save your life.

326
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,161
No, you can save my life.

327
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,246
Not him.

328
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,365
Trust me, I wanna find out who Savitar is
just as badly as you do,

329
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,844
but I don't wanna let someone
who has caused so much pain

330
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,840
walk free just to save my life.

331
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,811
And, you know, deep down,
I don't think you want that either.

332
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,325
I knew you'd come.

333
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,602
'Cause you're the only person
who's willing to do anything.

334
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,046
What do you want?

335
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,131
To be set free.

336
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,489
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.
You came here for something.

337
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,602
Told you before, Detective,
it is beyond your understanding.

338
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,527
This is about my daughter's life.

339
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,002
It's as simple as that for me.

340
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,523
You tell me who Savitar is,

341
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,882
and I will let you go.

342
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,403
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.

343
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,201
A leap of faith for us both, then.

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,650
Open the door.

345
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,602
If you take one step before you tell me,

346
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,809
I will blow you away.

347
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,241
Understood?

348
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
But you do not know this guy.

349
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,481
Great timing!

350
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,447
What is that?

351
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,561
No.

352
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,721
Gypsy-

353
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,886
Give me the name.

354
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,805
The name! Now!

355
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
Savitar is...

356
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,767
No! What the hell are you doing?

357
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,807
- He was about to tell me who Savitar is.
- Damn it.

358
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,281
Kadabra's on the loose.
He's somewhere in the building.

359
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,445
There we are.

360
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,528
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

361
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,971
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!

362
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,485
We had a deal.

363
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,371
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.

364
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,727
I've altered the terms of our agreement.

365
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,922
<i>It appears that you have as well.</i>

366
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,727
Move!

367
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,490
Caitlin. Caitlin, are you all right?

368
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,687
- You all right?
- Yeah.

369
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,723
- Come on.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

370
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,040
Okay. Okay, okay. Easy. Easy.

371
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,687
- Come on.
- Gentle, gentle.

372
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,002
The hand-ray X-ray machine,
grab it for us, would you, please?

374
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,161
BARRY: Yeah.

375
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,927
- Here.
- Okay, good. Remove it.

376
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,242
- How bad is it?
- JULIAN: It's bad.

377
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,641
It's bad. There's quite a few pieces
of shrapnel inside you,

378
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,370
and they look deep enough
to pierce your kidney

379
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,567
if they're not removed immediately.

380
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,405
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.

381
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,925
We can't. They're gonna ID her as a meta.

382
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,127
Yeah, and not just any meta.

383
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,044
Yeah, one that we have a file on
for attacking CCPD.

384
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,241
IRIS: <i>Then what are we going to do?</i>

385
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,487
<i>None of us are doctors,</i>

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,210
and she can't operate on herself.

387
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,971
We do have another option.

388
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,167
Well, what is it?

389
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,321
When Caitlin goes meta,

390
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,687
her metabolic rate
offsets cold-tissue destruction.

391
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,841
She can regenerate?

392
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,970
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.
I don't need a hospital.

393
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,726
All I need is a mirror
and a steady set of hands.

394
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,644
You were a field medic
in the Royal Army, right?

395
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,406
What? No, I've never operated
on anyone before.

396
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,766
That's okay. I'll walk you through it.

397
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,491
Caitlin, you're talking about staying
awake during your own surgery.

398
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,564
I'm putting my life in your hands.
I trust you, Julian.

399
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,284
What the hell were you thinking?

400
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,930
Now is not the time, Gypsy.

401
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,203
You know, you got a really
messed up sense of justice for a cop.

402
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,327
Watch yourself.
I took two oaths in my life.

403
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,450
One, to uphold the law.
The other, to protect my family.

404
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,846
Guess which one takes priority.

405
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,490
That was my prisoner.

406
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,608
He was my prisoner, too,
and you're on my Earth.

407
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,445
He has information
that can save Iris' life,

408
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,170
so I don't give a damn.

409
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,885
It's because of you he's on the loose.

410
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,408
Because of me? No, no, because of you.
You opened that door!

411
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,650
You let him out!
That is on you, Detective!

412
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,965
How much of that did you hear?

413
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,361
I heard enough.

414
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,886
This is my friend.

415
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,570
It's the man's daughter.

416
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,969
I mean, wouldn't you do that
for someone you cared about?

417
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,645
I am doing that, you idiot.

418
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,844
Okay, what does that mean?
For who? Who are you talking about?

419
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,125
I used to have a partner.

420
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,002
Like a partner, or like a "partner"?

421
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,691
Both.

422
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,611
It was a long time ago, Cisco.

423
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,604
It's not like I'm burning a candle
for the guy,

424
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,888
but he did mean something to me.

425
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,840
It's been three years
since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.

426
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,601
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,008
I have been searching for him ever since,
and he finally showed back up.

428
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,966
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights,
and then your friend messed it all up.

429
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,090
So, yes, I do know what it is like

430
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,971
to care about someone so much
that you break the rules.

431
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,124
That's why I have to find this guy,
no matter what.

432
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,250
And when I do,
he is gonna pay for what he did.

433
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,565
No more delays.

434
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,521
CAITLIN: <i>Ready?</i>

435
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,681
JULIAN: Ready as I'll ever be.

436
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,763
Okay, let's start with
the shrapnel on the surface.

437
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,331
Okie-dokie.

438
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,087
Just let me know
if I do anything wrong, okay?

439
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,850
Yeah.

440
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,689
Okay, that's the first bit. Well done.

441
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,087
Okay.

442
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,125
Is there supposed to be this much blood?

443
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,250
It's normal for the shrapnel
to cavitate and displace tissue,

444
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,562
but if I lose too much blood,
I'll start hemorrhaging.

445
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,961
Okay.

446
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,082
- IRIS: My God.
- Okay.

447
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,884
All right, nearly done. Nearly done.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

448
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,726
Okay, well done. Well done.

449
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,928
That's all the pieces of shrapnel
from the surface gone.

450
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,570
Okay, great.
Now it's time for the hard one.

451
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,721
But you're doing great.

452
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,604
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.

453
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,924
It's wedged between my kidney
and my inferior vena cava,

454
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,124
and it's surrounded
by some major blood vessels.

455
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,851
<i>If you hit them,
there's a good chance I'll go into shock.</i>

456
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,601
- Shock?
- But it's okay. You've got this.

457
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,251
Okay. All right.

458
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,207
Heart rate's increasing.

459
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,407
JULIAN: <i>Okay, I think I've got it.</i>

460
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,607
Great, pull it out.

461
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,081
I can't, Caitlin. It's stuck.

462
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,480
CAITLIN: <i>Then turn it.</i>

463
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,121
Guys, it's getting up there.

464
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,601
- It might be a tendon in the way.
- What if it's not a tendon?

465
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,649
Then I will rip this necklace off.

466
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,689
No! I would rather die.

467
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,203
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.

468
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,406
Can you please stitch me up
because I think I need to pass out.

469
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,003
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.
Well done, well done.

470
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,411
- She's gonna be all right.
- Thank God.

471
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,925
That really was amazing, Julian.

472
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,526
Seriously. Julian Albert, MD.

473
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,847
I think I know why Abra Kadabra's
been stealing all that tech.

474
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,764
- Why?
- Build a time machine.

475
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,686
He's trying to get back to the future.

476
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,966
Presto.

477
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,530
What is that thing in his hands?

478
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,890
Everything Kadabra's been stealing,
these are the exact components I used

479
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,929
to build Evil Wells' time sphere
two years ago,

480
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,082
but I could never figure out
what he used for a power source.

481
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,281
<i>I think this is it.</i>

482
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,966
So that's what he took
from the time vault, its power source?

483
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,202
Last thing he needs
to return to the 64th century.

484
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,728
Well, we need to find his ass
before he pulls another disappearing act.

485
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,764
If Kadabra's plan is to Marty McFly
himself back to the future...

486
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,889
He's gonna have
to open a temporal wormhole first.

487
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,411
- And when he does...
- We can nail him.

488
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,762
- Mmm-hmm.
- No, he's mine.

489
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,566
I look forward to showing him
the same mercy he showed my partner.

490
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,042
Hey, Gypsy, you can't go after him alone.

491
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,321
Sure, I can.

492
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,409
You want justice
for all those people that he's hurt,

493
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,005
for your partner, right?

494
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,886
Right now, we're trying to prevent
someone we love from getting hurt,

495
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,570
but we can't do that without your help.

496
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,324
I don't trust you guys anymore.

497
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,050
Kadabra's already given
both of us the slip.

498
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,440
If he does it again through time,

499
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,444
I don't think
we get this opportunity back.

500
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,083
Only way we catch him is together.

501
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,122
Guys, Abra Kadabra's
heading south on Ninth.

502
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,651
He opened up a Wormhole.

503
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,245
What do you say?

504
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,121
We can't let him get past us.

505
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,881
We're not gonna do that.

506
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,650
Catch me if you can.

507
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,171
- BARRY: <i>Where's he at?</i>
- He's on State and Main!

508
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,287
CISCO: We're on it!

509
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,291
You shall not pass!

510
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,283
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.

511
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,321
We're gonna lose him.

512
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,484
No, we're not.
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!

513
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,841
You've got to stop this guy.

514
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,964
Time to go home.

515
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,923
Barr, he opened up another wormhole.

516
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,006
Yes. He did it. He got him.

517
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,606
Thank God.

518
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,205
- So much for your disappearing act.
- No.

519
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,924
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect
you for the crime of mass murder.

520
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,561
Let her take me.

521
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,529
You'll never find out what I know,
and Iris dies.

522
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,529
You've come to see me off.

523
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,449
I'm really touched.

524
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,406
What are we gonna do here?

525
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,165
You're going with her.

526
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,485
I'm not gonna stop her.

527
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,969
Then you'll never find out
what you want to know.

528
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,483
I have nothing to offer you.

529
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,010
No reprieve,
no escape from what you're facing.

530
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,003
You've done some terrible things,

531
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,482
but you are still a man.

532
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,489
You have a family, friends,
people that you care about.

533
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,442
Somewhere inside of you,
there must be a glimmer of light,

534
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,401
of hope.

535
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,807
It's that part of you that I'm asking.

536
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,524
I'm begging.

537
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,685
Help me save her.

538
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,567
Flash.

539
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,961
Begging.

540
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,447
See, here it is. In the future,

541
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,206
you and I have been enemies for years.

542
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,448
There have been others, of course.

543
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,963
There's Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe,

544
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,524
but none of them hurt you like Savitar.

545
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,966
He truly broke you.

546
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,087
I have to be honest.
I was always a little bit jealous.

547
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,050
But now it's like I get to kill her, too.

548
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,770
If you'll excuse me,
I have my execution to attend.

549
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,005
Where does this leave us?

550
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,446
I don't know.

551
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,371
Cisco, I'm...

552
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,051
I'm still here.

553
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,041
Yeah.

554
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,882
Well, I wasn't gonna let you go that easy.

555
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,366
Kadabra?

556
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,088
He's gone. He's gone for good, apparently.

557
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,521
Sorry, my palms are sweaty.

558
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,920
It's quite all right.

559
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,643
Honestly, my stitch work may leave
quite a lot to be desired, so...

560
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,807
It's okay.

561
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,168
I was never much of a two-piece
bathing suit kind of gal anyway.

562
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,128
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.

563
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,286
I mean, staying awake
during your own surgery, that's one thing,

564
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,808
but talking my clumsy hands through it,
that's quite the other.

565
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,129
You are immensely brave.

566
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,361
You fought through the pain
like I've never seen anyone before.

567
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,170
You did all the hard work.

568
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,325
Hardly.

569
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,048
You going soft on me, Julian?

570
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,766
Yes.

571
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,521
Absolutely.

572
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,849
I'm so terribly sorry.

573
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,810
That's most clumsy of me.

574
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,929
Some bedside manner you got there.

575
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,881
I'm working on it.

576
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,120
Just rest.

577
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,001
Here you go.

578
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,488
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

579
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,881
Easy.

580
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,567
Sorry.

581
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,285
I should've been stronger.

582
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,407
You think you should've shot Kadabra?

583
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,402
<i>Dad, I think you showed true strength
by letting him go.</i>

584
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,842
I try to be strong for you guys.

585
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,567
For you, and Wally, and Barry.

586
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,850
Dad, you have been,
and it makes me stronger, too.

587
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,082
When you were a baby, I was terrified

588
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,927
that you might die
in the middle of the night.

589
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,770
I just didn't sleep.

590
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,886
I would just sit in your room

591
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,891
and watch you sleep.

592
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,691
I put my hand on your chest

593
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,969
just to make sure
you were breathing in and out.

594
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,609
I would just sit there praying that

595
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,288
you'd just keep breathing.

596
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,684
<i>That's how I feel right now.</i>

597
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,930
I don't know what I can do to save you.

598
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,891
I know how to save her.

599
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,681
What?

600
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,451
I know how to save her.

601
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,083
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne,
you know, they're...

602
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,565
They're always one step ahead of us.

603
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,289
For one reason.
They know what's gonna happen.

604
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,481
<i>So, every move we make,
every trap we try and set,</i>

605
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,130
<i>it's all just history to them.</i>

606
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,970
They're armed with the future.

607
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,011
Well, not anymore.

608
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,606
What does that mean?

609
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,451
If the answers that we need

610
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,126
to stop Savitar and save you
are in the future,

611
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,044
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

612
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,409
I'm gonna run to the future.

613
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,491
No more strawberry.

614
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,041
What do you mean,
there's no more strawberry?

615
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,571
I just bought some, like, a week ago.

616
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,805
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some/all.

617
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,961
Cisco.

618
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,050
Do you want me to go out and get you more
strawberry Jell-O? I will get you more.

619
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,201
No, it's fine.

620
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,931
But next time I operate on you,
you're getting bupkis, mister.

621
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,246
Next time you operate on me,
maybe you can fix my broken heart.

622
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,727
I'm sorry it didn't work out
with you and Gypsy.

623
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,645
If two metas from two different universes

624
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,804
with the same vibrational powers
can't make it work,

625
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,849
then what hope is there?

626
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,041
H.R.: <i>There you guys are.</i>

627
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,321
<i>I've been looking all over for...</i>

628
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,806
What are you doing in bed?

629
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,241
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.

630
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,805
Yeah, how about you tell us
where you've been?

631
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,122
Her name is Rhonda,
and she's into new positions.

632
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,369
- We had the...
- Okay. My God, stop talking.

633
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,604
You've got to let somebody know next time
you decide to go on a two-day love romp.

634
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,128
Who was worried about me?

635
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,449
He was. I'm touched.

636
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,484
You'll be touched in the face
with a hammer

637
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,926
the next time
you pull something like that.

638
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,163
Guys, stop it. Don't make me laugh,
or I'll bust my stitches.

639
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,044
Is that lime Jell-O?

640
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,571
It's all you, H.R.

641
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,160
Are you serious?

642
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,371
I love the lime.

643
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,610
I love the lime!

644
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,927
You were really worried about him,
weren't you?

645
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,922
Just promise me
that you'll never ever tell him.

646
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,762
Cross my heart and hope to...

647
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,321
Caitlin?

648
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,521
Hey.

649
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,920
Caitlin? Caitlin? Somebody help!

650
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,967
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. She just started seizing.

651
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,090
Hold her down. Hold her down!
H.R., grab her legs. Hold her down!

652
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,965
What's happening?

653
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,201
She's not breathing.

654
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,600
We have to get an ambulance
in here right now.

655
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,610
H.R., grab the crash cart.
Cisco, grab the oxygen.

656
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,166
Wheel it over here!

657
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,125
<i>Slow and steady, over her mouth.</i>

658
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,682
Okay, go. Come on, slow and steady.
That's it. That's it.

659
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,841
What's happening?

660
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,161
She may have thrown a blood clot.
I don't know.

661
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
H.R.: <i>Julian!</i>
JULIAN: <i>Charge the paddles!</i>

662
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,326
- Give me the paddles!
- Charging, you're good.

663
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,608
Okay, give it here. Give it here. Clear.

664
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,764
All the way. Turn it up to the top.
All the way up.

665
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,445
- Okay, you're ready.
- Clear!

666
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,931
Clear, clear, clear.

667
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,966
Charge... Go.

668
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,929
Go. Keep going.

669
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,168
Come on, Caitlin. Come on!

670
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,845
<i>Just keep going. Just keep going.</i>

671
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,331
Here, take this.

672
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,530
Here we go. She's coming back.

673
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,846
She's coming back.

674
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,326
<i>Yes, she is.</i>

675
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,163
Come on. Please, come on.

676
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,850
<i>Don't stop. Please!</i>

677
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,010
Please don't stop.

678
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,721
Don't...

679
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,201
She's gone.

680
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,886
- Stop! That's not what she wanted!
- I don't care!

681
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,481
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch her die, okay?

682
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,006
Okay?

683
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,087
It's all right, mate. It's okay.
It's okay.

684
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,240
Caitlin?

685
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,046
Caitlin.
