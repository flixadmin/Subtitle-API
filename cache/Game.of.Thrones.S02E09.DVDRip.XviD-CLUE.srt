to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

Yes.

00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,861
-The wildfire.
-He can only play it once.

327
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,114
We're too far from the gates.

328
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,408
The fire, their archers...

329
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,535
Hundreds will die.

330
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,246
Thousands.

331

336
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,294
Praying.

You're perfect, aren't you?

338
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,506
Praying.

339
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,176
What are you praying for?

340
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,553
For the gods to have mercy on us all.

341
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,597
Oh.

342
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,973
On all of us?

343
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,100
-Yes, Your Grace.
-Even me?

344
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,269
Of course, Your Grace.

345
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,854
Even Joffrey?

346
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,526
-Joffrey is my...
-Oh, shut up, you little fool.

347
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,696
Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.

348
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,865
The gods have no mercy.
That's why they're gods.

349
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,119
My father told me that
when he caught me praying.

350
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,040
My mother had just died, you see.

351
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,294
l didn't really understand
the concept of death, the finality of it.

352
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,547
l thought that if l prayed very, very hard,

353
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,509
the gods would return my mother to me.
l was four.

354
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,470
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

355
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,931
He believes in them,
he just doesn't like them very much.

356
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,811
One for her.

357
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,941
Here.

358
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,319
Sit.

359

Drink.

360
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,493
Not like that. Drink, girl.

361
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,082
l should have been born a man.

362
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,126
l'd rather face a thousand swords

363
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,671
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

364
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,675
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

365
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,927
lt was expected of me,

366
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,514
as it will be of you
if you ever become Joffrey's queen.

367
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,768
lf my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

368
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,855
these hens will return to their cocks

369
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,900
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

370
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,902
lifted their spirits.

371
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,821
And if the city should fall?

372
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,741
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

373
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,953
The Red Keep should hold for a time,

374
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:53,541
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

375
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,377
lf it were anyone else outside those gates,

376
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,379
l might have hoped for a private audience,

377
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,715
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

378
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,886
l'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

379
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,475
Have l shocked you, little dove?

380
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,227
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

Learn how to use it. Drink.

383

Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

384
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,746
No, you wouldn't, would you?

385
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,750
lf the city falls, these fine women

386
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,086
should be in for a bit of a rape.

387

in their bellies come the morning.

we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

they treated us differently.

Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

He was heir to Casterly Rock,

"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.

"You will be king.

"Will l be strong and fierce like my father?"

661
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,528
"Yes," said his mother.

Back to the boats!

Stand and fight!

668
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,492
Stand and fight, damn you!

No!

Father.

671
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,549
The battle is over. We have won.

MAN: (SlNGlNG) "And who are you,"
the proud lord said

673
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:16,359
"That l must bow so low?"

That Lord of Castamere
