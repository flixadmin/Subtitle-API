00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:05,880
Bast...

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,717
time is running out.

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,387
Please allow me to heal
my brother of this illness,

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,598
and I will never
question your existence again.

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,393
His heart rate is dropping
fast. Where are we?

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,811
We are finishing
a sequence now.

8
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,438
- GRIOT,
give me the controls.

9
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,897
- As you wish, Princess.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,071
What is the confidence rate?

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,823
- 25%.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
We'll have to try another way.

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,785
King T'Challa's heart rate

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,079
has fallen to 31 beats
per minute.

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,790
Princess,
you should go be by his side.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,293
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
Get out!

18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,094
What is the confidence rate?

19
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,596
- 29.1%.

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,722
Print it!

21
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,562
- Princess,
I am aware of the urgency,

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,272
but I must warn you,

23
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,232
this synthetic
Heart-Shaped Herb

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,777
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,863
I don't care! Has to work.

26
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,175
GRIOT.

27
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,301
- Yes, Princess?

28
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,720
What's my brother's
heart rate?

29
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,102
Your brother

30
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,688
is with the ancestors.

31
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,030
No.

32
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,911
{\an8}

33
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,922
{\an8}

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,842
{\an8}

35
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,635
{\an8}

36
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,263
{\an8}

37
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,400
{\an8}- Praise the ancestors.

38
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,466
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,430
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

T'Challa

00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,083
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,146
- It is an honor for me...

47
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,899
to invite her majesty,
Queen Ramonda,

48
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,401
daughter of Lumumba,

49
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,444
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of Wakanda.

50
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,626
Mr. Chairperson,

51
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,215
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

52
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,093
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

53
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,262
in Wakanda's failure

54
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,808
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

55
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,977
to tackle
international challenges,

56
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,562
to share resources,

57
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,856
and full cooperation

58
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,399
concerning vibranium.

59
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,900
{\an8}

60
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,710
{\an8}
I now give the floor

61
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,712
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

62
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,680
It has always been our policy

63
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:57,768
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

64
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,148
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

65
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,820
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

66
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,125
{\an8}

67
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,586
{\an8}

68
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,630
{\an8}

69
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,089
{\an8}

70
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,114
You perform civility here.

71
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,201
But we know what you whisper

72
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,578
in your halls of leadership

73
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
and in your
military facilities.

74
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,672
"The King is dead.

75
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,426
"The Black Panther is gone.

76
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,598
"They have lost
their protector.

77
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,732
- "Now is our time...

78
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,360
"to strike."

79
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,431
Aneka, where is your spear?

80
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,016
Shuri gave me these to try.

81
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,645
You know, I like them better.

82
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,397
- Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

83
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,150
because it is precise,
elegant...

84
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,861
and deadly.

85
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,158
It will not change
under my watch.

86
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,536
Yes, General.

87
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,955
I told you not to bring them.

88
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,960
Last night
there was another attack

89
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,546
on one of
our outreach facilities.

90
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,301
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

91
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:39,388
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

92
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,392
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

93
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,073
{\an8}

94
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,370
{\an8}

95
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,624
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

96
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,126
be an olive branch.

97
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,090
Further attempts
on our resources

98
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,468
will be considered
an act of aggression

99
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,180
and met with
a much steeper response.

100
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,351
We mourn the loss of our king.

101
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,771
But do not think for a second

102
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,148
that Wakanda
has lost her ability

103
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,776
to protect our resources.

104
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,072
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

105
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,325
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda,

106
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,663
and wish you the best of luck.

107
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,545
{\an8}-
This is Rotor 625

108
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,921
{\an8}requesting clearance to land.

109
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,218
DR.- All right.
Meet you down there.

110
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,302
Yeah.

111
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,848
Hey!

112
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,016
I thought you retired!

113
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,226
I thought I had too.

114
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,520
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

115
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,771
of finding vibranium.

116
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,939
Oh, less than that.

117
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,920
Here we go.

118
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,006
Cabin pressure is stable

119
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,924
at negative one P-S-I.

120
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,890
At 800 feet,

121
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,017
passing through thermocline.

122
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,727
All my life supports
in the green.

123
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,938
Copy you.

124
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,657
- We've touched down.

125
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,125
DR.-
Perfect. So, Salazar,

126
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,835
you are near the site
right there.

127
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,214
- Yeah,
it's astonishing.

128
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,550
The drill
seemed to make contact

129
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,010
with a metallic substance.

130
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,305
- Whatever it is,
it's solid.

131
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,682
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

132
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,312
- I'll be.

133
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,523
Vibranium in the ocean.

134
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,566
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

135
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,401
since it's the only one
we've got.

136
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,863
- Heading towards
the vibranium detector.

137
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,960
Okay, Salazar,
we just went dark.

138
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,254
- Yeah.
The rig lost power.

139
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,047
Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.

140
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,648
- What the hell was that?

141
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,288
- Jackson,

142
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,206
tell me you're seeing this?

143
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,458
DR.- Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.

144
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,669
Hey, uh, Salazar,
can you give me a visual?

145
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,798
It's a phantom jellyfish.

146
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,508
I've never seen one
this color.

147
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,594
Emergency dive team, stand by.

148
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,763
Salazar, uh,
we just lost Jackson's vitals.

149
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,973
Can you see him?

150
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,608
No. He's gone.

151
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,693
Can you clarify? What do
you mean by, "He's gone"?

152
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,946
Salazar, do you copy?

153
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,824
-Salazar?

154
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,246
- Smitty,
we got a situation out here.

155
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,259
What's that sound?

156
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,386
West, you got a visual
on what's making that sound?

157
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,394
West, how copy, over?

158
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,149
West, you got a visual?

159
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,670
- It's some kind
of sonic attack.

160
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,421
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

161
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,763
We are under attack.

162
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,723
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

163
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,935
Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is Rotor 625.

164
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,395
We are requesting
assistance immediately.

165
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,771
It's the Wakandans.

166
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,983
It has to be.

167
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,625
Henderson.

168
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,043
Smitty, we gotta go.

169
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,128
Henderson!

170
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
Let's go.

171
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,883
What's going on?

172
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,677
Get off the edge.

173
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,361
{\an8}

174
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,383
Go, go, go, go!

175
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,600
Now! Go!

176
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,727
Spin! Spin them off!

177
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,229
Okay. They're gone!

178
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,440
-Oh, my God!

179
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,085
DR.- Just get us out.

180
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,628
- We're good.

181
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,046
-We're good.

182
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,255
Where is the strike team?

183
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,633
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

184
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,801
Everyone is dead...

185
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,429
Shit. What is going on?

186
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,348
- We're getting
pulled backwards.

187
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,934
Oh, my God.

188
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,857
-Oh, God! Hang on!

189
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,727
- Queen Ramonda
of the nation of Wakanda

190
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,938
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,

191
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,481
while members of her military

192
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,233
escorted
captive mercenaries

193
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,776
onto the floor of the UN.

194
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,695
A year has passed
since Queen Ramonda

195
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,822
was reinstated
as ruler of Wakanda

196
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,407
after King T'Challa's
sudden death

197
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,450
from an undisclosed illness
last year.

198
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,786
All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,

199
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,455
as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...

200
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,999
{\an8}

201
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,710
Approaching the river border.

202
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,718
We are home.

203
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,977
- Princess.

204
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,103
Just a moment.

205
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,521
I'm in the middle
of something.

206
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,232
- I understand,
Princess, however...

207
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,025
You're disrupting
my train of thought.

208
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,446
- Shuri.

209
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,989
Mother.

210
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,157
- I was trying
to tell you.

211
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
The Queen is here.

212
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,453
-Thank you.
-That thing unnerves me.

213
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,788
I think that one day

214
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,165
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

215
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,085
My AI isn't like the movies,
Mother.

216
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,878
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

217
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,547
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

218
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,468
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

219
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,681
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

220
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,474
There could be any number of

221
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,226
unknown threats
on the horizon,

222
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,978
and they're
creating solutions.

223
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,022
- Oh, what is this?

224
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,816
Exo Suits for our army.

225
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,402
It grants the user
super-human strength,

226
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,654
speed, and durability.

227
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,156
But, as always,
Okoye had notes.

228
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,491
What were her notes?

229
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,951
She hates them.

230
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,035
Oh.

231
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,667
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,961
Have you made
any progress on that?

233
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,254
- Excuse me, Princess.

234
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,549
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

235
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,633
Maybe you should...

236
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

237
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,720
as I instructed.

238
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
- As you wish, Princess.

239
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,349
We do not need the Herb,
Mother.

240
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,394
We need new technology.

241
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,729
What of the Black Panther?

242
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,610
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

243
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,863
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

244
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,449
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the Herb,

245
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,701
I was trying
to save my brother.

246
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
- Oh, Shuri.

247
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,678
Do you know what day it is?

248
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,763
Tuesday.

249
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,557
The date, child.

250
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,065
Brother's passing.

251
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,025
One year ago today.

252
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,244
Have you planned anything?

253
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,248
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

254
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,250
-Right now?
-Right now.

255
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,544
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

256
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,754
-Mother.
-No, no.

257
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,672
You won't need them
where we are going.

258
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,425
Hmm?

259
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,389
And the other two. Yes.

260
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,999
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

261
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,669
It is the only way
you are going to heal

262
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,088
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

263
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,464
I'm fine, Mother.

264
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,843
You don't have to worry
about me.

265
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,722
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

266
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,641
T'Challa is dead,

267
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,602
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

268
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,981
When that illness
took your brother from us,

269
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,652
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

270
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,530
But I still took time
in the bush.

271
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,950
I wandered
until I found water.

272
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,493
And I sat.

273
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,788
Then I did this ritual

274
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,332
that I am about
to show you now.

275
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,131
I found your brother
in the breeze,

276
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,802
pushing me gently, but firm.

277
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,972
Like his hand on my shoulder.

278
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,809
It took some time,

279
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
but he was there.

280
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,778
He wasn't there, Mother.

281
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,032
The presence that you felt

282
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,034
was just a construct
of your mind.

283
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,998
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

284
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,125
That's all.

285
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,878
Hmm.

286
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,885
What construct
does your mind create

287
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,012
when you think
of your brother?

288
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,932
Does it offer you comfort?

289
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,684
Or torment?

290
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,449
Come, child.

291
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,212
How did you get this?

292
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
What does it matter?

293
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,132
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

294
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,636
- Burning
of the funeral garments

295
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,055
marks the end
of the mourning period

296
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,141
and the beginning
of a new relationship

297
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,477
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

298
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm not doing this, Mother.

299
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,274
If I sit

300
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,985
and think about my brother
for too long,

301
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,281
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

302
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,075
It will be the world...

303
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,036
and everyone in it.

304
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,372
Shuri...

305
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,754
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

306
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,548
about your brother.

307
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,095
Mother, wait!

308
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,639
-What are you doing?

309
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,333
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

310
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,751
It isn't.

311
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,046
- Stop! Right there!

312
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,549
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

313
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,594
This place is amazing.

314
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,597
The air is pristine.

315
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,058
And the water...

316
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,728
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

317
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,231
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

318
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,734
That never have to change
who they were.

319
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,403
What reason do you have

320
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
to reveal your secret
to the world?

321
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,325
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

322
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,369
Who are you?

323
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,745
- I have many names.

324
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,457
My people call me
K'uk'ulkan...

325
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,087
but my enemies call me Namor.

326
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,424
The American military
detected vibranium

327
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,093
under my nation's domain.

328
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,639
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

329
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,849
but we need Wakanda's help

330
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,685
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

331
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,772
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

332
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,441
Vibranium only exists here.

333
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
In Wakanda.

334
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,486
Mother, he's covered in it.

335
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,119
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

336
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,996
In response,
other nations have begun

337
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,498
searching the planet for it.

338
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,085
His choice has compromised us.

339
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,255
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

340
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,631
and bring them to me?

341
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,386
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

342
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,013
You do not sneak
into my country

343
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,808
and tell me what is fair.

344
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,354
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

345
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,858
And they have
incomparable strength.

346
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,486
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

347
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,953
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

348
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,455
place it in the ocean.

349
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,915
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

350
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,670
For your own sake,

351
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,089
don't mention
anything about me

352
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,966
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

353
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,602
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

354
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,203
- How did he do that?

355
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,580
We must convene the Council.

356
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,209
- Heaven Scrapers
had no evidence

357
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,002
of any activity at all.

358
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,926
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

359
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,469
If my soldiers were present,

360
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,096
this "fish man"

361
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,098
would be bound before us
as we speak.

362
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,434
If your muscle brains
were present,

363
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,894
they would still be there

364
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,771
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

365
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,105
You bald-headed demon...

366
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
Show some respect, you two.

367
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,234
M'- Respect?

368
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,820
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

369
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,987
Watch your tone, Jabari!

370
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,961
- As I was saying,

371
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,922
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

372
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
And nothing
on the radar as well.

373
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,969
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

374
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,637
- He was not alone.

375
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,014
And claims to command
a massive army.

376
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:54,394
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

377
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,520
So he can kill them?

378
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,688
Do it.

379
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,775
We never had to face an enemy

380
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,610
with access
to vibranium before.

381
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,572
And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.

382
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,282
M'- That is because
this wise Council

383
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,951
allowed Killmonger
to take the throne

384
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,078
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

385
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,664
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

386
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,208
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

387
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,963
If we do
what he is asking for now,

388
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
what is to stop him
from coming back

389
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,426
and asking for more?

390
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:36,895
- As you were.

391
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:42,734
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

392
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
It's you.

393
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,779
-So, does it work?
-Yes.

394
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,364
This thing can detect

395
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,658
the altered frequency
of vibranium

396
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,953
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

397
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,830
Whoever built this
is brilliant.

398
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,582
Come, look.

399
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,835
Some are custom parts
and others look like

400
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,754
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

401
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,173
I am still struggling
to believe

402
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,217
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

403
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,637
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

404
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,513
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

405
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,681
so it's reasonable

406
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,808
that the other one
just landed there.

407
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,061
This changes everything
that we know.

408
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,689
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

409
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,275
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

410
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,235
That sounds very painful.

411
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,531
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

412
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,868
-I do have an idea.
-- Mm.

413
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,995
I'm going to need
the princess.

414
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,164
Out of the question.

415
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,458
She is in no state
to be in the field.

416
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,876
{\an8}

417
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,380
it may
do her some good to get out.

418
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,508
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

419
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,011
Besides, I can do
this American operation

420
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,179
with my eyes closed.

421
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,474
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

422
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,059
This Namor,

423
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,478
he snuck past our defenses.

424
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,563
That will never happen again.

425
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,232
He was not alone.

426
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,150
She'll be with me.

427
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,403
- So,

428
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,446
when are we leavin'

429
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,865
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

430
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,576
{\an8}

431
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,585
Can't stop

432
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,421
-Addicted to the shindig

433
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,798
Chop Top,
he says I'm gonna win big...

434
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,884
Whoa.

435
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,137
Distant cousin
to the reservation

436
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,889
Defunkt the pistol
that you pay for

437
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,308
This punk, the feeling
that you stay for...

438
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,854
Come on.

439
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,315
Yeah, I got it.

440
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,609
I got it.

441
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,113
Will you slow down?

442
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,371
You didn't think to call?

443
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
Now, why would I have
your number?

444
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,793
We are looking
for the scientist

445
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,670
who built
the vibranium detector.

446
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,380
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

447
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,091
Come on. Mining ship.

448
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,509
Lot of casualties.

449
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,219
What happened?

450
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,429
Seriously?

451
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,309
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

452
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,437
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

453
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,605
friends of mine.

454
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Gone.

455
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,274
Just like that.

456
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,734
You throw in the fact

457
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,818
that they were tracking
vibranium...

458
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,571
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

459
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,573
So who was it?

460
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,035
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

461
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,245
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

462
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,998
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

463
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,250
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

464
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,919
before anything else happens.

465
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,505
You owe me, Ross.

466
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,173
You owe my brother.

467
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,011
Okay, look.

468
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,056
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

469
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,308
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

470
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,726
And we got a new director.

471
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,770
She's watching me like a hawk.

472
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,523
We will be very, very careful.

473
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,775
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

474
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,443
The US needs another machine

475
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,112
and this kid is
the only person in the world

476
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,446
who knows how to build one.

477
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,572
So they're comin' for her.

478
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,657
A kid?

479
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,752
-Hey.
-You forgot to Venmo me.

480
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,089
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

481
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,924
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

482
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,175
It's a band today.

483
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,969
That's predatory. I...

484
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,930
I built the whole
robotic hand.

485
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,558
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

486
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,101
And what grade did you get?

487
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,567
Thanks.

488
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,737
Is that an iPhone I see?

489
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,822
- Primitive.

490
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,408
{\an8}

491
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,202
We have located the scientist.

492
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,037
She is
in the American equivalent

493
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,873
of a Wakandan village school.

494
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,166
- A school?

495
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,085
Please tell me
it is a professor.

496
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,045
It's a student, Mother.

497
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,630
We can't give her to Namor.

498
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,134
- Bring this student
back to Wakanda.

499
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,220
{\an8}

500
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,765
I've got it from here.

501
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,185
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

502
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,644
It will be more discreet.

503
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,063
I can be discreet.

504
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,818
What?

505
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,403
-Nothing.
-Is it the makeup?

506
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,487
No.

507
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,697
It's the wrong shade,
isn't it?

508
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,865
It's the right shade.

509
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,533
Fenty 440. You look good.

510
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
I can blend in as a student.

511
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,247
I can do this.

512
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,586
-You get five minutes.
-Yes!

513
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,849
- Yo!

514
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,100
Riri Williams?

515
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,064
Yo, I don't do drop-bys
no more.

516
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,232
You gotta go to the website.

517
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,610
It's an encrypted file.

518
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,945
I wanted to airdrop it.

519
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,280
You the...

520
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,824
Whew.

521
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,493
You're Princess Shuri.

522
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
What the hell
are you doing here?

523
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,456
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

524
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,251
No.

525
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,586
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

526
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,171
that you built for the CIA.

527
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,841
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

528
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,593
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

529
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,762
-A school project?
-- Yeah.

530
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,931
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

531
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,601
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

532
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,898
Y'all probably don't say that
in Wakanda.

533
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,235
How old are you?

534
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,487
Nineteen.

535
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,155
Brilliance at a young age

536
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,783
is not always accepted
by the elders.

537
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,786
How long did it take you?

538
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,037
Couple months.

539
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,872
-Couple months?
-The hardest part was

540
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,791
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

541
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,086
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

542
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,254
Not just us.

543
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,339
This place is no longer safe
for you.

544
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,634
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

545
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,513
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

546
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,017
Okay.

547
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,311
Okay.

548
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,688
You wait right here.

549
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,191
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

550
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,609
Ooh!

551
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,280
- I had it under control.

552
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,700
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

553
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,535
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

554
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,370
Get out!

555
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
Hey.

556
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,541
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

557
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,625
-toward me!
-Oh!

558
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,877
See how they teach
the children

559
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,253
to treat their guests? Mm!

560
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,258
Oh...

561
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,676
You brought a spear in here?

562
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,137
You brought a spear in here.

563
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,972
I like her.

564
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

565
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,225
-Put it down, put it...
-- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

566
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,894
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

567
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,645
- It's all right, Princess.

568
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,064
Small, small girl.

569
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,068
I am going to give you
two options.

570
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,403
You can come to Wakanda,

571
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,864
conscious or unconscious.

572
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,409
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

573
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,536
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

574
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,499
-Oh, it's funny?
-No, it's not.

575
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,043
-Mm-hmm. I told you!
-You look good.

576
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,878
Calm down.
We'll leave, okay?

577
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,713
And she can deal

578
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,466
with that merman
with the winged ankles

579
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,552
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

580
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,846
-You got this.
-Mm, with your heater.

581
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,181
-- Come on. Let's go.

582
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,100
What?

583
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,942
- What exactly
is this place?

584
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,653
- I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

585
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:10,241
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

586
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,326
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

587
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,832
Please don't touch anything.

588
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,126
- You don't have to worry
about that.

589
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,710
- It may not
look like much,

590
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,796
but it's my life's work
in here.

591
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,880
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,384
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

593
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,552
Yeah.

594
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,596
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

595
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,724
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

596
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,019
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

597
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,105
- Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

598
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,315
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

599
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,401
just to crack
my own encryption.

600
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,945
What is it you're building
here? Is it Stark Tech?

601
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,447
I said don't touch anything.

602
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,240
- Princess,
American law enforcement

603
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,700
has arrived at your location.

604
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,243
-- Shit.
-Who was that?

605
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,661
My AI.

606
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,747
They are surrounding us.

607
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,379
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

608
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,589
That's the feds.

609
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,480
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

610
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,773
I swear to God,
I was doing so well!

611
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,568
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

612
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,279
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

613
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,031
is gonna show up
at my doorstep

614
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,741
and then shit
about to pop off.

615
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,825
I think

616
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,578
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

617
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,373
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

618
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,960
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

619
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,462
This is the Federal Bureau

620
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,546
of Investigation.

621
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,672
...because of
your little machine.

622
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,132
So those popo out there...

623
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,342
- We have
surrounded the premises.

624
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,510
...are the very least
of your worries.

625
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,137
Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

626
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,723
General,
they've got us surrounded.

627
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,475
Maybe we should just split up.

628
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,060
Out of the question.

629
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,353
Does this vehicle work?

630
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
No.

631
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,235
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

632
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,237
Don't even think about it.

633
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,405
Besides,
there are three of us.

634
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,033
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

635
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,660
- Whoo!

636
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,994
I knew it.

637
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,580
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

638
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,708
I spent years
on this. On and off.

639
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,670
-Nice. Have you flown it yet?

640
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,963
That thing can fly?

641
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,006
There's an entire
YouTube channel

642
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,883
dedicated to sightings of me.

643
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,051
- That's awesome.

644
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,803
- We have
a warrant to detain...

645
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,638
-- Come.
-...the student Riri Williams.

646
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,931
Wireless transmitter,

647
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,099
so we can communicate.

648
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,308
Don't try to scurry off.

649
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,519
- General Okoye,
Princess Shuri,

650
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,729
come out with your hands up.

651
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,565
- What a hunk of junk.

652
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,525
Hey, please be careful.

653
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,901
- You will not
be placed under arrest.

654
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:51,986
Keys are on the seat.

655
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,696
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

656
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,030
we can lose them
in Boston traffic.

657
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,991
General,
we really need to split up.

658
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,243
Listen to me.
We are not in your lab.

659
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,411
We are in the field.

660
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,996
Now, get her in the car.

661
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,706
Always shouting at me.

662
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,673
- The tactical unit
will breach the entrance

663
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,634
in three, two,

664
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,136
-one.

665
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,139
- FBI! Don't move!

666
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,890
- What the hell is that?

667
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,310
Oh, shit!
She got an Iron Man suit?

668
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,353
-Fall back!
-Stay where you are!

669
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,025
- Guess it can fly.

670
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,484
- GRIOT!
- Yes, Princess.

671
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,194
-Now!
-Remote piloting activated.

672
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,529
- Shuri! No!

673
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,203
Clip, pole, smoke, fade

674
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,371
They want the drip

675
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,915
Let's go!

676
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,126
- GRIOT.

677
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,587
Give me a visual.

678
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,963
They want the glow
They want my soul

679
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,590
They want the wave
I keep a clip

680
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,674
I keep a pole

681
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,052
Who want the smoke
Who want the fade

682
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,096
- GRIOT...
- Yes, General?

683
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,057
...take me to the princess

684
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,893
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU,

685
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,353
you will not
be able to process

686
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,229
basic input for a millennia.

687
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,564
- Just one moment,
General.

688
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,191
- Okoye,
I'm on my way to you.

689
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,276
Bounce, crouch or get slouched

690
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,653
My whole hood devout

691
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,281
My mama taught me
not to be a harlot

692
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,408
My granny help me
take the wise route

693
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,243
Although I'm itty bitty
sitting pretty

694
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,455
GRIOT, give me control
of this vehicle right now!

695
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,666
- I am clearing you
a path.

696
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,797
She's all yours, General.

697
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,757
Manual drive engaged.

698
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,520
Look, I know you on my bumper

699
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,397
I know you want my thunder

700
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,399
Why the laws
wanna take us under

701
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,942
We need to find
an extraction point.

702
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,610
- There's one
across the river.

703
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,320
I know you want my thunder

704
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,155
Why the laws
wanna take us under

705
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,116
Why the hell
am I in this jungle

706
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,326
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off
the bridge.

707
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,708
- Princess,
there is a surveillance drone

708
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,584
-locked onto you.
-How high?

709
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,086
- Thirty-thousand feet.

710
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,463
We don't cry 'bout
how they try take us all out

711
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,507
-Look
-They want the drip

712
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,008
They want my soul

713
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,093
Hang on.

714
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,803
I got it.

715
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,474
Come on, Riri.

716
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,144
You gotta find
these differential equations.

717
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,104
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

718
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,064
- Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

719
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,232
without an oxygen mask.

720
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,529
- Oxygen level
is now 55%.

721
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,615
- Twenty-eight
thousand feet.

722
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,327
- Oxygen level
is now 30%.

723
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,832
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

724
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,459
my Euler angles
and that should...

725
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,461
that should drop it
right on the...

726
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,802
- Oxygen, 0%.

727
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,141
The drone is no longer
tracking you.

728
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,060
Altitude,
500 feet and falling.

729
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,395
Riri! Are you okay?

730
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,773
-Riri!
-Yeah.

731
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,444
I'm good.

732
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,404
- Incoming!
- Get out of the way!

733
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,655
{\an8}

734
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,865
-Shit!
-- And no worries.

735
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,950
I got a special delivery
for y'all in three,

736
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,535
two, one...

737
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,163
- Nice one, Riri!

738
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,581
We got the glow
We got the soul

739
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,874
We got the wave

740
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,417
- Whoo!

741
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,673
-- Riri!

742
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,578
What just happened?
Shuri!

743
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,121
Shuri!

744
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,473
- The Princess's vitals
are stable, General.

745
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,226
She should regain
consciousness momentarily.

746
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,762
Take another step closer

747
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,056
and I will kill you all.

748
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,975
Drop your weapons!

749
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,770
{\an8}

750
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,693
{\an8}Hey, is she blue?

751
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,570
{\an8}-

752
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,905
{\an8}

753
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,574
Drop your weapon!

754
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,984
{\an8}

755
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,154
{\an8}

756
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,751
- Okoye!

757
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,253
Wait!

758
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,713
- Activating
interpretation.

759
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,964
-I'm Shuri.

760
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,340
Princess of Wakanda.

761
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,593
I demand that you take me
to Namor.

762
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,845
Do not bring harm
to this girl.

763
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,641
Do we take them both alive?

764
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,227
-- Yes, Attuma.

765
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,661
- Breathe.

766
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,588
Shuri!

767
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,692
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

768
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,070
None. But we think
it was the Wakandans.

769
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,446
Excuse me?

770
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,656
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

771
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,740
that they were coming.

772
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,700
Right. Who made that call?

773
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,120
-She did.
-- Director de Fontaine.

774
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,915
Director de Fontaine.

775
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:07,999
Really?

776
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,084
Well...

777
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,962
Uh, Agent thinks
it was the Wakandans.

778
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,005
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

779
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,090
since they took out our ship.

780
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,591
That's why I wanted you here.

781
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,760
You're lookin' good.

782
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,428
Oh. Well, I try.

783
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,097
- You put
that home gym in?

784
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,181
- Yeah. Last year.

785
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,059
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

786
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,811
Howdy.

787
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,646
-I'm special agent in charge.
-Oh, good for you.

788
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,898
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

789
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,234
-Yeah. Okay. After you.
-Yeah. Okay.

790
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,527
-All right.
-So, what happened here?

791
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,737
Um, we think
it was a car crash,

792
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,656
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

793
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:40,782
- What do you mean?

794
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,159
It was just like this
when you found it?

795
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,869
- Yes.
We think someone involved

796
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,953
got rid of the vehicles.

797
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,204
Got rid of them how?

798
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,747
- They dumped
them into the river.

799
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,124
You're kidding me.

800
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,751
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

801
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,296
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

802
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,548
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

803
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,383
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

804
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,677
It's an eight-hour drive.

805
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,137
- Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

806
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,681
Actually, wouldn't mind...

807
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,933
apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

808
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,059
during our marriage.

809
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,689
- They were blue.

810
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,567
And they had
superhuman strength.

811
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,321
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

812
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,865
I struck down three of them

813
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,408
with blows
that should've killed them,

814
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,202
but they rose again.

815
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,622
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

816
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,635
- Okoye,

817
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,429
you will be
stripped of your rank

818
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,514
as General of Wakanda's armies

819
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,559
and your status
as Dora Milaje.

820
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,523
{\an8}

821
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,902
{\an8}You may.

822
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,862
{\an8}

823
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,324
I have given everything.

824
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,079
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

825
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,622
{\an8}

826
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,208
Allow me
to make this right.

827
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,584
"Make it right"?

828
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,339
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

829
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,759
Perhaps we are being
too hasty.

830
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,177
M'- Mmm.

831
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:29,224
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

832
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,935
Where is her
treacherous husband now

833
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,398
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

834
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,567
is with the ancestors.

835
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:44,447
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

836
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,826
and my entire family is gone!

837
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,454
Have I not given everything?

838
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,549
On your feet, General.

839
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,932
I stood by you

840
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,728
after Killmonger
took the throne,

841
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:18,481
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

842
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,277
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

843
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,071
And I warned you

844
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,033
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

845
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,118
and you lost her.

846
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,370
So, today,

847
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,457
I am done.

848
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,089
Are you here, GRIOT?

849
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,674
- Yes, my Queen.

850
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,096
Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?

851
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,555
- I was.

852
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,475
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

853
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,061
- Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

854
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,230
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

855
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,314
- Hmm.

856
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,149
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

857
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,652
That information
is highly classified.

858
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,906
What is that?

859
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,408
-That's a new ringtone?
-Oh, shit.

860
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,828
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

861
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,121
It's enough
with the titles.

862
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,372
Just take it. I don't care.

863
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,665
Hey, honey sweetheart.

864
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,375
Ooh.

865
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,002
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

866
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,088
Actually, she's leaving.

867
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,256
All right.

868
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,883
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

869
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,767
Everett Ross.

870
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,060
Queen Ramonda?

871
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,187
What are you doing
with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

872
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,231
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

873
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,567
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

874
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,735
Do you have the student?

875
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,573
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

876
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,950
What? Taken by who?

877
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,579
My agency assumes it was you.

878
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,706
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

879
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,041
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

880
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,918
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

881
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,920
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

882
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,798
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

883
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,176
A country
that's already on our radar?

884
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,260
Or you mean someone else?

885
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,345
- That is all I can say for now.

886
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,513
Please,

887
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,600
alert me if your government
decides to act

888
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,268
on their suspicions.

889
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,519
Yeah. Sure.

890
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,107
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

891
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,067
I owe Shuri my life.

892
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,739
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

893
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,450
- I lost track of them
in the North Atlantic,

894
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,786
but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.

895
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:29,923
{\an8}

896
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,920
{\an8}-Hmm?
-- Oui, Miss Nakia.

897
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,507
{\an8}

898
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,591
{\an8}

899
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,640
Queen Mother.

900
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,769
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

901
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,939
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

902
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,400
and they grow
everything we eat here.

903
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,194
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

904
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,321
But you are using
different material.

905
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,825
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

906
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,163
You were missed
at T'Challa's funeral.

907
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,293
Oh...

908
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,135
Queen Mother.

909
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,263
- It's been six years
since you left us.

910
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,600
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

911
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,854
I was afraid

912
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,525
of how final
the funeral would be.

913
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,653
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

914
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:20,825
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

915
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:24,621
and you know
death is not the end.

916
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,002
{\an8}

917
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,508
How is everyone at home?

918
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,011
Shuri has been taken.

919
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,721
What?

920
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,141
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

921
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,851
{\an8}

922
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,895
I was a different person then.

923
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,023
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

924
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,234
and rescue her,
without being seen.

925
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,446
Who on earth would risk war
with Wakanda?

926
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,908
- Oh, my God.

927
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,284
- Okay, breathe. Breathe.

928
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,827
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

929
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:05,995
Where the hell are we?

930
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,289
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

931
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,374
Oh, my God!

932
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,501
What is that?

933
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,420
- Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

934
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,422
-- Just calm down.

935
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,716
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

936
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,051
that you can call
to come and get us?

937
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,135
No.

938
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,220
Why not?

939
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,097
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

940
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,432
The Black Panther is gone.

941
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,184
So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers

942
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,268
when I get kidnapped?

943
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,775
{\an8}

944
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,534
Do you understand her?

945
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,202
Not completely.

946
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,497
Nuh-uh.

947
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,999
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

948
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,501
That's in every movie.

949
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,919
Princess Leia.

950
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,337
Belle from
Beauty and the Beast.

951
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,048
That white chick
from Indiana Jones.

952
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,258
It's fine.

953
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,885
You should see what I have
to wear at Warrior Falls.

954
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,309
{\an8}

955
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,729
Wait.

956
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,273
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

957
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,816
I'm coming back.

958
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,693
I'm coming back.

959
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,778
Stay calm.

960
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,162
{\an8}

961
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,168
{\an8}

962
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,052
{\an8}

963
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:15,875
{\an8}

964
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,014
{\an8}

965
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,450
Princess.

966
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,618
Welcome.

967
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,039
Please, feel free.

968
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,590
This is beautiful.

969
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,175
That was my mother's.

970
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,771
These are all
Mesoamerican artifacts.

971
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,108
Most likely 16th century.

972
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,528
Have you been alive
since then?

973
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,032
Your mother was human.

974
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,492
She was.

975
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,870
Then she became
something else.

976
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,080
-How?
-"How?"

977
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,125
"How" is never
as important as "why."

978
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,846
- My mother
and her village

979
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,514
were driven from their farms

980
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,435
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

981
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,480
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

982
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,983
Facing starvation,

983
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,985
war, and disease,

984
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,237
my people turned to Chaac...

985
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,783
our god of rain and abundance.

986
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,829
Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...

987
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,582
-...a way to save his people.

988
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,966
- Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

989
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,648
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,

990
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,067
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

991
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,444
for fear
of what it may do to me.

992
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,113
{\an8}

993
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:34,490
But the Shaman was convincing.

994
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,001
{\an8}

995
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,190
They all fell sick.

996
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,193
And their lives,

997
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,487
their existence there,

998
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,947
ended.

999
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,086
The plant took away
their ability to breathe air

1000
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:33,049
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

1001
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,137
They settled in the ocean,

1002
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,932
away from war and diseases.

1003
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,603
{\an8}

1004
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,255
My mother
gave birth to me there

1005
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,801
and I became
the firstborn son of Talokan.

1006
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,345
The plant gave me wings
on my ankles

1007
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,931
and ears
that pointed to the clouds.

1008
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,641
I was a mutant.

1009
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,812
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

1010
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,481
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

1011
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,317
As she grew older,

1012
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,239
my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...

1013
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,909
and died with a broken heart.

1014
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,288
She made me promise

1015
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,624
to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

1016
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:56,674
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

1017
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:05,141
{\an8}

1018
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,309
Huh?

1019
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,467
{\an8}

1020
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,014
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

1021
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,057
As he died by my hand,

1022
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,267
he called me...

1023
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,643
{\an8}

1024
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,900
The child without love.

1025
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,902
And I took my name from there.

1026
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,992
"Namor."

1027
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,995
Because I have no love
for the surface world.

1028
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,082
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1029
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,629
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

1030
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,380
What if we took her
to Wakanda?

1031
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,966
Let us go.

1032
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,385
I give you my word.

1033
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,012
She will remain in my country.

1034
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,680
I cannot risk that, Princess.

1035
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,474
Then keep me instead.

1036
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:32,061
I'd love to see your nation.

1037
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,023
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

1038
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,528
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

1039
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:43,948
Your blood will become toxic

1040
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,449
and the pressure of the ocean

1041
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,952
will break every bone
in your body.

1042
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,289
Or you can wear a suit.

1043
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,458
We have some of them. Come on.

1044
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:58,545
Stay close.

1045
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,570
- Hey! Namor, wait!

1046
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,741
- Whoa!

1047
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,611
Hello.

1048
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,308
It's beautiful.

1049
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,478
It's made of vibranium.

1050
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,645
- Yes.

1051
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,314
In the depths of the ocean,

1052
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,983
I brought the sun
to my people.

1053
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:51,195
I know you wished me

1054
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,530
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1055
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,158
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1056
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,060
- Nakia,
your hunch was correct.

1057
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:26,230
I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.

1058
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:02,224
- The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern

1059
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,852
approximately 140 meters
below the surface.

1060
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,772
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1061
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,066
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

1062
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,068
If she's down there,

1063
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,778
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

1064
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,656
How would you like me
to proceed?

1065
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,953
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1066
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,331
I will attempt
to draw Namor out.

1067
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,909
You are the first person
from the surface

1068
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,494
to come to Talokan.

1069
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,539
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1070
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,299
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1071
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,470
You are young, Princess.

1072
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,265
When you age as I do,
you realize

1073
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:28,185
we all lose everyone we love.

1074
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,936
But when I lost my brother,

1075
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,730
it just felt different.

1076
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,565
He suffered in silence.

1077
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,152
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1078
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:39,946
How does that make sense

1079
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:44,576
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1080
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,496
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1081
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:49,998
Why?

1082
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,961
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1083
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,633
My ancestors would often say,

1084
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,428
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1085
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,351
I admire
what you have built here.

1086
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,106
And how you've protected
your people.

1087
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,943
But as princess of Wakanda,

1088
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,570
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1089
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,367
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1090
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,912
I'm not leaving without her.

1091
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:33,375
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1092
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,755
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1093
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,467
For centuries,
the surface nations

1094
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,345
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1095
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:47,472
Over resources.

1096
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,143
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1097
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,936
I have prepared my people

1098
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,147
for the time
they will come for us.

1099
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:59,526
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1100
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:06,742
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1101
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,035
There is no in-between.

1102
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,875
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1103
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,794
and you want Wakanda
to help you?

1104
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:19,880
That's madness.

1105
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:23,049
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1106
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,676
if given a chance.

1107
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,929
If we make an alliance,

1108
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,807
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1109
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:35,604
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1110
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,398
the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.

1111
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,610
And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1112
01:19:42,694 --> 01:19:44,654
The scientist will die.

1113
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:48,575
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1114
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,368
An attack on my people?

1115
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:52,162
Yes.

1116
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,706
And I want you
to listen to me.

1117
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,834
Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.

1118
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,215
{\an8}

1119
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,890
I heard you that night,

1120
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,975
with your mother at the river.

1121
01:20:15,268 --> 01:20:18,021
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1122
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,695
Let us burn it together.

1123
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,497
{\an8}-
Queen Ramonda

1124
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,249
{\an8}won't sell us any vibranium.

1125
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,543
And now they abducted
a young woman

1126
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,877
who built the machine.

1127
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,337
Yeah, with all due respect,

1128
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,047
Riri Williams
is a child prodigy

1129
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,341
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1130
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,968
The Wakandans
were recruiting her

1131
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:49,386
as part of their
outreach program.

1132
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:50,971
Nothing more. And then,

1133
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:53,515
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1134
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,684
to arrest the Crown Princess

1135
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,102
of an international
superpower.

1136
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,940
The President wants
to take offensive action

1137
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,066
against Wakanda.

1138
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,361
What type of offensive action?

1139
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,613
Destabilization.

1140
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:13,118
Well, Special Officer Ross
is our expert.

1141
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,495
So, Ross, what do you think?

1142
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,163
My sources are telling me

1143
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,456
that there's someone else
out there.

1144
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,293
-Another nation?
-- Could be. I don't know.

1145
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,377
You've gotta give me
enough time

1146
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,545
to investigate this properly,

1147
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,755
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1148
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:27,757
with a country
whose military capacity

1149
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,801
we can't even comprehend.

1150
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,387
Director?

1151
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,098
I think he's the expert.

1152
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:38,184
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1153
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,067
- Yes?

1154
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,152
We have a problem.

1155
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,967
Is my daughter alive?

1156
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,094
The princess
is alive and well.

1157
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,640
She requested
to be taken to Talokan.

1158
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,184
She will remain there
for the time being.

1159
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:26,066
What can I offer you
in exchange?

1160
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,484
Nothing.

1161
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,653
I beg to differ.

1162
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:33,490
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda

1163
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:36,117
for your attack
on their mining ship.

1164
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:39,245
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1165
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:42,999
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1166
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:51,841
If you tell the Americans
about us,

1167
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,512
if you try to find us,

1168
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:00,392
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1169
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:02,644
I will kill the princess.

1170
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:05,981
I will come to Wakanda

1171
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,108
and I will kill you.

1172
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,493
So, what happened?

1173
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,373
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1174
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,333
and asked me to help him.

1175
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:31,256
I need to think.

1176
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,092
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1177
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,144
Ey!

1178
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:47,731
{\an8}

1179
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:52,986
{\an8}

1180
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,291
{\an8}

1181
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,543
{\an8}Shuri...

1182
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,046
{\an8}

1183
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:16,801
Are you okay?

1184
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:18,970
Are you okay?

1185
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,472
-Give me your Beads!
-Let's go.

1186
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,015
Give me your Beads.
I can save her.

1187
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:23,099
We have to go.

1188
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,392
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1189
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,560
but we need to listen to her.

1190
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:26,895
Listen, I hit her
with a sonic round.

1191
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,314
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1192
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,274
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1193
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,777
-We have to go.
-Wait!

1194
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,404
Did they hurt you?

1195
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,115
No. No.

1196
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,867
Thank you.

1197
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:24,869
{\an8}

1198
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,580
-GRIOT.
-- Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,707
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1200
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:34,796
{\an8}

1201
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:45,909
{\an8}

1202
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:25,448
{\an8}

1203
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,410
{\an8}

1204
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:34,207
{\an8}

1205
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,137
- Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1206
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,389
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1207
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,308
Go.

1208
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,060
Fortify the sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1209
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,228
Princess?

1210
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,147
Neka.

1211
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,484
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1212
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,030
I just wanted to return these.

1213
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,408
No. Keep them.

1214
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,076
Might need them soon.

1215
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,996
Did you get that
from down there?

1216
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:01,336
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

1217
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,339
-Yes.
-- Hmm.

1218
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,591
It is beautiful.

1219
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,470
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

1220
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,013
- Mm.

1221
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:33,451
- So,
Miss Riri Williams,

1222
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:36,371
what do you think of Wakanda?

1223
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,539
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1224
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:42,710
It's great.

1225
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,629
But I really
would like to go home.

1226
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,673
You will need to be patient.

1227
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,884
Can I at least call my mom?

1228
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:57,725
- The Princess
has been brought home

1229
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,602
by the War Dog Nakia.

1230
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,145
Glory to Hanuman.

1231
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,688
- Glory to Hanuman.

1232
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:07,318
Mm. The spy saves Wakanda
once again.

1233
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,362
The Queen will reward her

1234
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,031
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1235
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:15,952
Okoye.

1236
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,414
{\an8}

1237
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:22,834
After Thanos' attack,

1238
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,420
when you left
without saying a word,

1239
01:30:26,045 --> 01:30:27,213
it hurt.

1240
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:34,595
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1241
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,390
It was not easy.

1242
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:39,183
He was...

1243
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:43,688
King and Black Panther
to everyone.

1244
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,524
But to me...

1245
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,990
he was everything.

1246
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,827
My T'Challa.

1247
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:02,123
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1248
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,750
I had to step away

1249
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,295
and let myself break.

1250
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:11,174
I couldn't just...

1251
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,511
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1252
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:18,306
- Mm-hmm.

1253
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,322
We are under attack.

1254
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,289
Here.

1255
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:51,130
{\an8}

1256
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:53,633
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1257
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:55,593
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1258
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,928
Shuri, where are you?

1259
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:58,554
Making my way
to the city right now.

1260
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,181
Stand down! That is an order!

1261
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,642
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1262
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,185
- Aneka,
do not let her leave the lab.

1263
01:32:04,268 --> 01:32:05,353
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1264
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:06,437
-We can't hear you.
-- Shuri!

1265
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,522
Love you. Bye!

1266
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:10,942
You just hung up on the Queen.

1267
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,109
I just hung up on my mom.

1268
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:13,861
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1269
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,187
Invaders!

1270
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:56,988
-Mama! Mama!

1271
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:00,992
{\an8}

1272
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,414
EMTs are suffering

1273
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:08,291
a form of sonic hypnosis.

1274
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,128
{\an8}

1275
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,130
General, plug your ears.

1276
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:15,381
Yes, my Queen.

1277
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,929
-Can I help?
-Come, quickly.

1278
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:12,396
{\an8}

1279
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,689
{\an8}

1280
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:15,608
{\an8}
Cross your arms...

1281
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:16,692
{\an8}

1282
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,110
{\an8}

1283
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,365
{\an8}Nakia.

1284
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,047
The fish man.

1285
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:43,552
{\an8}

1286
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:14,166
- Phambili!

1287
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:07,511
{\an8}

1288
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:27,448
Shit, he's too fast.

1289
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:28,532
He's even faster in the water.

1290
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,935
-Activating system override.
-- No.

1291
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,019
-Wait! I'll fix it.

1292
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:58,687
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1293
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,497
- Do you see her?

1294
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,957
Yes. Right there.

1295
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,138
-Go, child.

1296
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,474
Wait, what?
And leave you here?

1297
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:36,559
Run!

1298
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,700
Okoye, move now!

1299
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:54,678
{\an8}

1300
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:01,518
She did this.

1301
01:39:05,564 --> 01:39:06,732
In one week's time,

1302
01:39:06,815 --> 01:39:09,485
I will return
with my entire army

1303
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:12,905
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1304
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,033
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1305
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:17,993
{\an8}

1306
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:19,995
Mother.

1307
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,164
-Keep her back!
-Mother!

1308
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:25,209
-Mama! Mama!
-Bury your dead.

1309
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,503
Mourn your losses.

1310
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:32,424
You are queen now.

1311
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:33,676
Mother!

1312
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:35,386
No!

1313
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:40,099
Get off of me!
Mother!

1314
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:42,726
Mama!

1315
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:51,610
Mama!

1316
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:53,112
Mama!

1317
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:54,863
Mother!

1318
01:39:55,572 --> 01:39:56,699
{\an8}

1319
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,200
{\an8}

1320
01:39:58,617 --> 01:39:59,743
{\an8}

1321
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,747
{\an8}Help me!

1322
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:05,207
{\an8}Mama!

1323
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:07,418
{\an8}

1324
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:09,878
{\an8}

1325
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,842
-- Mama!

1326
01:40:55,549 --> 01:41:00,721
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1327
01:41:07,352 --> 01:41:09,021
You must mourn her

1328
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:13,108
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1329
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,904
Do not bury yourself
in your technology.

1330
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,322
Why are you here?

1331
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:21,909
I promised your brother

1332
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,369
that I would provide you
with counsel

1333
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:25,954
and protection.

1334
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,626
But I am in need
of your advice today.

1335
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:36,215
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1336
01:41:36,298 --> 01:41:38,092
with a proposition.

1337
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,763
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1338
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,431
in Jabariland.

1339
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,768
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1340
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,104
who scoffs at tradition?

1341
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,147
M'- Mm.

1342
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:55,317
The world...

1343
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,905
The world has taken
too much from you

1344
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:03,909
for you to still be
considered a child.

1345
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:08,956
It is in my people's interest
to know

1346
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:11,500
which way your mind
is leaning.

1347
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,087
The elders are desperate.

1348
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:18,632
The city is vulnerable.

1349
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,011
If you are to provide
for them,

1350
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,390
they will be
in great debt to you.

1351
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:30,185
And what of your heart?

1352
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:32,312
Hmm?

1353
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,732
Which way
is your heart leaning?

1354
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:40,571
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1355
01:42:44,074 --> 01:42:45,742
My heart was buried with her.

1356
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,739
- Oh, man.

1357
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:26,533
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

1358
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,701
What...
What are you doing here?

1359
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:30,537
I'm hungry. And...

1360
01:43:30,954 --> 01:43:32,956
{\an8}Tragedy strikes
the international community.

1361
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,208
{\an8}Sources can now confirm

1362
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:37,252
{\an8}that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1363
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,463
Western allies say
that civil conflict

1364
01:43:39,546 --> 01:43:41,590
was the likely cause
of the Queen's...

1365
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:45,135
So...

1366
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,845
You have any comment?

1367
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:52,184
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1368
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:54,019
What are you talking about?

1369
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:57,689
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1370
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:02,277
What about the Beads?

1371
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:04,571
What?

1372
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:05,739
The Beads.

1373
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:07,032
I had them bugged

1374
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,867
before you
ever even got there.

1375
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:12,871
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1376
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:15,624
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1377
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:17,167
May she rest in peace.

1378
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:18,877
But it's good.

1379
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:20,087
Well, for us.

1380
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,965
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1381
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:25,092
-They're a good people.
-Mm-hmm.

1382
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:27,219
You ever thought
for a second

1383
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,012
what they could be doing?

1384
01:44:29,179 --> 01:44:30,597
Ever thought
what we would be doing

1385
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,892
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1386
01:44:34,142 --> 01:44:38,438
Oh, I actually dream
about that.

1387
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,943
Val. Val, please.

1388
01:44:43,318 --> 01:44:45,112
It's Director de Fontaine.

1389
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,993
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1390
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,746
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1391
01:44:57,082 --> 01:44:59,459
We need to find a way
to weaken Namor.

1392
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,795
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1393
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:05,382
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1394
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:08,135
I thought
the Black Panther was gone.

1395
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,187
My brother is dead.

1396
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:23,525
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1397
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:42,836
GRIOT?

1398
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,630
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1399
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,591
between our attempts
at creating

1400
01:45:47,674 --> 01:45:49,384
a synthetic
Heart-Shaped Herb...

1401
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,056
and the fibers
from this bracelet.

1402
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:55,932
- Yes, Princess.

1403
01:45:59,227 --> 01:46:01,980
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1404
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:05,484
they may share
some base-level similarities

1405
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:06,693
that we can exploit.

1406
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,153
- As you wish, Princess.

1407
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:14,868
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

1408
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,161
- Uploading now.

1409
01:46:32,761 --> 01:46:34,888
Who do I turn to

1410
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:37,140
When I need saving

1411
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,976
'Cause you move mountain

1412
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,396
I can't do the same

1413
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,731
And did you think about

1414
01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:47,651
When you left us

1415
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:49,069
Why doesn't he look like them?

1416
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,446
His physiology
is completely different.

1417
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:54,282
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1418
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:55,784
The women
that were guarding us,

1419
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:56,868
they had water
over their mouths

1420
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:58,662
and on their necks.

1421
01:46:58,745 --> 01:46:59,746
He didn't have that.

1422
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,332
Several organisms
don't need gills

1423
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:05,335
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1424
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,045
It's like a jellyfish.

1425
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:11,007
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1426
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:13,343
It's a process called

1427
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:14,636
-diffusion.
-Diffusion.

1428
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:21,435
Memories, oh, carry me go

1429
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:25,897
Carry me go, oh, nowhere

1430
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:29,901
Sick and tired of it all
Take me far-away

1431
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:32,279
Mr Dj Gbemi trabaye

1432
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:35,031
Now I no fit trust anybody

1433
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,867
Na e make I no fit shout

1434
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:38,869
My body don dey tire eh

1435
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:41,746
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1436
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:43,290
is a day wasted.

1437
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,041
We must deal with Namor

1438
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,877
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1439
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,713
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1440
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:52,382
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1441
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,717
he jumped back into the water.

1442
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,635
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1443
01:47:55,802 --> 01:47:57,721
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1444
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,347
from the water on his skin.

1445
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:01,558
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1446
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:02,767
he won't be as strong.

1447
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:04,352
Yo, that's it.

1448
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:07,647
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1449
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,274
into a pervaporation chamber.

1450
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:10,525
Is that even possible?

1451
01:48:10,692 --> 01:48:11,860
Yes.

1452
01:48:13,361 --> 01:48:15,280
You're going to help us
trap him.

1453
01:48:16,114 --> 01:48:18,116
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1454
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,826
- Right this way.

1455
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,664
- How old were you

1456
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,166
when you built
your first machine?

1457
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,417
- Three.

1458
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,046
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1459
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:33,673
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

1460
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,888
So who taught you
how to do all that you do?

1461
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:41,473
- My big brother.

1462
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:47,854
- I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.

1463
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:50,440
This is not me.

1464
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,109
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1465
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,570
I turned in my weapon.

1466
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,864
I built you
a new spear as well.

1467
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:00,742
A new one?

1468
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:01,952
Yes.

1469
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:05,664
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1470
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,290
- The Midnight Angel.

1471
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:08,917
Midnight Angel?

1472
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,252
{\an8}

1473
01:49:11,836 --> 01:49:14,047
This will even
the odds against them.

1474
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,675
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1475
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,719
Please.

1476
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,347
My body don dey tire eh

1477
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:24,224
Make me mara eh

1478
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:25,517
Shuri.

1479
01:49:26,184 --> 01:49:27,352
Yes.

1480
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,564
How many of these
did you make?

1481
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,651
- I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1482
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,486
I won't be forced out
of my home.

1483
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:39,197
You have such
a rebellious spirit.

1484
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,740
Why did you join the Dora?

1485
01:49:41,783 --> 01:49:42,951
Why do you care?

1486
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:45,996
As far as I can see
Na the memories

1487
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,623
Wey Dey carry me
From reality

1488
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:50,125
E no require visa

1489
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,711
I still have a lot of fight
left in me.

1490
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:56,339
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of Kyana,

1491
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:59,217
do you still have
some fight left in you?

1492
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:01,803
What do you have in mind?

1493
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:05,348
My body don dey tire eh

1494
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:15,775
My body don dey tire eh

1495
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:18,361
Make me mara eh

1496
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:20,947
When my whole world
is set on fire

1497
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,825
Don't leave me alone

1498
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:27,454
GRIOT,

1499
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:30,457
what's the confidence rate?

1500
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:33,376
- 98.7%, Princess.

1501
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:36,421
Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

1502
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:41,718
{\an8}

1503
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,014
Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1504
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,683
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1505
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:53,730
So...

1506
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:57,984
this is what
you've been up to.

1507
01:50:58,777 --> 01:50:59,944
Yes.

1508
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:02,030
What you have here, now,

1509
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:07,494
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1510
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:12,999
It would be the greatest gift

1511
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:15,794
since Bashenga's discovery.

1512
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,176
We'll soon find out. Come.

1513
01:51:26,304 --> 01:51:27,764
-GRIOT?
-- Yes, Princess.

1514
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:28,932
- Print it.

1515
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:34,813
- How will we know
if it works?

1516
01:51:35,605 --> 01:51:36,856
- If it glows.

1517
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:47,158
{\an8}

1518
01:51:51,913 --> 01:51:52,997
I mean,
shouldn't we be

1519
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:54,374
burning incense or something?

1520
01:51:54,999 --> 01:51:56,084
Only Bast knows

1521
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:58,169
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1522
01:52:08,513 --> 01:52:10,348
Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?

1523
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:11,516
No.

1524
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,144
Need you to have access
to my chest,

1525
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,354
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

1526
01:52:16,938 --> 01:52:18,481
"Cardiac arrest"?

1527
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:20,608
She's joking,

1528
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,402
right?

1529
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:25,405
-Right?

1530
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:34,205
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1531
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:37,625
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1532
01:52:38,042 --> 01:52:40,462
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1533
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:46,050
{\an8}

1534
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:00,750
Mother?

1535
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,348
N'Jadaka.

1536
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,100
Lil' cousin.

1537
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:18,476
How?

1538
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,396
How is never as important
as why, right?

1539
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:24,440
You chose me.

1540
01:54:24,607 --> 01:54:27,485
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1541
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:29,320
Why did you take the Herb?

1542
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,282
-To see my family.
-No, that's bullshit.

1543
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:35,159
You didn't believe
the Ancestral Plane was real,

1544
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,244
did you?

1545
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:40,373
No.

1546
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:42,375
So, why did you take it, then?

1547
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:45,461
You don't have to lie to me.

1548
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:47,797
So I can be strong.

1549
01:54:48,172 --> 01:54:49,674
Strong to do what?

1550
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:53,553
See?

1551
01:54:55,096 --> 01:54:57,056
We're more alike
than you think.

1552
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,935
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1553
01:55:01,102 --> 01:55:02,270
I'm nothing like you.

1554
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,481
You took it for yourself,

1555
01:55:05,648 --> 01:55:07,191
then destroyed the rest.

1556
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:09,903
Unworthy king,

1557
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,238
afraid of being replaced.

1558
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:14,324
Just a coward.

1559
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:15,491
No.

1560
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:16,618
I had the courage to do

1561
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:18,244
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1562
01:55:19,662 --> 01:55:21,164
How many people
like your scientist

1563
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:23,625
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1564
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:25,668
Cowards.

1565
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:28,087
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1566
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,173
and before T'Challa.

1567
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:32,091
Don't mention my brother.

1568
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:34,093
You're the reason
why he's dead.

1569
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:37,847
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1570
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,266
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1571
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:42,268
Their blood is on your hands.

1572
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:44,771
That ain't on me.

1573
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:46,689
And don't you dare

1574
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:48,691
take that away
from your mother.

1575
01:55:48,858 --> 01:55:50,443
She sacrificed her life
to protect

1576
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,362
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1577
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:56,407
Your father,
he was a hypocrite.

1578
01:55:57,909 --> 01:55:59,661
He would've killed that girl.

1579
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,288
Shit, he killed
his own brother.

1580
01:56:03,873 --> 01:56:06,542
T'Challa was too noble.

1581
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:11,047
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1582
01:56:13,174 --> 01:56:14,842
And here you stand.

1583
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,642
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1584
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:24,894
or take care of business...

1585
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:26,729
like me?

1586
01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:30,566
- Are you okay?

1587
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:33,903
{\an8}

1588
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:37,532
Who did you see?

1589
01:56:43,037 --> 01:56:44,038
No one.

1590
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:48,292
{\an8}

1591
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:50,336
I failed.

1592
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:52,630
-It didn't work.
-Hey, Shuri.

1593
01:56:55,758 --> 01:56:58,136
-They abandoned me.
-They would never do that.

1594
01:56:58,219 --> 01:56:59,762
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1595
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,681
-I re-created the Herb.
-Okay.

1596
01:57:01,764 --> 01:57:03,808
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1597
01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:05,518
-Relax.
-Why didn't they come for me?

1598
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:06,728
Just relax.

1599
01:57:13,818 --> 01:57:15,111
- Shit.

1600
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:20,783
Can I get some of that too?

1601
01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:29,250
I think...

1602
01:57:30,793 --> 01:57:32,253
you're going to need a suit.

1603
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,870
- There are more
people coming from the city.

1604
01:58:05,953 --> 01:58:07,580
M'- They need more space.

1605
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,748
So what?

1606
01:58:09,624 --> 01:58:11,876
You are visitors.

1607
01:58:12,043 --> 01:58:15,254
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1608
01:58:40,404 --> 01:58:42,698
-- The princess!

1609
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:17,525
M'- She has done it!

1610
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:21,237
-The Black Panther lives!

1611
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:41,507
Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.

1612
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,428
Our Queen murdered.

1613
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:49,473
Our capital destroyed.

1614
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:52,977
He believes
we have no protector.

1615
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:55,980
But now...

1616
01:59:57,773 --> 01:59:59,775
now is our time to strike.

1617
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:03,529
- How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

1618
02:00:04,113 --> 02:00:05,823
We'll bring Namor to us.

1619
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:07,533
-Here, again?
-- No.

1620
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:10,036
A distant location at sea.

1621
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,621
M'- All right.

1622
02:00:11,704 --> 02:00:13,164
Let's say this does work.

1623
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:17,210
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

1624
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:20,421
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1625
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:25,593
is murdering him
the right solution?

1626
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,012
You were calling for his head

1627
02:00:28,179 --> 02:00:30,514
when his only crime
was intimidation.

1628
02:00:30,681 --> 02:00:32,475
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1629
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:33,851
His soldiers

1630
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:35,728
did not call him
General or King.

1631
02:00:35,811 --> 02:00:38,481
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1632
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:39,857
What is that?

1633
02:00:40,024 --> 02:00:42,151
The feather serpent god.

1634
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:43,736
What?

1635
02:00:43,819 --> 02:00:45,821
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

1636
02:00:45,988 --> 02:00:47,865
we do not have access
to books?

1637
02:00:48,115 --> 02:00:49,617
-- Elders,

1638
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:51,410
with your permission,

1639
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:55,289
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1640
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:57,667
{\an8}

1641
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:06,759
Namor's not finished.

1642
02:01:08,177 --> 02:01:11,264
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

1643
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:13,766
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

1644
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,185
-What are you afraid of?
-M'- War.

1645
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:19,939
If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,

1646
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:22,733
killing him
will risk eternal war.

1647
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,985
- And so what?

1648
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,862
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

1649
02:01:27,029 --> 02:01:28,406
M'- Of course it was.

1650
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:33,494
Of course she was.

1651
02:01:35,496 --> 02:01:38,708
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1652
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:40,960
Hmm?

1653
02:01:44,171 --> 02:01:45,881
And it is not what I want...

1654
02:01:48,509 --> 02:01:50,261
for my people.

1655
02:02:00,604 --> 02:02:03,649
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1656
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:06,569
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

1657
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:09,947
Her hopes and her dreams.

1658
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:14,618
But she's dead.

1659
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:16,662
She's gone!

1660
02:02:18,372 --> 02:02:22,251
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

1661
02:02:23,669 --> 02:02:24,962
So, her dreams,

1662
02:02:25,129 --> 02:02:28,215
her goals, her hopes for me...

1663
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,803
it doesn't exist.

1664
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:37,058
It doesn't matter anymore.

1665
02:02:39,143 --> 02:02:42,021
What matters is what I want,

1666
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,899
and what I want is Namor dead!

1667
02:02:48,903 --> 02:02:50,571
And you're going
to help me get it.

1668
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,288
{\an8}

1669
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:08,464
We leave in the morning.

1670
02:03:34,281 --> 02:03:35,282
- Hi.

1671
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:36,450
Good morning.

1672
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:40,287
If we survive this,

1673
02:03:41,956 --> 02:03:45,167
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

1674
02:03:48,003 --> 02:03:50,339
Here. Take my hands.

1675
02:03:53,634 --> 02:03:54,635
{\an8}

1676
02:03:59,014 --> 02:04:01,517
Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

1677
02:04:01,684 --> 02:04:04,728
Who did you see
when you took the Herb?

1678
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,610
If you go to war
for vengeance,

1679
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:14,196
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

1680
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,657
It will only grow larger,

1681
02:04:16,824 --> 02:04:18,284
and it will consume you.

1682
02:04:20,536 --> 02:04:21,912
It already has.

1683
02:04:27,293 --> 02:04:29,211
{\an8}

1684
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:38,387
{\an8}

1685
02:05:51,293 --> 02:05:52,586
For the Queen.

1686
02:06:26,078 --> 02:06:27,496
Phambili!

1687
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:08,412
- Riri,
how's it going up there?

1688
02:07:08,912 --> 02:07:10,164
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1689
02:07:10,247 --> 02:07:11,707
I could really use
that backup right now.

1690
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:13,834
- I thought
you'd never ask.

1691
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:20,633
- Shit.

1692
02:07:25,095 --> 02:07:26,472
Shit, he's fast.

1693
02:07:27,139 --> 02:07:28,349
But I'm faster.

1694
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:35,564
Whoo!

1695
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,370
I got you.

1696
02:07:55,709 --> 02:07:57,044
It's on you now, Shuri.

1697
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,596
-Princess.
-- No.

1698
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:11,600
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1699
02:08:12,267 --> 02:08:15,270
- Pervaporation cells
activated.

1700
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:25,698
- What's wrong?

1701
02:08:26,448 --> 02:08:27,741
You need a glass of water?

1702
02:08:31,745 --> 02:08:33,455
-Yo, we got him.
-Good!

1703
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:34,832
Namor has been captured.

1704
02:08:34,915 --> 02:08:36,083
{\an8}

1705
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:42,464
Back to Wakanda!

1706
02:08:48,178 --> 02:08:49,179
Move out!

1707
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:16,165
-What is going on?

1708
02:09:16,248 --> 02:09:18,125
The sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

1709
02:09:40,355 --> 02:09:41,857
That can't be good.

1710
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:16,141
- Panther, the
Sea Leopard has lost power,

1711
02:10:16,225 --> 02:10:18,268
and they are experiencing
significant casualties.

1712
02:10:19,812 --> 02:10:20,813
Okoye.

1713
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:22,231
- Panther.

1714
02:10:22,356 --> 02:10:23,357
Phambili!

1715
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,441
Aneka.

1716
02:10:25,692 --> 02:10:26,693
Okoye!

1717
02:10:26,777 --> 02:10:28,153
It is time.

1718
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:34,117
- Phambili!

1719
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:40,082
For Wakanda!

1720
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:42,000
- Wakanda!

1721
02:10:50,342 --> 02:10:51,885
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1722
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:52,970
- Catastrophic.

1723
02:10:53,053 --> 02:10:54,429
His spear is made
of raw vibranium.

1724
02:10:54,513 --> 02:10:55,931
The ship could explode
at any second.

1725
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:57,015
Get us to the desert.

1726
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:17,119
-- No!

1727
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:46,607
{\an8}

1728
02:12:14,551 --> 02:12:15,552
I got you, sis.

1729
02:12:15,636 --> 02:12:16,720
Hold on.

1730
02:13:21,034 --> 02:13:22,035
{\an8}

1731
02:14:00,907 --> 02:14:02,117
- Get off me!

1732
02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:15,380
- All right, come here.

1733
02:14:18,675 --> 02:14:20,218
{\an8}

1734
02:14:45,994 --> 02:14:47,746
M'-
May the ancestors save us

1735
02:14:47,829 --> 02:14:49,456
if the princess
does not hurry.

1736
02:14:49,539 --> 02:14:51,249
We may be going to join them.

1737
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:53,251
If so, hey,

1738
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:55,670
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

1739
02:15:25,784 --> 02:15:27,202
It could've been different.

1740
02:15:31,790 --> 02:15:32,833
{\an8}

1741
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:51,184
Are you gonna be noble

1742
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:52,269
like your brother

1743
02:15:52,352 --> 02:15:53,687
or take care of business

1744
02:15:53,854 --> 02:15:54,896
like me?

1745
02:15:55,063 --> 02:15:56,606
I'm not my brother.

1746
02:15:58,024 --> 02:16:00,026
Namor will beg me for mercy

1747
02:16:00,694 --> 02:16:03,238
as I stand and watch
as he dies.

1748
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,361
{\an8}

1749
02:16:46,698 --> 02:16:48,408
-Wakanda forever!

1750
02:18:37,058 --> 02:18:38,560
- Shuri.

1751
02:18:40,103 --> 02:18:41,104
- Mama.

1752
02:18:44,065 --> 02:18:45,358
Show him

1753
02:18:45,734 --> 02:18:47,277
who you are.

1754
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:55,118
Yield,

1755
02:18:56,328 --> 02:18:58,663
and Wakanda
will protect your oceans.

1756
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:01,082
We will protect your secrets.

1757
02:19:01,249 --> 02:19:02,250
Yield,

1758
02:19:03,501 --> 02:19:05,211
and your people will live.

1759
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:11,634
Vengeance has consumed us.

1760
02:19:12,093 --> 02:19:14,721
We cannot let it
consume our people.

1761
02:19:23,521 --> 02:19:24,731
{\an8}

1762
02:20:10,735 --> 02:20:12,612
Wakanda forever!

1763
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:14,656
- Wakanda forever!

1764
02:20:38,888 --> 02:20:40,515
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1765
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:46,104
-Oou le le

1766
02:20:50,066 --> 02:20:52,694
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1767
02:20:52,777 --> 02:20:57,198
Oou oou
le le oou le le oou le oou le

1768
02:20:57,282 --> 02:20:58,950
Well, I pray that the universe

1769
02:20:59,033 --> 02:21:00,535
Thank you, my love.

1770
02:21:02,245 --> 02:21:04,914
Gives you way more
than you deserve

1771
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,586
When the tears fall
like shooting stars

1772
02:21:10,003 --> 02:21:11,838
Remember who you are

1773
02:21:12,547 --> 02:21:16,384
Just look up to the sky
You'll see

1774
02:21:16,468 --> 02:21:19,262
Well, I pray that the universe

1775
02:21:21,431 --> 02:21:24,267
Gives you way more
than you deserve

1776
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:25,518
- Yo.

1777
02:21:29,022 --> 02:21:31,149
-All set to head home?

1778
02:21:31,232 --> 02:21:32,317
As long as you're sure
the police

1779
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,860
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

1780
02:21:34,027 --> 02:21:35,653
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

1781
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:37,113
But you might
want to slow down

1782
02:21:37,197 --> 02:21:39,449
on your
homework-for-hire business.

1783
02:21:39,532 --> 02:21:41,910
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1784
02:21:43,203 --> 02:21:45,038
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1785
02:21:45,205 --> 02:21:46,206
Yes.

1786
02:21:46,539 --> 02:21:49,751
Your suit.
It's a great design,

1787
02:21:50,293 --> 02:21:51,544
but can't let you
leave with it.

1788
02:21:51,711 --> 02:21:52,921
It's all good.

1789
02:21:53,004 --> 02:21:54,297
Figured the least I could do

1790
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,049
is help Wakanda
clean up my mess.

1791
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:58,801
I have one more thing
to show you.

1792
02:21:59,219 --> 02:22:00,220
Come.

1793
02:22:04,224 --> 02:22:07,310
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

1794
02:22:07,477 --> 02:22:08,853
but it was worth it.

1795
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:10,522
- How did you...

1796
02:22:11,856 --> 02:22:13,399
It's my dad's car.

1797
02:22:14,651 --> 02:22:16,361
We used to
work on it before...

1798
02:22:16,444 --> 02:22:19,030
Oou le le oou le le oou le le

1799
02:22:19,113 --> 02:22:21,199
I'm coming back for you

1800
02:22:22,325 --> 02:22:24,202
-You sure this is her?
-Every part.

1801
02:22:24,369 --> 02:22:25,828
Have it shipped to Boston.

1802
02:22:25,995 --> 02:22:27,288
Be there before you arrive.

1803
02:22:32,835 --> 02:22:33,836
Bring it in, man.

1804
02:22:37,423 --> 02:22:41,719
- Panther, Miss Williams'
transport has arrived.

1805
02:22:42,345 --> 02:22:43,888
Look after yourself.

1806
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:46,641
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

1807
02:22:46,808 --> 02:22:47,892
Catch a Bulls game?

1808
02:22:49,143 --> 02:22:50,687
Sounds fun,

1809
02:22:50,770 --> 02:22:53,606
but I have something
I need to take care of.

1810
02:23:18,339 --> 02:23:20,800
And now I present to you

1811
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:22,135
Princess Shuri,

1812
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:23,595
the Black Panther!

1813
02:23:42,071 --> 02:23:44,907
The Black Panther
sends her regards,

1814
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:47,702
but she will not be
joining us today.

1815
02:23:48,828 --> 02:23:50,788
I, M'Baku,

1816
02:23:50,955 --> 02:23:53,499
leader of the Jabari Tribe,

1817
02:23:53,666 --> 02:23:55,126
son of Wakanda,

1818
02:23:56,628 --> 02:23:58,379
wish to challenge

1819
02:23:59,464 --> 02:24:00,840
for the throne.

1820
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:07,972
{\an8}

1821
02:25:32,432 --> 02:25:33,766
What the hell is this?

1822
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:36,269
-- Can we turn around?

1823
02:25:36,686 --> 02:25:38,646
- I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

1824
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:41,482
Why don't you go check it out?

1825
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:42,859
- Okay.

1826
02:25:45,653 --> 02:25:46,946
- Yeah,
this is Shauver.

1827
02:25:47,363 --> 02:25:49,365
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1828
02:25:49,532 --> 02:25:51,242
How do you want us to proceed?

1829
02:25:51,325 --> 02:25:52,785
-What the...

1830
02:26:03,421 --> 02:26:04,714
Ah!

1831
02:26:04,797 --> 02:26:07,133
A colonizer in chains.

1832
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,844
Now I have seen everything.

1833
02:26:09,927 --> 02:26:11,053
Funny.

1834
02:26:11,804 --> 02:26:12,805
{\an8}

1835
02:26:35,787 --> 02:26:36,788
- Merci.

1836
02:26:39,999 --> 02:26:41,000
{\an8}

1837
02:26:46,714 --> 02:26:47,715
- Hey.

1838
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:50,176
{\an8}

1839
02:26:52,386 --> 02:26:53,805
It's good to see you.

1840
02:26:54,555 --> 02:26:55,765
Everything is ready.

1841
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,308
Just give me one moment, eh?

1842
02:26:57,475 --> 02:26:58,810
Actually,

1843
02:26:58,976 --> 02:27:00,853
I think I should do it
on my own.

1844
02:27:02,063 --> 02:27:03,439
Of course.

1845
02:28:56,636 --> 02:29:00,056
Lift me up

1846
02:29:02,016 --> 02:29:05,436
Hold me down

1847
02:29:07,396 --> 02:29:11,609
Keep me close

1848
02:29:12,818 --> 02:29:16,197
Safe and sound

1849
02:29:18,282 --> 02:29:23,037
Burning in a hopeless dream

1850
02:29:23,537 --> 02:29:29,001
Hold me when you go to sleep

1851
02:29:29,085 --> 02:29:32,672
Keep me in the warmth
of your love

1852
02:29:32,755 --> 02:29:35,925
When you depart keep me safe

1853
02:29:36,008 --> 02:29:38,135
Safe and sound

1854
02:29:39,887 --> 02:29:43,224
Lift me up

1855
02:29:45,184 --> 02:29:48,938
Hold me down

1856
02:29:50,606 --> 02:29:54,527
Keep me close

1857
02:29:56,028 --> 02:29:59,407
Safe and sound

1858
02:30:01,367 --> 02:30:06,288
Drowning in an endless sea

1859
02:30:06,622 --> 02:30:11,836
Take some time
and stay with me

1860
02:30:12,169 --> 02:30:16,507
Keep me in the strength
of your arms

1861
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:19,176
Keep me safe

1862
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:21,429
Safe and sound

1863
02:30:23,055 --> 02:30:26,684
Lift me up

1864
02:30:28,561 --> 02:30:32,273
Hold me down

1865
02:30:33,816 --> 02:30:37,987
Keep me safe

1866
02:30:39,113 --> 02:30:42,283
Safe and sound

1867
02:30:44,660 --> 02:30:49,957
Burning in a hopeless dream

1868
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:55,171
Hold me when you go to sleep

1869
02:30:55,254 --> 02:30:59,383
Keep me safe

1870
02:30:59,467 --> 02:31:04,305
We need light
We need love

1871
02:31:06,307 --> 02:31:09,435
-Lift me up

1872
02:31:09,518 --> 02:31:11,771
In your arms

1873
02:31:11,854 --> 02:31:14,982
-Hold me down
-I need love, I need love

1874
02:31:15,066 --> 02:31:17,151
I need love

1875
02:31:17,234 --> 02:31:22,198
-Keep me safe
-Hold me

1876
02:31:22,281 --> 02:31:25,785
We need light
We need love

1877
02:31:38,464 --> 02:31:39,465
- Shuri,

1878
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,510
can we join you now?

1879
02:31:45,596 --> 02:31:48,641
This is my son, Toussaint.

1880
02:31:49,809 --> 02:31:50,810
Toussaint,

1881
02:31:51,477 --> 02:31:54,605
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1882
02:31:56,023 --> 02:31:57,024
Hi.

1883
02:32:17,962 --> 02:32:20,631
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

1884
02:32:20,798 --> 02:32:23,884
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

1885
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:26,470
Your father,

1886
02:32:27,096 --> 02:32:28,848
your baba,

1887
02:32:29,014 --> 02:32:31,684
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

1888
02:32:36,355 --> 02:32:38,399
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

1889
02:32:39,233 --> 02:32:42,153
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

1890
02:32:42,862 --> 02:32:45,656
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

1891
02:32:47,408 --> 02:32:48,993
Did my mother meet him?

1892
02:32:49,076 --> 02:32:50,077
- She did.

1893
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:00,796
It's nice to meet you.

1894
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:02,173
Nice to meet you.

1895
02:33:02,339 --> 02:33:03,883
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1896
02:33:04,383 --> 02:33:06,510
It holds a great history.

1897
02:33:06,677 --> 02:33:09,972
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

1898
02:33:13,267 --> 02:33:15,436
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1899
02:33:15,519 --> 02:33:16,520
Is that true?

1900
02:33:17,771 --> 02:33:20,566
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1901
02:33:23,569 --> 02:33:25,863
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1902
02:33:28,824 --> 02:33:29,992
{\an8}

1903
02:33:30,910 --> 02:33:33,120
My name is Prince T'Challa,

1904
02:33:33,204 --> 02:33:35,122
son of King T'Challa.

1905
02:35:02,376 --> 02:35:08,090
I give my heart to this place

1906
02:35:10,426 --> 02:35:16,807
I give my soul or whatever it takes

1907
02:35:16,890 --> 02:35:18,976
Never run away

1908
02:35:19,059 --> 02:35:25,232
I've got enough angels to storm the gates

1909
02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:27,318
I'm not afraid

1910
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:31,447
Behold the brave

1911
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:35,326
And I'll have it, no other way

1912
02:35:35,409 --> 02:35:41,373
I missed the emergence
and these moments of you

1913
02:35:41,498 --> 02:35:45,461
The mere reflection of me

1914
02:35:45,544 --> 02:35:49,381
That mirror can't change its view

1915
02:35:49,465 --> 02:35:52,301
So until those rivers run out

1916
02:35:52,384 --> 02:35:57,931
It runs through me wherever you are

1917
02:35:58,015 --> 02:35:59,850
I'll be there

1918
02:36:01,101 --> 02:36:04,271
We carry on

1919
02:36:06,482 --> 02:36:07,983
Born again

1920
02:36:08,067 --> 02:36:12,321
I give my heart to this place

1921
02:36:12,404 --> 02:36:15,783
I give my heart to this place

1922
02:36:15,866 --> 02:36:22,164
I give my whole soul and whatever it takes

1923
02:36:22,539 --> 02:36:24,166
Never run away

1924
02:36:24,291 --> 02:36:27,294
And I'd relive this

1925
02:36:27,378 --> 02:36:32,508
Just to see your face again

1926
02:36:32,591 --> 02:36:38,138
I know that you'll do the same

1927
02:36:39,264 --> 02:36:40,766
Born again

1928
02:36:40,849 --> 02:36:46,105
Just tell me what I need to do

1929
02:36:48,982 --> 02:36:54,488
I'd die and come back
just to love you

1930
02:36:57,241 --> 02:37:03,914
Just tell me
I'm begging you

1931
02:37:05,457 --> 02:37:11,296
Just tell me what I need to do

1932
02:37:12,256 --> 02:37:13,882
Oh

1933
02:40:53,238 --> 02:40:56,492
