you broke my nose.

00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,060
Behold!

1051
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,833
The head
of your precious queen,

1052
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,241
Furiosa!

1053
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,573
I have the Wolverine!

1054
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:13,906
I alone control her!

1055
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,139
You come for me,

1056
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,285
you come for her.

1057
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:21,683
So sorry.
I know it’s pronounced "him."

1058
00:42:21,683 --> 00:42:24,191
I’m gender blind.
It’s my cross to bear.

1059
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:25,522
Who’s next?

1060
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:26,853
- Toad!
- [snarls]

1061
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:28,657
You’re up.

1071
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:55,519
How long was I asleep?

1072
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:56,949
Not all of you was asleep.

1073
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,885
- [Deadpool grunts]
- Don’t bother.

1074
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:00,821
They’re very thorough.

1075
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:04,055
If you know where we are,
start talking.

1076
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:05,661
You’re in The Void.

1077
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,498
Think of it as purgatory.

1078
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:10,094
Reed called it
a metaphysical junkyard.

1079
00:43:10,094 --> 00:43:11,469
Where anything useless goes

1080
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,471
before it gets
annihilated forever.

1081
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:16,606
And where the TVA sends
people that don’t play nice

1082
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,036
with the rest
of the multiverse.

1083
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:19,444
- Like you?
- And you.

1084
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:22,040
[Deadpool] What does
the annihilating?

1085
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,612
Alioth.

1086
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,009
[Deadpool]
Alioth is in this thing?

1087
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,011
From Loki,
Season 1, Episode 5?

1088
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:29,179
Everyone here
is on the run from Alioth.

1089
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,719
Most don’t make it.

1090
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,490
There’s a resistance, though.

1091
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,592
Other people like us
that managed to survive.

1092
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:36,956
They’re hidin’ out
in the borderlands,

1093
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:39,893
trying to find a way
the fuck outta here.

1094
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:41,158
Then that’s where we go.

1095
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:42,995
[Deadpool] "We"? Us? A team?

1096
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,932
The answer is yes.
Shake on it.

1097
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:46,702
Fuck! You nicked it.

1098
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:48,704
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

1099
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:51,476
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

1100
00:43:51,476 --> 00:43:52,510
Make ’em fix things.

1101

1102
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,810
Something funny, bub?

1103
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,175
She might have somethin’
to say about that.

1104
00:43:58,175 --> 00:43:59,979
Who’s "she"?

1105
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:01,651
In The Void,

1106
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:04,181
you’re either food for Alioth

1107
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:06,018
or you work for her.

Paul Rudd finally aged.

Oh, you must be
this year’s Juggernaut.

1119
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:24,965
- Thank you.
- I’d keep your voices down.

1120
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:26,505
She don’t like the chatter.

1121
00:45:26,505 --> 00:45:28,408

Is that Charles?

Hey... Hey, Chuck! It’s us!

1125
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:49,429
That’s not Chuck.

1126
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:51,123
Ah, shit.

00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:52,696
[Deadpool] Oh, ableism. Great.

1128
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:55,996
That’s not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

1129
00:45:55,996 --> 00:45:57,602
A Wolverine.

1130
00:45:57,602 --> 00:46:00,968
I wondered when
I’d get one of you.

1131
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:01,771
You’re one of Xavier’s.

1132
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:04,070
[Deadpool] You-You know him?
You know Chuck?

1133
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,478
Oh, I knew him.

1134
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:06,413

[Deadpool] Amen. I’ve never
loved roommates. Mine’s blind.

1138

Except she can see cocaine.

1139

You want to chime in,

Who are you?

1142

Charles Xavier’s twin,
Cassandra Nova.

1143
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,026
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:28,468
Hmm. You two are cute.

1145
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:31,031
I have a good feeling
about this.

1146
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,166
And I’ve been trying to catch

all about you.

you’re a psychotic
megalomaniacal asshole.

His words, not mine.
Hellbent on domination
and pain.

1156
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:56,826
You said all that about me?

No! No! I don’t...

1158
00:46:57,827 --> 00:47:01,391
- I didn’t say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

to come to this.

I do get a Charles
through here.

1203
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:24,782
Never mine, though.

1204
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:27,587
No. He didn’t care to find me.

[Deadpool groans] Gen Z
and their trauma-bragging!

1206

Can’t you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

1207
00:48:34,561 --> 00:48:36,156
or cancer like the rest of us?

1208
00:48:36,156 --> 00:48:38,092
But I’m not like
the rest of you.

1209
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:39,698
Except maybe the Wolverine.

1210
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:42,833
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

You’re that scary, huh?

1212
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:46,067
The TVA certainly thought so.

1213
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:48,806
They sent me here
before I could walk.

1214
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:50,577
And you know,
it’s the best thing

1215

in a garbage dump.

in the garbage dump.

00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:10,157
What about your Charles?

1224
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:11,994
Did he protect you?

1225
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,996
Did he make you feel safe?

1226
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,965
We’re mutants.
We’re never safe.

1227

[whoops]

1230
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:25,073
[Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1231
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:26,877
I don’t...
I don’t want the smoke.

1232
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:28,043
I don’t have
any beef with you.

1233
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:29,880
I just want
to save my friends.

1234
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,815
I just... I want to go home.

1235
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:32,982
Well, the thing is,
I could get you home.

1236
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:34,687
- Good.
- But I don’t want to.

1237
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:37,921
[Deadpool] Not good.
[groaning]

1238
00:49:39,483 --> 00:49:41,584
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

1239
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:44,730
[Deadpool straining] Your...
fingers are inside me,

1240
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,489
but not in a good way.

1241
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:48,833
My brother could enter
one’s mind with a thought.

1242
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,000
I have to get my hands dirty.

1243
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,300
- [Deadpool groaning]
- [shushing]

1244
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:56,302
I’ve got you.

1245
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:00,042
[whispers] I’ve got you...

1246
00:50:01,406 --> 00:50:03,683
[Wade, muffled]
What do you mean?

1247
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,654
I can’t... I can’t reach you.
You’re not here.

1248
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:08,688
I’m right here.

1249
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:11,856
- No, you’re not. I can’t...
- I’m right here.

1250
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:15,090
Then show me.
You got to do something.

1251
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:16,520
Show you what?

1252
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,326
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

1253
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:25,562
Ever since they turned you
down, you took a knee.

1254
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:28,334
Baby, you never got back up.

1255
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:31,568
I know you’re
going through something.

1256
00:50:31,568 --> 00:50:33,845
Let me go through it with you.

1257
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:37,717
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

1258
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,084
Where’d you go?

1259
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,185
[Wade] Oh, my God.

1260
00:50:44,614 --> 00:50:46,484
[♪ melancholy music playing]

1261
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:48,860
You just say it. Okay?

1262
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,894
Say, "I don’t want you.

1263
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:51,830
"I don’t want to be with you."

1264
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,590
Go ahead. Say it.
Say... Say, "I don’t..."

1265
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,932
Say it.
You don’t wanna be with me.

1266
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,769
Tell me that
and I’ll walk away.

1267
00:50:56,769 --> 00:50:57,660
Say, "I don’t want you."

1270
00:51:05,668 --> 00:51:09,111
You’ll never fucking matter.

1271
00:51:12,576 --> 00:51:13,643
What?

1272
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:16,756
- You’ll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

- matter.
- matter...

1278
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:34,906
[Deadpool]
She never said that.

1279
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:35,808
- [Cassandra] No.
- [groans]

1280

[Deadpool groans]
You are so mean!

1283
00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:43,079
My brain could taste
your fingers,

1284
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,751
and they tasted like hate!

1285
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,952
And where in God’s name
is the intimacy coordinator?

1286
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:50,757
You’re so lost, Mr. Wilson.

1287
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:53,991
And long before you came here.

1288
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:55,454
This is Baby Knife.

1289
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:57,093
She’s gonna fuck you
in the face now.

1290
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:57,863
If you want to kill me,

1291
00:51:57,863 --> 00:52:00,129
it’s going to take
more than a little blade.

1292
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:01,658
[Deadpool] How about six?

1293
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:05,838
[laughs mockingly]
My boy’s wicked strong.

1294
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:07,565
That’s my big boy.

1295
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,237

- [strains] Almost done.
- Almost done what?

1316
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:15,908
Getting my knife out
of your buttocks,

1317
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,668
- pervert!
- Aah! Fuck!

Get your mind out of my pants!

1319
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:22,574
- I’m telling Blake.
- New rules.

1320
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,179
I talk now.

1321
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,950
That’s gonna be very hard
on the audience.

1322
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,513
Shut the fuck up!

1323
00:53:27,513 --> 00:53:28,283
Let me fuckin’ think.

1324
00:53:28,283 --> 00:53:31,319
Now we gotta get back
to Paradox, right?

1325
00:53:32,815 --> 00:53:33,585
Right?

1326
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:36,489
Je m’excuse. Am I allowed
to speak now or--

1327
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:39,393
Just nod, asshole.

1328
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:41,131
Right.

1329
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:42,462
Then we find the others
that poor kid, Johnny,

1330
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:43,903
was talking about
before you got him killed!

1331
00:53:43,903 --> 00:53:45,795
[Deadpool] "Poor kid."
He’s, like, 50!

1332
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:46,829
Yeah, if there’s
a chance they know

1333
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,402
how to get out of here,
we find ’em.

1334
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:50,734
And make those TVA fuckers
fix my shit

1335
00:53:50,734 --> 00:53:52,076
like you fucking promised!

1336
00:53:52,076 --> 00:53:53,836
[Deadpool] I smell quest.

1337
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:55,838
[sniffing]

1338
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:58,115
I smell food.

1339
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:04,924
So what made you finally wear
an honest-to-God costume?

1340
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:07,421
Mine’s red
so they can’t see me bleed.

1341
00:54:07,421 --> 00:54:10,556
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

1342
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:12,789
Have you been checked
for ADHD?

1343
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:13,757
Mm-mm.

1344
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:15,693
But I’ve had several STDs,

1345
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:18,432
which were probably caused
by ADHD.

1346
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:19,939
Fuck!

1347
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,007
What are you looking for?

1348
00:54:22,007 --> 00:54:23,976
Oh. Thank fuck.

1349
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:25,945
No, no, no, no, no.
That’s rubbing alcohol.

1350
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:27,705
You don’t want to drink--
Oh, yeah.

1351
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:29,839
There you go. Fuck that liver.

1352
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,675
[exhales]

1353
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:33,282
- Good. Okay.
- [sighs]

1354
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,416
What the fuck are those?

1355
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,120
Oh.

1356
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,122
Back in civilian life,
I wear a toupee,

1357
00:54:38,122 --> 00:54:40,157
but nobody knows. [chuckles]

1358
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:41,928
[laughing]

1359
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:44,656
Everybody knows.

1360
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:47,461
Wanna talk about
what’s haunting you,

1361
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:50,266
or should we wait
for a third act flashback?

1362
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:53,038
Ah... Go fuck yourself.

1363
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:57,306
You know...

1364
00:54:57,834 --> 00:55:01,211
in my world, you’re...
[clears throat]

1365
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,015
You’re well regarded.

1366
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:05,281
Yeah, well, not in mine.

1367
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:07,679
They don’t like me much
in mine either.

1368
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,614
You don’t say.

1369
00:55:08,614 --> 00:55:11,683
I wanted to be something,
you know. I...

1370
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,553
Shit, I wanted
to be an Avenger.

1371
00:55:13,553 --> 00:55:15,489
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1372
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:19,097
I didn’t make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1373
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:21,033
When my girlfriend left me,

1374
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:23,596
- and I just--
- You had a girlfriend?

1375
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:25,070
Yeah.

1376
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:26,038
Vanessa.

1377
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:28,403
When we met, she was a dancer.

1378
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:30,768
We had a whole life.

1379
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:32,803
It was good.

1380
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:35,839
But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.

1381
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:38,710
Fucked that right up.

1382
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:39,942
But you,

1383
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:40,877
you were an X-Man.

1384
00:55:40,877 --> 00:55:44,023
Fuck that.
You were the X-Man. You...

1385
00:55:45,189 --> 00:55:47,092
The Wolverine.

1386
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:51,030
He was a hero in my world.

1387
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:53,956
Yeah, well...

1388
00:55:54,429 --> 00:55:56,266
he ain’t shit in mine.

1389
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:04,307
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1390
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:06,210
He died.

1391
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:06,936
How?

1392
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:09,873
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked
by a tree, but,

1393
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:11,776
really, you just
ran out of batteries

1394
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:13,877
- trying to save someone.
- Who?

1395
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:16,088
The shitheels
