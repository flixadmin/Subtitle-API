[Whispering]
Batman's real.

159
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,040
Oliver: Come on.

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,920
Oliver:
If I remember right,

161
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:13,151
the radio station
was this way.

162
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
I'm surprised they put it
in the bad part of town.

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,176
It's cute how you think
there's a good part of town.

Barry: <i>Looks like
the one percenters</i>

166
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,714
bring the good part
with them.

167
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,000
This is why nobody
talks about Gotham, OK?

168
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,839
City might as well
be dead.

169

Man: <i>Sounds like you guys aren't
from around here.</i>

170
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,274
Probably don't know,

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,116
but Gotham tourism Bureau
collects a tax

172
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,555
on out-of-towners,

173
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,555
so phones, wallets,
watches now.

174
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,951
You know what, fellas?
I... we don't want any trouble,

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,555
so maybe we can just
talk this out, OK?

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,673
[Laughing]
Talk it out.

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,077
OK. I'll talk first.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Hey!

179
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,869
Agh!

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,679
On the ground now!

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,752
All of you, on the ground!
Show me your hands!

185
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,670
Oh, crap.

186
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,120
I need SWAT
at Nolan and Burton.

187
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,071
Green Arrow sighted at
Nolan and Burton.

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,197
Sir, we don't want
any trouble.

189
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah. Tell that
to Oliver Queen here.

190
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Oliver: Oliver,
stand down.

191

You realize that this
may not work, right?

194
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,271
Like, there may not be
a pattern to recognize.

195
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,231
Is there a suggestion bound
within that dose of pessimism?

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,736
Does the energy discharge
of the lightning

197
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,989
look familiar
to you?

198
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,616
The quantum amplitude is consistent
with a dimensional breach.

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,757
Exactly.
We're gonna need Cisco's help on this one.

200
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,719
Cisco:
I've been summoned!

201
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,840
OK. That was a disturbingly
coincidental entrance.

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,070
It wasn't
coincidental.

203
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,800
We'd been getting
the same red skies

204
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
and freaky lightning
in Central City,

205
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,640
and I'll tell you this much...
it wasn't speed force.

206

"We'd been," "wasn't,"

Caitlin: Interestingly,
the atmospheric Phenomenon ceased

209
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,136
the moment Barry and
Oliver left Central City.

210
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,720
It's like it packed up its
bags and followed them here.

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,956
That's why we came.

212
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,296
Caitlin: The Phenomenon has to be
related to Barry and Oliver's...

213

- OK, Caitlin. OK?
- Body swap?

don't say... ahem.

didn't tell her?

in touch with Laurel Lance

221
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,359
at the Star City
D.A.'s office or...

222
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,274
yeah.

would do them
some good."

224

Oliver: Heh.

225
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,034
What were you
thinking?

226
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,839
That you were about to
get yourself shot.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,336
- You're welcome.
- I was deescalating

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,953
the situation,
you know, like, uh...

229
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,190
- like I would?
- Uh-huh!

Guess what, man.

231
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,634
I handled it exactly
how you would!

232
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Kara: OK. You guys, maybe taking
on each other's personalities

233
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,832
worked for amazo,
but you were not gonna

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
talk your way out
of getting mugged,

235
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360
and you escalated the
situation way too fast.

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,536
So what would you
have done?

237
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,598
What I would have done is
supersped us right out of there.

seen is a gust of wind.

Oliver: I mean, hindsight
is 20/20,

240
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,616
but we'll follow
your lead next time.

241
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,936
Because there will
really be a next time

when someone threatens 3
superheroes with a gun.

- Who?
- I don't know.

Guess someone wanted to make
you guys their headache

247
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,356
instead of mine.

248

We'll show
ourselves out.

Please come with me.

to whoever bailed us out.

I really think
we've had

enough distractions
for one night.

253
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Yeah. I agree
with my friend.

We appreciate
the early release, whatever,

255
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,597
but we're really fine
on our own.

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,911
I'm afraid
my employer insists.

[Sighing]
OK.

us out of jail?

Doesn't sound
like him.

261
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,759
No, it wasn't.
Wayne left Gotham 3 years ago.

262
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,555
Why?
To go where?

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,150
No one knows.

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,158
So who's Manning
the shop now?

265
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Apparently after he left,
Bruce's board of directors

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,999
went to town with a bunch of
aggressive get-rich-quick deals.

Barry: <i>Yeah, but
an abandoned building</i>

didn't bail us
out, right?

269
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,595
Whoa.
That is definitely not Bruce Wayne.

Oliver Queen.

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Oliver: Ahem.

272
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,074
Barry: Yeah, yeah.
I'm Oliver Queen. Yeah.

- And you are?
- The rain on your parade.

274

If you're visiting Gotham
to compare grappling hooks

275
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,197
with Batman, you are
out of luck.

276
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,994
No one's seen him
in years.

[Whispering]
Told you.

278
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Myth.

279
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,799
Barry: I would never compare
myself to a total badass

280
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
like Batman.

281
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,352
What I think Oliver
is trying to say

282
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
is thank you for
getting us out of jail.

283
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,317
Oliver: What Oliver's
actually trying to say is

284
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,109
who are you,
and why are you helping us?

285
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,039
Gotham has enough problems
without a guy

286
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,675
in green leather showing
off his Arrows to everyone,

287
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,193
so the faster you find
what you're looking for,

288
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,160
the faster you can get
the hell out of my city.

289
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,696
Uh, but, what... what
should we call you...

290
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,552
rain, Ms. Parade?

291
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,357
Kane, Kate Kane.

292
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,754
She's cool.

293
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,680
You didn't tell her?!

294
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,957
Oliver... the actual
Oliver thought they had

295
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,112
enough problems
with Felicity already.

296
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, and you didn't think to
loop us in on the fact that you

297
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,040
were keeping the <i>Freaky Friday</i>
situation on the hush?

298
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,936
I was thinking it was more
like <i>Quantum Leap.</i>

299
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,056
Cisco: Well, if this were
like <i>Quantum Leap,</i>

300
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,856
they'd only look like themselves when
they see themselves in the mirror...

301
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,496
It depends on what type
of Quantum Leap...

302
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,801
Shouldn't we concentrate on
what this lightning came from?

303
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,638
- Right?
- Right, but...

304
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Curtis: Oh. Ahem.

305
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,656
Felicity: OK, guys. You don't
need to tip-toe around me.

306
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,160
It's just a lot
to process.

307
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,016
It's not every day that
you find out that your ex

308
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,240
is your husband
and vice-versa.

309
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,472
Cisco: Yeah. Iris was, pretty freaked out,
too, when she sussed it out.

310
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,438
Felicity: Wait. Iris.

311
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,120
You know, actually, John...
right before you came in,

312
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,536
John was just saying that we need
to really handle that lightning...

313
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,256
Felicity: Iris was able to tell
that something was off with Barry?

314
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,476
- No, not exactly.
- Oh, totally. I mean,

315
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,160
it was like lover's intuition.
- Stop.

316
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,616
Cisco: That's how you can
tell these two were...

317
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,360
you know, Felicity, um, there's something
very strange going on here,

318
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,597
so I wouldn't take this
as a commentary

319
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,035
on you and Oliver's
marriage.

320
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,720
No. My marriage
with Oliver is strained

321
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
by the fact that we've
become different people...

322
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,793
quite literally
in Oliver's case.

323
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
[Snaps fingers]

324
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,616
If the lightning strikes are
attempted dimensional breaches,

325
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,496
there might be a way to
stabilize the quantum flux

326
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,115
to allow whatever's trying to get
through to get through, right?

327
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,197
Curtis: Yeah. Of course.
Caitlin: Yeah.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,639
You guys try
facial recognition?

329
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
One of Bruce's R&D guys
still works in the building.

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,834
I can give this
to him.

331
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,275
Oliver: Uh, we did try it,

332
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,875
so thank you,
but no luck.

333
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,236
Besides, I'd think
if Wayne's R&D's

334
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,496
in the same shape
as this building,

335
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
it's not gonna really
do us any good.

336
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Suit yourself.

337
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,960
Seems strange,
doesn't it,

338
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,438
that Bruce Wayne and
Batman disappeared

339
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,159
from Gotham around
the same time.

340
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,517
Kate: Well, when Batman
left, the city went

341
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,869
to 5 different kinds
of hell,

342
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,839
which for Gotham is
really saying something.

343
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,674
Took a toll on Bruce.

344
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,196
Is that why he left?

345
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,120
Still trying to
figure that out.

346
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,680
Oliver: <i>Right, but you
work for him,</i>

347
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
and you don't know
why he left?

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Who said I work
for him?

[Door opens]

350

How'd it go
with Vesper?

351
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,110
Barry: She hung up
on me.

352
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
Apparently, I did
sleep with her.

353
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,256
- Kara: Hmm.
- Kate: <i>OK. The building is</i>

354
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,839
under renovation,
so this is

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,878
the best place for you
guys to work out of.

356
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,714
Oh, and the, uh,
wi-fi password's "Alfred."

357
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
So if Vesper's not
gonna help us,

358
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,800
we're just back
at square one.

359
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,593
No, we're not.
I lifted this off

360
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,114
of a computer
at the precinct.

361
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,118
It should have
the entire GCPD database.

362
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,674
You stole data
from the police?

363
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,355
No. No. The flash
did it.

364

- It's not funny.
- I'm not laughing.

[Knocking]

366
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,033
Did you lose the coin flip on
who has to come talk to me?

367
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,879
We didn't flip coins.
We drew straws.

368
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,832
I'm kidding.
Actually, I wanted to come talk to you

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,640
because I think I've got a
little bit more experience

370
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,359
with alternate realities
than you do.

371
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,593
So what words of wisdom
do you have for me?

372
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,872
That Iris probably has a little
bit more experience, as well,

373
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,437
and maybe that's why
she would have seen

374
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,636
something that
you didn't.

375
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,472
As for Oliver keeping
you in the dark,

376
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,039
when he and Barry tried to tell
us what was going on with them,

377
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,875
we knocked them unconscious and
locked them in the pipeline.

378
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,512
- Seriously?
- Wasn't our finest moment.

379
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,352
Look. I'm sure that
that's the reason

380
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
that Oliver didn't want to
take any chances with you.

381
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,197
I appreciate you
saying that...

382
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,795
But it's just another excuse
in a long list of excuses

383
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,030
for Oliver's behavior.

384
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,759
Oliver does love you,
Felicity.

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,835
Yeah? Well, what's love
without respect or trust?

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,070
I don't know,

387
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,718
but as long
as there is love,

388
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,794
you can't give up
on it.

Well, one good thing
about what's going on

395
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,911
is that I have something
to distract me.

396

Look at this.

your way with a computer.

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,676

I had to hold my own

showed up.

Kara: Oh. Illegal
experimentation, torture.

407
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,836
Hmm. Seems like he was
conducting experiments

408
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,559
on his own patients' brains.

409
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,029
Sounds like
a real charmer.

410
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,799
Well, he was acquitted.
All the charges

411
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,360
were dropped
on technicalities.

412
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,113
So where can we
find him now?

413
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,272
- No known address.
- What about employment?

414
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,800
Well, he was fired,
suspended

415
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
by the medical board
for two years,

416
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,160
but that was...
5 years ago.

417
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,758
- So no idea where to find him.
- No.

418
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,274

in Gotham.

I'm gonna put on
my work clothes

422
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,600
and do an X-ray flyby
of the city.

423

I don't think miss Kate
would be too thrilled

with us running
around her city.

425

Well, unless she has some
kryptonite stashed somewhere,

I'm really not worried.

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,993
I guess the name
Bruce Wayne carries

433
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,119
a certain notoriety.

434
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,875
Oh, I know.
Bruce Wayne's my cousin.

That makes
a lot of sense.

his private life
from the public eye

445
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,915
just got to be too much
for him and he broke?

446
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,195
Heh. Sitting
at that desk,

out that window,

450
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,716
you find a way
to not break.

Gotham without a fight.

wear versace and have
500 fewer tattoos.

455
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,120
Hmm. Those are the ones
that you can see.

456
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,194
Well, that's a mystery.

Oh. Is this the...
the old bard himself? Ha!

458

Hey. You... you wouldn't happen
to know a John Deegan, would you?

459
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,913
I would, actually.

460

He's a doctor
at arkham asylum.

461
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,515
Ah. I have to go
tell the boys.

462
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,117
Uh, hey.
Thanks for the help and the chat.

463

John: What the hell
is this?

464
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,976
Felicity: No offense,
but you'd need, like,

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,957
5 Ph.D.s for
the dumbed-down version.

466
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,793
How about the very
dumbed-down version?

people change bodies?

629
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,030
Deegan said he was using
the book to change reality.

630
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,476
Cisco: Same question.
How does a book change reality?

631
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,176
We'll figure that out when
we get back to Star City.

632
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,317
Guys, we're gonna need
some help with this lock.

633
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,472
Good. Then
you'll be leaving Gotham.

634
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,677
You guys have caused enough
problems for one night.

635
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
Hey. Would hitching a ride in the
Batmobile be out of the question?

636
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,398
Get... out.

637
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Sure.

638
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,076
- Kara: She really is like Batman.
- Barry: Yep.

639
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,556
I don't do
tearful good-byes.

640
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,400
No. I... I just wanted
to wish you luck.

641
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,679
Wherever your
cousin is,

642
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,832
I'm sure he's really
proud of you.

643
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
X-ray vision.

644
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,640
You really do have
a lot of tattoos.

645
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,311
Somehow, I feel like Kara Danvers
doesn't have a single one.

646
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,710
You know, it's such
a shame I have to go

647
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,758
because I feel like we
would make a good team.

648
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,799
World's finest.

Felicity: Oh. Look who
finally came back.

651
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,016
With what looks like
a fairly infamous book.

652
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,157
Caitlin: A book with
a cryptographic lock on it.

653
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,536
Oliver: Can you get to work on opening it,
please?

654
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,576
John: We don't have
a lot of time.

655
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,069
OK. Geek squad,
form up on me!

656
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,119
Not much
of a heartfelt reunion.

657
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,600
She's getting used
to everything.

658
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,480
Do you want me to talk to her as,
you know, you?

659
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,030
I think I'm in enough trouble
with Felicity as it is,

660
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,680
but no offense.

661
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,600
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a minute, then?

662
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,320
- Yeah. What's up?
- I just wanted to see

663
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,396
how you're doing.

664
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,035
I'm compartmentalizing.

665
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,240
I'll fix things
with Felicity later.

666
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,754
I don't mean
with Felicity.

667
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
We both saw some stuff
back at arkham.

668
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,837
I saw evil flash.

669
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,156
Eobard Thawne.

670
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,595
I saw Malcolm Merlyn.

671
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,035
- Oh.
- I knew you'd been

672
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
through a lot,
but...

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I don't know, man.
I never realized.

674
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,840
I don't know
how you do it.

675
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
I wouldn't be
able to live

676
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,560
with the Burdens
that you carry.

677
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Yes, you would.

678
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,312
Barry, I always thought
that you had it easy,

679
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,479
everything was just
sunshine and rainbows

680
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,872
and... everybody likes you.

681
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,512
You have real steel
in you, my friend.

682
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,080
You can carry any Burden
thrown your way.

683
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,754
Some unsolicited
advice?

684
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Hmm.

685
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,638
Don't wait to work things
out with Felicity.

686
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,076
Our line of work,
you never know how much time you got.

687
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,273
Not only is the lock
cryptographic...

688
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,416
It's metaphysical.
The readings I'm getting off this thing

689
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,432
are nuts... and, yes,
that's a technical term.

with Felicity for a minute?

This must be strange
for you.

694
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,670
Oh. What gave you
that idea?

695
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,917
I don't know.
Maybe it's easier for you to hear this

That we're gonna be OK.

700
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,553
People change, Felicity.

701
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,200
It means we're growing.

702

It means we're
evolving,

except for one thing,

704
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,552
one thing that
will not change...

705
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,312
Is how I feel
about you.

706
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,632
Love is too small
a word...

707
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,833
And no matter who you are

708

or... or what you become,

you will always be
the love of my life.

My Earth, Earth 90.

726
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,797
I've traveled from there
to warn you.

727
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,470
- Warn us about what?
- His name is mar novu,

728

but he calls himself
the monitor now.

729
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,871
He's been unleashing
the book of destiny

730
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,953
across the multiverse
to test different Earths.

731
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,270
Test them for what?

732
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,274
A crisis that he
believes is coming.

733
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,793
Novu thinks
the elseworlds created

734
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,111
by the book of destiny
approximates

735
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,433
the collision of realities
that we're facing.

you're gonna
stand down.

742
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,075
You're gonna use that book to
help us set reality right.

743
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,840
Well, I certainly
wouldn't have placed it

744
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,678
in Deegan's hands
if that were my intent.

745
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,990
Enough.

746
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,233
You will not do
to this Earth

what you did to mine.

748

against him.

You're causing chaos,

everyone else!

In the hope of finding
the champions

763

Uh... speed us out of here.

789
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,236
I can't.
Can you?

790
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Nope.

791
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,435
Oliver Queen.

792
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,678
I've been waiting
to do this

793
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,917
for a long time.

794
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Diaz: Unh!

795
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Barry: Aah!

796
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,549
Should I follow you? What...

797
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Hey!

798
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,713
[Whoosh]

799
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,716
There's no place you can run
where I can't find you.

800
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
It's over.

801
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
Man: <i>Greg, move your head.</i>
