1
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:02,158
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,076
Where's your mother?!

3
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:04,376
The white-haired woman!

4
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,211
She took her!

5
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,580
Deliver Sara's killer,
or the citizens of Starling

6
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:10,882
will see what the League
of Assassins is capable of.

7
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:12,817
I will tell Ra's
this was you,

8
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:14,719
that Thea was
under your control.

9
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,056
And he will still kill her.
She fired the arrows.

10
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:20,558
There's nothing
that I won't do to protect you.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,527
What does that mean?
I killed Sara.

12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,363
By League law, I have the right
to challenge you

13
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,532
to a trial
by combat.

14
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,368
You covet death that much?

15
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,260
Hey, I want
air support now!

16
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:57,228
These bastards,
they shot one of our own!

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,864
That cop was just asking
for my license, man,

18
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,900
you didn't have
to shoot him!

19
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,643
Get me closer!

20
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:24,622
Come on!
Damn it!

21
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:27,926
Yes!

22
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:31,729
It's him!

23
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:33,465
I thought
he was green.

24
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,772
This bike is sick!

25
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:42,640
Ok, not supposed to be
having fun right now.

26
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:43,741
Sorry!

27
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,477
No, sorry
is what you'll be

28
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,079
when Oliver finds
out you took out his motorcycle.

29
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,382
Ok, I've got him headed your way.
Aim for the engine block.

30
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,251
There's the green one.

31
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:58,723
This suit is too tight.

32
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:00,291
If they make it to the tunnel,
we're going to lose them.

33
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:01,993
You're not helping.

34
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:10,368
I thought he was
supposed to be good!

35
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:22,680
Who the hell
are you?

36
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:33,158
I'm more of a Glock
kind of guy.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,393
I didn't say anything.

38
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:39,417
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 3x10 ♪</font>

40
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,888
One caught,
one got away,

41
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,923
but even Oliver bats
.500 sometimes.

42
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,724
Any luck finding Oliver?

43
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,427
Not yet, but I have every reconnaissance
satellite I could hack,

44
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,129
which is a lot,
looking for him.

45
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,065
So the second he steps outside,
we'll know.

46
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,234
If he steps outside.

47
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,036
It's what
we were all thinking.

48
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:03,838
I'm not. It's only
been three days.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,042
I have to head to my other
office for a bit.

50
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:09,878
Ok, I know it's only been
three days,

51
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,213
but how much
longer before

52
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,749
we actually have to start
worrying?

53
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,420
I expected this kind of
blunder from Mr. Queen,

54
00:03:18,422 --> 00:03:20,488
but not from you.

55
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,223
You were too bold.
You should have checked with me

56
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,758
before abducting
that scientist.

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,093
We were just following
the trail for Omega--

58
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,995
like you ordered us to!

59
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:30,265
I ordered you to be cautious.
That's how you protect yourself.

60
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,200
And your loved ones.

61
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,369
We need to assemble
an extraction team to free my wife.

62
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,904
From where?
We don't know where

63
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:37,339
Chien Na Wei
is located,

64
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,873
and we have more
pressing concerns.

65
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,176
She has the Omega.
We find her, we find Tatsu,

66
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,345
we get them both
out of wherever they are.

67
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,280
If only it were
that simple.

68
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,915
We've learned that
the bio weapon

69
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:49,250
is actually comprised of
two components.

70
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:52,153
The Omega she has is harmless
without its counterpart, Alpha.

71
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:54,055
And where's that?

72
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:55,557
Currently
in the possession

73
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,392
of the Hong Kong
military.

74
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,561
Oh, so it's safe.
Far from it.

75
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,263
The only way to secure
the counterpart Alpha is to destroy it.

76
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,599
And by the time we do,
my wife will be dead.

77
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,369
Alpha is being
kept here,

78
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:10,238
in a PLA military
laboratory.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,840
The two of you,
with back-up,

80
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:14,042
will break into
the facility and recover the vial.

81
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,344
It's tagged
with a GPS tracker,

82
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,713
which you'll need
to disable before extraction.

83
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,783
And what about Tatsu?
Stop ignoring me!

84
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:24,586
I'm not ignoring
you, Mr. Yamashiro.

85
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:27,589
I'm merely focusing
on the task at hand,

86
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,157
which,
at the moment,

87
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,793
is not recovering
your wife.

88
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,504
Ahh. All right.

89
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:46,107
This will be gauntlet pulse
test, 37 Alpha.

90
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,081
Two second burst
at 800 volts.

91
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,451
In 5, 4,

92
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:00,655
3, 2, 1.

93
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:03,258
Oh, damn it!

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,027
Clowns?

95
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,462
Practice targets.

96
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,397
Clowns always
freaked me out as a kid.

97
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,533
Well, you're showing
them who's boss now.

98
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:13,268
Well, I would be, if I could
figure out how to modulate

99
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,903
the stress-energy tensor.

100
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,971
Hmm. Ray,
I've been thinking.

101
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,440
About overclocking
the magnetic coils?

102
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:20,108
Because I tried that.
No.

103
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,177
About what you're doing.

104
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,845
And about me helping you do it.

105
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:26,514
Save the city,
you mean?

106
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,917
Risk your life.

107
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,587
I know you think you're going to be safe
inside that suit of armor.

108
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:35,957
I know there's like a gajillion movies
that make it look easy.

109
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,027
Well, the Arrow and his partner
go out there every night,

110
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:41,362
without armor.

111
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:43,598
And...one night,

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,667
hopefully very far
off in the future,

113
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,969
they're not going
to come back.

114
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,872
I don't want that
to happen to you.

115
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:57,178
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

116
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,780
Start small.

117
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,449
Just see if you can get
the Nanite chip to function.

118
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,101
The cop he shot?
Father of three.

119
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,337
Doc says he may never walk again,
and that's if he makes it.

120
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,105
'Cause right now,
he's 50/50.

121
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:26,441
All right, Miss Lance,

122
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:28,676
you're up.

123
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,915
The People versus
Jermaine Fisher.

124
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,750
Mr. Fisher
is charged with

125
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,719
41 counts
of attempted murder,

126
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:41,723
including 16 counts of attempted murder
of a police officer.

127
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,825
So no bail
is what you're saying?

128
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:46,828
Vigorously,
Your Honor.

129
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,098
Just as the defendant vigorously
moves to dismiss all charges.

130
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,268
Mr. Fisher's apprehension
was not affected by the police,

131
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,136
but rather by vigilantes.

132
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,705
The circumstances
of Mr. Fisher's arrest are irrelevant.

133
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:01,042
Produce the Arrow
as an eyewitness and we'll find out.

134
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:04,712
That won't be necessary.

135
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,582
We have the weapon
with Mr. Fisher's fingerprints

136
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,150
all over it,
Your Honor.

137
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:12,320
Motion to dismiss
denied, bail denied.

138
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:15,123
Please remand
Mr. Fisher into custody.

139
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,201
How did it go
at A.R.G.U.S.?

140
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,636
Lyla tapped all of our
worldwide contacts.

141
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,338
No sign of Oliver.

142
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,173
And no idea
where he could be.

143
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,775
Well, he'll tell us
when he gets back.

144
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:36,010
Until then, we should focus
on keeping the lights on.

145
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,146
The two cop shooters
we took on last night;

146
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,948
I've been trying to find
the one that got away.

147
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,482
Jose Anton.

148
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:43,484
Anton is attached to a new crew
working the Glades,

149
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:46,187
the head of which
is this gentleman.

150
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,224
I know that guy.
That's Danny Brickwell.

151
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,558
His street name's Brick.

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,926
But I thought
he was in Iron Heights.

153
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,928
He was.
Until a week ago.

154
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,097
And then the case
against him imploded.

155
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,233
By which I mean
every single witness

156
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,968
suffered some sort
of fatal accident.

157
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,303
Three guesses as to who the police
suspect in those cases.

158
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:06,207
Jermaine Fisher and the guy who
got away last night.

159
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,009
Jose Anton.

160
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,911
So they kill witnesses
in order to get Brick out of prison,

161
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:12,247
and then shoot
a cop to do...what?

162
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:14,782
That's what
we have to find out.

163
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:17,051
I'll hit the streets.

164
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,292
You have that look
you always get

165
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,127
right before you tell
Oliver something...

166
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,929
Sagely.

167
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,931
Yes, and this is
about Oliver.

168
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,300
You think I'm in denial.

169
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,601
I think four
days ago,

170
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,836
Oliver challenged
the world's

171
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,237
greatest assassin
to a duel.

172
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,040
He survived Lian Yu.

173
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,743
And Hong Kong,
and god know what else.

174
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:46,014
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn
and Slade Wilson.

175
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,917
You have to believe in him.

176
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,719
Oh, I do believe
in him, Felicity.

177
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:54,422
It's just, I'm preparing myself
for the possibility

178
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:57,492
that things didn't
go Oliver's way.

179
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,662
Not this time.

180
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:05,466
You need to prepare
yourself, too.

181
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:15,476
Please,
Oliver, where are you?

182
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,448
Y'all best step off.

183
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,917
Brick is a friend
of mine.

184
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,554
You're more than
a friend, Anton.

185
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,556
You're like a brother.

186
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,462
Always had my back.

187
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,765
Always loyal.
Stand up.

188
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,701
So when they told me

189
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,704
someone ignored
my orders to lay low;

190
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:24,943
when they told me one
of my crew shot a cop...

191
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:27,679
I beat the man
who said it was you.

192
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,448
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,585
Danny, that cop?

194
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,587
It was a mistake.

195
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,225
What we're planning here
requires two things.

196
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:43,561
No mistakes, and the cops not
knowing anything.

197
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:46,598
They still don't. Fisher's not going
to say anything.

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,234
Was this side job
his idea or yours?

199
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,848
It doesn't have
to be like this.

200
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,817
Bro!

201
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,953
I dropped my first body
with that piece.

202
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,622
You know the deal;

203
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,024
you take me down first,
you walk out alive.

204
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:32,744
He actually tagged me.

205
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,984
All yours, boys.

206
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:46,624
Your attorney doesn't have your
best interests at heart, Mr. Fisher.

207
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,860
Otherwise, you'd be walking
out of here a free man.

208
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,763
Yeah, more like
a dead man.

209
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:53,998
Do you think you scare me more
than Brick does?

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Think again.

211
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,536
You have
a real nice day now.

212
00:11:58,538 --> 00:12:02,474
No, he didn't flip.
He likes breathing too much.

213
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,985
When your opponent is the mountain,
you must be the sea.

214
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:16,321
When he is the sea,
you must be the mountain.

215
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,223
Poetic.
Switch your attacks.

216
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:20,091
Never do the same move
more than twice.

217
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:23,528
Otherwise, your opponent
will learn to read you.

218
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,837
Something like that?

219
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,612
Well, I wouldn't recommend texting
during a real fight.

220
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,881
Sorry.

221
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:45,183
I--I thought
it might be Ollie.

222
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,078
He hasn't been home.

223
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:48,243
He hasn't returned
any of my calls or texts.

224
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:51,089
I didn't realize his absence was
weighing on you.

225
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,291
It's not weighing,
it's worrying.

226
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:55,126
If you like,

227
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,995
I could have some of my
old associates

228
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,696
look into Oliver's
whereabouts.

229
00:12:58,698 --> 00:12:59,964
Would you?

230
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:01,699
Of course.

231
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,835
He's family.

232
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:08,706
According to Laurel,
Fisher's lawyer called Brick

233
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,975
with the time and the place
of the outgoing call.

234
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,744
Can you trace that call
back to where Brick is?

235
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,078
At least where
his phone is.

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,548
His burner phone,
to be exact.

237
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,182
It's at a warehouse
in the Glades.

238
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,118
We'll check it out.

239
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,401
I'll have to talk you in from Palmer Tech.
I'm crazy-late.

240
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,857
This is the only
vulnerable entrance.

241
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:28,092
Because it's not
actually an entrance.

242
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,595
Not until
we make it one.

243
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,330
I'll shoot out
the glass.

244
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,299
You get in
and find the Alpha.

245
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,902
We won't have much time
once we breach.

246
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,238
Two minutes max before
the alarms draw attention.

247
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,874
Head directly for the lab.

248
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:45,076
I'll be right behind you.

249
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:47,879
You ok?

250
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:50,181
Waller said when we get
this done,

251
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:52,784
she'll get
Tatsu back.

252
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:55,620
She's lying.

253
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,116
Ahh!

254
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:34,859
On the move!
30 seconds.

255
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,628
Copy that.

256
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,364
I've got eyes
on the target warehouse.

257
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,599
But no signs of life. Felicity,
you seeing something I don't?

258
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,434
The warehouse doesn't have any
security cameras,

259
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,770
but someone disabled
all the traffic cams on that block,

260
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:48,439
which probably
means you're in the right place.

261
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,308
You sure ditching
the arrow suit was a good idea?

262
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,744
Only if I need
to move or shoot.

263
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,582
In position.

264
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:00,885
Clear.

265
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:04,555
Yeah, I got
something.

266
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,993
It's not big enough
to be Brick.

267
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,629
Yeah, I know.

268
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:14,499
What's this?

269
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:19,504
They burned
their burners.

270
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,706
Yeah,
torching evidence,

271
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,775
tying up loose ends.

272
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:26,377
Evidence of what?

273
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,514
I don't know.
These just look like numbers.

274
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,487
I found this.

275
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,790
What looks like
some industrial blueprints.

276
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,826
Hmm. These numbers look
completely random.

277
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:45,296
I can run a pattern
recognition algorithm.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,535
Oliver?

279
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,839
Oliver?!

280
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,677
Could you
put the gun away?

281
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,813
They don't scare
so much as annoy me.

282
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:09,654
I've only come
here to talk.

283
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,891
Would it be possible
too that?

284
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,993
Talk about what?

285
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,361
Oliver.

286
00:16:17,363 --> 00:16:18,629
I need to know...

287
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:20,698
Is he still alive?

288
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,467
He's alive.

289
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,403
Have you heard from him since
he went off to face

290
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,805
Ra's al Ghul?

291
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,607
He's alive.

292
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:34,846
If he were, I suspect you would
have heard from him by now.

293
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,181
Unless Ra's
took him prisoner,

294
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:39,717
and Demon's Head does
not take prisoners.

295
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:50,690
What are you doing?

296
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,259
I'm running
the pattern analysis

297
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,561
on that list of numbers
you guys found.

298
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,663
No, I mean, what's the point?

299
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,765
Malcolm Merlyn didn't
tell us anything we don't already know.

300
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,201
Nothing has changed.

301
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,637
You're right,
Felicity.

302
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,106
He didn't tell us
anything new.

303
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,208
But he may have been
right all the same.

304
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,410
I know you guys
think I'm in denial.

305
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:12,612
But if there's one thing Oliver
taught me--he taught us--

306
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,114
is that sometimes,
all you can do

307
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,782
is keep pushing
forward.

308
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,318
All right.

309
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,053
I've got the M.E.'s report.

310
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:22,122
Did they ID
the body?

311
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,890
Jose Anton.

312
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,393
Career criminal with ties
to Danny Brickwell.

313
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,595
I think Brick severed
those ties pretty thoroughly.

314
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,000
Is everything ok?

315
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,170
Where's Oliver?

316
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,774
He went to fight
the head

317
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:43,109
of the League of Assassins.
What?!

318
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,812
And we haven't heard from him
since he left.

319
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,948
There's something else--

320
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,684
Malcolm Merlyn stopped by
for a little chat.

321
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,353
He says Oliver's dead.

322
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,989
And you guys believe him?

323
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,557
Look, Laurel,
Merlyn said--

324
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,426
There isn't one thing
that Malcolm Merlyn can say

325
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,094
that any of us should believe.

326
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,430
This isn't the first time

327
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:06,032
that I've heard
that Oliver was dead.

328
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:08,468
He's been back before.

329
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,137
He'll be back again.

330
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,532
Clear.

331
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:36,723
Found it!

332
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:38,958
Aah!

333
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:44,364
Hong Kong military?

334
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,701
Triad.

335
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,170
Chien Na Wey's men.

336
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:53,973
Any luck?

337
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:57,110
The number pattern is consistent with
cataloguing numerics.

338
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,812
What kind of catalog?

339
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,747
If I knew, I would be
telling you.

340
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:02,849
I'm sorry to interrupt.

341
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,385
We really need
to change the locks.

342
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,153
What
do you want?

343
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,756
The League conducts matter
of significance such as duels

344
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,425
on grounds sacred
to its beliefs.

345
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,028
I went there.

346
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,531
And found this.

347
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:26,206
It's Ra's' custom
to leave behind

348
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,408
the instrument
of death

349
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,044
as a memorial
to honor the fallen.

350
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,314
Merlyn, did you see...

351
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,382
Oliver's body?

352
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:38,251
It fell into
a ravine.

353
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:41,354
His remains were
unrecoverable, I'm afraid.

354
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:44,491
Then how do we know
that's Oliver's blood?

355
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,694
Because after I leave,
you'll test it.

356
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,163
And after you confirm that
it is his blood,

357
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,732
you'll exhaust yourself with
conspiracy theories

358
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:56,703
as to how I planted it
or how it's all a lie.

359
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,405
And after enough
time passes,

360
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:03,376
you'll be left with
one inescapable truth--

361
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,912
that Oliver Queen
is dead.

362
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:10,016
This is your fault.

363
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,719
Oliver went there
because of you--

364
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:14,587
because of what
you did to Thea.

365
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,456
You made her a target
for the League so he would have

366
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,726
to challenge Ra's
just to save her.

367
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:22,996
You killed him.

368
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,465
You are right.

369
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,568
And I will live
with that guilt

370
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,171
for the rest of my days.

371
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:34,107
I am truly sorry.

372
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,975
I can see how much
you loved him.

373
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,578
Save it, Merlyn.

374
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,414
You're enjoying this.

375
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,184
Miss Smoak
is correct.

376
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:47,086
I orchestrated
the matter

377
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,088
to eliminate
the death warrant

378
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,724
Ra's placed
on my head.

379
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,359
Oliver was that way.

380
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:56,296
His death
means my own.

381
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,865
Good.

382
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,377
What's that?

383
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:50,849
The blood analysis
on the scimitar.

384
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:52,951
It's Oliver's.

385
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:56,722
99.997% match.

386
00:22:56,724 --> 00:23:00,993
If Merlyn's lying,
he's being thorough about it.

387
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:06,231
Felicity...

388
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,335
Thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

389
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,373
I got to go to work.

390
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,507
You really don't.

391
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,643
It's fine.

392
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:20,312
I'm glad we know now.

393
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:35,394
Run for the exit!
I'll cover you!

394
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:36,762
What about you?

395
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,797
You get the Alpha out of here!
But--

396
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,666
Away from them! Go!

397
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,131
You had him.
Why didn't you take the shot?

398
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,167
We need to get out of here.

399
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,302
Now.

400
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,550
You know, it's weird.

401
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:35,153
I don't think I've ever actually
seen you drink alone.

402
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,222
You ok?

403
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:38,924
Yeah.

404
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,792
I just got some bad news
about a friend.

405
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:44,296
Anyone I know?

406
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,498
How are you doing?

407
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,834
Still freaking
out, actually.

408
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,269
Worried about Ollie.

409
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,505
I was going
to ask you a favor,

410
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,707
but it doesn't seem
like the right time.

411
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:58,477
Well, it depends.
What's the favor?

412
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,012
You and the Arrow, you're...

413
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,014
you're close, right?

414
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,649
I mean, that's you
I've been seeing on the news

415
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,017
in the red hood?

416
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,252
Thea...

417
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:08,920
Look, I haven't seen him,

418
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:10,288
I haven't heard from him,

419
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,225
he's not answering
any of my phone calls.

420
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:15,360
I'm actually starting
to get really worried.

421
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,363
So...I thought
maybe the Arrow

422
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,699
could look for Oliver?

423
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:22,901
I just thought maybe
if you saw him,

424
00:25:22,903 --> 00:25:24,669
you could ask.

425
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,976
Thank you.
You're the best.

426
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:34,579
Look, I-- I better go check
the stock room.

427
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,355
Thea just asked me
to talk to the Arrow

428
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,357
about finding Oliver.

429
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,858
And what'd you
tell her?

430
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,360
What else? I lied.

431
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:50,862
Oliver didn't want
Thea to know.

432
00:25:50,864 --> 00:25:54,065
That was then.
But now, what's the point?

433
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,268
I keep asking myself
the same question, Roy.

434
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,870
Then why do you keep
going over the case evidence?

435
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:02,107
Because it helps me keep
my mind off of Oliver.

436
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:03,909
Doing this
without him

437
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:06,278
while we're waiting for him
to come back is one thing,

438
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,914
but doing all this without him,
without m?

439
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,515
That's a whole
other situation.

440
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,050
What do you want me
to tell you, Roy?

441
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:13,819
I can only see one inch
in front of me

442
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,488
and this is the only thing
in front of me right now.

443
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:22,894
I keep looking
at this file, and...

444
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,464
Something about it
feels familiar.

445
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:29,167
Yeah. Felicity did say that Fisher
and Anton were connected with Brick.

446
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,803
No, it's more
than that.

447
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,043
I've seen this file
somewhere...

448
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,012
Else.

449
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:43,415
What are the chances
that's a coincidence?

450
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,283
Hey, there's only
way to find out.

451
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:46,885
What are you
doing?

452
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,687
Bringing up
the case numbers

453
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:51,122
on the all guys we've put away over
the past eight months.

454
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,426
Some of these are guys
that we caught.

455
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:57,929
Yeah. And others were apprehended
by the authorities.

456
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,599
There's a pattern here.

457
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,468
All these guys
are awaiting trial

458
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,471
for assault--assault
with intent, murder,

459
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:07,572
attempted murder.

460
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,574
Street enforcers.
Muscle.

461
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:13,144
Why would Brick have a list of
these case numbers?

462
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:24,523
Ah, I'm sure you're wondering
if I ever go home.

463
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,925
Unfortunately for my assistant,
the answer's no.

464
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:29,961
Any luck with our
Nanite problems?

465
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,530
No.

466
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:33,798
Yeah, it's the transplex
interface, isn't it?

467
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
I knew my designs were off.

468
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:37,769
It won't...work.

469
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:40,005
Yeah, well, you've only
been at it for a day, so.

470
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:41,606
Not the chip.

471
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,942
Not your suit.

472
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:47,112
Your plan.

473
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:50,048
It won't work.

474
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,750
You--you make it sound like

475
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:54,452
using an enhanced exoskeleton
to fight crime and save the city

476
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:56,254
is a loony tune idea.

477
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:59,791
It won't
bring her back.

478
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:03,161
Anna.

479
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,829
Your fiancé.

480
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,164
I know who she is.

481
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,999
She's not coming back.

482
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:12,604
When we lose...
Someone,

483
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:15,840
when someone dies,

484
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:18,176
they're gone.

485
00:28:18,178 --> 00:28:20,845
Forever, and there
is nothing--

486
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:24,015
there is nothing

487
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:28,653
nothing that we can do that
is going to bring them back.

488
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,523
So you have to stop.
You have to stop,

489
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,359
because it's not what Anna would
have wanted. It's--

490
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,328
you're upset. I can see that.
And if you want,

491
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,063
we can talk about it.

492
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,532
But never tell me again

493
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:43,068
what Anna would have wanted.

494
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,738
You don't get to do that.

495
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,978
I am sorry.

496
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:56,781
I shouldn't...

497
00:28:56,783 --> 00:28:58,850
be here right now.

498
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,660
What?

499
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:10,328
We got
something on Brick.

500
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,763
The blueprints
we found?

501
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:12,998
They're schematics

502
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,532
for the warehouse
where the police

503
00:29:14,534 --> 00:29:16,201
store all their physical evidence
and active cases.

504
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,370
And Brick has a list
of case numbers.

505
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:21,072
We think he might be looking
to steal or destroy evidence

506
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,674
to get those cases
thrown out of court.

507
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,276
Yeah. I'll call
Lance, tell him.

508
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,130
A lot of these cases
are on guys who were put away

509
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:28,948
within the past eight months.

510
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:32,917
This is everything we've been doing since
we took Slade down.

511
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,286
This is everything
Oliver was working for.

512
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:37,989
I'll be right there.

513
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,745
Three minutes.

514
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:17,222
Seal off every exit.

515
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:19,023
Give me a two block
perimeter.

516
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:26,331
John, shooter at your five.

517
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,802
I'm out!

518
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:35,940
Here, use mine.

519
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:37,909
So here's the deal--

520
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:40,712
you take me down,
you walk out alive.

521
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:44,215
I don't fancy your chances,
though.

522
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:55,030
Smart man.

523
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:58,033
Nobody thinks about going
for a head shot.

524
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:15,117
Shots fired! I need ESU
and back-up here, now!

525
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,655
Felicity!

526
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:22,191
Where's Diggle?
I'm pinned down!

527
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,959
Felicity!

528
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,327
Felicity!

529
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:30,032
Any...Last...Words?

530
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:33,269
Or are my hands too tight
around your neck?

531
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:39,541
I guess arrows work a little better
on this guy than bullets.

532
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,120
You ok?

533
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:53,756
Yeah, I will be, after we find
the son of a bitch.

534
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:05,067
Damn it!

535
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,239
Oh, my god, John!

536
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:13,709
It's ok, it's all right,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

537
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,511
Brick?

538
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,913
Got away. They put
one guard in the hospital

539
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,182
on the way out, but he's
going to pull through.

540
00:33:20,184 --> 00:33:22,284
If that door hadn't shut,
we would have had him.

541
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:25,421
Just bad luck.

542
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,656
Unless it wasn't.

543
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:28,523
You were pinned down.

544
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,265
You both were. They
were going to kill you!

545
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:31,961
Felicity...

546
00:33:31,963 --> 00:33:33,362
You did that?

547
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:36,932
They had machine guns.
You had a bow and arrow.

548
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,802
You let him
get away?

549
00:33:39,804 --> 00:33:41,337
I saved your lives.

550
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:45,007
Felicity, it wasn't
your call to make.

551
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:48,177
It wasn't my call to let Oliver go
challenge Ra's al Ghul

552
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,878
to a fight
to the death, either!

553
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,681
Brick has who knows
how much evidence, Felicity.

554
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,184
And it was either that
or the two of you.

555
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:57,319
My friends being killed.
So I made my choice.

556
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:01,357
I chose not to let anyone else
I care about die.

557
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,891
We've been in tough spots before
and we've always managed

558
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:04,560
to come out on the other side.

559
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,628
No.

560
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,065
Oliver did.

561
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,901
But he's not here
anymore,

562
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:14,269
because he's dead.

563
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:16,505
Ok.

564
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,741
The point is,

565
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:21,210
if we're going to do this
without Oliver,

566
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:23,779
Felicity, we have
to trust each other.

567
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:27,049
You don't get it.

568
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:31,453
There is no "this"
without him.

569
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:36,158
It's done. I'm done.

570
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,995
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:08,664
But I have no one else
to turn to.

572
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,133
And he needs your help.

573
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:28,384
I was
out of line.

574
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:31,087
And I'm sorry.

575
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:37,460
You want to tell me
what had you so upset?

576
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:43,432
I lost a friend of mine.

577
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,968
He was more than
a friend, actually.

578
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,104
He was...

579
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,740
I'm not
sure what we were,

580
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:54,243
but...he's gone.

581
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,646
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:56,648 --> 00:36:01,050
And three months ago,
another friend of mine died.

583
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:04,320
I'm 25 years old.

584
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:07,323
I'm over my quota where
losing my friends are concerned.

585
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:11,994
And you're a friend.

586
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:17,266
So if you want
to go out there;

587
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:19,702
if you want to commit suicide,

588
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:21,470
I can't stop you.

589
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:24,173
But I don't have to help you.

590
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,888
Eight months
to put him away...

591
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,291
Eight minutes
to set him loose.

592
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,560
I'm sorry.

593
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:46,662
I tried.

594
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,130
Without
the evidence,

595
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:50,333
the judge had
to let them go.

596
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,102
He's not coming back.

597
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:56,906
Oliver.

598
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,841
I know you don't want
to believe it, Laurel.

599
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,777
God knows I don't, but...

600
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:05,114
He's not coming back.

601
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:10,820
Are you?

602
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:17,226
Are you coming back?

603
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,762
I don't know.

604
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:26,635
For the first time
since I met Oliver Queen...

605
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:29,538
I don't know what happens next.

606
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:35,010
I know it's silly, but I...

607
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:38,681
Still like to think of myself
as Oliver's bodyguard.

608
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,453
I just couldn't protect him.

609
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,372
It's funny.

610
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:06,275
He was worried something
would happen to me.

611
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,788
I could have killed you!

612
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,758
Heh. It's cute
that you think so.

613
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,294
Did you hear anything
about Ollie?

614
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,929
I'm afraid not.

615
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:02,498
Then what
are you doing here?

616
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,569
We're in danger,
Thea.

617
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:10,506
We need to leave
Starling City and never return.

618
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:14,944
Thank you all
for coming.

619
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:16,645
But seeing
as I'm the reason

620
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,881
none of you are
sitting in a prison cell right now,

621
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:21,817
I figure it's the least
you can do.

622
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,488
I know I'm the guy that made all
the evidence against you go away,

623
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,524
but as you can see,

624
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,960
it didn't go too far.

625
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:35,631
You are all part
of my crew now.

626
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:38,033
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

627
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:41,370
I can send a gift wrapped
package to the D.A.

628
00:39:41,372 --> 00:39:46,308
Together, not only will
we make a lot of money,

629
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,878
we will make history.

630
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,480
Together,

631
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:54,850
we are going to take
over the Glades.

632
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,190
You think Brick's crazy?

633
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:02,892
Take over a whole
section of town?

634
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:04,326
I know he's crazy.

635
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:06,395
I don't know what
he's got planned,

636
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,764
but whatever it is, I'm in.

637
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:19,642
Who the hell are you?

638
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:21,810
I'm the justice
you can't run from.

639
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:26,715
Well done, Mr. Queen.

640
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:31,654
I'm glad to know my investment in you
hasn't entirely been for naught.

641
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:34,590
Although I was
disappointed to read

642
00:40:34,592 --> 00:40:37,826
Agent Pierson's
after action report.

643
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:40,329
You let one of Chien Na Wey's
men get away.

644
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:42,431
I hesitated.
It was a mistake.

645
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:44,366
It really was.

646
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:47,369
Now we have no one
to interrogate.

647
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:51,273
You mean torture, right?

648
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:59,415
I saw you with that man.

649
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:02,151
You didn't
hesitate .

650
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:05,421
You chose
not to shoot him.

651
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,758
I put the GPS from the vial
in his pocket.

652
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,396
And now he is going to lead us
right to Tatsu.

653
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,632
You're going to get
her back, Maseo.

654
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,100
I promise.

655
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:21,103
Oliver...

656
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:23,372
What you've done,

657
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:26,675
I will be forever
in your debt.

658
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,587
Don't move.

659
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:42,024
You'll pull out the sutures.

660
00:41:42,026 --> 00:41:43,559
Oliver.

661
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,761
Tatsu.

662
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,029
How...

663
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,465
I asked her
to come here...

664
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,772
So she could
bring you back to life.
