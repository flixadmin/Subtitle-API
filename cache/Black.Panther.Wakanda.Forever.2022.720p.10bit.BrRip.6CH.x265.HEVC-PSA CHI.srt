So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1315
01:19:15,421 --> 01:19:17,756
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1316
01:19:18,674 --> 01:19:19,842
That's madness.

1317
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:23,012
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1318
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:24,638
if given a chance.

1319

If we make an alliance,

1320
01:19:28,058 --> 01:19:30,769
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1321
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:35,566
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1322
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:38,360
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1323
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:41,572
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1324
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:44,617
The scientist will die.

1325
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:48,537
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1326

An attack on my people?

Yes.
