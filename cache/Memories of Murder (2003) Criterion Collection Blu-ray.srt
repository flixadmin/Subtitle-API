1
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,571
Junk car! Junk car!

2
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,299
Get out of here, kid.

3
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,360
I told you to get out of here.

4
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:28,332
OCTOBER 23, 1986

5
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,177
- Go home, kid.
- Go home, kid.

6
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,556
- Little brat.
- Little brat.

7
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,851
- What the hell are they doing?
- What the hell are they doing?

8
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,436
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

9
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,355
- Put that back!
- Put that back!

10
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,861
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

11
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,196
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

12
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,658
- That's important, don't touch!
- That's important, don't touch!

13
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,996
- Those kids.
- Those kids.

14
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:45,618
MEMORIES OF MURDER

15
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,748
What?

16
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,751
You dated the dead girl,
and she dumped you last August?

17
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,170
Is that right?

18
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,588
That's correct.

19
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:02,426
That's correct?
Take off your hat, you damn punk.

20
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
Do women like guys like you?

21
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,814
After watching <i>Body Heat...</i>

22
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,858
<i>Body Heat?</i> That an action movie?

23
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,278
A, C, T...

24
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,245
Damn punk.

25
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,959
Since it's a rape and murder case and all

26
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,545
well...

27
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,632
If she was sexy, or pretty,
that sort of thing.

28
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,926
Your impressions?

29
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,053
Well

30
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,598
she didn't seem like a country girl...

31
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,393
Don't blink.

32
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,396
You blinked, didn't you?

33
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,315
Hey, look at me.

34
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,571
Don't look at the ceiling, look at me!

35
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:08,284
Was he born that way? One, two...

36
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,466
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

37
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,051
Did you take the exam?

38
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,388
You need to study hard to get in there.

39
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,352
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

40
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,063
What? I told you to bring one.

41
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,066
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

42
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,401
That's what you said last time...

43
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,905
Here's one, here.

44
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:51,493
You answered the phone, you lying bastard.

45
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,706
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

46
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:04,173
DIRECTED BY BONG JOON HO

47
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,636
Why didn't you rope the place off?

48
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,265
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

49
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,851
Inspector Park, over here!

50
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:18,979
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

51
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,607
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

52
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,401
Go help those jerks over there.

53
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,198
- You called the forensics team?
- Yes, they're on their way.

54
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,869
But where's the person who reported this?

55
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,124
No forensics team, this is total chaos!

56
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,418
Jesus, look at him!

57
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,546
Hey!

58
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,798
Get out of here!

59
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,011
Who received the call on this?

60
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,929
Did you find out who reported it?

61
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,473
The phone...
The crime site is getting ruined.

62
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,810
Damn forensics team's not here,
this is a mess.

63
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,479
What are you talking about?

64
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:05,526
Take pictures when I tell you!

65
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,737
Why'd you bring so many reporters?

66
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,699
They were all here when I arrived.

67
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,243
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

68
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:18,371
- I don't see him.
- Feels great with that shithead gone.

69
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,958
Why does this have to happen to me?

70
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,961
How can I investigate like this?

71
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:29,257
Hey, tractor! Hey, tractor!

72
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,759
Tractor!

73
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,557
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

74
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,395
If someone waves, shouldn't you look?

75
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,189
Shit, is he deaf?

76
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,776
Shit! Look at this.

77
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,654
Now those bastards show up.

78
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,285
What the hell took you so long?

79
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:59,537
The crime scene's ruined!

80
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:03,875
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

81
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,836
What's going on?

82
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,763
How can you look at those photos
while eating?

83
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:20,684
If I keep staring at them,

84
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,978
one moment it'll hit me.

85
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,606
- Instinctively.
- Are you a fortune teller?

86
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,941
Open up a shop then.

87
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:34,198
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

88
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,367
It's how I survive as a detective.

89
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,705
There's a reason people say
I have shaman's eyes.

90
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,291
Okay, then.

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,002
You see those two guys there?

92
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,926
One of them's a rapist,
and the other is the victim's brother.

93
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:02,010
He caught the guy doing this
to his sister, and dragged him in.

94
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:10,818
So tell me, which one's the rapist?

95
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,373
- Hey.
- What?

96
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:26,666
I think it fell out.

97
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,043
Really?

98
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,379
Let's do this properly.

99
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,511
I'll give this to you especially today.

100
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:39,972
I'm so grateful.

101
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,476
It's just a flu shot.

102
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,603
Know how much this costs?

103
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,608
- Kwak Seol-yeong?
- Yeah?

104
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,487
You must be earning more now
than at the hospital.

105
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:01,659
I hear everyone in town comes to you.

106
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,663
Shh. I got something to tell you.

107
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,083
I heard this from the old woman
at the mill.

108
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,629
You know the Baek family meat restaurant?

109
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,548
The Baek family?

110
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,427
You know what people call them?

111
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,845
What?

112
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:23,098
The Baek Lady Killers.

113
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,977
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

114
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:32,733
But the son's a little bit retarded.
Kwang-ho.

115
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:38,530
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

116
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,533
Hyang-sook? The one who was killed?

117
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,327
Yeah.

118
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:49,249
She was found with a girdle over her head?

119
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,334
Right.

120
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,337
Even more important,

121
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,298
the night she was killed,

122
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,552
that old woman saw Kwang-ho following her.

123
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:05,474
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

124
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,936
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

125
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,979
No, she's fine.

126
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:19,363
That kid... Wait.

127
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,824
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

128
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,455
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

129
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,291
Tell me in detail.

130
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,169
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

131
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,404
Kwang-ho.

132
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,907
Let's talk man to man.

133
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,327
You see a pretty girl, you want to do her.

134
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:13,208
When I was your age,
I'd go out with friends, I understand.

135
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:19,923
You never intended
to kill Hyang-sook at first, huh?

136
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,467
"How about just touching her breast..."

137
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,093
I couldn't touch it.

138
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:26,930
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

139
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,181
No, I didn't.

140
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,064
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

141
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,566
He's nice.

142
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,695
He's really sweet. He never beats anyone.

143
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,865
But sometimes, you know,

144
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:49,077
if he gets worked up about something...

145
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:56,376
God, what an ugly face.

146
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,465
Just looking at this face makes me angry.

147
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,843
Shit.

148
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,596
Shit.

149
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,064
Pretty?

150
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,859
This is so it won't leave scratches,
you punk.

151
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:23,070
Hey, hey...

152
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,405
What's with the army boots?

153
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:27,616
Doing this to the kid...

154
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,202
Kwang-ho, get up.

155
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,084
Are you really innocent? Huh?

156
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,419
Look in my eyes.

157
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,796
Huh?

158
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,716
Where the hell's he looking?
Look in my eyes!

159
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:05,271
TURN YOURSELF IN,
OR MAY YOU ROT AND DIE.

160
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,549
Excuse me, miss...

161
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:27,467
Hello?

162
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,179
Oh, miss?

163
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,598
Are you all right?

164
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,807
Why are you following me?

165
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:38,895
No, I just wanted to ask directions.

166
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,272
Let me help you.

167
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,692
Let go!

168
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,154
What's wrong?

169
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,490
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town a rapist's paradise?

170
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,617
You shithead.

171
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,416
What the hell?

172
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,668
Who are you?

173
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,547
Get over here.

174
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,509
Hey, miss!
The victim needs to file a report!

175
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:12,929
Miss!

176
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,232
Where is she going?

177
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,401
Are you a detective?

178
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,740
You should have told me.

179
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,242
My mistake.

180
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,954
How can a detective be such a bad fighter?

181
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,045
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

182
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,842
What's that smell?

183
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:54,554
Oh, sneakers. They smell bad?

184
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:58,850
But these here are evidence item #28.

185
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,670
Develop these quickly, huh?

186
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,924
- Uh, chief.
- What?

187
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,094
This guy here... from Seoul.

188
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,181
Nice to meet you! I got the call...

189
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,474
But

190
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:41,601
your face...

191
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,896
Did anything happen?

192
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,315
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

193
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,819
Oh, I prepared a desk over there
with lots of sunlight.

194
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,031
I think... I like that corner.

195
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,703
Okay, okay! As you wish.

196
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,499
Inspector Jo, say hello.

197
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,294
From Seoul,

198
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,714
Seo Tae-... yoon, senior officer.

199
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:13,758
Jo Yong-go. Nice to meet you.

200
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,429
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

201
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,639
Quite an uncommon thing.

202
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,767
Well, go arrange your desk.

203
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,477
Yes, sit down.

204
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,064
INSPECTOR CHIEF

205
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,787
The song is great. The opening song.

206
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,123
I always watch <i>Inspector Chief</i> with Dad.

207
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,084
What was my phone number?

208
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,211
Just eat.

209
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,006
Right, I need to call Dad!

210
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

211
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,020
Hey, Kwang-ho.

212
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,774
Listen.

213
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,611
This footprint was found
at the site of Hyang-sook's murder.

214
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:16,696
Look.

215
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,740
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

216
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:22,035
You wear these? Right?

217
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,162
Now, look closely.

218
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:30,210
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

219
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,337
The same, right?

220
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,839
This pattern?

221
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,636
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

222
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,930
Am I right?

223
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,935
This part was smudged,
don't worry about that.

224
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,066
You killed all those women, right?

225
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,236
Okay.

226
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,157
You didn't kill them all, right?

227
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:07,455
So you didn't <i>not</i> kill only Hyang-sook,
correct?

228
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:10,666
I didn't kill anyone.

229
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,379
We've got the evidence here!

230
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,174
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

231
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,762
Look at you...

232
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,392
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

233
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,811
Can't you even shovel right? Watch me.

234
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,482
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

235
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,317
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

236
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,611
You punk.

237
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,699
Did you come here to play?

238
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,035
You know where this is?

239
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,703
We came here to bury you.

240
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:51,624
- What? Why?
- Why?

241
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,043
Because you won't listen, you bastard.

242
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,213
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

243
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,217
Out here in the fresh air. With that face.

244
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,136
Hey, come here.

245
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:06,931
Women hate this face, don't they?

246
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,850
They grimace and all fucking run away.

247
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,060
It's true.

248
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,354
I'll kill them all.

249
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:19,611
Everyone who grimaces at my face.

250
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,155
I'll kill them all.

251
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,453
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

252
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,666
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

253
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,544
Hyang-sook.
You always followed her around.

254
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,464
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh, yeah, she's pretty.

255
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,967
But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh?

256
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,302
She said, "Fuck, get away!" didn't she?

257
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:48,180
Because you liked her.

258
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,766
So you killed her, huh?

259
00:21:58,274 --> 00:22:01,653
By the train tracks. In that rice paddy.

260
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,572
The train tracks? Right.

261
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,992
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat,

262
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:12,080
strangled it tightly.

263
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,832
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

264
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,669
- Brassiere?
- With her white brassiere,

265
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,089
strangled her tightly.

266
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,883
- And then?
- Her stocking.

267
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,594
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

268
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,387
Then it was the stocking.

269
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,640
This guy's smart, huh?

270
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,143
- And then?
- What?

271
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:37,063
What was it?

272
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,816
Something with a strap?

273
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,111
- A handbag strap?
- Right, a bag strap.

274
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:51,195
Strangling Hyang-sook's throat
with it tightly.

275
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,372
And?

276
00:22:55,248 --> 00:23:00,837
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

277
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:03,590
She looked completely dead.

278
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:05,758
And then?

279
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,598
Her head was covered up.

280
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,599
With what?

281
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:20,683
Her panties.
Covered her head with her panties.

282
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:25,569
Do you mean a girdle? That women wear?

283
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,822
Right, girdle!

284
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,410
Looked like it covered her head right up.

285
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:34,787
And then?

286
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,916
Um... had to dress her again.

287
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,752
And why was that?

288
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,255
I don't know. Put the clothes back on.

289
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,341
Why was that?

290
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,681
How would I know?

291
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,349
You were doing well!

292
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,434
Bastard! What did you do next?

293
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,019
- Then... running!
- Where?

294
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,980
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

295
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,817
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

296
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,319
The lightning struck!

297
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,447
Where the hell were you running,
you bastard!

298
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:13,033
Yong-go, start digging.

299
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,243
Huh? Digging?

300
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,371
Lightning!

301
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:41,562
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

302
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,523
<i>The air raid siren has begun to sound.
This is only a drill.</i>

303
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:46,984
<i>The entire country is now
under a civil defense drill.</i>

304
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,697
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.</i>

305
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:55,034
<i>Please find cover
in the nearest underground space.</i>

306
00:24:55,118 --> 00:25:02,118
<i>Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.</i>

307
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,549
<i>Please move all flammable materials
to a safe place.</i>

308
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:15,847
<i>Unplug all cords,
then hurry to an underground area...</i>

309
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,024
Shut off the lights!

310
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,081
You forgot the breasts.

311
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,292
Hey, you!

312
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,335
Come here.

313
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,091
- Put this on. Everyone ready?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,593
Get in the car.

315
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,428
Turn around.

316
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:57,012
LEE HYANG-SOOK

317
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:59,974
Take off your pants.

318
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,519
What'll the headline be?

319
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,231
"Crime-Fighting Trio"
or "Smiles of the Unstoppable."

320
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,233
Inspector Park, in the back.

321
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,111
Make a straight line now.

322
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,156
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

323
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,659
Smile! Okay!

324
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,829
This time, hold up your fist. Tight!

325
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,167
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

326
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,795
Come on!

327
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:35,802
Wait a second.

328
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:48,981
With these webbed fingers,
you can't even hold chopsticks, right?

329
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,526
They've always been this way?

330
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,872
- Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?
- I don't know.

331
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,792
What's he talking about? It was here.

332
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,087
For the reenactment, you have to act well.

333
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:15,800
There are a lot of reporters here.

334
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,217
How's this?

335
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:19,011
A bit lower.

336
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,722
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

337
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:26,769
It's best to write down the correct order.

338
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,313
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

339
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,815
Chief.

340
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,902
The reenactment
isn't going to work anyway.

341
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,906
Call it off before
it becomes an embarrassment.

342
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,744
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

343
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,538
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

344
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:47,832
Inspector Seo!

345
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,544
You're dumping shit on cooked rice here!

346
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:55,464
I told you before, Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

347
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,924
Just shut up!

348
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,134
Chief...

349
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:03,555
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

350
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:06,850
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

351
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,602
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

352
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,354
Get the hell out!

353
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,316
Grab the brassiere strap...

354
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,861
- Hey, concentrate!
- Dad!

355
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:21,073
Kwang-ho! It's me!

356
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,491
Dad!

357
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:26,745
- Hey, you're innocent!
- I know! I didn't do it!

358
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:32,543
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

359
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:37,173
He didn't kill anyone! My son's innocent!

360
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:43,137
You were tortured, weren't you?

361
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,682
My team never tortures suspects.

362
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,113
It's all gone to hell.

363
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,865
Don't bring it up.

364
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:08,913
Hey, did you see the look
on prosecutor Choi's face back there?

365
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:13,125
Fuck, how can he revoke the warrant?

366
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,210
We even had evidence.

367
00:29:15,294 --> 00:29:17,755
Evidence? That footprint?

368
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,801
How can they set him free?

369
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:24,303
What can we do?

370
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,432
All we had was a confession.

371
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,769
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

372
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:36,857
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

373
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:41,862
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

374
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,656
Like how she was strangled.

375
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,159
You heard it too.

376
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,579
Be honest,
didn't you rehearse that in advance?

377
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,122
What?

378
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,916
Quiet. Eat something.

379
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
Jesus...

380
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:05,261
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

381
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:08,681
What the fuck!

382
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:14,144
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM RESHUFFLED

383
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:18,441
MURDER CASE SHROUDED
IN MYSTERY ONCE AGAIN

384
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,837
The location of the first homicide,

385
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,923
and the second homicide.

386
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,384
Now, a distance of

387
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,804
approximately 1000 meters.

388
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,558
A length of not more than...
one kilometer.

389
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:06,030
The victim, on the 12th and the 16th,

390
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:10,034
both days at twelve o'clock...

391
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:14,538
Ah, December 16th.

392
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,626
On December 16th, at twelve o'clock...

393
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:23,047
The location is Yangji Teahouse...

394
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,175
Han Sung-geun,

395
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:29,553
a 32-year-old office worker.

396
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,683
An arranged date, maybe?

397
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:39,771
Anyway, at the crime site

398
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:44,484
were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

399
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:48,823
and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

400
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,658
What? Yes.

401
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,205
The two dead women,

402
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:58,916
did they have anything in common?

403
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:02,627
In common...

404
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:04,296
Well, first,

405
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,967
both of them were single.

406
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,471
They were both extremely beautiful.

407
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:14,473
And?

408
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,602
The murders all took place in the rain.

409
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,521
Rain?

410
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,607
He murdered them on rainy nights.

411
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:26,277
Really?

412
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,112
And red clothes.

413
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,031
They all wore red clothes.

414
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,825
Both of them?

415
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,952
No, all three of them.

416
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,164
Three of them?

417
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:40,082
What are you talking about?

418
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,919
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

419
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,510
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

420
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:55,472
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

421
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,684
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

422
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:03,146
Everyone in this town knows her.

423
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,149
A pretty girl, that Hyun-soon.

424
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,570
Even a Miss Korea is no match for her.

425
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,906
Did you process the missing person form,
Yong-go?

426
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,366
Oh, shut up.

427
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,911
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

428
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:21,915
If you look in detail,
documents never lie.

429
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:26,128
It says she was wearing a red shirt.

430
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,005
It's right here in writing.

431
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,923
What's that?

432
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:34,177
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

433
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:36,680
It rained on that day too.

434
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:40,017
Rain, red clothes...

435
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,854
She was murdered. By the same person.

436
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,774
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

437
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:52,028
She always said she'd go
to Seoul one day...

438
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:56,200
I have an idea where the body is.
Look at the map.

439
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,618
Right here...

440
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:03,207
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

441
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,588
Give me two squadrons of cops.
I'll find her in two days.

442
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,593
You sure of this?

443
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,405
You know,

444
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:39,451
university students,
when they go on orientation,

445
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,829
people say the guys all get laid.

446
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:47,375
A big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

447
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:48,961
Is that true?

448
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,922
I don't know. Hurry up.

449
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,801
You went to a two-year school, didn't you?

450
00:34:56,885 --> 00:35:01,181
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

451
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:07,145
Go ask Seo.
He went to a four-year university.

452
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,731
Whether he had group sex...

453
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,275
Shit, four years.

454
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,987
I spent four years in high school.

455
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,703
Shit, put that away.

456
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,042
You know, I miss Dokko Hyun-soon.

457
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,460
You too?

458
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,881
She was just too good for this town.

459
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,384
I'm telling you, she went to Seoul.

460
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:41,305
What is it?

461
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,433
Lot of snakes down there.

462
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,149
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

463
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:57,988
Look. It's old,
but the inner thigh is still firm.

464
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,866
There's evidence of rape?

465
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,327
A bit of semen was found.

466
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,831
But it's so old,
we can't determine the blood type.

467
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,792
Oh, Hyun-soon...

468
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:14,838
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

469
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,758
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

470
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,593
Yes.

471
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:24,889
The victim's panties on her face,
as with Hyang-sook.

472
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,309
Her hands were bound the same way too.

473
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,563
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

474
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:34,191
He's thorough.

475
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:35,943
And polished.

476
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:43,659
So there hasn't been a single witness yet.

477
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,706
Would you like a bit more tenderloin?

478
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:52,083
That's okay. We're fine.

479
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,212
Where did Kwang-ho go? I don't see him.

480
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,881
Is anything...?

481
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:03,511
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

482
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,305
What's this?

483
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,642
Oh, last time,
taking a look at his sneakers,

484
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,895
they smelled so awful, I felt bad for him.

485
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,815
I thought, I'll have to buy him new shoes.

486
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,901
So I picked up some Nikes.

487
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,778
You didn't have to...

488
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,241
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

489
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,162
Kwang-ho!

490
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,832
This here...
your shoe size is 250 mm, right?

491
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,836
Here, Nike. Try them on.

492
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,048
Give me that sneaker.

493
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,594
These are "Nice," not Nike. N, I, C, E.

494
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:47,931
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

495
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:54,354
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

496
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,231
Cool, huh?

497
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:02,529
Have a drink.

498
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,241
I beat you because I care for you.

499
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,995
So if you see me on the street,
don't run away.

500
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,373
Yong-go feels bad about...

501
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,752
Punk.

502
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:25,427
Hey, where are you going again?

503
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,304
You see, Chief.

504
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:32,851
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

505
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,521
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

506
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,648
Inspector Seo!

507
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,319
Have some meat before you speak.

508
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,535
I don't eat burnt meat.

509
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,455
<i>When the Spring flower blooms</i>

510
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,208
<i>You said you'd come back to me</i>

511
00:38:57,292 --> 00:39:02,798
<i>Like the singing swallows</i>

512
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,135
<i>On the hills</i>

513
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,430
<i>Singing birds and blooming flowers...</i>

514
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,567
Sir?

515
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:29,616
<i>Alone on the hill</i>

516
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,494
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

517
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,373
What?

518
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:39,542
Why did you come here?

519
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:43,380
Out to the boondocks? Huh?

520
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,676
To catch the killer.

521
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:54,975
Is Seoul that big?

522
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,603
Huh? Is it big?

523
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,398
Bigger than America?

524
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,612
Give me a banana.

525
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,783
Let me tell you about America.

526
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,622
They've got the FBI!

527
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,792
If you watch how they investigate...
You know how?

528
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,465
Their heads are spinning like a top.

529
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,468
Analyzing things...

530
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:32,304
You know why?

531
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,767
It's cause they got so much fucking land!

532
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:43,898
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

533
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:48,779
So they have no choice,
those FBI bastards.

534
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,033
But our Republic of Korea...

535
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:59,790
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

536
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,792
You know why?

537
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,629
Cause our land's the size of my dick.

538
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:12,218
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

539
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:15,931
That's folk wisdom, you bastard.

540
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,143
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

541
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:24,147
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

542
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,151
You bastard!

543
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:32,072
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

544
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,748
Give him this.

545
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,797
Take it away! Take it!

546
00:41:56,471 --> 00:42:00,809
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

547
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:06,690
I've got it now. About the killer.

548
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,693
That bastard,

549
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,863
he'll do it again.

550
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,615
The next night it rains.

551
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:20,412
So we need to keep one step ahead of him.

552
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,790
Preemptive! Okay?

553
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:30,630
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

554
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,176
I'll kill you both! Understood?

555
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:51,150
Ladies and gentlemen!

556
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:54,278
In just a moment,
our President will be driving past.

557
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,114
Wait a minute...

558
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:18,595
It's raining nice.

559
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:21,389
You ready?

560
00:43:57,467 --> 00:44:01,220
Ooh, Gwi-ok's looking nice!

561
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:02,514
Shut up.

562
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,436
What if he grabs her for real?

563
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,650
Inspector Seo should be
following close behind her.

564
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:20,782
Shit, do we have to do this
every time when it rains?

565
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:26,079
But thanks to this,
Gwi-OK puts on that red skirt.

566
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,416
With makeup,
she looks like a different person.

567
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,918
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

568
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,044
You getting hard?

569
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,171
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

570
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,090
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-go!

571
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,267
Hey.

572
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,562
So do you really keep watch here?

573
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,441
These days, nobody ever goes outside.

574
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,153
Someone's coming.

575
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,698
Hey, kids! Hey, kids!

576
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,701
Over here.

577
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:08,997
That's cold.

578
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:10,790
You're so wet!

579
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:17,422
Hey, stay here until the rain stops.

580
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,133
That umbrella's useless.

581
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,567
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

582
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,930
Someone threw it away.

583
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,807
Miss, are you going that way too?

584
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,809
Hey, she's a detective.

585
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,394
No way!

586
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,813
She's in the Violent Crimes Division.

587
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,731
- Really?
- Sure.

588
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:38,526
Wait a minute. We'll give you a ride.

589
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,528
Wow, in a police car!

590
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:45,741
Hey, you two.
What are you doing out so late?

591
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:48,370
We always stay together, so it's okay.

592
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,915
You'll be fine even if you go alone.

593
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,504
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

594
00:45:58,588 --> 00:45:59,589
What?

595
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,425
You know, during cleaning time,
about the murderer.

596
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,387
Right! You know why
they can't catch the murderer?

597
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:09,515
This is the truth.
We go to Ansong Girls Middle School.

598
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,559
Behind our school, there's an outhouse.

599
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,646
They say a crazy man lives under there,
the murderer!

600
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,023
He stays there all day,

601
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,318
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

602
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,738
So when he comes out at night,

603
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:27,659
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

604
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,912
That's not the story.

605
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:34,373
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

606
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:37,407
Then I'll meet you in front of the factory
with an umbrella.

607
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:41,339
It's okay.

608
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,800
Okay.

609
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,595
I'll see you soon.

610
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:03,688
<i>Stand by me, don't leave me</i>

611
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:10,744
<i>I still love you</i>

612
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:16,166
<i>Walking by myself...</i>

613
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,316
Hello?

614
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:10,613
Everyone stay where you are!

615
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,743
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

616
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,536
Hey, you!

617
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,913
I'm talking to you!

618
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,374
Wait for the forensics team.

619
00:49:33,511 --> 00:49:34,512
Look!

620
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:37,515
These are genuine footprints.

621
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,353
You see the Remicon factory there?

622
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:46,191
He caught her near the factory,

623
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:50,361
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

624
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,618
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

625
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:02,999
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

626
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:09,130
I hoped to find fingerprints
on the umbrella, but no luck.

627
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:14,469
Not only that, due to the rain,
the footprints are all smudged.

628
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,516
Even after such a thorough investigation,
nothing.

629
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:27,857
Therefore, Chief,
I think this could be a hint. Hint!

630
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,650
What?

631
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:34,364
The fact that we found nothing
at the scene.

632
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,493
Always in rape cases,

633
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,495
at the crime scene,

634
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:45,958
there's one or two
of those hairs left behind.

635
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,460
So?

636
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:53,924
I'm saying the criminal
must not have any hair down there.

637
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:55,801
You mean hairless?

638
00:50:55,885 --> 00:51:00,014
That's right, hairless. A total baldy.

639
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,021
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

640
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:08,940
For example,

641
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,402
a Buddhist monk
who shaved the hair down there.

642
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:14,946
It's a perfect crime.

643
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,823
Well, then.

644
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:21,660
Yongdeok Temple is just next door.

645
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:23,371
Should we start there?

646
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,841
Hey, Gwi-OK,
you've got the radio on over there.

647
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,011
How would you like your coffee?

648
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,055
Lots of sugar for me.

649
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:44,559
- Inspector Seo!
- Yes, sir?

650
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:48,021
Do you have any more ideas?

651
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:53,818
I don't know. As you saw today,
this criminal is flawless.

652
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,570
- So?
- Therefore,

653
00:51:56,654 --> 00:51:59,823
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

654
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:02,910
So what are we going to do?

655
00:52:04,912 --> 00:52:06,247
Jesus...

656
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,667
Excuse me,
but I've got something to show you.

657
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:16,090
What will she show us today?

658
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,677
What's this?

659
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,514
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

660
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,517
Looks like a broadcast schedule.

661
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:30,480
Yes, it's an evening music program
I listen to.

662
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:36,027
There's someone who keeps requesting
the song "Sad Letter."

663
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,614
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

664
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:44,702
Actually, this isn't a very popular song.
It's quite rare.

665
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,412
A song? What letter?

666
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,832
"Sad Letter." The singer is Yoo Jae-ha.

667
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,960
Jo Young-pil's band.

668
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,338
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

669
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:02,845
The song was broadcast
on the same days of the murders here.

670
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,849
Look.

671
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,686
October 20. That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

672
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,525
December 19 was Lee Hyang-sook.

673
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:21,781
So... on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

674
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,076
Yes. I listened to it myself.

675
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:29,580
The DJ read out the postcard
containing the request.

676
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,793
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District.

677
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:36,796
Please broadcast it on a rainy day."

678
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:43,010
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

679
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:46,431
You read too many mystery novels
as a student?

680
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,559
That was a nice story.

681
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:56,065
Chief, this can't be a coincidence.
Look at this. Documents never lie.

682
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:59,234
Christ, here we go again.

683
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:02,572
It seems he's a real psycho.

684
00:54:03,322 --> 00:54:05,908
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

685
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:10,412
Oh, Chief, now you're doing it too.
This makes no sense!

686
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:13,290
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

687
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:17,753
Assemblies start with the National Anthem.
It's the same.

688
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,755
Did you get the postcard?

689
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,133
I requested it,

690
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,011
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

691
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,056
Find it quickly.

692
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,934
Check the postmark,
fingerprints and handwriting.

693
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,143
Yes, sir!

694
00:54:33,227 --> 00:54:36,939
Officer Kwon,
call the station and follow up on this.

695
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,363
Baldies!

696
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,408
- What about that?
- Huh?

697
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,702
What we mentioned before...

698
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,037
Hairless, sir!

699
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,539
How do you investigate?

700
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,584
Pull the pants off passing men?

701
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:13,767
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

702
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:15,936
What postcard?

703
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,021
You read it on the air yesterday!

704
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:19,816
Look how many we get here!

705
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:23,444
Hey, mister!

706
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,656
Nothing. Get dressed.

707
00:55:28,866 --> 00:55:29,867
Inspector.

708
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,787
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

709
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:35,873
It's no use.

710
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:52,807
You're not going to shower?

711
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,602
Enough showers, for God's sake.

712
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,566
My skin feels like it'll burst.

713
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,986
You couldn't find any hairless men?

714
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,284
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

715
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,245
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

716
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,456
At least your face is clean.

717
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,712
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

718
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:25,256
I'll lose my hair there too.

719
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:35,098
I asked the workers at the sauna there

720
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:37,059
to call me if they saw anyone.

721
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:41,397
Bastards just smirked at me.

722
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,986
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

723
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:54,285
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

724
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,999
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

725
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,210
Shit, it's nothing you've heard of.

726
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:06,005
Is he still talking nonsense?

727
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:08,257
Driving me crazy.

728
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:13,971
If you feel that way, go see a shaman.

729
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,599
A shaman?

730
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,603
Sure, one that tells fortunes well.

731
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:25,524
Ask her where the murderer is hiding.

732
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:35,682
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

733
00:57:36,452 --> 00:57:40,623
It should be moved about
10 meters to the southwest.

734
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:47,213
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

735
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,391
Is his face among these pictures here?

736
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:02,353
Take those dirty photos away.

737
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,648
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

738
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,068
It's bad fortune.

739
00:58:11,862 --> 00:58:17,118
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

740
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,264
Wait, wait a minute.

741
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:45,229
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

742
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,314
Stir.

743
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,359
She said that was most important.

744
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,070
Now pour it.

745
00:58:58,075 --> 00:58:59,076
Stop.

746
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,205
Good.

747
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:12,714
Once this dries,

748
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,553
this stain will form
the shape of the murderer's face.

749
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,680
That's ridiculous.

750
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,765
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

751
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,517
Know how much this costs?

752
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,770
So shut up!

753
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,819
Who's that?

754
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,656
You've heard?

755
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,826
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

756
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,196
Wait a sec.

757
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,865
What the...

758
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,827
What's he doing here?

759
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,620
Why'd he come?

760
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,179
What the fuck...

761
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:46,308
We need science here!

762
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:50,855
What the hell's that?

763
01:00:57,319 --> 01:00:59,572
Still, he's got style.

764
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:37,771
Stop there!

765
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:42,484
Hey, you!

766
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,582
It's getting narrow! Single file!

767
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:23,525
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

768
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,610
No.

769
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,947
- It's that policeman.
- What?

770
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,700
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

771
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:35,871
Damn, he's a fast little bastard.

772
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:40,542
He's not there?

773
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,464
Did you check the alleys properly?

774
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:48,675
You think you know this village?

775
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,177
You stepped on a stick back there.

776
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:54,139
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

777
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,350
He stepped on it.

778
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,774
What?

779
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:06,360
Over there... Hey, you!

780
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,622
Stop!

781
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,006
Jesus, not again.

782
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,261
Hey, over there.

783
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,292
Black clothes, black clothes...

784
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:06,378
Everyone's in black except you.

785
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,224
Everybody stop!

786
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:25,105
Don't move an inch!

787
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:50,881
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

788
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:54,218
Gather them together.

789
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,930
Hey, stop.

790
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:01,016
Gather together.

791
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:03,393
Lift up your heads.

792
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:05,479
Everyone stand in line.

793
01:07:22,412 --> 01:07:24,373
Look in my eyes.

794
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,502
Give me that.

795
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,100
What is it?

796
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,564
- You bastard!
- Out of my way.

797
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,986
You ran away from us?

798
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:22,139
But... is jerking off a crime?

799
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:24,057
It's not a crime.

800
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,768
Why'd you run away?

801
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:30,647
Someone jumped out of the woods
and ran at me,

802
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:33,191
so I panicked.

803
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,987
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

804
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:40,699
There are kids at home,

805
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,036
and the air's nice in the woods.

806
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,541
Or did you go back
to fantasize about the dead girls?

807
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:58,300
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

808
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,469
What's this?

809
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:02,804
Gimme that.

810
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:08,894
What did you make these with?

811
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,161
These days, you know,

812
01:09:27,245 --> 01:09:32,959
real events in our town
are stronger than the magazines.

813
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:38,631
When I read the newspaper,
I start fantasizing.

814
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:41,551
I ask myself why I do this,

815
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,929
but when will this chance come again?

816
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:49,643
According to neighbors,

817
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:53,104
he looks diligently after his sick wife,

818
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:55,315
never misses a week at church,

819
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,776
that he's honest.

820
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:03,365
All perverts are like that.
Nice on the outside.

821
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,867
But my eyes can't be fooled.

822
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,204
One look, and I know.

823
01:10:12,582 --> 01:10:16,377
Honey, I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

824
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:21,466
- Don't forget, or they'll smell.
- I'll take care of it. Go feed the kids.

825
01:10:21,883 --> 01:10:24,803
Watch out for protesters.

826
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:29,349
Release Jo Byung-soon!

827
01:10:29,766 --> 01:10:33,102
- What now?
- I heard Byung-soon confessed last night.

828
01:10:33,186 --> 01:10:36,398
- Who says so?
- Oh, Chief!

829
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,612
When will you make an announcement?

830
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:45,823
We know nothing. Just wait a bit more.

831
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,493
You've held him four days
without a warrant.

832
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,871
People are saying he's detained illegally.

833
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,625
This time be realistic, like in a movie.

834
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,712
Go!

835
01:10:59,629 --> 01:11:01,381
You did a good job just now.

836
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,591
Yong-go?

837
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:10,348
So, you were hiding behind the outhouse,

838
01:11:10,932 --> 01:11:13,309
and you saw Park Myung-ja

839
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:16,562
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

840
01:11:16,646 --> 01:11:19,733
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

841
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,362
Not it seems, you bastard, be precise!

842
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:31,661
I think I dreamed it that way.

843
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:37,125
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

844
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:44,626
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

845
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:48,178
- With my hand like this.
- Next?

846
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:54,559
Myung-ja cried out,
and I guess she collapsed?

847
01:11:54,643 --> 01:12:00,356
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her...

848
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,902
Hey, it didn't happen there, it was...

849
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,532
The pine grove! I took her there.

850
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,785
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

851
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:16,789
According to the news,
more than 200 meters, right?

852
01:12:16,873 --> 01:12:18,583
That's so far!

853
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:22,503
So the rain was pouring,
and I dragged her through the mud.

854
01:12:22,587 --> 01:12:24,506
And then?

855
01:12:25,298 --> 01:12:27,801
So I threw her down in the pine grove.

856
01:12:28,426 --> 01:12:30,928
Then I strangled her.

857
01:12:31,012 --> 01:12:33,431
- With what?
- The bag strap.

858
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:34,516
Really?

859
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,184
Her stocking!

860
01:12:39,312 --> 01:12:40,938
Right.

861
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:44,192
A brassiere! A Venus brassiere.

862
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:51,449
I wrapped it around her throat like this,

863
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,702
so the woman,

864
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:59,582
she took a rock
and clocked me in the head.

865
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,834
Where'd she hit you?

866
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,546
Right here, next to my eye.

867
01:13:06,923 --> 01:13:11,678
It still hurts,
even if it was just a dream.

868
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,356
Byung-soon?

869
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,567
Are you gonna keep saying it was a dream?

870
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:30,780
That's enough. Turn your head.

871
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,115
So this bruise is from the rock?

872
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:35,785
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

873
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:44,210
You've done well, now let's finish this.

874
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:52,552
So... since she hit me like this
with the rock,

875
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,512
I must have lost consciousness?

876
01:13:55,180 --> 01:14:00,476
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

877
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,853
And?

878
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:05,941
I was in the bottom of an outhouse!
A shithouse!

879
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:11,237
And maggots were creeping
all over the place!

880
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:15,199
- Not the outhouse again.
- So after brushing them off,

881
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:19,745
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

882
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:22,665
Even in a dream, it's hard.

883
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,584
But then I saw,

884
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:29,214
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

885
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,133
Walking to the playground,

886
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,928
I saw huge swarms of girls,

887
01:14:36,012 --> 01:14:38,139
so many, and the smell...

888
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:40,433
Wait! Over here.

889
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:47,524
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

890
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,944
Everyone knows that story.

891
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,488
I saw it in a dream.

892
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:00,077
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction

893
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:02,663
perpendicular to the wind.

894
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:05,166
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

895
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,460
Put it down. Hey!

896
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,055
Pretend you're dead!

897
01:15:23,309 --> 01:15:27,647
Last time, who told you that story
about the outhouse?

898
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,482
You came because of that?

899
01:15:34,612 --> 01:15:35,780
What's wrong?

900
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:40,201
I hurt myself in the chute.
There was a pebble in there.

901
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:43,038
Where's the nurse?

902
01:15:45,206 --> 01:15:46,791
I'll put it on for you.

903
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,002
I'll do it.

904
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,757
Shy? You're just a kid. Sit down.

905
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:58,928
Give it to me.

906
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:02,766
Lift up your shirt.

907
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:07,437
Think about what I asked you.

908
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:14,444
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

909
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,114
Who might have told that story first.

910
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:20,157
How would I know?

911
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:25,038
It's like asking who made up
the elephant jokes.

912
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,085
Why don't you go to the outhouse yourself?

913
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:34,005
Do I look like I have time for that?

914
01:17:24,764 --> 01:17:26,557
Even still,

915
01:17:26,641 --> 01:17:29,643
some kids talk,
so you snoop around the outhouse?

916
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,312
You got that much time?

917
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:34,148
- Giving me a heart attack.
- Investigating...

918
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,400
What?

919
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:38,528
Is investigating such a dirty job?

920
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,868
Ah! Is that why they made up the rumor?

921
01:17:46,077 --> 01:17:49,080
I saw her myself once or twice.

922
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,708
- That woman.
- Who?

923
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:53,918
A crying woman.

924
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:56,546
When was it?

925
01:17:58,339 --> 01:18:00,425
I was in the outhouse then too,

926
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:03,553
when I heard a woman crying.

927
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,014
When I came out,

928
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:12,145
there was a woman working on that hill,
who kept crying.

929
01:18:14,063 --> 01:18:15,690
<i>A woman was crying?</i>

930
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:17,567
<i>Yes.</i>

931
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,695
<i>She kept crying on that hill.</i>

932
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:23,364
<i>It just seemed strange.</i>

933
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:44,928
Hello?

934
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:48,932
Excuse me.

935
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:53,311
Are you the person who lives here?

936
01:18:55,688 --> 01:18:56,898
Who are you?

937
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,403
I'd like to ask something. I heard that...

938
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:06,616
Wait!

939
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:08,993
Look here.

940
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,746
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

941
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:16,542
You can't stay there. Someone might see.

942
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:20,213
There's no one here.

943
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,845
Go, please. I beg you.

944
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:43,236
Be assured this will remain a secret.

945
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:46,739
As we're both women

946
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,160
tell me everything comfortably
and in detail.

947
01:19:56,207 --> 01:19:57,583
That night...

948
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:05,758
a light rain was falling.

949
01:20:06,592 --> 01:20:07,885
When was it?

950
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:11,764
It was...

951
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:17,478
last September.

952
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,991
I had read all the articles...

953
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,162
about the women killed.

954
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:41,502
The methods he used were exactly the same.

955
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,547
It was...

956
01:20:47,633 --> 01:20:48,801
the same with me.

957
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:56,976
You saw his face?

958
01:20:57,643 --> 01:20:59,312
I tried not to on purpose

959
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,065
keeping my chin down.

960
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,818
My panties covered my head,

961
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,821
but I closed my eyes tight.

962
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:14,035
If I saw him, he'd have killed me.

963
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:20,833
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

964
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:23,836
His hands were very soft.

965
01:21:25,129 --> 01:21:29,592
The hand over my mouth was delicate,

966
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:31,260
just like a woman's.

967
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:08,339
We're done.
Let's get ourselves some sleep.

968
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:11,676
Once we get your seal, it's done.

969
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,096
It's all as you said.

970
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:17,598
Sound good?

971
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:20,809
Yes, of course.

972
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:23,937
Oh, it's finally over, right?

973
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:26,023
Please let me down. Please.

974
01:22:32,488 --> 01:22:34,656
Let him go. He's not the murderer.

975
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,741
What?

976
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:39,453
Byung-soon, are you the murderer?

977
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,538
Yes, sir, yes...

978
01:22:41,622 --> 01:22:43,749
Shut up. No, you're not.

979
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,376
I think I am...

980
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,711
Let him go!

981
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,756
Write down everything she said...

982
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,840
Hey!

983
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:54,134
You toying with me?

984
01:22:54,218 --> 01:22:56,637
Are you having fun?

985
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:59,598
I caught the murderer, okay?

986
01:22:59,682 --> 01:23:01,976
What do you mean, you caught him?

987
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:10,025
- Did you hang him from the ceiling?
- Well, he kept lying, and...

988
01:23:10,109 --> 01:23:12,861
Get hold of yourself. Those journalists...

989
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:16,032
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

990
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:22,371
Stop!

991
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:25,374
Listen.

992
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,212
What is that?

993
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,382
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

994
01:23:33,466 --> 01:23:34,884
Yes, it's live.

995
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:47,688
First, declare a state of emergency.

996
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:51,234
And send me two garrisons of men.

997
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:54,237
Because our intelligence says so!

998
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:58,615
Tonight. There'll be a murder tonight.

999
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:01,493
Hello, I need to speak to producer Im...

1000
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:03,704
What? He quit?

1001
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:05,873
Get me the AD now.

1002
01:24:07,124 --> 01:24:10,210
The song that was just played,
"Sad Letter."

1003
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:12,713
Read the name and address
of the requester.

1004
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,924
You must have the postcard.

1005
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:17,510
What? Prank call?

1006
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,054
It's the police, bastard! Hello?

1007
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:22,473
I'll go myself.

1008
01:24:23,432 --> 01:24:25,517
Are the garrisons coming?

1009
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:27,687
They don't even have one man available.

1010
01:24:29,146 --> 01:24:33,317
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1011
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:08,603
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1012
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:16,277
Estimated time of death,
last night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1013
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:23,242
When the two of you were fighting
like madmen. Right?

1014
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,496
Wait a minute.

1015
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:31,876
There's something in the vagina.

1016
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:47,099
Looks like a peach.

1017
01:26:14,043 --> 01:26:15,461
Nine pieces.

1018
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,765
Do you see this kind of thing
in Seoul often?

1019
01:26:30,267 --> 01:26:31,268
Never.

1020
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:36,524
You were right.

1021
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:38,109
What?

1022
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:45,366
These guys were a waste of time
from the start.

1023
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:48,703
Hey!

1024
01:26:49,995 --> 01:26:51,789
A call from the radio station.

1025
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:55,126
I think she found the postcard.

1026
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,547
I've got the postcard. It has an address.

1027
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:01,632
Can you write it down?

1028
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:07,430
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District #32.
Park Hyun-gyu.

1029
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:43,299
Who are you?

1030
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:48,345
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1031
01:27:50,347 --> 01:27:53,058
He works at the factory at this time.

1032
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:20,961
Hey, Hyun-gyu. Park Hyun-gyu!

1033
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,090
Park Hyun-gyu!

1034
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:55,704
Show me your hands.

1035
01:29:05,297 --> 01:29:07,424
They're quite smooth.

1036
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:12,304
How long have you worked
in the factory office?

1037
01:29:16,058 --> 01:29:17,601
From September last year.

1038
01:29:19,353 --> 01:29:23,983
Then... a little before the first murder.

1039
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:32,449
So after doing your military service,
you came to this town,

1040
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,703
and the murders all began taking place.

1041
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:37,246
Right?

1042
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:40,875
Park Hyun-gyu.

1043
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:44,003
You sent this postcard to the station.

1044
01:29:44,587 --> 01:29:45,837
Yes.

1045
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:47,756
You sent several others too.

1046
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,466
Yes.

1047
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:52,386
You asked it to be played on rainy days.

1048
01:29:53,178 --> 01:29:54,305
Yes.

1049
01:29:56,181 --> 01:29:57,641
"Sad Letter."

1050
01:29:58,767 --> 01:30:02,396
You know that each time this song played,
a woman was murdered?

1051
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:06,609
No.

1052
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:11,113
Look at the broadcast records.

1053
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:15,326
Okay.

1054
01:30:16,785 --> 01:30:19,788
The song played yesterday? "Sad Letter."

1055
01:30:21,373 --> 01:30:22,374
Yes.

1056
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:25,335
- You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1057
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:29,548
Your song played at 7:08,
and the program finished at 8 p.m.

1058
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:30,757
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1059
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,759
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1060
01:30:32,843 --> 01:30:35,804
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1061
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,848
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1062
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:40,767
- Because you went out!
- I was home!

1063
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:44,104
She was killed between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1064
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,731
You weren't listening, you went out!

1065
01:30:46,815 --> 01:30:48,275
Don't make me laugh.

1066
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,570
- Yong-go!
- You motherfucker. Are you joking?

1067
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:53,822
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1068
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,786
Get back here!

1069
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:09,254
Even kids in this town
know you torture innocent people.

1070
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:12,132
- Shut up, you!
- Get back here!

1071
01:31:16,178 --> 01:31:17,930
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1072
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:21,350
Never.

1073
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:26,271
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1074
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:30,859
You say you listened at home to the end?

1075
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:35,406
But you couldn't have forgotten
the last song.

1076
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:41,954
Because the DJ introduced it
with some very striking words.

1077
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:46,208
She mentioned you,
and the many postcards you sent.

1078
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,671
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1079
01:31:51,463 --> 01:31:54,341
Tell me
if you really listened to the end.

1080
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,386
I don't remember.

1081
01:31:57,803 --> 01:31:59,138
You don't remember?

1082
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:02,141
Should I explain it for you?

1083
01:32:05,894 --> 01:32:08,439
This is the recording
of yesterday's program.

1084
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:13,694
Last night,
you sat listening to this song.

1085
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:19,116
Outside the rain was pelting down,
you listened...

1086
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:24,121
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1087
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:29,126
There's something you always do
when you hear this song.

1088
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:34,631
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1089
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:40,554
you left the lights on in your own room
and crept outside.

1090
01:32:41,346 --> 01:32:46,018
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1091
01:32:47,102 --> 01:32:50,355
Who will it be today?

1092
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:53,025
Right?

1093
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,447
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1094
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:00,865
The rain drenching you.

1095
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:05,162
But you find all this pleasurable.
Stimulating, right?

1096
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:09,249
So yesterday you stuffed this
in that woman's body!

1097
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:14,505
You remember how many pieces it was?

1098
01:33:15,672 --> 01:33:17,800
One piece, two,

1099
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,343
- three pieces...
- Shut up!

1100
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:23,304
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

1101
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:24,848
Shut the fuck up!

1102
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:27,309
Yong-go!

1103
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,108
I told you not to hit him.

1104
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:38,612
Didn't I?

1105
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:43,825
I warned you. You know why journalists
snoop around here.

1106
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:45,619
You stupid bastard.

1107
01:33:48,705 --> 01:33:52,960
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1108
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,725
I'm going crazy.

1109
01:34:12,104 --> 01:34:13,939
No eyewitnesses

1110
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,025
not one piece of evidence.

1111
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:21,029
We need something, shit.

1112
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:25,117
Shit, we don't need any damn witnesses.

1113
01:34:25,742 --> 01:34:27,619
Just a confession will do.

1114
01:34:28,203 --> 01:34:31,331
Just need to beat that bastard
to an inch of his life.

1115
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:36,044
You've changed.

1116
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:43,093
Try it and you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1117
01:34:47,347 --> 01:34:49,391
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1118
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,814
I always wanted to ask you.

1119
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,192
When you dragged him up the mountain,

1120
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:05,782
he talked about Hyang-sook's death
in so much detail.

1121
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:07,742
So?

1122
01:35:07,826 --> 01:35:12,748
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1123
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,001
I told you I didn't!

1124
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:20,755
But how did he know
the way she was strangled...

1125
01:35:20,839 --> 01:35:22,216
That's my point!

1126
01:35:25,844 --> 01:35:29,013
The tape...
Where's the tape from the mountain?

1127
01:35:29,097 --> 01:35:31,183
Miss Kwon? Gwi-OK.

1128
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:36,396
<i>Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.</i>

1129
01:35:37,147 --> 01:35:38,648
<i>She looked completely dead.</i>

1130
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,525
Listen to how he speaks here.

1131
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:44,821
<i>Covered up Hyang-sook's head.</i>

1132
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:46,615
<i>With what?</i>

1133
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:48,908
<i>Her panties.</i>

1134
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:53,413
<i>Her head was covered with her panties.</i>

1135
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:55,498
He's talking like it was someone else.

1136
01:35:55,582 --> 01:35:57,250
<i>And then?</i>

1137
01:35:57,334 --> 01:36:01,338
He's describing what he saw.

1138
01:36:05,592 --> 01:36:07,719
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1139
01:36:19,856 --> 01:36:21,233
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1140
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:23,777
Kwang-ho...

1141
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:26,947
No, no. We came for a drink.

1142
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:29,241
Some meat, please.

1143
01:36:31,201 --> 01:36:32,995
What are you doing here?

1144
01:36:42,045 --> 01:36:44,006
Control yourself, huh?

1145
01:36:44,798 --> 01:36:47,801
He's not in his room. I'll check outside.

1146
01:36:48,468 --> 01:36:50,262
Try the game arcade.

1147
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:54,057
How long have you been here?

1148
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:56,977
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1149
01:37:09,865 --> 01:37:13,326
<i>It is now 23 months
since the incident first surfaced.</i>

1150
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,288
<i>Before interrogating Detective Moon...</i>

1151
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,916
They should cut off all detectives' dicks!

1152
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,169
Nah, it's not worth it.

1153
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:24,629
Stupid bastards.

1154
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:27,007
Quiet, let's listen.

1155
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,729
<i>The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture</i>

1156
01:37:41,813 --> 01:37:43,565
<i>and sexual assault, opened today.</i>

1157
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:09,007
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1158
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:12,135
Your parents pay good money...

1159
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,139
Hey, Yong-go!

1160
01:38:21,853 --> 01:38:23,980
Call the police! Police!

1161
01:38:50,298 --> 01:38:51,591
Kwang-ho!

1162
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:54,886
Kwang-ho! Don't run away!

1163
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,556
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1164
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,017
Kwang-ho!

1165
01:39:07,899 --> 01:39:09,109
Kwang-ho!

1166
01:39:11,236 --> 01:39:12,487
I'm sorry...

1167
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:14,864
What's wrong with you?

1168
01:39:14,948 --> 01:39:17,784
We're not here to catch you. Come down.

1169
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:21,288
You're gonna kill me?

1170
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:25,291
We'll forget that any of that happened.

1171
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:28,503
If a fight breaks out, that can happen.

1172
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:32,048
It's okay, just come down, huh?

1173
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:35,718
If I do, you'll kill me? I know it.

1174
01:39:35,802 --> 01:39:38,054
We won't kill you, just come down.

1175
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:42,225
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1176
01:39:43,059 --> 01:39:45,061
You...

1177
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:48,106
You remember Hyang-sook?

1178
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:51,359
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1179
01:39:52,777 --> 01:39:56,114
That's right.
You used to follow after her.

1180
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:58,908
But that night,

1181
01:39:58,992 --> 01:40:03,663
when it rained, you saw her killed, huh?

1182
01:40:03,747 --> 01:40:06,499
That? I told you already.

1183
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:10,711
In the forest. I told you already...

1184
01:40:10,795 --> 01:40:14,841
You saw when Hyang-sook was murdered,
didn't you? Here?

1185
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:17,093
Yeah, here.

1186
01:40:18,094 --> 01:40:20,889
The paddy next to the train tracks.

1187
01:40:24,392 --> 01:40:28,688
That night, did you see the killer's face?

1188
01:40:29,314 --> 01:40:31,775
- Yeah.
- Really?

1189
01:40:32,484 --> 01:40:34,027
Lightning, ka-rang!

1190
01:40:37,405 --> 01:40:40,784
I saw everything from inside here.

1191
01:40:42,285 --> 01:40:44,996
So you saw his face?

1192
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,790
Three times.

1193
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,710
Do you remember him in detail?

1194
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,213
He was handsome.

1195
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,424
More than me.

1196
01:41:01,846 --> 01:41:04,391
Was this the face you saw?

1197
01:41:06,893 --> 01:41:08,228
Look at the picture.

1198
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,409
- You know how hot that fire was?
- Look at the photo!

1199
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:26,955
- It was so hot!
- Snap out of it!

1200
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:30,249
Here, look closely.

1201
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:33,002
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

1202
01:41:33,086 --> 01:41:35,171
Look at the photo!

1203
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:36,964
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1204
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:42,553
When I was young, he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1205
01:41:42,637 --> 01:41:44,680
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1206
01:41:44,764 --> 01:41:46,433
What the hell!

1207
01:41:48,351 --> 01:41:50,061
Please forgive him.

1208
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,938
You bastard!

1209
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:54,608
What are you students doing?

1210
01:41:55,483 --> 01:41:57,151
We're police!

1211
01:41:57,235 --> 01:41:59,446
Bullshit! Then we're the FBI!

1212
01:42:14,502 --> 01:42:18,465
Hey, Kwang-ho! We're looking for you.

1213
01:42:19,966 --> 01:42:21,009
Hey!

1214
01:42:21,468 --> 01:42:24,012
A train's coming! Come here!

1215
01:42:29,976 --> 01:42:31,603
Out of the way, quick!

1216
01:42:33,688 --> 01:42:34,738
It's dangerous there.

1217
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,483
Out of the way! You idiot!

1218
01:42:37,567 --> 01:42:39,194
Stay away. Go...

1219
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:23,571
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1220
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:01,317
Yes, yes.

1221
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:05,321
Journalists tend to be like that.

1222
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:08,908
Sir, as I said last time...

1223
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:12,579
Hello? Hello?

1224
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:15,122
Assholes!

1225
01:44:15,206 --> 01:44:17,459
High-ranking bastards...

1226
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,836
- Chief!
- What?

1227
01:44:20,253 --> 01:44:23,798
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1228
01:44:24,257 --> 01:44:25,257
They found what?

1229
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:26,676
Take a look.

1230
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,845
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1231
01:44:29,929 --> 01:44:34,266
Maybe he masturbated on the corpse,

1232
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:36,686
and semen fell on her clothes.

1233
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,063
Wait. So

1234
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:42,817
if the DNA in this semen

1235
01:44:42,901 --> 01:44:45,736
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1236
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:51,951
then the game's over, isn't it?

1237
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:55,246
Yes, that would be quite strong evidence.

1238
01:44:55,705 --> 01:45:00,292
The problem is,
we don't have the technology in Korea

1239
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:02,212
to carry out such tests.

1240
01:45:02,962 --> 01:45:06,966
It must be sent to America.
There's no other way.

1241
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:11,971
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1242
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:15,766
So we just have to wait
for the documents from America?

1243
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,018
That's right.

1244
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:21,355
You sent people
to watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1245
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:25,318
Yes! They're watching him 24-hours a day.

1246
01:45:26,236 --> 01:45:28,529
Once the result comes in from America,

1247
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:31,950
wait until we get our hands
on that bastard.

1248
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:52,846
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Why?

1249
01:45:53,429 --> 01:45:56,640
- Did you go to the hospital?
- For this little scratch?

1250
01:45:56,724 --> 01:46:00,353
- Come here.
- It's okay. I put on some medicine.

1251
01:46:01,729 --> 01:46:03,898
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1252
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:09,945
- It keeps swelling.
- Come on, let's go.

1253
01:46:10,029 --> 01:46:11,281
Just get in.

1254
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:15,618
So, you have to amputate?

1255
01:46:16,119 --> 01:46:17,953
Should I explain it again?

1256
01:46:18,037 --> 01:46:21,373
It was pierced,
but why cut off a healthy leg?

1257
01:46:21,457 --> 01:46:23,543
If you don't, he'll die.

1258
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,630
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1259
01:46:28,464 --> 01:46:31,467
For rusty nails,
you need to see a doctor fast.

1260
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:33,970
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1261
01:46:34,762 --> 01:46:39,183
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1262
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,144
Crazy bastards.

1263
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:43,271
Let's go.

1264
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:47,691
Are you family?

1265
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:49,985
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1266
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:52,321
Anyway, you came together, right?

1267
01:46:52,405 --> 01:46:56,618
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1268
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:15,762
You fucker...

1269
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:32,612
Hello, post office?

1270
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:35,907
It's Seo Tae-yoon, Investigative Crimes.

1271
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:39,661
Have the documents from America arrived?

1272
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,873
Have you checked 100%?

1273
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:48,086
I keep calling because it's important!

1274
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:53,466
Since it's so important,
please call as soon as it comes.

1275
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:58,805
Hello?

1276
01:48:01,849 --> 01:48:03,768
Uh, now?

1277
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:06,562
Why'd you call me out?

1278
01:48:07,313 --> 01:48:10,066
Why? Can't I do that sometimes?

1279
01:48:10,566 --> 01:48:14,362
Your face looks worn.
Are you sleeping well?

1280
01:48:16,739 --> 01:48:18,741
What kind of detective sleeps well?

1281
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:24,956
- What's wrong with you?
- Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1282
01:48:29,627 --> 01:48:31,421
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1283
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:38,469
You look like a corpse.

1284
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:46,644
It may be no use asking,
but can you do anything else?

1285
01:48:48,896 --> 01:48:50,523
Can you quit your job?

1286
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:14,857
Violent Crimes Dept! Violent Crimes!

1287
01:50:15,441 --> 01:50:17,985
How many visits in one night?

1288
01:50:18,069 --> 01:50:20,404
Is money that important?

1289
01:50:22,615 --> 01:50:26,285
Bo-kyung's grandmother collapsed again.
I have to go.

1290
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:29,747
You deserve a medal.

1291
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:31,958
Get one from the Health Ministry.

1292
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:45,721
Chief! Park Hyun-gyu
hasn't come home for two hours.

1293
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:48,975
It's only six stops from there
to his house,

1294
01:50:49,392 --> 01:50:51,226
so he must have gotten off.

1295
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:54,104
Would a man under investigation
act so wild?

1296
01:50:54,188 --> 01:50:56,858
He's capable of it.

1297
01:50:57,275 --> 01:51:01,445
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1298
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:07,326
Once the DNA tests arrive, he's through.
Stop it.

1299
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,912
I let him go...

1300
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:13,124
Don't get so upset!

1301
01:52:54,600 --> 01:53:01,565
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

1302
01:53:01,649 --> 01:53:06,696
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...</i>

1303
01:54:17,933 --> 01:54:22,104
Will you make any special investigation
into this incident?

1304
01:54:37,536 --> 01:54:39,830
A razor wound in the breast...

1305
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:44,418
What the hell?

1306
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:48,547
Something is stuck inside of the vagina.

1307
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:53,135
Huh? Looks like a ball point pen,

1308
01:54:53,761 --> 01:54:55,470
and a spoon.

1309
01:54:55,554 --> 01:54:57,681
Jesus...

1310
01:55:01,143 --> 01:55:03,354
Look inside, closely.

1311
01:55:09,902 --> 01:55:11,946
Wait, what's that?

1312
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:16,242
An old band-aid.

1313
01:55:30,005 --> 01:55:31,757
What are you doing?

1314
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,512
Why are you touching a corpse?

1315
01:56:02,037 --> 01:56:03,038
What?

1316
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:07,918
Get up, you bastard!

1317
01:56:15,217 --> 01:56:17,511
You fucker!

1318
01:56:20,931 --> 01:56:23,184
Get up, you fucker.

1319
01:56:25,352 --> 01:56:28,063
Are you human?

1320
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:45,206
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1321
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:57,134
Tell me!

1322
01:56:58,469 --> 01:57:00,262
Tell me you killed them!

1323
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,599
Tell me!

1324
01:57:04,683 --> 01:57:07,478
You killed all those women!

1325
01:57:27,581 --> 01:57:28,666
Yeah.

1326
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,793
I killed them.

1327
01:57:33,128 --> 01:57:34,838
I killed them all.

1328
01:57:39,051 --> 01:57:43,138
That's what you want to hear, right?

1329
01:57:44,807 --> 01:57:46,267
You feel better?

1330
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,816
Inspector Seo!

1331
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:57,152
The papers from America!

1332
01:57:58,237 --> 01:57:59,530
Read them!

1333
01:58:00,823 --> 01:58:02,073
Shit!

1334
01:58:02,157 --> 01:58:03,325
You fucker!

1335
01:58:05,244 --> 01:58:07,537
You fucker! You mocked us, didn't you?

1336
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:09,540
You bastard!

1337
01:58:11,875 --> 01:58:13,294
You mocked us!

1338
01:58:30,811 --> 01:58:31,854
What's wrong?

1339
01:59:04,136 --> 01:59:05,596
There's a mistake.

1340
01:59:16,523 --> 01:59:19,151
This document is a lie. I don't need it.

1341
01:59:32,915 --> 01:59:35,042
What does it say, huh?

1342
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:45,928
It really wasn't you?

1343
01:59:53,394 --> 01:59:54,770
Look in my eyes.

1344
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:27,678
Look in my eyes!

1345
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,986
Fuck, I don't know.

1346
02:00:51,702 --> 02:00:53,412
Do you get up each morning too?

1347
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:58,792
Go!

1348
02:01:01,962 --> 02:01:03,505
Just go, fucker!

1349
02:02:18,914 --> 02:02:20,290
That's enough.

1350
02:02:55,200 --> 02:03:00,747
2003

1351
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:02,249
Chi-hyuk.

1352
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:08,046
You played computer games
all night, right?

1353
02:03:09,047 --> 02:03:10,257
Did you or didn't you?

1354
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:16,597
Look in my eyes, son.

1355
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:19,224
Eyes all bloodshot.

1356
02:03:20,559 --> 02:03:23,061
- Do you play well?
- Yeah!

1357
02:03:23,478 --> 02:03:26,398
You don't study,
might as well be good at games.

1358
02:03:27,649 --> 02:03:31,986
If you won't study, go get some exercise.

1359
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:34,531
Sitting in front of the computer...

1360
02:03:34,948 --> 02:03:36,533
I really didn't!

1361
02:03:36,617 --> 02:03:38,118
What do you mean you didn't?

1362
02:03:38,619 --> 02:03:40,662
Think you can fool my eyes?

1363
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,707
He said he didn't. Believe him.

1364
02:03:44,791 --> 02:03:49,880
No, two days ago,
Manager Oh called my company.

1365
02:03:51,256 --> 02:03:55,927
He kept saying you can't do this
to people, it's not fair.

1366
02:03:56,011 --> 02:03:59,097
You can't believe him.

1367
02:04:00,057 --> 02:04:01,975
Did I do anything wrong?

1368
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:07,397
Oh, Chairman Kim...
I'm on the road now with our product.

1369
02:04:10,901 --> 02:04:13,612
Sure, let's have dinner with Manager Oh.

1370
02:04:15,155 --> 02:04:16,615
It's been a while.

1371
02:04:20,118 --> 02:04:23,038
Chul-Yong! Pull over a minute!

1372
02:06:00,927 --> 02:06:02,554
Is something in there?

1373
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:05,974
Is anything in there?

1374
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:08,727
No...

1375
02:06:09,853 --> 02:06:11,521
Then why are you looking?

1376
02:06:13,982 --> 02:06:15,650
I'm just looking.

1377
02:06:16,735 --> 02:06:18,111
That's so weird.

1378
02:06:20,363 --> 02:06:21,656
What is?

1379
02:06:23,116 --> 02:06:24,867
A while back,

1380
02:06:24,951 --> 02:06:28,997
a man was here looking into that hole.

1381
02:06:32,918 --> 02:06:35,587
I asked him the same question.

1382
02:06:36,296 --> 02:06:38,090
Why he was looking there.

1383
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,800
What did he say?

1384
02:06:40,717 --> 02:06:42,219
What was it?

1385
02:06:43,178 --> 02:06:44,637
Right...

1386
02:06:44,721 --> 02:06:48,475
He remembered
doing something here long ago,

1387
02:06:48,975 --> 02:06:52,813
so he came back to take a look.

1388
02:07:06,493 --> 02:07:08,411
Did you see his face?

1389
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:15,293
What did he look like?

1390
02:07:17,087 --> 02:07:18,296
Well...

1391
02:07:20,298 --> 02:07:21,842
kind of plain.

1392
02:07:24,094 --> 02:07:25,345
In what way?

1393
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:29,599
Just...

1394
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:33,186
ordinary.
