00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,670
2 inch I-beams, copper wire.

164
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,890
If I can just find
a welding station,

165
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,540
won't be a problem.

166
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,980
- Excellent.

167
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,550
- All right, as long as we get
on the factory floor,

168
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,640
everything will be easy
as apple pie.

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
- You ladies are the new hires?

170
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,860
Good, we need all the help
we can get.

171
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,080
- Well, that was easy.
- Hmm.

172
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,650
- You two gals,
hit the assembly line.

173
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,300
- Okay.
- You got it.

174
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,530
- And you, my secretary
just quit on me.

175
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,830
How fast can type?

176
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,620
- I can process over
a million words a minute.

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,620
- Sure.

178
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
My office is down the hall.

179
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,670
Start the coffee.

180
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,280
- Oh.

181
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,760
- What about us?

182
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,200
- Janitorial is that way.

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,550
- Excuse me?

184
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,550
- No coloreds on the floor.

185
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,160
- I am getting really sick
of this century.

186
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,640
- Whoa.

187
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,530
- Hello again, name's Abby.

188
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,920
Now, we run a tight ship

189
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,180
and turn around a new
Cat bomber every 48 hours,

190
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,620
but if you follow my lead,
you'll do just fine.

191
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,230
- Sweet.

192
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,840
- The factory wasn't built
with women in mind,

193
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,370
but I could draw you a map

194
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,060
to the port-a-johns outside
if you need one.

195
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,370
- Oh, I'm sure we can find it.

196
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,630
There are a few men here
who were too old to be drafted,

197
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,380
but it's really us ladies
who run the show.

198
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,290
- Huh, how empowering.
-

199
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,600
Hey, Abby!

200
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,770
If you were a fruit,
you'd be a "fineapple."

201
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,600
- Very funny, George.

202
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,210
- And I spoke too soon.

203
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,690
- Yup.

204
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,000
- We're gonna start you
on bolts and washers.

205
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
Now, don't let a bolt go by
without a washer. Got it?

206
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,570
- Got it.

207
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,000
- Good.
Now I better get back to it.

208
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,790
- Oh, hey, thanks
for showing us around.

209
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,920
- Of course.

210
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Us ladies got to stick
together.

211
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,320
- How the hell am I supposed
to build this thing

212
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,670
if we're not even
on the factory floor?

213
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,370
- First day?
- Unfortunately.

214
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,070
- With that attitude,
we can make it your last day.

215
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,640
- What is the point of us
staying?

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,380
- Look, I'm with you.

217
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,510
This sucks.

218
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,210
Or we might've
just been handed a gift.

219
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,950
- You have a sad definition
of gift.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,690
- No, we can build the parts
we need here.

221
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,870
We need to smuggle them out.

222
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,050
We just got handed
our Trojan horse.

223
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,700
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

224
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,710
- Good.

225
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,060
Shift starts at 8:00,
ends at 8:00.

226
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,580
- What about breaks?

227
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,540
- Take that up
with the complaint box.

228
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,980
- Okay, Where's that?

229
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,370
- Right next
to the champagne fountain.

230
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,810
- What the hell is this for?

231
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,160
- I don't know
where you're from

232
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,560
with that city attitude
and country hairstyle,

233
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,470
but here, we're professionals.

needs us to do,

while we're doing it.

- Me too.

Congrats on the big move.

241

All the ancestors
are super pumped.

242
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,590
- Uh-huh.

243
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,720
- Well, most of them.

244
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,200
- Who's not pumped?

245
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,200
Uncle Arjomand.

246
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,860
- Oh, come on, guys.

247
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,210
Haven't met
an uncle I couldn't schmooze.

248
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,950
- Yeah, see, Amoo Arjomand--
he's like 400 years old.

249
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,390
He's essentially unschmoozable.

250
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,600
If he doesn't like you,

251
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,130
he could have you kicked
out of the totem.

252
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,260
- Is that legal?

253
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,740
- I don't know or understand

254
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,740
the rules of the totem,
so, yeah.

255
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,400

So what do I do?

256
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,960
- Show him respect.
- Okay.

257
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,750
- How much do you know
about Persian culture?

258
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,790
- Full disclosure, eh.

259
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,140
- Hello, Legends?
I'm parched.

260
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,880
Can someone bring me
some water?

261
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,760
Preferably sparkling?

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,500
- Is that?
- Long story.

263
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,110
Bishop dropped in
and--and hold up.

264
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,420
This could be the perfect
ta'arof teachable moment.

265
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,810
- What's ta'arof?

266
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,900
- Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

267
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,160
the heart of Persian etiquette
and hospitality.

268
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,470
Having a guest in the house
is the perfect opportunity

269
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,770
for you to learn all about it.

270
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,730
- Okay, regular water
will be just fine.

271
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,120
Well, regular ice water

272
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,130
with a pinch of salt
for electrolytes.

273
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,650

this quite a challenge.

274
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,040
Good luck.

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,180

2-inch I-beams to you?

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,710
- Maybe.

277
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,580
- I wanna snag one
and bring to Spooner.

278

Can you handle this?

279

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,140
- Okay, get in there
and do your thing.

324
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,060
- I will cover your shift.
- You sure?

325
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,280
- Just get me home.

326
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,150
- I got you.

327
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,110
- When Bishop gets out
of the shower,

328
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,940
we will offer him some tea.

329
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,460
Big part of ta'arof
is making your guests

330
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,940
feel welcome in your home.

331
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,030
A real
"mi casa es su casa" vibe.

332
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,430
- But what if you're the guest?
- Good question.

333
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,470
When your host offers
you something, you must deny it

334
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,650
at least three times
before accepting it.

335
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,130
- That's not insulting?
- No!

336
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,000
It shows respect and
consideration toward your host.

337
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,310
You don't wanna be imposing
or seem expectant.

338
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,270
- Okay, if I'm being
totally honest,

339
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,750
it just seems like
you're all lying to each other.

340
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,180
- Yes, you're starting
to get it.

341
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,930
It is all a performance,
except in this case,

342
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,670
you're both
the actor and the audience.

343
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,760
I know it's supes confusing,
but that's how it's done, so...

344
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,940
- Nate, would you like any tea?

345
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,070
- Oh, tea.

346
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,200
It's like you read my mind.

347
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,940
Two sugars.
Don't steep it for too long.

348
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,160
- I just smuggled
those back from the totem.

349
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,030
That's 600 GSM Egyptian cotton.

350
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,170
- No wonder my hair's
still wet.

351
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,780
I usually use something denser.
Oh.

352
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,130
- If I may.

353
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,090
- Mmm.

354
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,220
Nope, I forgot to say
I can't drink caffeine.

355
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,010
It makes me jittery.
Do you have anything herbal?

356
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,090
- I can arrange that.

357
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,920
- Great.
Just bring it up to my room.

358
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,920
Definitely invest
in some 800 GSM towels.

359
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,930
You won't regret it.

360
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,230
- Great job, ladies.

361
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,540
See you in two days
for the next one.

362
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,150
Keep up the good work.

363
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,680
- We have to make a new one
of these every two days?

364
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,110
- I hope Esther and Spooner
are making progress.

365
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,340
- I did it.

366
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,040
- Don't we need,
like, 18 of these?

367
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,820
- Yeah, well, 17 now.

368
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,260
- We are never getting
out of here.

369
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,180
- Sir, the First Lady's office
called again.

370
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,000
She's insistent about seeing
the factory in action.

371
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,180
- Tell them I don't need
a babysitter.

372
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,270
- The injection molder
is down again.

373
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,960
But I have the work order
right here.

374
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,570
It just needs your stamp.

375
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,100
- I don't know what you girls
keep doing to these machines

376
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,190
that I have to keep
fixing them all the time.

377
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,490
You know that costs money?

378
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,190
- Of course, sir.
We're all doing our best.

379
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,800
- Just wish it was
a little better.

380
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,460
Give the order to Ms. Godfree.
I'll get it in the morning.

381
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,290
- Hey, what does
an injection molder do?

382
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,120
- It makes custom metal parts.

383
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,510
- Like this?
- Hypothetically.

384
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,560
- So with one stamp
on one work order,

385
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,250
we could have a machine
making all of our parts

386
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,170
and get out of here
in less than 48 hours.

387
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,080
- What about being invisible?
- Oh, come on.

388
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,870
What is the worst
that could happen?

389
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,180
Warn me if he comes back.

- It wasn't a spell, exactly,
more like a--a feeling.

418
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,400
- And any idea when
it's gonna wear off?

419
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,840
- Nope.

420
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,240

things easier on us.

- How?

422

run the factory, right?

423
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,330
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,460
- Well, now that's our job,

425
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,030
which means
we get to make our parts.

426
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,810
And as long as
we stay on schedule,

427
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,460
we won't alert Evil Gideon.

428

gonna be a very long day.

We should get some food,
get some sleep.

If we're gonna run a factory,

one of us should probably
figure out how.

This is my mess,

So retro.
- Yeah.

436

Pastry Smash?

437

I love that game.

438
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,410
- Here's
another important lesson.

439
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,930
When a guest
compliments something,

440
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,240
it's customary for the host
to give it to them.

441
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,720
It shows equality
and mutual respect

442
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,810
between the two.

443
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,160
- No.

444
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,720
- Now, you got me
wanting to play.

445
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,860
- Sure, just don't run
the battery down.

446
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,470
Thank you.

447
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,300
- Oh, my goodness,
I'm starving.

448
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,000
What did you guys make?

449
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,430
- Why is he down here?

450
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
- I'm learning
about Persian culture

451
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,390
so I can win over
cranky uncles.

452
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,740
- Bishop's my teachable moment.

453
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,700
- You're lucky I love you two.
- Aw, I love you.

454
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,700
Here's some
complex carbohydrates.

455
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,490
- Oh, thank you.
- Salad.

456
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,490
- You eat food?
How human are you?

457
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,580
- Biologically, I'm 100% human.

458
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,410
- Well, so then, how computer
are you?

459
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,500
- Also 100%,

460
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,280
which is confusing
mathematically,

461
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,720
but accurate metaphorically.

462
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,370

463
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,720

You've done it.

464
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,680
Fantastic work, dear girl.
Fantastic.

465
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,420
- Yeah, don't sound
so surprised.

466
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,510
- All right, Master Green.

467
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,380
If you'd be so kind as
to locate us

468
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,470
a pair of torch lights,
we shall proceed presently

469
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,470
to the woods,
where we shall begin our work.

470
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,300
- Actually, no need.
Astra's got you covered.

471
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,300
Wait until you two see
the workspace

472
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,040
that she locked down for you.

473
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,610
- Good morning, boss.

474
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,220
Sarah told me to tell you
that the Eagle has landed,

475
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,610
which is secret code
for "Gary and Gwyn

476
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,090
have set up the time machine
in the loading bay."

477
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,840
Why do humans
have secrets anyway?

478
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,710
- Because there are some things
people don't want

479

Without those women,
