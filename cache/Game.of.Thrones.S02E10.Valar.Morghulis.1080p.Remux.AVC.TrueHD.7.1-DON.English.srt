deep inside of me.

I, too, have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

But maybe you wished one of them could

overpower you, fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,550
Untie me. Now!

164
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,470
MAN: I gave it to you to cut the rope,
and now I don't have me dagger no more.

165
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,098
So unless it got stuck in your arse
on its way to your cunt,

166
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,017
it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.

167
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,104
What's your business here?

168
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,064
Traveling a prisoner.

169
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,565
(LAUGHS)

170
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,653
- You're a woman.
- A woman!

171
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,279
Well, fuck me!

172
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,783
- If you've quite finished up...
- (LAUGHING CONTINUES)

173
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,163
- All right, we'll be going.
- Whoa. Whoa!

174
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,083
Who do you fight for?

175
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,711
The Starks.

176
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,922
What did he do?

177
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,511
- Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
- No, stealing is a crime.

178
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,180
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

179
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,974
- Where are you taking him?
- To Riverrun.

180
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,851
Why Riverrun?

181
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,687
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

182
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,981
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

183
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,316
I don't give the orders.

184
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,776
He must be important to someone.

185
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,696
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

186
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,324
All right, have it your way,

187
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,618
my lady.

188
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,458
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

189
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,210
- No.
- Then you don't know me.

190
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,297
Do you ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?

191
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,674
- Is it near Ashemark?
- No.

192
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,342
I've never been there.

193
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,887
What do you think of these beauties?

194
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,515
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

195
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
Two of them we did, yeah.

196
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,772
Wait.

197
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,693
I do know you.

198
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,488
That's Jaime Lannister.

199
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,282
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

200
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,785
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

201
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,453
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

202
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,247
- I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.
- (CHUCKLES)

203
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,750
They dragged him out of the woods
and threw him down before the king.

204
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,377
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

205
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,338
If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

206
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,757
I have a question for you both.

207
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,176
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

208
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,470
I count to three, you both answer.

209
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,680
What's his name?

210
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,516
One.

211
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,769
Two. Three.

212
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,438
(GROANS)

213
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,983
(GRUNTS)

214
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,869
Two quick deaths.

215
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,541
- (STABBING)
- (GROANING)

216
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,849
(PANTING)

217
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,899
Those were Stark men.

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,402
I don't serve the Starks.

219
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,155
I serve Lady Catelyn.

220
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,284
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

221
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,954
Stay.

222
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,254
(GRUNTS)

223
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,017
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

224
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,810
I know that.

225
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,313
And you mean to do it anyway?

226
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,276
I love her.

227
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,362
I know that seems important to you.

228
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,072
It is important to me.

229
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,286
Your father didn't love me when we married.

230
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,122
He hardly knew me or I him.

231
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,835
Love didn't just happen to us.

232
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,631
We built it slowly over the years,

233
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,424
stone by stone,

234
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,261
for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

235
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,600
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

236
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,019
but it is stronger.

237
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,813
It lasts longer.

238
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,944
And that is what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,

239
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,488
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

240
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,531
Because she's not beautiful?

241
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,492
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

242
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,495
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

243
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,413
And you agreed to it.

244
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,833
You gave him your word.

245
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,088
Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.

246
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,881
If your father lived his life for one thing...

247
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,633
My father is dead.

248
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,721
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

249
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,780
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

250
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,619
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

251
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,870
MELISANDRE: I did.

252
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,040
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

253
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,419
And I'm no better than a savage

254
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,546
trusting in a fire god.

255
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,260
I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.

256
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,722
I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell

257
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,766
as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

258
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,895
Attacked from behind
by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

259
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,897
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

260
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,816
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

261
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,235
You claimed to speak for a god.

262
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,487
Will you quit the war
just because you've lost a battle?

263
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,906
You talk about war as if you understand it.

264
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,992
I've been fighting far longer than you.

265
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,243
Have you?

266
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,579
Show me how you fight.

267
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,080
(CHOKING)

268
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,292
Show me.

269
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,592
Where's your god now?

270
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,054
Will he save you?

271
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,265
Where is your god?

272
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,019
Inside you.

273
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,647
(EXHALES)

274
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,901
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

275
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,281
I murdered my brother.

276
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,291
We murdered him.

277
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,919
Share the weight with me.

278
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,921
He wasn't your brother.

279
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,136
This war has just begun.

280
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,347
It will last for years.

281
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,642
Thousands will die at your command.

282
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,813
You will betray the men serving you.

283
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,149
You will betray your family.

284
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,986
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

285
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,116
And it will all be worth it

286
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,911
because you are the Son of Fire.

287
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,414
You are the Warrior of Light.

288
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,169
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

289
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,673
You will be king.

290
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,971
You promise these things,

291
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,474
but you don't know.

292
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,893
None of us know.

293
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,479
Let me show you.

294
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,032
Look into the fire, my king.

295
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,617
Look.

296
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,663
- I see fire.
- Keep looking.

297
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,631
Do you see?

298
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,260
Do you see, my king?

299
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,280
Yes.

(HORN BLOWING)

301
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,293
I will kill that man.

302

I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

how many spears they run through me,

00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,677
I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.

305
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,014
They want you to know you're surrounded.

306
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,599
I know I'm surrounded.

307
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,310
I know that because
I stood on the battlements

308
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,395
and saw I was surrounded.

309
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:35,980
They don't want you to sleep.

310
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,941
They want to sap your spirit before...

311
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,151
Thank you, wise bald man.

312
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,906
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

313
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,703
No word from my father?

No.

315
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,501
Send more ravens.

316
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,129
You killed all the ravens.

(HORN BLOWING CONTINUES)

319
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,018
First time I saw Winterfell,

320
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,607
it looked like something
that had been here for thousands of years

321
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,528
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

322
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,657
I saw it and I thought,

323
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,662
"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.

327

Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me of that.

You know what it's like to be told
how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?

329
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,025
To be told how much you owe them?

330
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,905
And then to go back home
to your real father...

00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:20,710
to every fucking god
in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

I serve Winterfell.

Now Winterfell is yours.

I'm bound by oath to serve you.

And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

341
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,600
Run.

342
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,730
Five hundred Northmen
wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.

343
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,982
You can't win.

344

Wait for nightfall and run.

345
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,070
There's nowhere to run.

346
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,489
I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.

347
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:54,869
And even if I did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines and made it home,

348
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,996
I'd be a coward.

Join the Night's Watch.

Once a man has taken the black,

354
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,727
he's beyond reach of the law.

All his past crimes are forgiven.

356
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,777
I won't make it to the Wall.

357
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:31,030
I won't make it 10 feet past
the Winterfell gates.

358
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,657
There are ways.

359
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:37,495
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.

360
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,957
The road will be dangerous.

But with a little luck...

362
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:52,468
The Night's Watch
is an ancient, honorable order.

363
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,848
You'll have opportunities there.

364
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,978
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

365
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:06,149
The opportunity to make amends
for what you've done.

366
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,862
I've done a lot, haven't I?

Things I never imagined myself doing.

Not yet.

have slipped beneath the waves.

- Yes, my lord?

00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,670
You don't want this one coming back for you.

648
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,810
Come along, Jon Snow.

649
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:59,630
Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

650
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,720
What the...

(SCREECHES)

652
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,978
DOREAH: Khaleesi, please.

653
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,147
He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

654
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,273
DAENERYS: Come.

655
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:32,306
Nothing.

656
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,150
Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

657
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,362
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

658
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:52,827
I am king of Qarth.
I can help you now, truly help you.

659
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,787
We can take the Iron Throne.

660
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,248
- I'll bring you a thousand ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

661
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,250
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

662
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,002
I beg you, please!

663
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,964
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

665
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,654
It's all a lie.

666
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,033
Looks real enough to me.

667
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,706
Real enough to buy a ship?

668
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,710
Aye, a small ship.

669
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:53,137
Take all the gold and jewels.

670

(WIND HOWLING)

674
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:30,257
I thought we were coming north
to fight wildlings.

675
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,720
Is this goat?

676
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,847
It's moose.

677
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,018
People shouldn't live anywhere
you need to burn shit to keep warm.

678
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:44,230
Well, you see a tree, let me know.

679
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,568
If you step back and think about it,

680
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:51,862
the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is...

681
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,031
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

682
00:58:54,615 --> 00:59:00,079
The thing about her that I find so interesting
is that after all that Craster's done to her,

683
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,623
she's still got hope that life might get better.

684
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:05,876
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

685
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,379
is that she said six words to you.

686
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,258
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

687
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,218
is absolutely nothing.

Two blasts is wildlings.

You're not fighting them alone. Come on.
