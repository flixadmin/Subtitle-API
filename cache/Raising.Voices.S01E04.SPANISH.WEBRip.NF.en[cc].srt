of how bad we're doing as a society.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
[laughs]

161
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
So, "Greta" is common in Scandinavia.

162
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,240
Do you have family
in Sweden or Denmark or somewhere?

163
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
- No?
- Nope.

164
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,080
When I was little I was always told
the story of Hansel and Gretel

165
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,400
and the little chocolate house.

166
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Hm.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
So where's your Hansel at?

168
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
[fire crackling]

169
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,200
Mm, mm, there is no Hansel.

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,400
So you go into the woods alone.

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,640
I really think
that there needs to be a little...

172
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,920
feminist revisionism
in traditional fairy tales.

173
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Because, well,

174
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
hm...

175
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,240
The witch is...

176
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,720
well, I think she's really
just a woman that's independent,

177
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,280
and is attracted to Gretel.

178
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,080
And she invites her
to her house with sweets.

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
And once inside her home she forces her

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,800
to do everything she wants.

181
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
And...

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,280
Greta loves it.

183
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
[calm music plays]

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,400
[laughs]

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,280
You can do whatever you want to me.

186
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,680
Although the Brothers Grimm
were German, no?

187
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,680
What?

188
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh.

189
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
[chuckles] Wow, sorry,
I'm really boring you.

190
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,440
No, no, no, no, no, no. Um, it's not you.

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,360
I've been listening to your story
and I spaced out completely, but no...

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
Oh god, I'm sorry.

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,040
It's also Friday and you, for sure,
have better things to do than be here.

194
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Anyway, so we're um,
still on for next week?

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Mm, sure. Yup.

196
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,040
- No problem. Yeah.
- Yeah?

197
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,880
[drum 'n bass music playing]

198
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,560
- [knocking on door]
- [door opens]

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
Nata, can you go pick up your brother?

200
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,720
- [sighs] Where is he?
- At his friend Eli's house.

201
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,720
Come on, Mom. It's two streets away.
He's ten, can't he walk back on his own?

202
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,560
Do you have any idea
how many ten-year-olds get run over?

203
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
[sighs]

204
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,120
[water rippling]

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
[Eli's mom] They've locked themselves
in his room. Give me a second.

206
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
[Nata] Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
[suspenseful music plays]

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,280
[Eli] We were in the middle of a game.

209
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,880
[Eli's mom] Come on,
you've been playing for three hours.

210
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,960
Mom, can Alex stay over this weekend?

211
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,720
No, sweetie, we're leaving
to go skiing tomorrow.

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,160
- Maybe next weekend, that work?
- That's great.

213
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Come on.

214
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,760
I HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS WEEKEND
YOU'LL GO FREAKING CRAZY

215
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,880
ALBERTO:
GREAT!!!

216
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,920
[Alma] Whee! [laughs]

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,480
Get closer, get closer. Over here!

218
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
You come over here! And go!

219
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,376
- Run, run, run, run, run!
- [Cooper barking]

220
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,560
[Pablito] Ah, Cooper! Give it to me!

221
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,880
- [Alma] Oh, no.
- Kick it! He's coming here.

222
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,520
Got it! Oh, no, no, no!

223
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,760
[Vero] How's school going?

224
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
It's been good.

225
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, I've gotten good grades
on a few projects.

226
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,680
And Nata and her study group have helped
with notes and explanations. So, good.

227
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
[Pablito] Are you gonna pass?

228
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Yeah.

229
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

230
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,280
I will work extremely hard
and I will do it.

231
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,200
How 'bout we go shopping
later tonight, if you want?

232
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,000
Surely there's gotta be
something you need.

233
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,120
Um, I'd love that.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,280
But I can't.

235
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,640
I, um, have so much to make up
and so little time to do it.

236
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,760
And besides, Greta mentioned she...
she wanted to come visit later.

237
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,680
May she?

238
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Any thoughts, Pablo?

239
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah.

240
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
You know, I fixed the leak.

241
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,680
There's no water flooding in.

242
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,360
We can put your boxes with your things
in there again, if you want.

243
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Cool.

244
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,560
Ugh! I swear, sometimes I just...
I go nuts, I spend hours watching him eat.

245
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,960
But the noise is fucking gross, Berta.

246
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
It's freaky, even for you, Berta.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
[slurping]

248
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,560
[Berta] It's the algorithm.
Because it brings out the worst in me.

249
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,040
I mean, it's...
it's like a type of inner God, almost.

250
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,440
You know? Like the keeper of my secrets.

251
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,880
Some imaginary friend
who knows me better than anyone.

252
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
Well, except for you.

253
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,080
- Oh, me?
- [Berta] Yeah.

254
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,040
- [Berta] Look, I'll show you.
- No.

255
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,696
No. I want this connection
that exists between the algorithm and I

256
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
to be totally private,
thank you very much.

257
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
- [Berta] Why? You hiding something, Alma?
- [Alma] Don't be stupid.

258
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,856
- [Berta] Come on, let me look at it.
- Uh, no, no, Berta. Calm down.

259
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,920
Don't go all psycho on me.

260
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,800
[Berta] Okay, okay. I'll stop.

261
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,480
[Alma chuckles]

262
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,680
[Berta] Whoa, whoa, wait, look,
this is the best part!

[metal clanging]

264
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Let's go.

[water rippling]

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,720
[Nata] The keys are in the pot over there.

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
We're alone.

- [chuckles] Come on.
- [Alberto] Nice!

271

[Alberto] Holy shit!

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,040
- [Nata] Uh, what the fuck?
- Whoa!

275
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,440
[Nata] This is amazing!

276
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,920
No fucking way.
Come, we're doing this right.

277
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,000
Here, put this on and go make us dinner
while I get ready. Go on!

278
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,240
Mm. Okay, okay.

279
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,840
[Berta] Dude, I need to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

[door opens]

281

I'm sorry, I couldn't find the bathroom.

285
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
Hm. Use the one down the hall.

Right. I really am so sorry.

It's fine, really.

You're the fucking shit, Nata.

293
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Shall we eat?

294
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
- Yeah, sure, come on.
- Let's go.

Careful, the door!

That's it.

300
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
Yeah.

301

[Alberto] Mmm.

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Wait.

303
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Not like this.

Did you get there?

Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

[Alma] I'm such a dumbass.

[Greta] Why?

316
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,960
What the fuck was I thinking?

317
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,400
I mean, why on earth would your brother

477
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,440
No. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

478
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,600
[Greta] I'm sorry! All I can think of
are dirty questions to ask. Ahh!

479
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
[both laughing]

480
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,120
[Greta] I don't know.

481
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
Wake up, Alma! It's my birthday!

482
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,080
- [Alma groans]
- Come on!

483
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,440
Party!

484
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Come here.

485
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
[energetic music playing]

486
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Kids, be careful!
Please, no running inside.

487
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
[doorbell rings]

488
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,200
You must be the clown
that jumps out of the cake?

489
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,000
- What?
- [chuckles]

490
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,200
- [Greta] What is this?
- Oh.

491
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,160
Ooh. Okay. Oh. Come in.

492
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,560
It's Pablito's birthday today.

493
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,120
Thank you for volunteering.
You are most welcome.

494
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,000
[Alma] I think my mother
would rather have you as a daughter.

495
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,520
You know, a lot of women
over 40 are super into me.

496
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
[children shouting]

497
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,640
Um...

498
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,240
Am I missing something?

499
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Huh?

500
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Okay.

501
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,760
I gotta tell you something huge.

502
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Let's see.

503
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,280
Umm...

504
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,640
Okay, so.

505
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,480
- I've sort of started dealing weed...
- [coughs]

506
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,480
...to this girl
who's around thirty-something,

507
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,320
that well,
that I'm really into, to be honest.

508
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Huh?

509
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,720
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh... uh, where did we find this chick?

510
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,040
- I met her at the corner market.
- Mm.

511
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Uh, well I sold to her
on two or three occasions.

512
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,360
I've gone to her place
three Saturdays in a row.

513
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
- You do it yet?
- No.

514
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Not yet.

515
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,320
But well, I make myself cum
thinking about her, so...

516
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,480
God. Seriously.

517
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,840
I feel like you'd come
just thinking 'bout my mother.

518
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,680
Mm. You don't come
when you think about my mother?

519
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
No.

520
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,680
Hmm... [chuckles] No.

521
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
You know I love you.

522
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,880
- I love you some days.
- Right.

523
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Gonna go get something to drink.

524
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,560
Your kids are crazy
about the vacation you promised them.

525
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
No, I'm not going to solve your shit.

526
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,720
See if you're capable of looking them
in the eyes and telling them.

527
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,880
No, no, no, no, no.
No! You listen to me now.

528
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,440
You need to take responsibility
for the things you do.

529
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,680
I know you have a girlfriend.
You also have three children, dammit.

530
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,320
WHAT YOU DOING? I NEED TO GET OUT

531
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,160
Why do I have to take care of everything?

532
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm so goddamn sick of you!

533
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,600
You know what?

534
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,840
LILY:
COME TO MINE

535
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
Go fuck yourself!

536
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,240
COOL!!!

537
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,640
[exhales]

538
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,600
One, two, three!

[cheering]

[indistinct chatter, laughter]

541
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,320
- [Pablito] I got it!
- Yes!

542
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,000
[Alma] There we are.

543
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
Why don't you give him cake?

544
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
Offer a slice.

545
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
All right.

546
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Come here.

547
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Hello.

548
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,120
Um, anyone want cake? I made it.

549
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Well, I do.

550
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,160
Um, so Greta wanted
to hang outside for a little bit.

551
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
- May I?
- Mmmm. The cake is delicious.

552
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
She earned it, buddy.

553
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,480
I won't stay out past 10:00.

554
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Yes?

555
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Yes.

556
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,760
[Alma chuckles] Thank you for saving me.

557
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,760
- [Greta] It was an excellent plan.
- [Alma] Oh, so you want to go back?

558
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,760
- [Greta] No. No fucking way.
- Let's go, come on. [laughs]

559
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,560
[Greta] So what do you want to do then?

560
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
- Hm?
- Uh...

561
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,120
I wanna show you something.

562
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
All right.

563
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,080
[Alma] Someone sent me this photo.

564
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,160
And two... two other dick pics as well.

565
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,880
Who the hell sent you this?

566
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,480
He's using a nickname.

567
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,480
"PutoAlfucking."

568
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,160
- Well, they're clearly dumb as fuck.
- Yeah.

569
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,480
And you are absolutely sure
you don't know who this is?

570
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Alma, will you please
just tell me already?

571
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
All right.

572
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,720
The night of... of the party...

573
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
When you went back to get the coats.

574
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,640
<i>Someone showed up.</i>

575
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
What are you doing here?

576
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
<i>I was really messed up.</i>

577
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,720
And I didn't want to see your brother.

578
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,680
Or you.

579
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Please, just get me out of here.

580
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,160
<i>I swear, I didn't mean
to disappear like that.</i>

581
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,760
<i>But the Molly hit me and...
and everything was spinning and...</i>

582
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,000
<i>I don't know, I didn't want
my parents to see me like that.</i>

583
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,240
<i>So then, I asked him
to take me to his place.</i>

584
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,560
<i>The truth is,
I didn't know what I was doing.</i>

585
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,360
And, well I must've thought

586
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,880
that well, if I just banged Hernán

587
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>I would feel better.</i>

588
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,560
<i>But it wasn't a good idea.</i>

[music fades]

594
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,040
The next day, I mean,

595
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,440
I had the worst hangover in the world.

596
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,760
<i>And all I wanted was to get out of there.</i>

[poignant music playing]

598
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,760
- Where are you going?
- Where's my coat?

599
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,000
You weren't wearing a coat.

600
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,640
Fuck. Fuck.

601
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,600
- [Hernán] What's wrong?
- This didn't happen, okay? Got it?

602
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,040
Don't you dare tell anyone.

603
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,760
Wait, Alma. Alma!

604
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,200
Why wouldn't you tell me sooner?

605
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
I don't know.

606
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,240
I suppose I needed to process it and

607
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,200
I was really embarrassed.

608
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,960
Get over here, please.

609
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,640
Greta?

610
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,320
What if Hernán sent the photos?

611
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
Well then, message him.

612
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,880
- Right now?
- Yes.

613
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,480
Just say you wanna meet him.

614
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,720
[Lily] Berta,
what's bothering you so much?

615
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,840
I don't know, girl. It's not like
it was exhibited at the Tate Modern.

616
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
It's not like that
because they've only shown it

617
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,840
at some cultural center
in the neighborhood.

618
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,600
- [Berta] I need to go to the bathroom.
- [Lily] At the end of the hall.

[pop music playing in bedroom]

620
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,480
[boy] So you gonna smoke it or what?

621
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,120
- That one's rolled up real nice.
- [girl] I'll get around to it.

622
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,720
[girl 2] Okay, okay, I get it.

623
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,696
- Famous? What are you saying, dude?
- [Susanita] What's up, babes? How are you?

624
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,280
- Look who's free!
- Can you believe it?

625
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,480
- One second.
- How you doin'?

626
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,920
[Susanita] What's up, Gretix?

627
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,960
We were just talking about the concert.

628
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,760
What's up? What'd you wanna talk about?

629
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,440
I need you to see something.

630
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,600
- Although, maybe you already have.
- Let's see.

631
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Was this you?

632
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
[Hernán] No. No, no way.

633
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,520
- What is this about?
- Did you take this fucking photo?

634
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,496
- Woah...
- [Alma] And this one. Is this your dick?

635
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,960

Hey, Hernán,

647
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,680
I don't think a friend
pulls down your panties and fucks you

648
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,120
when you're passed out, drunk and high,
as well as heartbroken. You know?

649
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
- Hmm?
- What the hell did you tell her?

650
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,040
- Just the truth.
- [Hernán] We fucked because you wanted to.

651
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,560
I didn't force you to do anything.

who took advantage of me.

- What?

655
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,960
- Fucking hell, Hernán.
- What? What don't you get, Greta?

656
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,760
The one who doesn't get it is you.

657
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Okay?

658
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,520
You were dying to fuck her forever.

659
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,720
And you took advantage of the fact
that she was real fucked up to do it.

straight home, Hernán.

- Hm.
