1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,430
<i>What is reality?</i>

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,276
<i>And is there only one of them?</i>

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:19,416
<i>Or do several realities coexist?</i>

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,998
<i>To help explain, Erwin Schroedinger</i>

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,130
<i>devised an extremely
interesting thought experiment.</i>

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,730
<i>Schroedinger's cat.</i>

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,164
<i>A cat is locked in a steel chamber</i>

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,998
<i>with a tiny amount of
radioactive substance,</i>

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,790
<i>a Geiger counter, a vial
of poison, and a hammer.</i>

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,248
<i>As soon as a radioactive atom
decays inside the steel chamber,</i>

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,689
<i>the Geiger counter releases the hammer,</i>

12
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,664
<i>which smashes the vial of poison.</i>

13
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,539
<i>The cat is dead.</i>

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,164
<i>However,</i>

15
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:00,126
due to the wave characteristics
in the quantum world,

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,460
the atom has both
decayed and not decayed,

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:12,581
until our own observation forces
it into a definitive state.

18
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,373
until the instant we look
and see, we don't know

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,245
if the cat is dead or alive.

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,748
It exists in two superposed states.

21
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,288
The properties "dead"

22
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,456
and "alive"

23
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,828
therefore exist simultaneously
in the microcosm.

24
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:43,623
<i>But what if the simultaneous
existence of life and death</i>

25
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,455
<i>also applied to the macrocosmic world?</i>

26
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,565
I'll make this right.

27
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,881
<i>Could two different realities
potentially exist side by side?</i>

28
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,456
<i>Could we manage to split time</i>

29
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,128
<i>and allow it to run in two
opposing directions?</i>

30
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,226
And by doing so, allow the cat

31
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,916
to simultaneously exist in
both states, dead and alive?

32
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,039
<i>And, if so,</i>

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,671
<i>how many different realities...</i>

34
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,373
<i>could exist side by side?</i>

35
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,455
Martha!

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Wait!

37
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,755
You can't go in there.

38
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,958
Bartosz?

39
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:53,373
- What are you doing here?
- Adam and the others lied to you.

40
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,164
He doesn't want to help
you. He's going to kill you.

41
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,331
In the future. He doesn't
want to stop the apocalypse.

42
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,831
Everyone will die.

43
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,633
Not because of you,
but because of him.

44
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,248
I know what the origin is.

45
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,410
And how it's all connected.

46
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,881
Please.

47
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,623
I can show you.

48
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,225
You've got to trust me.

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:19,495
IN BETWEEN TIME

50
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,706
<i>It's hard for people to accept death.</i>

51

TANNHAUS FAMILY: 8.11.1971
MAREK, SONJA, CHARLOTTE

52
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,836
<i>We hold on tightly to
things that are long gone.</i>

53

CHARLOTTE 
30.5.1971

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,500
<i>We long in vain for a
way to turn back time.</i>

55
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,668
<i>A way to reverse death.</i>

56
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,539
<i>But if time is relative</i>

57
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,164
<i>and nothing is really ever in the past,</i>

58
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:46,576
<i>and the simultaneous overlapping
of different realities is possible,</i>

59
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,331
<i>shouldn't it then be possible</i>

60
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,673
<i>to bring back something that
was believed to be dead long ago</i>

61
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,825
<i>and to create a new reality in
which what is dead lives again?</i>

62
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,498
<i>If our life is defined as that</i>

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,130
<i>which lies between birth and death,</i>

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,250
<i>then it exists there
in infinite versions.</i>

65
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,998
<i>Could we succeed in cheating death</i>

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,170
<i>by finding a way</i>

67
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,081
<i>to bring back life?</i>

68
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,786
<i>There, between time.</i>

69
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,281
FOR CHARLOTTE

70
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,978
Tell me about paradise.

71
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,080
Paradise...

72
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,930
is free

73
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,703
of pain and suffering.

74
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,576
Everything we've ever done...

75
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,641
is forgotten there.

76
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,378
Any pain...

77
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,390
we've ever felt...

78
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,615
is erased.

79
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,030
And...

80
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,515
all the dead...

81
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,400
live.

82
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,293
Adam will keep his promise.

83
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,905
The passage will open.

84
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,605
What do you want?

85
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,978
You've been promising us there's
a way out of here for ages.

86
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,528
That we can stop the apocalypse.

87
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,458
But you still don't know
how the portal works.

88
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,240
It will work.

89
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,456
I saw it work.

90
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,078
In the future.

91
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,456
And then what?

92
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,373
When are you finally
going to tell us the truth?

93
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,375
You don't want to go back.

94
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,451
You don't want to stop
the apocalypse at all.

95
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,000
This is bigger than us.

96
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,256
Bigger than the apocalypse.

97
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,873
If the portal works, we can
use it to find the origin.

98
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,325
The one moment that started all this.

99
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,381
And when we've found it,
we'll destroy it.

100
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,188
And everything that arises from it.

101
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,428
That is paradise.

102
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,211
Paradise?

103
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,375
We've been stuck here for 2 years.

104
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,498
2 fucking years!

105
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,978
I don't want your fucking paradise.

106
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,878
I just want out of here.

107
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,633
Hello?

108
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,670
I... didn't mean to startle you.

109
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,145
Sometimes I think it'll
never stop raining.

110
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,964
I'm...

111
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,416
Silja.

112
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,333
Bartosz.

113
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,285
We can start a new series
of experiments tomorrow.

114
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,938
I know we've been
trying for a long time,

115
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,881
but it will work.

116
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,878
Jonas.

117
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,083
You can't lose hope.

118
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,361
I can't do this anymore.

119
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,080
What are you doing here?

120
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,808
Are you following me?

121
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,425
You promised me something.

122
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,245
Adam promised me something.

123
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,133
You said the apocalypse must happen.

124
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,428
So that we can be saved.

125
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,498
So that all of us will be saved.

126
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,181
You can't die.

127
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,238
You can't take your own life.

128
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,730
Because your older self already exists.

129
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,128
Time won't allow it.

130
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,195
No matter what you try...

131
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,481
something...

132
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,018
or someone...

133
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,416
will always stop you from doing it.

134
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,706
Elisabeth and I,

135
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750
we found the passage.

136
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,643
You must keep your promise.

137
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,076
It will open again.

138
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,703
And then you will...

139
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,170
then Adam will...

140
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,905
lead us to paradise.

141
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,130
He said we will become friends.

142
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,713
Before you betray me.

143
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,918
Yes! Good.

144
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,833
Once more.

145
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,000
Once more.

146
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,543
Yes! Yes!

147
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,750
It's a boy.

148
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,631
What will you name him?

149
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,991
Hanno.

150
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,981
<i>Fate is playing a cruel game with us.</i>

151
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,208
<i>Yet we will always believe</i>

152
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,000
<i>there is a way to turn
the tide in our favour.</i>

153
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,503
<i>If only we want it badly enough.</i>

154
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,338
<i>A person is able to pursue a goal,</i>

155
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,706
<i>no matter how unattainable it may seem,</i>

156
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,458
<i>over the course of an entire lifetime.</i>

157
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,289
<i>No resistance, no
obstacle is great enough</i>

158
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,461
<i>to stop one from pursuing one's will.</i>

159
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,789
<i>Is this stubbornness in our striving</i>

160
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:09,664
<i>not that which distinguishes
us from animals,</i>

161
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,876
<i>which know only short-lived desire?</i>

162
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,748
<i>And isn't all progress,
through all ages,</i>

163
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,380
<i>not the product of this
unquenchable act of will?</i>

164
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,956
<i>No matter what motivates our will,</i>

165
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:35,998
<i>it will guide us on our path.</i>

166
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,998
<i>We will only be able to let go</i>

167
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,670
<i>when we have finally attained
our goal once and for all.</i>

168
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,328
Why do you think it's not working?

169
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,383
Maybe Claudia doesn't want it to work.

170
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,745
Why do you even trust her?

171
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,206
Why did you trust him?

172
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,248
Adam?

173
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,833
He lied to you.

174
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,023
There is no paradise.

175
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,525
There's no world other than this one.

176
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,783
I know you think I will become him.

177
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,928
But I won't.

178
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,206
The portal will work, I've seen it.

179
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,831
In the future.

180
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,593
Everything repeats itself.

181
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,076
But if I can travel back,
I can change everything.

182
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,081
My older self tried it before,

183
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,283
but this time, everything's different.

184
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,215
I've changed the
components in the passage.

185
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,780
This time, it'll work.

186
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,956
She told you that?

187
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,168
Claudia?

188
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,448
What do you really know about her?

189
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,161
She sometimes disappears for days.

190
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,986
How does she know all
the things she knows?

191
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,543
She said not everything
that's here belongs here.

192
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
What did she mean by that?

193
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,433
Come inside.

194
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,375
Claudia's hiding something from us.

195
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,583
We can't trust her.

196
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,101
I hope you know that.

197
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,488
<i>He still doesn't suspect anything?</i>

198
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,756
<i>No.</i>

199
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,668
<i>He has no idea you or
the other world exists.</i>

200
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,289
You must continue to
guide him on his path.

201
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,914
The matter, it must not work yet.

202
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:46,326
You uphold the knot in your
world, and I'll uphold it in mine.

203
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,748
Wait.

204
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,123
All these past few years, the
things Eva said I had to do...

205
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,355
Does she know everything
that happens?

206
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,539
I was wondering.

207
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,311
Have you ever met her?

208
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,291
Who?

209
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,461
My older self.

210
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,581
No.

211
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
I still remember
exactly what she said.

212
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,026
"If everything goes right...

213
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:31,211
Regina will live".

214
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,115
I've thought about that all these years.

215
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,748
I just can't believe
that by that she meant

216
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,560
her suffering was to repeat
over and over forever.

217
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,618
There must be a way to untie the knot...

218
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,578
without destroying all life in it.

219
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,503
A way for Regina to live.

220
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,128
Really live.

221
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,914
I think neither Eva
nor Adam know that path.

222
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,426
But I'll find it.

223
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,998
In my world or yours.

224
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,170
Don't...

225
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,986
You didn't bring Claudia with you?

226
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,130
Noah is watching her.

227
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,095
We have to be careful.

228
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,506
You must give this to Claudia.

229
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,103
And she must give it to Tannhaus.

230
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,596
She understands

231
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,171
why it's necessary?

232
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,625
Why everything has to happen again?

233
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,681
You have to be strong now, Hanno.

234
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,796
For your father too.

235
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,915
Silja...

236
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,245
Bartosz, we tried everything.

237
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,125
She wanted to name her Agnes.

238
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:02,383
Tell me about paradise.

239
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,290
Paradise...

240
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,664
is free

241
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:18,626
of pain and suffering.

242
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:24,916
Everything we've ever done...

243
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,765
is forgotten there.

244
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,708
The passage will open.

245
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,539
And then...

246
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,251
we will be there.

247
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,865
You,

248
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,873
me...

249
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,906
and Charlotte.

250
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,075
Where is she?

251
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,125
Charlotte?

252
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,000
Where is Charlotte?

253
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,828
All these years, I wondered
what he meant by that.

254
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:56,664
That we'd be friends
before you betray me.

255
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,706
Where's Claudia? Does she have
Charlotte? Did you help her?

256
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,146
I don't know what you're talking about.

257
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,790
Where is she?

258
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,130
Where's Charlotte?

259
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,705
I don't know.

260
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,595
I wish you all the
suffering in the world.

261
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,211
I will find her.

262
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,943
I will bring her back.

263
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,531
I promise I will.

264
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,960
<i>A man can do what he wills,</i>

265
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,956
<i>but he cannot will what he wills.</i>

266
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:54,123
<i>All the paths we take in our lives,</i>

267
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,873
<i>every decision that we make,</i>

268
00:40:56,875 --> 00:41:01,825
<i>is guided by that which we
desire deep inside ourselves.</i>

269
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,455
<i>We cannot fight that desire.</i>

270
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,001
<i>It determines every one of our deeds,</i>

271
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:37,576
<i>no matter how grave and
unimaginable they seem.</i>

272
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,250
Hannah?

273
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,251
Silja?

274
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,166
I...

275
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,870
I'm looking for Jonas.

276
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,038
Yes.

277
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,828
He has changed.

278
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,793
Travelling has left its mark on him.

279
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:23,711
Jonas?

280
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,956
This is my daughter.

281
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:49,958
Silja.

282
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:54,576
She's your sister.

283
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,375
How did you find us?

284
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,328
A few days ago...

285
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,133
there was this old woman.

286
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,751
She just showed up on our doorstep.

287
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,540
Eva.

288
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,785
She said...

289
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,653
she knew where you were.

290
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,463
And that you were looking for me.

291
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,628
You're right.

292
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,211
It's all my fault.

293
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,288
I ruined everything.

294
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,963
But now I'm here.

295
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,165
I'm here, Jonas.

296
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:39,875
Bartosz.

297
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,883
Prepare the chamber for them.

298
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,306
What are you doing?

299
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,285
Silja.

300
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,431
She doesn't belong here.

301
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,571
What's that supposed to mean?

302
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,058
"She doesn't belong here"?

303
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,750
All the pieces have to be in position.

304
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,631
She's in the wrong place.

305
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,878
So are you.

306
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:13,788
Mum.

307
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,333
I want to show you a secret.

308
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,373
But we'll let your mum sleep, okay?

309
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,381
Come on.

310
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,415
I...

311
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,878
I have travelled far.

312
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,960
I need a place to sleep.

313
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,291
Hanno?

314
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,066
Prepare the chamber for this gentleman.

315
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,423
I was wondering when you'd come.

316
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,746
I know you think I lied to you.

317
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,875
That I took Charlotte away from you.

318
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:22,981
But I didn't.

319
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,456
You were right.

320
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,708
Claudia...

321
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,883
she lied to all of us.

322
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,388
The book...

323
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,505
do you have it with you?

324
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,828
Are the last pages missing?

325
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,593
You must find the last pages.

326
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,003
They will lead you to Charlotte
and to your final destination.

327
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,628
You will find your paradise.

328
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,710
And Helge...

329
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,421
will help you do so.

330
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,535
Everything in life happens in cycles.

331
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,035
Sunset

332
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,664
is followed by sunrise,

333
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,076
over and over.

334
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,668
But this time...

335
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,165
it will be the last cycle.

336
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,750
Are you ready, Noah?

337
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,331
The matter,

338
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,289
it can finally be stabilised.

339
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,961
Everything must happen again
in exactly the same way.

340
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:11,456
You have to lead your younger
self down the same path.

341
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,164
He must not act differently.

342
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,456
MISSING
MIKKEL NIELSEN

343
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:17,748
You have to set the course, no
matter how hard that may seem.

344
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,914
But you'll finally be
able to change everything.

345
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:24,126
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER

346
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,713
The device...

347
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,541
He'll repair it.

348
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,164
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

349
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,876
You must destroy the passage,
and the knot with it.

350
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,498
You'll succeed this time.

351
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,583
Jonas...

352
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,416
You must never lose hope.

353
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,289
POLICE

354
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,373
<i>Weeks ago, in the small town of Winden,</i>

355
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,875
<i>a 15-year-old boy
disappeared mysteriously.</i>

356
00:56:56,666 --> 00:57:00,748
<i>Residents are now alarmed after
a second child has gone missing.</i>

357
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,248
<i>Eleven-year-old Mikkel has
been missing for two days.</i>

358
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,040
<i>Report any information you
may have to the Winden police.</i>

359
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,920
Hello, Claudia.

360
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,458
Don't you want to get in?

361
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,818
You have to stop Adam.

362
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,998
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

363
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,488
Have we met?

364
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,920
I'm sorry.

365
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:23,788
<i>You are the white devil.</i>

366
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,238
27 JUNE 2020
BEGINNING OF THE LAST CYCLE

367
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:36,825
Charlotte?

368
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,830
No, this can't be true.

369
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,673
Mum.

370
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:47,583
Jonas.

371
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,373
I've looked for you all these years.

372
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,035
You are not my father.

373
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,751
Regina?

374
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,995
I'm so sorry.

375
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,831
You used me.

376
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,910
<i>There is no man without guilt.</i>

377
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:22,245
None of them deserve a
place in your paradise.

378
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,035
Jonas?

379
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,131
And so the circle closes.

380
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,043
What about Martha?

381
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:58,425
Why did you bring me here?

382
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,413
They're the only ones who'll save us.

383
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,450
Save us?

384
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,461
Everything that's
happened is their fault.

385
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,416
No.

386
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,795
They are the light.

387
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,300
What do you want from me?

388
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,016
Isn't it peculiar...

389
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,498
that one feels the greatest aversion

390
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,140
towards the people who are
most similar to oneself?

391
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,641
I'm not like you.

392
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,618
You and I have nothing in common.

393
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,616
My whole life, I believed

394
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,331
that this moment could
never repeat itself.

395
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,039
That I could never do

396
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,201
what my older self had done.

397
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,789
Because I couldn't understand

398
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:09,921
how I could ever want what she wanted.

399
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,155
But now...

400
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
66 years later, I understand.

401
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:25,291
Some pain is never forgotten.

402
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:29,581
It brands us for our entire life.

403
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,166
You and I...

404
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,025
we share that pain.

405
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,630
We bear the same scars.

406
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,135
A memento.

407
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:59,706
So you never forget which
side you really belong on.

408
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:06,921
You may not understand yet, but
choosing us is choosing life.

409
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,033
Choosing Adam is choosing death.

410
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,500
No!

411
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:18,331
No!

412
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:25,998
No!

413
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,925
This can't be.

414
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,365
Hello, Jonas.
