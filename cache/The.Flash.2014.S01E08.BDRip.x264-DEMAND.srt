1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,643
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,807
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,361
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,681
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,208
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,209
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,320
Previously on The Flash and Arrow:

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,804
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,170
You can be better because you can
inspire people in a way that I never could.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,163
You said you were writing about me...

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,163
...to bring hope
to someone you care about.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,561
How would he feel
if that put you in harm's way?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,041
You're giving hope to people.
I'm doing this for them.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,171
Barry, when you met me, Oliver and Digg,
we were this well-oiled archery machine...

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,004
...but it didn't start out that way.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,330
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you tonight.
You're worth being on time for.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,324
Everyone on this planet...

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,802
...at some point in their lives,
has had a major case of the feels.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,284
Those days when your heart is just too small
to hold the big things you're feeling.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,731
Today's one of those days.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,490
We think of our emotions like
they're these unique personal phenomena...

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,008
...that no one has ever
felt what we have felt.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,326
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel: anger, love.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,290
As a scientist,
I know there's nothing magical...

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,410
...about what makes us feel something
for someone else...

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,767
...but then I see her smile.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,450
Man, that cannot be science.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,604
Oh, and there's a fresh bottle in the
fridge for when she wakes up from her nap.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,121
Thank you.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,048
Sir? Help you with something?

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,723
Thanks.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,130
I'll be just fine on my own.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,731
- Sir, you're not allowed to be back here.
- Nothing to get upset about.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,844
You're butting in line.

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,763
Barry, bank robbery in progress
at Cunningham and Sampere.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,922
- I got it.
- Wait, that's where I bank.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,448
Once superthieves showed up,
I went mattress.

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,962
I've already missed the gym.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,930
No. Five more minutes.

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,562
- Come on. We never get to sleep in.
- I know...

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,570
...but your dad hates tardiness.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,368
Buzzkill.

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,601
The buzziest.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,084
Another picture of the Flash came in. See?

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,806
That red blur?

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,451
- How do you know it wasn't Photoshopped?
- It wasn't.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,887
It's not a hoax or a mass hallucination.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,847
You know, every day someone new
accepts the impossible...

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,604
...and believes in him.

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,361
- Why can't you?
- I believe in what I can see...

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,449
...what I can touch...

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,764
...what I can feel.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,770
Which means I believe in you.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,771
Mm.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,207
Do you mind? Thanks, man.

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,283
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,410
- Witnesses reported seeing a red streak.
- You should've seen it.

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,564
Everybody here was trying to kill
each other. I got here just in time.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,930
It must've been a diversion, because there's
a half-million bucks missing from the vault.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,562
There's a tracer in the cash stacks.
We're trying to find the signal.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,687
Meantime, any idea what could've caused
such mass... this?

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,251
A neurotoxin, maybe.

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,210
I'm gonna swab some surfaces,
see what I can find...

66
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,727
...but I think maybe they got whammied.

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,043
- Did you just say "whammied"?
- I got so angry.

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,443
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,410
- You have to believe me.
- I do.

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,530
Something is happening in this city...

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,160
...and everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is.

72
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,163
I think we should do something about it.

73
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,005
My boyfriend has decided
we need to eat healthy at home...

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,209
...so work is now the only place
I can eat what I like.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,530
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you saying something, detective?

76
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,002
The Blur, the Flash, the man in the
red suit, whatever he's called...

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,162
...he was spotted at the bank this morning.

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
The bank that was robbed
of half a million dollars...

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,281
...where a dozen people
tried to murder each other.

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,523
You think our attention should be focused
on catching Santa Claus?

81
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,807
I can't explain how he gets
to and from crime scenes so fast.

82
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,885
We need to figure out who this guy is
and what he wants.

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,647
You should ask your girlfriend.
She writes fan fiction about him.

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,448
Joe, help me out here.

85
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,325
Sorry, partner. I stopped believing
in Santa when I was about 8.

86
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,521
Sir, we should worry about...

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,730
Hey, what's going on in there?

88
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,446
I think Eddie's trying
to convince the captain...

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,602
...that the Flash is a public menace.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,689
Excuse me?

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,644
So after weeks of trying to convince you
the Flash is real...

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,690
...now that you believe me,
you're trying to have him arrested?

93
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,444
- What the hell?
- Thanks, Barry.

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,803
- Sorry.
- No worries.

95
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,201
The captain shot me down.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,085
Look, I'm not feeling like lunch.
See you later.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,521
He's just jealous.

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,523
Of the Flash?

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,490
- Should he be?
- No.

100
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,762
I'll see you later.

101
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,487
Barry, you need to get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,928
Yeah, I will, after I eat.

103
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,321
Anger, hate, aggression.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,002
A Jedi craves not these things.

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,003
No one is feeling that quote?

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,811
Everyone in the bank went total savage
for like five minutes.

107
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,009
- And then they were fine again.
- Anger can be a powerful emotion.

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,727
If this metahuman can engender irrational
feelings of anger in his victims...

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,245
...he can do a lot of damage.

110
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,209
Detective West helped me get a copy...

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,842
...of the CAT scans the hospital did
on everyone at the bank. Take a look.

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,761
Look at this.
The emotion centers of the brains...

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,122
...are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,204
Particularly the area
that controls executive function.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,203
The part that stops people from doing...

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,682
...random and potentially destructive
things that pop into their heads.

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,604
How do you think
the meta does it to them?

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,489
That's the half-million-dollar question.

119
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,369
Hey, if you guys figure it out,
just give me a call, okay?

120
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,410
Is the Flash off
to another rooftop rendezvous with Iris?

121
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,650
No.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,482
Yeah, but she probably just wants
to ask me... I mean, you know, him...

123
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,483
...about metahuman stuff for her blog.

124
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
Do you want some advice?

125
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,647
No matter what I say,
I'm getting the advice, right?

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,724
Don't get involved, as
the Flash or yourself.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,886
You don't wanna be the one to blame
for their breakup.

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,361
Okay, I hear you.

129
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,610
- Iris.
- Flash.

130
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,367
It'd be great to call
you by your real name.

131
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,126
You mean like "Ralph"?

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,250
Is your name Ralph?

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,966
What did you wanna see me about?

134
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,403
- My boyfriend, he's...
- Did you guys break up?

135
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,847
- No.
- Oh.

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,244
He's a cop...

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,721
...and he thinks that you're dangerous.

138
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,130
And he's trying to convince his boss that
you're a menace that needs to be stopped.

139
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,044
I thought I should warn you.

140
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,767
Anyways, you should probably go.

141
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,451
You're not going.

142
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,802
- Barry, you there?
- What?

143
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,406
Police got a ping from the tracer
in the stolen cash.

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,847
SWAT team's closing in
on the 1600 block of Pass.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,048
Now stop ruining Iris' love life and go.

146
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,522
I've gotta run.

147
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,531
I bet you say that to all the girls.

148
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,482
What other girls?

149
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,367
He always paid in cash,
never seemed like trouble.

150
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,846
He's on the move.

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,045
- Freeze.
- Hold it right there.

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,091
Hands up.
ls there a problem, gentlemen?

153
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,805
Certo.

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,246
Turn around.

155
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,411
Certo, what are you waiting for? Cuff him.

156
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,211
You don't tell me what to do.

157
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,925
Get down!

158
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,042
Nice mask.

159
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,444
It's comforting to know
that no matter what city you go to...

160
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,127
...Big Belly Burger is always going
to taste like Big Belly Burger.

161
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,487
You mean full of grease and salt?

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,569
I thought those were the
secret ingredients.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,764
Oliver's back.

164
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,400
By the way, I gave Oliver
like a half-hour head start.

165
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,285
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey, Felicity.

166
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,601
How you doing, Digg?

167
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,043
You're fast.

168
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,921
- Did you guys not tell him about me?
- Well, seeing is believing.

169
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,603
Or drooling. Heh.

170
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,762
Hey. Thanks for showing up back there...

171
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,809
...but I had that.
Uhhuh.

172
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,330
- I was getting ready to make my move.
- What move? The one to the morgue?

173
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,802
- What are you guys doing in Central City?
- Working a case.

174
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,286
Suspicious homicide in Starling
where the murder weapon...

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,449
...is a boomerang.

176
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,168
Cool.

177
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,651
I mean, awful.

178
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,689
I found traces of iron oxide on it.

179
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,561
Central City has the highest concentration
of iron oxide in the country.

180
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,961
Australian aboriginals
used boomerangs to hunt.

181
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,600
Mainly on kangaroo, which is a
surprisingly low-fat source of...

182
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,651
Ahem. We were following a lead when
we heard the SWAT raid over the radio...

183
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,725
...and I thought that I would come by,
watch you make your move.

184
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,805
I had a cousin got hit by lightning once.
He just developed a stutter.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,403
Huh. Well, my team and I are after a nasty
metahuman who makes people angry.

186
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
Cool.

187
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,209
- I mean, awful.
- Since you're here, why don't we team up?

188
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,840
I help find your boomerang man,
you help find my rageaholic.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,081
- We'd love to.
- No.

190
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,890
We'll handle our business
and head home.

191
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,840
The fastest way to find out about the
boomerang is to sic S.T.A.R. Labs on it.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,843
Enough people know my secret identity.

193
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,446
Fine. I'll go. They already know who I am.

194
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,928
You can drop me off,
and I will meet up with you later.

195
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,122
- How about I give you a lift?
- Ooh!

196
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,366
Man, that's not freaking you out?

197
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,403
Let's go.

198
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,049
- So, what'd you think?
- I think...

199
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,565
My shirt's on fire! Oh!

200
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,649
Oh, my... Sorry.

201
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,771
I'm glad I decided not to go braless.

202
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,604
You guys remember Felicity.

203
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,603
I'll always remember this.

204
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,243
Hi, Felicity. It's so good to see you.
What brings you back to Central City?

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,241
- Not Barry.
- No, not Barry. This? Not happening.

206
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,880
We looked down that road and we said,
"No, thank you."

207
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,246
They get it.

208
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,282
Actually, I'm here because of this.

209
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,921
Awesome. What are the wings made of?

210
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,243
Not sure. I'm thinking some sort
of composite or high-density plastic.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,731
Reinforced with carbon fiber.

212
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,446
- Oh, that's weird. it almost feels like it's...
- Vibrating.

213
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,761
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,321
Oh, I wanna run some tests,
and I wanna run them right now.

215
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,925
Mm-hm.

216
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,762
You guys come up with anything new
on our meta?

217
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,925
The officer who was affected tonight said he
saw a flash of red before he lost control.

218
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,721
I suspect the meta is inducing rage
via the ocular nerve.

219
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,770
Oh. Dr. Wells wants to see you.

220
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,968
Why do I feel like I just got called
into the principal's office?

221
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,610
Starling City vigilante.

222
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,967
- He calls himself the Arrow now.
- Oh, does he, Flash?

223
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,810
- Wait, what's the problem?
- We don't trust him.

224
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,970
You guys don't even know him.

225
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,125
I know he was wanted for murder in at least
12 different cases dating back three years.

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,126
I know there's been two major terrorist
attacks in Starling since he became active.

227
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,284
The cops are cool with him now.
He doesn't kill people anymore.

228
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,280
What about all the criminals that he put
arrows through? Those, what, don't count?

229
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,404
- He's a hero, Joe.
- You're a hero, Barry.

230
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,407
You offer protection, hope, light.

231
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,404
What that man does
is carry out a dark reckoning for his city.

232
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,484
It is a brutal, violent vision of justice.
One we do not share.

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,211
You truly think he's a
hero, fine, so be it...

234
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,644
...but he's not the kind
you should be looking up to.

235
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,602
That's my bad. That's on me.

236
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,681
I want that Arrow out of my city...

237
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,604
...tonight.

238
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,368
Do you think he can do everything
really fast?

239
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,081
I mean, how fast do you think he goes
to the bathroom after he's eaten something?

240
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,810
This is you watching my back?

241
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,682
Oliver, the Mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

242
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,730
Whatever he can do,
he's still the same Barry we met last year.

243
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,771
If you're so adamant against teaming up
with him, what are we doing here?

244
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,531
He's a good kid. And it's
just a name, Diggle.

245
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,928
The man who rents this storage unit.

246
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,970
I want his name.

247
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,605
H9)'-

248
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,044
The bad guy that you're after, the one who
robbed the bank, his name is Roy G. Bivolo.

249
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,370
Uh... Thanks. How did you find that out?

250
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,405
The guy's still alive, right?

251
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,809
I'm just asking.
I thought you didn't wanna help.

252
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,442
I'm not. It's just a name.

253
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,881
- All right.
- Hi.

254
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,161
H9)'-

255
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,282
One nonfat latte, extra sugar, for Felicity.
And one coffee, black, for Oliver.

256
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,647
I brewed you a fresh pot, so...

257
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,482
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,924
- Barry, urn, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,242
- Bye.
- Bye.

260
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,930
Ow. What are you doing?

261
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,811
You did not tell me
that you knew Oliver Queen.

262
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,645
- I know Oliver Queen.
- He's even more handsome in person.

263
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,283
- And his arms are twice the size of yours.
- Technically, they're not twice the size.

264
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,442
- He's on my three list.
- What's a three list?

265
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,285
My list of three guys
I'm allowed to cheat on Eddie with.

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,488
You usually don't meet
people on your list...

267
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,122
...but now here he is,
and I just cannot stop staring at him.

268
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,330
Felicity, this is me noticing you staring.

269
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,289
We need to help Barry with this case.

270
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,963
- Why don't you wanna help?
- Because Barry doesn't really want my help.

271
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,201
He only thinks he does.

272
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,010
Harrison Wells and Barry's cop foster dad
both said you were dangerous...

273
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,527
...and a bad influence. Barry defended you.

274
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,011
You're gonna hawk me about this
until I say yes, aren't you?

275
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,446
I'm a hawker.

276
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,401
Okay.

277
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,561
- Okay what?
- Okay, we'll help you catch your bad guy.

278
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,323
- Great. "Metahuman."
- I'm not calling him that, Barry.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,843
Partners?

280
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,050
- Partners.
- All right.

281
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,571
H9)'-

282
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,960
You're late.

283
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,130
Barry, how can you have super speed
and still not be on time?

284
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,966
Sorry. I guess the super tardiness
kind of neutralizes it.

285
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,766
So how do we catch Bivolo here?

286
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,049
Oh, no, we don't here. We're here to train.

287
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,004
What? Like Rocky?

288
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,491
I read your friend Iris'
blog post on the Flash...

289
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,530
...and I visited all the crime scenes
you fought at.

290
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,968
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month, you took on Leonard Snart.

291
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,246
We call him Captain Cold.

292
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,370
We can talk about you giving your enemies
silly code names later.

293
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,922
You mean like over coffee with Deathstroke
and the Huntress?

294
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,608
The point is that you engaged Snart
on a commuter train, which he derailed.

295
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,731
Okay, there may have been some damage,
but I got the job done. I was the hero.

296
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,407
Barry, when you approach a new
environment, do you case every inch of it?

297
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,647
You could. You have the time.

298
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,089
But you don't.

299
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,405
You just run in blind.

300
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,047
There's a difference, Barry, between
having powers and having precision.

301
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,131
When I came to you thinking about helping
people, you said I could be an inspiration.

302
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,203
Living this life...

303
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,125
...well, it takes more than a mask.
It takes discipline.

304
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,567
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

305
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,762
Uh, what is that for?

306
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,724
You're gonna run over there...

307
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,168
...you're gonna come back at me,
and you're gonna get hit with an arrow.

308
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,244
- No, I'm not.
- Heh, heh. Yes, you are.

309
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,764
Okay, fine. I will humor you.

310
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,050
Ready!

311
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,683
Ready.

312
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,801
Nice try.

313
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,686
What, you shot me?

314
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,965
- I heard you heal fast.
- Aah!

315
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,724
Oh, God.

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,731
Hey. What's up?

317
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,166
Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

318
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,322
I thought the captain
shot him down already.

319
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,330
Well, apparently, he's got a new argument.

320
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,370
The Arrow made another appearance
last night.

321
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,046
And you forgot to tell me
that you got Bivolo's name...

322
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,322
...from shooting that
storage guy in the leg.

323
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,244
Technically, I didn't shoot him.

324
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,085
What word would you use to describe
how you got this info?

325
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,322
I'm gonna go with "torture."

326
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,249
I don't... The Arrow gets results.

327
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,845
He's a crazy man.

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,480
Look, I don't actually disagree with you
at the moment.

329
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,530
But we wouldn't have Bivolo's name
if it weren't for the Arrow.

330
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,803
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

331
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,883
Two things I won't be doing in this life:

332
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,691
playing professional baseball
and thanking that lunatic.

333
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,049
- Stay.
- Have you heard of color psychology?

334
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,249
The theory that changes
in the color spectrum can affect emotion.

335
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,085
- It's nice to have another woman to talk to.
- I know.

336
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,001
I was thinking that if Bivolo uses color
to induce the temporary psychosis...

337
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,407
...maybe we can use light
and color to reverse it.

338
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,164
Miss Smoak.

339
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,408
A word, if you please.

340
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,928
Hey, what's up, doc?

341
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,602
Sorry, that was dumb.

342
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,526
- Remember, I went to MIT.
- Yes, you're smart.

343
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,929
Felicity, I like to surround my team
with known quantities.

344
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,562
That is because I find the unknown
to be toxic, dangerous.

345
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,969
Arrow is unknown.

346
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,210
I can assure you, Dr. Wells,
he's not dangerous.

347
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,285
To us.

348
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,443
Well, of that, I have little doubt,
and yet I find myself with a conundrum.

349
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,444
How can I completely trust a man...

350
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,602
...when I don't even know his name?

351
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,129
And so I was hoping, Miss Smoak,
that you could help me trust him.

352
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,521
Who is he under the hood?

353
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,408
That is not my secret to tell, Dr. Wells.

354
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,729
Of course.

355
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,527
I'll figure it out on my own.

356
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,126
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

357
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,446
H0w'd it go with Oliver?

358
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,365
To be honest, not exactly the
partnership I thought it'd be.

359
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,729
- Did he do the thing with the arrows?
- You knew he was gonna shoot me?

360
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,844
Whoa. It's practically impossible
to tell when Oliver's making a joke.

361
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,761
We just got a ping from facial-recognition
software on Bivolo, a.k.a. Prism.

362
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,883
We have facial-recognition software?

363
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,849
- Happy Hanukkah.
- Where can I find him?

364
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,447
Traffic cameras just caught him
entering a residence at 168 Jarvis.

365
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,161
- We should let the Arrow know.
- I can handle this solo. I've done it before.

366
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,086
- Barry, I really think you need to...
- Felicity, I don't need his help.

367
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,609
I knew you'd be coming for me.

368
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,286
I could see it in your eyes at the bank.

369
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,689
When I turned those people
against each other...

370
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,086
...it made you angry.

371
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,006
Have some real anger.

372
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,006
No signs of macular damage.
Your retina and cornea seem unaffected.

373
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,491
I told you, I'm fine.

374
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,725
You said Bivolo whammied you.
No desire to go MMA on any of us?

375
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,086
No.

376
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,847
Yeah, I mean, something weird happened
with his eyes for a second.

377
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,044
- Weird thing?
- Yeah, everything went red.

378
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,248
You were right.

379
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,881
Okay, next thing you know,
Bivolo was gone.

380
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,361
Look, obviously,
his powers didn't work on me, so...

381
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,729
It was stupid for you to go out there
alone. You take too many risks.

382
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,565
As fast as you are,
that's gonna catch up with you.

383
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,202
Caitlin, I'm not Ronnie.
You gotta stop treating me like I am.

384
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,330
You're right. You're not.

385
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,761
What?

386
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,007
You are such a lovable dummy.

387
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,128
It's Oliver. He wants to have
another session.

388
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,408
I'm sure he's not gonna shoot you again.

389
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,561
Maybe you should wear body armor.

390
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,562
Thinking of new ways to embarrass me?

391
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,926
I'm not trying to embarrass you, Barry, but
you went after Bivolo last night alone...

392
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,730
...and you lost him.
Pfft.

393
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,282
- And you've never had a misstep?
- Of course I've had missteps.

394
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,326
Barry, I have been living this life
for almost eight years...

395
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,290
...encountering things
that you can't even fathom...

396
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,920
...and I'm still alive.

397
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,451
Not because super speed kept me
out of the ground.

398
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,400
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning...

399
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,961
...keep training, keep getting smarter.

400
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,011
And until you get that,
despite your best intentions...

401
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,202
...you will do more harm than good.

402
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,967
I finally see it.

403
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,770
You're a little bit jealous
of me, aren't you?

404
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,451
A guy like you, handsome, rich...

405
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,404
...can have any girl he wants...

406
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,807
...jealousy's probably
a new emotion for you...

407
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,646
...so you might be a little slow
to get what it is that you're feeling.

408
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,801
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

409
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,931
See, you can train, lift weights...

410
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,651
...climb that stupid bar
until your heart explodes...

411
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,804
...but you'll never be as fast as I am.

412
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,209
You will never be what I am.

413
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,843
And that's gotta hurt
your rock-hard pride, Ollie.

414
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,482
I told Felicity you didn't want my help.

415
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,689
Yeah? You're finally right about something.

416
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,362
Allen. Where are you with the Bivolo case?

417
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,564
- I'm working it.
- Care to be more specific?

418
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,286
How about you answer me
when I ask you a question?

419
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,891
Hey, how about you back off?

420
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,490
Excuse me?

421
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,723
Look, I workjust as hard
as anyone in this building.

422
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,486
I don't need you constantly berating me
to do my job.

423
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,802
When it's done, you will
have it, all right?

424
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,522
Sorry, captain, he's having an allergic
reaction to some bad medication.

425
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,648
You remind him who answers to who.

426
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,370
Have you lost your mind?

427
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,648
I'm so sick of Singh
talking to me like that.

428
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,525
He's still our boss. I know
you're upset about losing Bivolo...

429
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,166
Wait, wait. You're just like him.

430
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,563
Like Wells and Oliver
and everyone else my whole life...

431
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,008
...that didn't think I could get the
job done. You wanna help me, Joe?

432
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,051
You wanna help? Get my dad out of prison.
You helped put him there, didn't you?

433
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,362
Barry, I need you to calm down.

434
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,251
Why don't we both take a ride
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

435
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,611
I'm calm, okay?
When I am not calm, you'll know.

436
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,730
Okay. I'll call you back later.

437
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,368
That was the Arrow.
He says Barry is acting strangely.

438
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,763
- Strangely how?
- He's been whammied.

439
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,411
He was acting angry. It was scary.

440
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,204
And his eyes...

441
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,566
...they glowed.

442
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,088
It's possible his body's fighting the
effects, so it's hitting him slower.

443
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,608
When it comes to rage, that's not good.
The longer you suppress emotion...

444
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,205
The bigger the explosion.

445
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,926
Considering what he can do,
how do we even stop him?

446
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,402
A cold gun would come in real handy
right about now.

447
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,130
- Hey.
- I'm just saying.

448
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,124
None of us can stop Barry.

449
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,762
Fortunately,
Felicity knows someone who can.

450
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,440
I think you'd better
call back Oliver Queen.

451
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,281
We're gonna need the Arrow's help.

452
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,169
Is this your way of telling me
you want satellite radio for Christmas?

453
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,487
- Look, I'm not mad at you.
- Good. There's no reason you should be.

454
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,810
Eddie, both you and the Flash care
about protecting this city.

455
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,361
You would both give your lives for it.

456
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,445
You're more alike than you think, okay?
He is not the bad guy.

457
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,006
How do you know so much about him, Iris?

458
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,328
He got in touch with me after I started
the blog, and I've seen him a couple times.

459
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,441
A couple times?
Why didn't you tell me about this?

460
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,564
Given that I think he's a hero
and you wanna put him in jail...

461
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,529
...do you really need to ask that?

462
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,923
How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

463
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,924
I heard you've been looking for me.

464
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,241
All this time you've been trying to
catch me, and I caught you first.

465
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,882
Guess you haven't
read your girlfriend's blog.

466
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,201
Eddie, no!

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,561
Ooh, see,
I knew the Arrow was Oliver Queen.

468
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,726
I had it narrowed down to a list of 150
people, but he was definitely on that list.

469
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,643
You have a way to stop Barry's rage fest?

470
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,566
I have an idea about how to do that.
Joe, I'm gonna need your help.

471
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,768
We need to find him
before he hurts somebody.

472
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,081
I have him.

473
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,122
Facial recognition picked him up
on a traffic camera downtown.

474
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,124
Oh, God.

475
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,241
Eddie!

476
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,811
Who the hell are you, huh?

477
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,407
You think you can just come along
and get to have whatever you want?

478
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,244
What gives you the right?

479
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,084
What the hell are you talking about?

480
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,686
What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

481
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,650
- I feel fine.
- You are not fine.

482
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,246
How would you know,
because you write about me?

483
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,249
You don't know me!

484
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,604
You don't know who I am.

485
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,280
You never did.

486
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,490
I know that you have risked your life
to help people, to save them.

487
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,850
Someone who does that does not suddenly
turn around and wanna hurt people.

488
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,123
Please.

489
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,448
- No.
- Unh!

490
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,204
- Run.
- Eddie, run.

491
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,723
You need to calm down.

492
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,281
And you need to hold on.

493
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,281
I hope they turn Barry back
before he kills Oliver.

494
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm more worried
about what Oliver might do to Barry.

495
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,407
Barry has superpowers,
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

496
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,646
Do you have any idea how many people
Oliver has killed with that bow and arrow?

497
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,486
Recurve bow arrows can travel up to
300 feet per second, so 200 miles an hour.

498
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,847
- Barry can run three times that fast.
- Whatever.

499
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,644
Oliver's been doing this a lot longer.

500
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,087
- My money's on experience.
- My money's on speed.

501
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,210
Please tell me you're not actually
having this conversation now.

502
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,489
- You missed.
- No.

503
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,921
Two thousand milligrams
of horse tranquilizer...

504
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,923
...should be hitting you anytime now.

505
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,606
Where are you going?

506
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,247
- We're not done.
- Unh!

507
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,089
Is that all you got?

508
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,283
Oliver, get up.

509
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,922
Fool me once...

510
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,967
I still believe in you, Barry.

511
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,881
- Is this gonna work?
- He needs to see the right colors.

512
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,121
Now, Joe.

513
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,924
Barry?

514
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,481
You Okay?

515
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,687
Oh, this is gonna be
a special kind of hangover.

516
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,404
So...

517
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,683
...it was a tie.

518
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,209
Oliver, I'm so sorry.

519
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,203
This is not your fault.

520
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,443
But we do still have your metahuman
to take care of.

521
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,682
Anything left in the tank?

522
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,684
Well, if not, there's two of us, right?

523
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,725
Right.

524
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,484
You think this will stop me?

525
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,043
I will make you tear each other to pieces.

526
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,647
- You will all die screaming with rage!
- "Blah, blah, blah, no prison can hold me."

527
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,565
Heard it all before, pal. Adiés, Prism.

528
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,563
I liked "Rainbow Raider."

529
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,042
- Okay, you don't get to pick the names.
- I have a prison like this.

530
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,886
Mine's on a nearly inhospitable island
in the North China Sea...

531
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,003
...but this works too.

532
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,251
My identity is a closely guarded secret...

533
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,085
...known only to a few,
and if it were to get out...

534
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,404
...will endanger my family, my friends...

535
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,007
...and it would embolden my enemies
to retaliate at me through them.

536
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,051
What Oliver is trying to say is that
he had a lovely time working with you...

537
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,521
...and getting to know each of you...

538
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,371
...and he can't wait to do it again soon.

539
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,365
Right.

540
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,688
It didn't sound
like that's what he was saying.

541
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,162
I may not agree with your methods,
but thank you.

542
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,606
You're welcome.

543
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,090
Hey, if I had a DNA sample
I was unable to fully break down...

544
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,090
...do you think you could isolate
the genetic markers for me?

545
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,611
Sure. What's the sample from?

546
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,171
Canary's murder.

547
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,929
Of course.

548
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,570
Mr. Queen...

549
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,644
...I met your father once. Charity event.

550
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,363
One of the things we spoke of was you.

551
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,809
I think he would be very proud
of the man you've become.

552
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,881
Thank you.

553
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,408
And, please, call me Oliver.

554
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,966
There is something off about that guy.

555
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,289
Captain Singh approved the task force.

556
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,488
You wanted me to believe
the Flash was real. Now I do.

557
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,328
I believe he's dangerous,
and I am gonna take him in.

558
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,241
How do you feel about that?

559
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,968
All I know...

560
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,605
...is how I feel about you.

561
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,607
I will see you tonight.

562
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,130
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys heading home?

563
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,051
- Yeah. Can you do javas for the road?
- I will hook you up.

564
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,366
- Okay.
- Thank you.

565
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,760
You're welcome.

566
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,284
Um, so listen, I'm really sorry
for what I said in the field...

567
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,204
...and last night in the street.

568
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,364
I wish I could say it was all
because of what Bivolo did to me...

569
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,650
...but I guess I had more feelings
bottled up than I thought.

570
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,120
You can always talk to me.

571
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,121
Yeah. Thank you.

572
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,002
And you were right.
I still have a lotto learn.

573
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,050
There's one more thing,
and you're not gonna like it.

574
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,962
- Does it involve shooting me in the back?
- No.

575
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,202
No, the heart.

576
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,682
That's not gonna work out for you,
and you need to let her go...

577
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,801
...for both of your sakes.

578
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,570
Guys like us don't get the girl.

579
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,570
You ready?
Mm-hm.

580
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,769
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

581
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,601
Oliver.

582
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,406
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,050
- How are you?
- Good. Good. It's been a long time.

584
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,843
We never spoke after, and I'm so sorry...
No, I'm sorry.

585
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,971
I heard about your mother and...

586
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,085
She loved you very much.

587
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,929
She did.

588
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,771
- I should get going.
- All right.

589
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,889
- Who was that?
- Hmm?

590
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,290
Someone that I used to know.

591
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,961
Hi, sweetheart.

592
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,970
Yes, I'm just getting you a hot chocolate.

593
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,447
Mommy will be home soon.

594
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,485
Got your message.

595
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,085
I wanted you to know...

596
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,166
...last night, that wasn't me.

597
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,846
It sure looked like you.

598
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,365
Yeah. I was affected
by one of the metahumans.

599
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,409
He messed with my head.

600
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,602
But I'm okay now, I promise.

601
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,446
I defended you.

602
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,365
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

603
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,524
My father, Barry, Eddie.

604
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,968
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

605
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,647
But now it's time I did.

606
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,208
Don't contact me anymore, okay?

607
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,283
Iris...

608
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,200
...I'm sorry.

609
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,404
Me too.

610
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,642
Look at that. Better than an ATM.

611
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,242
Anyone tell you not to hang out
under the freeway at night?

612
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,920
You're liable to get robbed.

613
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,244
You got the shakes, man.
What are you, tweaking or just cold?

614
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,241
I'm not cold.
