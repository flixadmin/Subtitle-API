They weren't gonna get it out
through the drain or sewer.

160
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,041
They're pumping the gold farther away,
through that stream.

161
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,458
They must have brought in
a much more powerful pump.

162
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,833
I mean, it's at least 25 km of pipelines
carrying 90 tons of gold.

163
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,291
They'd probably need an oil pipeline pump.

164
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,958
Find Suárez. We need to
comb through that whole stream.

165
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,458
And get me the pipeline plans.

166
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
I want to know every single spot
those channels go through,

167
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,833
where they lead, everything.

168
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
Get a team. We're launching an offensive.

[sighs] What now?

170
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,875
Well, now we take turns
keeping an eye on the outside,

171
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,583
we freshen up. How's that sound?

172
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,833
Then we wait for the Professor's magic.

173
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,625
Where do you think the gold is going?

174
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,041
These channels lead to several factories,
uh, treatment plants,

175
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,416
and hydraulic facilities,
to, uh, stormwater tanks--

176
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,833
We need to track it down!
Every single gram of it.

177
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,208
I want soldiers combing every
cubic centimeter of water in those pipes.

-About 480 units.

00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,000
And that, my dear friend,
no one will expect.

638
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,791
We've combed 25 km of pipes
with metal detectors and found nothing.

639
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:44,875
[Palermo] Not the police, nor the CNI,

640
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,541
nor the Spanish National Research Council.

641
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,541
No one.

642
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,125
[Ángel] Ninety tons of gold
can't just disappear.

643
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,541
They didn't get it out that way, damn it!
They didn't.

644
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,125
Then where the fuck is that gold?

645
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:57,125
They couldn't have gotten it out
any other way!

646
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,833
Someone tell me
where the fuck is that fucking gold!

647
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,916
BANK OF SPAIN

-You're fucking kidding me.

651
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,000
[speaking indistinctly]

652
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,791
-Victoria. Victoria…

653
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,250
[Alicia] My baby.

654
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:21,625
[screaming] Fuck!

655
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,000
[Alicia gasps]

656
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:28,375
[Victoria wailing in distress]

657
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,625
[crying]

658
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,083
[sirens approaching]

659
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,666
-Victoria.
-[sobbing]

660
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,583
Someone's stolen the gold.

661
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,166
[laughing]

662
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,500
[screaming joyfully]

663
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,958
Fuck yeah! We did it!

664
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,083
[laughing]

665
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:30,458
