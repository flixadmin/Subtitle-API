1
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,580
Hi. I have bought tickets for a Christmas
concert in Sagene church next week.

2
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,100
I was thinking you and I could bring mom,
it would mean a lot to her.

3
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,860
It's my thank you
for letting me borrow your shower.

4
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,040
You used our shower?

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,120
I used your shower, yeah.

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,340
It's not...

7
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
The hair products aren't mine.
At least not all of them.

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,820
But you're welcome to use some.

9
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,720
Feel free to borrow some shampoo.

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,400
Hi! Good morning.

11
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,620
I made us some breakfast.

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,860
I hope you're hungry cause
I've made lots of food.

13
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,880
Yeah. Should we get change? For the...

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,420
For the..

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
Should we get change for the yoga? Or?

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,320
- Oh! You're doing yoga?
- We're doing yoga?

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
Eh, Yeah? Yeah!

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,220
We do! Oh, that kind of yoga!

19
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,020
Yes! I'd forgotten, we're doing yoga now.

20
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,740
We're doing bathing yoga.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,460
- Bathing yoga?
- At Bisleth bath.

22
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,800
So we have to...

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,580
So we have to leave.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Just help yourself to some
cayenne pepper from the freezer.

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,360
Or, I mean, from the pantry.
It's in the middle of the fridge...

26
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,320
- So... Bye!
- Bye!

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,900
Oh, sorry. Bye!

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,160
Hey, I didn't know what you like so I just...

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I made everything.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,340
What movie?

31
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,260
Movie?

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
Taste this.

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,100
Is it good?

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,420
Mhm.

35
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,660
The secret is

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,580
a tablespoon of sour cream.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,860
When I woke up, I...

38
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,120
I thought you'd left.

39
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,080
Hey.

40
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,280
I was just here cooking.

41
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,680
And chatting with your friends.

42
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,200
Does Sonja know where are you?

43
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,060
Fuck Sonja. We're not together anymore.

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,080
Well, the last time you said it was over,

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,400
you we're making out with her
like two days later.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,380
It's not..

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,480
It's not easy for me to not
give a fuck about her, Even.

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,580
No, but you've got to understand,
the thing with Sonja is...

49
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,740
that she's controlling.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Sometimes I feel as
she knows me better as myself.

51
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,580
Because everything she says is true.

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,140
And...

53
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,880
That's why I'm so freaking tired of it.

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,260
I feel as though

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,780
she can't feel what I feel

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
or think, for that matter.

57
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,820
You know?

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,240
Only you can feel what you feel.

59
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,000
And I haven't felt anything

60
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,360
quite like this...

61
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,300
Ever.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,220
Neither have I.

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,320
This song though.

64
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Huh?

65
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Gabrielle?

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Are you kidding?

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,100
No?

68
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,540
Jesus Christ, this is like hashtag.
What the fuck.

69
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,240
What?

70
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,520
When you found a man of your dreams,
and it turns out he likes Gabrielle.

71
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,800
Am I the man of your dreams?

72
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,720
Or?

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,820
Is it me you were talking about?

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,600
- Am I the man of your dreams?
- That's how the hashtag goes, you know...

75
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,800
No! Excuse me.
You said I'm man of your dreams.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Say it again.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Say it again.

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
You're the man of my dreams.

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
It's shit!

80
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,120
Seee! You're dancing! You are!

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,080
No?!

82
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,400
Come on, then.

83
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,100
"You make me fired up,"

84
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,940
"There's nothing that can cool me down."

85
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,180
"You make everything go up in smoke,"

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
"There's no one else I'd rather do this with."

87
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,020
"Five fine ladies in the club, we command."

88
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,340
"Turn it all the way up in the skies."

89
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,820
Isak! That's it! Ive been trying
to get a hold of you for days!

90
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,480
I kniow that you're mad at me and probably
think I'm a coward for leaving mom,

91
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,320
but I could not help her. I hope you'll understand
that one day. I'm trying my best.

92
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,720
Fine. I'll come with you
to that Christmas concert.

93
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,220
I'm bringing my new boyfriend.
His name's Even.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
I don't know if you're joking right now?

95
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,340
If you've gotten a boyfriend, that's very nice,
Isak, and I would love to meet him.

96
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,780
But you know how mom is,
she gets very easily stressed.

97
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,720
Hey.

98
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Hey.

99
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,100
Forgot to do the assignment?

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,420
Yeah.

101
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
Did you see that...

102
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,900
That link I sent you?

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,820
Uh, no.

104
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,380
What was it?

105
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,680
Just a link to this article.

106
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
Okay? What was it about?

107
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,440
Just some...

108
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,860
Research done on

109
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,560
the theory of evolution and

110
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,160
homosexuality.

111
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,580
I was just thinking about
the discussion we had while back.

112
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,600
And...

113
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
It's not often that I am wrong, but...

114
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,480
It turns out I was wrong.

115
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,660
In that discussion.

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,740
Because...

117
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,240
Homosexuality has had a...

118
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,920
Has played a natural part in the evolution.

119
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,520
And...

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,140
They had done a lot of
new and interesting research on it.

121
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,420
So...

122
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
I was wrong.

123
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,320
What about...

124
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,720
What about Islam?

125
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,520
Anything new and exciting on that part?

126
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,500
Or is it still the same?

127
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,780
Islam

128
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,880
says the same as always.

129
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,880
That all people in this world
have the same worth.

130
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,440
And that no person

131
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,180
should be spoken about behind their back,

132
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,280
be violated, judged or mocked.

133
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,140
So if you hear anyone use religion

134
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,680
as an argument for their hatred,

135
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,000
don't listen.

136
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,420
Because hate doesn't derive from religion.

137
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
It derives from fear.

138
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,780
Can we begin class by everyone turning in
their assignement to my e-mail?

139
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,740
I'm pretty starved.

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,840
Me too.

141
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm really tired.

142
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,360
I want food.

143
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
Are you coming or not?

144
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,720
I am not coming.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,240
Oh, come on!

146
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,500
It's the best pizza, you know that.

147
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
Can't you ask somebody to take notes for you?

148
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,380
And just go. 99 crowns for a pizza.

149
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,540
It's that fucking simple.

150
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,260
You guys don't have to ship,
but I'll have to if-

151
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,060
One hour!

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,140
Yeah, one hour.

153
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,840
You can study for that fucking test at home.

154
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,540
No! I can't do that.

155
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Yes, you can!

156
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,660
No, you learn more by attending
lectures. Research shows that.

157
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,100
Research?

158
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,600
What did you just say?!

159
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,600
Come on, why are you even thinking about it?

160
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,020
- Hey, guys.
- Hey

161
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,640
Guys, this is Even. Even, this is the...

162
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,240
Yeah.

163
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,460
Hey, guys.

164
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,720
- Hey, Even.
- Hey.

165
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,660
Magnus.

166
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,220
Mahdi, pleasure.

167
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,820
So, what's up?

168
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,840
We were gonna get some food,
but he got one more class, so...

169
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,780
Mhm.

170
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,540
- Sucks.
- I don't fucking care, but he's not interested.

171
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,200
- Oh! You're Even!
- Yeah.

172
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,540
Oh yeah. Holy fucking shit! I thought...

173
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,100
Err, sorry! Hey!

174
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,860
Magnus, pleasure.

175
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,840
A pleasure.

176
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
I completely forgotten!

177
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,140
He's the guy who threw us out, right?

178
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,200
It's exactly-

179
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,880
Nah.

180
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,800
No, it was you, but it was...

181
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,780
But because of him.

182
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,620
Yeah, because of you!
You're the one who threw us out.

183
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,100
Because of this hottie. Because...

184
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,480
I didn't throw you out!

185
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,400
Yes, you did.

186
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,620
They we're going to a party.

187
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,520
With you!

188
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,340
It was very sudden. Like,
"Guys, get out! Even's here!"

189
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,900
You were going to a party.

190
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,720
With you.

191
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
But then it didn't happen because
you wanted to hang out with him.

192
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, but I think it was
for the best you weren't there.

193
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
No, but seriously guys.
We got to get some food.

194
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,300
Okay, done. We're getting pizza.

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,260
Enjoy, guys.

196
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,340
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

197
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,720
You two enjoy as well.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,820
Yeah, we always do.

199
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,720
Bye!

200
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,980
Nice.

201
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,980
- Bye.
- Pizza!

202
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,320
Hello, this is Isak?

203
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,000
Hi. Uh, it's Sonja.

204
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,720
Even's-

205
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,760
It's Sonja.

206
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,600
Don't fucking call Isak.

207
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,660
What? Why did you do that?

208
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't talk to her.

209
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,460
Why? What does she want?

210
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,500
She wants to control you.

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Control me?

212
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
How would she control me?

213
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,540
Because she...

214
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,620
Doesn't like people
who live freely and are real.

215
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,640
You're so fucking hot, Isak!

216
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,540
Hi mom.

217
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,980
I've started dating a boy.

218
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,960
I know you believe in God
and the Bible says it's a sin.

219
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,060
But you don't have to be afraid
because it's also says that

220
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,020
God created man in his image and
that everyone is of equal worth.

221
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry if it makes you sad.

222
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,140
Hugs, Isak.

223
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,460
Hey Isak, this is Sonja.

224
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,040
Could you call me when you won't be with Even?

225
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,140
It's important.

226
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,160
- Hey.
- Hi.

227
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,260
Do you wanna go to my place?

228
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,680
No, I don't want that.

229
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,260
Okay? What do you want to do, then?

230
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,380
I want...

231
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,300
Check in to...

232
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,840
A fucking suite!

233
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,720
A suite?

234
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,800
Yeah?

235
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,600
Why'd you always walk like that?

236
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,300
Huh?

237
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,520
Hello.

238
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,240
We have booked room for a name Evan Bach Næsheim.

239
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,540
Yes, welcome!

240
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,820
Thank you very much.

241
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Can I see some ID?

242
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
Of course.

243
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,640
Are you Danish?

244
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,660
Yes, I am.

245
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,780
You're Danish?!

246
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Wow.

247
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,000
How fun, I'm a huge danish fan.

248
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,720
Yeah?

249
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
Danish movies, danish people...

250
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,640
Carouselles.

251
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,420
Antichrist.

252
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,040
It's very good.

253
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,040
Brothers.

254
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,300
That one too.

255
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,560
Stars without brains.

256
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
Maybe not that one,
but the other ones are very good.

257
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
Don't you like Denmark?

258
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,300
Yeah, I do.

259
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,120
Denmark is great.

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,620
This is my boyfriend.

261
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,400
How nice.

262
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah, it's very nice.

263
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Isn't he handsome?

264
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,740
Handsome?

265
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Yeah.

266
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,200
How would you say it in Danish, uhm...

267
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,720
Hot?

268
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,540
Hot?

269
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,260
Eh, what do you say?

270
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,920
Isn't this man beautiful?

271
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,380
Yes, very.

272
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,960
Very beautiful.

273
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,300
How many

274
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,660
Isaks and Evens are lying
just like this, what do you think?

275
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,200
Try this burger.

276
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,440
Good?

277
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,760
You know, at our wedding we'll only serve

278
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,420
mini burgers.

279
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,540
At our wedding, really?

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,240
You don't think we'll get married?

281
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,200
We're so fucking getting married!

282
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,320
Grand fucking wedding.

283
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,660
And we'll show up as...

284
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,660
God and Julius Caesar.

285
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,380
No, you know what? We'll show up as...

286
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
Just completely naked.

287
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,180
Completely naked. No clothes.

288
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,800
From now on, we'll do everything naked.

289
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,400
Okay.

290
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,900
And I'll propose to you from a balcony.

291
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,320
Just imagine me driving up

292
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,420
in a white limo Tesla.

293
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,840
I'll be driving up

294
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,080
and yelling, "Princess Vivian!"

295
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,680
Princess Vivian?

296
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,900
It would be completely genius
if that was your answer!

297
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,640
Because then,

298
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,340
the whole joke is that you think
it's a Romeo and Juliet reference.

299
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,060
But you don't get it
until you enter the balcony

300
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
and you see me sitting naked

301
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,500
with a tie. And that's when you get the reference.

302
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,060
And after I've climbed up the balcony,

303
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
I'll ask you.

304
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,440
"What'll happen after I save you?"

305
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,900
And then you answer...

306
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,740
"I'll save you right back."

307
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,300
It would be so fucking funny.

308
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,340
It's actually one of my dreams.

309
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,880
It's one of my dreams.

310
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,920
How many

311
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,480
do you think are lying

312
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,680
like this, right now?

313
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Infinite.

314
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,460
In infinite time.

315
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,020
You know, the only way
to have something for infinity,

316
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,160
is by losing it.

317
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
Don't say stuff like that

318
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
I'm only joking.

319
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,880
Don't you ever sleep?

320
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,300
Not when you're lying here
looking so fucking hot.

321
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Baby!

322
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,640
Come lie down with me.

323
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,240
Yeah, I'll just go buy some

324
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
McDonald's first.

325
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,840
Even?!

326
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,960
Where did he go?

327
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,700
Hello, Sonja?

328
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,320
Some-something happened to Even.

329
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,120
Can you check where the closest McDonald's is?

330
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,500
If he's walking around in Grønnland right now,
he'll get beaten up! He's naked!

331
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,140
Okay, thank you.

332
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,380
The police has got him.

333
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,180
So he's safe, at least.

334
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,840
What just happened?

335
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,340
He's manic!

336
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,380
That's what's happening now.

337
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,040
He's not well!

338
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,400
Do you think he's in love with you?

339
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,220
He's not!

340
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,000
It's just a sick idea he has right now.

341
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,520
Last year he memorized the Quoran.
In Arabic!

342
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,540
Because at the time
he thought it was a good idea.

343
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,680
He's also not supposed to smoke,

344
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,500
because that's not good for him,
as you might understand.

345
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,200
So can you just please...

346
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,240
Stay away?!
