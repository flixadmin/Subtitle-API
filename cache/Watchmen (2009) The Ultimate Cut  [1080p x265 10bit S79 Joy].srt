RORSCHACH: Human bean juice.

163

Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

Let's talk downstairs.

165
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,971
DAN:
It could have been a burglary.

166
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,849
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

167
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:06,771
RORSCHACH: An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

168
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:11,776
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

169
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:15,112
knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

170
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,199
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

171
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,658
Maybe.

172
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:23,079
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

173

You don't think that's a little paranoid?

Paranoid?

176

a lot of enemies over the years...

177
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:34,256
even among his friends.

178
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:36,592
RORSCHACH:
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

179
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:41,430
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

180
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:45,684
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

Retribution.

Nobody knows who you are.

You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

189

That what you have now?
A normal life?

190
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:22,888
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

191
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,557
past the human cockroaches...

192
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:27,476
talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

Soon there will be war.

Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

208
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,795
Why does one death matter
against so many?

209
00:23:37,505 --> 00:23:42,301
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

Even in the face of armageddon...

The Watchmen resent me

can Jon really stop them?

that someone plans to murder him.

JON: Good evening, Rorschach.

320
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:19,716
RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

321
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:21,301
JON: Yes...

322
00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:24,554
but you're going to leave disappointed.

323
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:28,433
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

324

RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

325
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:33,063
I have a real name I've been using.

What are you doing here?

329

JON: The Comedian is dead.

330
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,698
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

331
00:31:43,032 --> 00:31:45,492
see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

332
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,787
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

333
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:53,834
Even if I wanted to help...

334
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,338
my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

335
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:02,801
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

336
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:06,388
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

337
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,226
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

338
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:15,397
the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

339
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:20,527
particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

340
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:24,489
therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

341

342

What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

344
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,081
So we can't do anything to stop it?

345

He pulled that on Rorschach...

dropped him down an elevator shaft.

03:12:12,027 --> 03:12:15,195
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

2203
03:12:15,363 --> 03:12:18,407
they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

2204
03:12:18,575 --> 03:12:22,244
but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2205
03:12:23,371 --> 03:12:25,873
The world's smartest man...

2206
03:12:26,166 --> 03:12:28,584
poses no more threat to me...

2207
03:12:28,752 --> 03:12:31,920
than does its smartest termite.

2208
03:12:34,174 --> 03:12:35,632
What's that?

2209
03:12:36,051 --> 03:12:37,926
Another ultimate weapon?

2210
03:12:38,553 --> 03:12:40,262
Yes.

2211
03:12:41,890 --> 03:12:43,349
You could say that.

2212
03:12:46,895 --> 03:12:48,812
Came under attack.

2213
03:12:49,647 --> 03:12:52,983
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

2214
03:12:53,318 --> 03:12:58,530
in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2215
03:13:00,325 --> 03:13:04,286
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

2216
03:13:04,454 --> 03:13:07,456
with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2217
03:13:07,832 --> 03:13:10,667
Putting aside our past differences...

2218
03:13:11,002 --> 03:13:13,170
we have both pledged to unite...

2219
03:13:13,505 --> 03:13:16,840
against this common enemy.

2220
03:13:17,342 --> 03:13:19,343
With the rest of the world...

2221
03:13:19,803 --> 03:13:21,804
we will prevail.

2222
03:13:24,349 --> 03:13:27,351
This is a day we shall never forget.

2223
03:13:27,519 --> 03:13:31,730
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

2224
03:13:31,898 --> 03:13:36,527
and all that is good
and just in our world.

2225
03:13:37,862 --> 03:13:42,116
Thank you. God bless us all.

2226
03:13:42,492 --> 03:13:44,284
ADRIAN: Do you see?

2227
03:13:46,496 --> 03:13:48,956
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2228
03:13:50,542 --> 03:13:53,001
I've saved the earth from hell.

2229
03:13:53,169 --> 03:13:55,129
We both have.

2230
03:13:55,588 --> 03:13:57,798
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2231
03:14:02,595 --> 03:14:04,096
Now we can return...

2232
03:14:05,515 --> 03:14:07,099
do what we were meant to.

2233
03:14:07,350 --> 03:14:10,227
We were meant to exact justice.

2234
03:14:10,562 --> 03:14:13,897
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

2235
03:14:14,065 --> 03:14:18,861
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2236
03:14:19,028 --> 03:14:22,489
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

2237
03:14:22,657 --> 03:14:24,867
- nonetheless.
- He's right.

2238
03:14:25,410 --> 03:14:29,371
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2239
03:14:29,539 --> 03:14:32,416
No. We can't do this.

2240
03:14:32,584 --> 03:14:34,376
On Mars...

2241
03:14:35,879 --> 03:14:37,713
you taught me the value of life.

2242
03:14:38,673 --> 03:14:41,091
If we hope to preserve it here...

2243
03:14:41,885 --> 03:14:43,927
we must remain silent.

2244
03:14:47,765 --> 03:14:49,725
Keep your own secrets.

2245
03:14:56,566 --> 03:14:57,774
Don't even think about it.

2246
03:15:00,403 --> 03:15:02,112
Rorschach.

2247
03:15:03,907 --> 03:15:05,407
Wait.

2248
03:15:06,451 --> 03:15:08,577
Never compromise.

2249
03:15:08,912 --> 03:15:11,788
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2250
03:15:12,207 --> 03:15:15,209
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2251
03:15:26,262 --> 03:15:29,765
I've made myself feel every death...

2252
03:15:31,267 --> 03:15:37,147
see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2253
03:15:42,737 --> 03:15:46,448
- You understand, don't you?
JON: Without condoning...

2254
03:15:48,117 --> 03:15:49,993
or condemning...

2255
03:15:54,415 --> 03:15:56,333
I understand.

2256
03:16:03,758 --> 03:16:06,885
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2257
03:16:07,762 --> 03:16:09,680
You know I can't let you do that.

2258
03:16:10,932 --> 03:16:13,934
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2259
03:16:15,353 --> 03:16:17,187
Convenient.

2260
03:16:25,905 --> 03:16:30,492
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2261
03:16:34,247 --> 03:16:37,207
I can change almost anything...

2262
03:16:41,796 --> 03:16:44,131
but I can't change human nature.

2263
03:16:45,466 --> 03:16:48,844
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2264
03:16:50,138 --> 03:16:53,473
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2265
03:16:59,647 --> 03:17:01,523
Well, what are you waiting for?

2266
03:17:04,986 --> 03:17:06,820
Do it.

2267
03:17:12,910 --> 03:17:13,952
Do it!

2268
03:17:16,664 --> 03:17:20,042
No!

2269
03:17:37,518 --> 03:17:43,273
JON: I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

2270
03:17:43,441 --> 03:17:45,942
LAURIE: I thought you said you cared
about life again.

2271
03:17:46,110 --> 03:17:47,527
JON: I do.

2272
03:17:48,863 --> 03:17:51,740
I think maybe I'll create some.

2273
03:17:55,870 --> 03:17:58,205
Goodbye, Laurie.

2274
03:18:18,101 --> 03:18:21,311
[DAN YELLING]

2275
03:18:33,449 --> 03:18:34,616
Come on.

2276
03:18:37,078 --> 03:18:38,662
Come on!

2277
03:18:43,084 --> 03:18:44,418
Dan...

2278
03:18:44,877 --> 03:18:47,629
a world united and at peace.

2279
03:18:48,506 --> 03:18:49,715
There had to be sacrifice.

2280
03:18:49,882 --> 03:18:54,261
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

2281
03:18:54,429 --> 03:18:56,179
You've mutilated it.

2282
03:18:56,556 --> 03:18:58,724
That's your legacy.

2283
03:19:07,275 --> 03:19:10,068
That's the real practical joke.

2284
03:20:02,663 --> 03:20:06,666
MAN:[ON TV] We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

2285
03:20:06,834 --> 03:20:10,295
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

2286
03:20:10,463 --> 03:20:13,632
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

2287
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:19,596
which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

2288
03:20:20,807 --> 03:20:23,016
SALLY:
Sure you don't want a drink?

2289
03:20:24,018 --> 03:20:25,060
I'm okay.

2290
03:20:26,103 --> 03:20:27,354
Cheers.

2291
03:20:28,773 --> 03:20:31,900
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

2292
03:20:33,194 --> 03:20:35,695
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2293
03:20:38,699 --> 03:20:40,450
Laurel.

2294
03:20:41,452 --> 03:20:43,787
What you must think of me.

2295
03:20:44,622 --> 03:20:47,165
I'm sorry I never told you.

2296
03:20:47,333 --> 03:20:49,125
I should have...

2297
03:20:49,293 --> 03:20:53,421
but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

2298
03:20:53,589 --> 03:20:55,549
It doesn't matter.

2299
03:20:56,384 --> 03:21:01,638
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

2300
03:21:02,223 --> 03:21:05,141
and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2301
03:21:05,309 --> 03:21:07,644
I know how that is...

2302
03:21:08,396 --> 03:21:10,981
but I just want you to know...

2303
03:21:11,566 --> 03:21:14,401
that you never did anything wrong
by me.

2304
03:21:18,573 --> 03:21:22,826
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2305
03:21:24,412 --> 03:21:26,913
Because he gave me you.

2306
03:21:31,919 --> 03:21:33,003
Thanks, Mom.

2307
03:21:35,756 --> 03:21:37,549
I love you.

2308
03:21:45,099 --> 03:21:49,311
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

2309
03:21:50,938 --> 03:21:55,525
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2310
03:22:06,037 --> 03:22:10,206
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

2311
03:22:10,374 --> 03:22:13,877
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2312
03:22:14,045 --> 03:22:18,673
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

2313
03:22:18,841 --> 03:22:21,092
so all we gotta do is take her out.

2314
03:22:21,260 --> 03:22:24,346
Well, that sounds like a date.

2315
03:22:35,650 --> 03:22:37,901
Are we gonna be all right?

2316
03:22:39,987 --> 03:22:44,282
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

2317
03:22:44,492 --> 03:22:46,368
in the end.

2318
03:22:47,995 --> 03:22:50,163
I know what Jon would say:

2319
03:22:50,331 --> 03:22:52,374
Nothing ends.

2320
03:22:54,251 --> 03:22:56,878
Nothing ever ends.

2321
03:23:44,218 --> 03:23:47,971
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2322
03:23:48,139 --> 03:23:49,514
Everyone in the country...

2323
03:23:49,682 --> 03:23:51,933
every country in the world
are holding hands...

2324
03:23:52,101 --> 03:23:55,395
and singing songs
about peace and love.

2325
03:23:55,896 --> 03:23:58,773
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2326
03:23:58,941 --> 03:24:02,861
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2327
03:24:03,029 --> 03:24:04,863
We could run a piece on that.

2328
03:24:05,031 --> 03:24:08,199
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2329
03:24:08,367 --> 03:24:12,203
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2330
03:24:12,955 --> 03:24:17,167
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

2331
03:24:17,334 --> 03:24:18,960
Crank file.

2332
03:24:19,128 --> 03:24:21,129
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2333
03:24:21,297 --> 03:24:23,923
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2334
03:24:30,431 --> 03:24:35,143
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

2335
03:24:35,311 --> 03:24:39,773
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
