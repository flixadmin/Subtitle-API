1
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,451
Najid, cut the horses loose!

2
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,047
We have to turn back.

3
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,261
We have been riding
for six months.

4
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,262
And we've lost 20 men.

5
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,718
But we survived.

6
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,682
Yes. By chance.

7
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,100
Any one of us could
have met that same fate.

8
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,264
We were the strongest.

9
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,270
Remember why you're here.

10
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,187
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I would have to kill you.

11
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,105
At least here,
we have a common goal.

12
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,398
Oh, yes.

13
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,074
This black powder.

14
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,573
It turns air into fire.

15
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,364
And kills a dozen men
at one time.

16
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,369
It is the weapon of our dreams.

17
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,950
And what if it's just a myth?

18
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,961
Men have sent word
that it's real.

19
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,250
And those men are dead.

20
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,706
And we are next.

21
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,666
We have no maps,

22
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,134
no medicine

23
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,378
and no food.

24
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,133
No one is going back.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,175
We take inventory
of what we have left

26
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,469
and finish what we started.

27
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,646
There's not much here.

28
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,681
The moon is strong.

29
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,809
When the horses
are fresh, we move.

30
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,768
- To where?
- North.

31
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,401
If they keep after us,
we'll kill them in the mountains.

32
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,899
The magnet.

33
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,699
Too heavy.

34
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,951
- Useless.
- I'll have it.

35
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,116
It's all yours.

36
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,958
Amigo, only you would carry a
stupid magnet through the desert.

37
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,633
I can use it to make a compass.

38
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,509
Rizzetti won't make it.

39
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,509
The wound is festering.

40
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,097
We'll be dragging a corpse.

41
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,271
I heard that.

42
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,349
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

43
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,898
I've been left for dead twice.

44
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,146
- It was bad luck.
- For who?

45
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,947
The people who left me.

46
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,945
Maybe Rizzetti's right.

47
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,096
Where are they?

48
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,856
Hill tribes?

49
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,861
It's no man.

50
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,864
Then what is it?

51
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,702
Whatever it is, it's hunting.

52
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,419
- What was that?
- I don't know.

53
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,591
I took its hand.

54
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,090
- We need to move.
- Agreed.

55
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,467
I'll take the hand with us.

56
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,843
What the hell for?

57
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,138
So someone can tell me
what I just killed.

58
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,956
Persistent bastards,
aren't they?

59
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,627
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

60
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,461
What a long shitting
way to go to die.

61
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,130
Mother of God.

62
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,803
I have no need
to go down fighting.

63
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,387
Agreed.

64
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,391
I say we take our chances with
the gents in front of us.

65
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,052
I haven't surrendered
in a while, eh?

66
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,102
It'll come back to you.

67
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,695
Follow my lead, we'll be fine.

68
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,860
Of course, my friend.

69
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,699
Where you go, I follow.

70
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,701
You're doing such
a great job already.

71
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,123
They know what it is.

72
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,620
And they don't
look happy to see it.

73
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,453
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

74
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,501
Our weapons are on that table.

75
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,133
Have you lost your mind?

76
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,632
I can take out the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

77
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,566
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

78
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,137
I must confess, this is
not my favorite plan.

79
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,559
Where was this found?

80
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,810
You speak English.

81
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,482
Fantastic.

82
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,487
Where was this found?

83
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,989
It wasn't found.

84
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,817
It was taken.

85
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,198
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

86
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,414
Where?

87
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,830
Two days' ride.

88
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,538
North, in the mountains.

89
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,561
Two of you, you did this?

90
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,562
Well...

91
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,890
I killed it.

92
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,391
Alone?

93
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,326
Tell me how.

94
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,700
A swing of the sword.

95
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,869
The hand, it came away clean.

96
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,917
The beast fell back
into a chasm.

97
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,086
Why are you here?

98
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,921
We came to trade.

99
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,006
We were ambushed.

100
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,308
You are soldiers.

101
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,036
Mmm.

102
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,607
Are you killing us, sister?

103
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,826
Two lost travelers?

104
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,124
I think she'd like that.

105
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,421
If it is death, my dear,
we need time to pray.

106
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,213
I'm trying here.

107
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,798
Sister, I know a siege
when I see one.

108
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,964
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

109
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,887
What the hell
did we kill out there?

110
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,509
Tao Tei.

111
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,520
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

112
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,972
You killed it alone.

113
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,815
You're correct.

114
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,312
We are under siege.

115
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,691
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

116
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,026
Attack? Tao Tei.

117
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,400
What the hell is a Tao Tei?

118
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,778
Many things about your
story have importance.

119
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,738
You are not to die today.

120
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,822
The black are the foot soldiers.

121
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,125
And the red?

122
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,408
Those are the archers.

123
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,892
And the blue?

124
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,472
They're all women.

125
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,807
What the hell do they do?

126
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,028
Look at this army.

127
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,864
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

128
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,574
Incredible.

129
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,350
They look nervous.

130
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,229
It's a big wall
to be so nervous.

131
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,162
Do you hear it?

132
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,400
William, over there.

133
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,911
Why isn't he tied up?

134
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,865
There's our escape.

135
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,028
We need to move!

136
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,667
We need to move or we die!

137
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,696
Go, go!

138
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,522
Go and fight!

139
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,746
Cut me loose!

140
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,546
Fight or run?

141
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,630
Run where?

142
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,214
Aim for the eyes!

143
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,636
William!

144
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,075
Hey! Bitch!

145
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,300
William.

146
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,798
I need a shot.

147
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,685
What god made those things?

148
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,525
None that we know.

149
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,211
Think they'll hang us now?

150
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,418
I could use the rest.

151
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,848
You've earned
General Shao's praise.

152
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,408
Will they come back?

153
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Yes.

154
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,741
All we can do is prepare.

155
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,925
Who are you?

156
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,011
Easy.

157
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,898
I'm Ballard. Hmm?

158
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,230
William.

159
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,482
This is Tovar.

160
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,406
What are you doing here?

161
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,530
We came looking
for black powder.

162
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,862
I bet you did.

163
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,699
I came with mercenaries
for the same thing.

164
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,408
Twenty-five years ago.

165
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,372
And did you find it?

166
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,664
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

167
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,679
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

168
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,721
We weren't being diplomatic.

169
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,515
We were trying to stay alive.

170
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,763
You smell like animals.
Thank you.

171
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,653
Clean up

172
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,318
and they'll feed you.

173
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,535
He knows where the powder is.

174
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,784
Then why is he still here?

175
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,074
He needs help getting out?

176
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,711
Right.

177
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,419
We play our part,

178
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,506
take the powder and go home.

179
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,380
I didn't sign up for this.

180
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,547
Which part?

181
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,472
Well, all of it.
But mostly the monsters.

182
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,762
There's a lot of them.

183
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,184
We really do smell.

184
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,386
General Shao welcomes
you as honored guests

185
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,683
of the Nameless Order and thanks
you for your skill and courage.

186
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,351
We are honored to be honored.

187
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,146
Is that the best you've got?

188
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,069
Commander Chen thinks your bow

189
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,879
is not worthy of your skill.

190
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,836
Tell him there's no
better weapon here.

191
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,568
They wish to see you shoot.

192
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,076
In here?

193
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,328
What was that?

194
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,664
He thinks you have fear.

195
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,496
Too many people.

196
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,083
Get one of the cups.

197
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,498
- Now?
- Get one of the cups.

198
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,593
I want to eat.

199
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,746
You remember how to do this?

200
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,977
Last time didn't go so good.
We were drunk.

201
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,773
How high?

202
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,773
Ten yards.
Six hands to the right.

203
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,020
Turn around.

204
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,435
No, I'll do it this way.

205
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,486
- On my count.
- Amigo...

206
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,146
One.

207
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,283
Two.

208
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,612
Three.

209
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,695
Pull.

210
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,652
Good luck with that.

211
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,488
I want food.

212
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,034
Who taught you English?

213
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,657
Sir Ballard.

214
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,115
English and Latin.

215
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,327
Heard he's been here
for 25 years.

216
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,458
You won't let him leave.

217
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,297
He must stay here.

218
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,124
What about us?

219
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,758
Pace yourself.

220
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,305
The meals are regular here.

221
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,845
I hope not to stay that long.

222
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,384
I like your thinking,

223
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,308
but I suggest you keep
your plans private.

224
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,310
You aren't the first Westerners

225
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,312
to come here looking
for black powder.

226
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,653
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

227
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,238
How long have you been here?

228
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,402
Always.

229
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,618
I was not five years old
when I came here.

230
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,870
I have no other family.

231
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,701
We're the same.

232
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,750
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

233
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,122
As a soldier?

234
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,046
Worse. As a gleaner.

235
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,000
Packs of children,
we'd clean the battlefields.

236
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,176
After, when the fighting's over.

237
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,551
I became a page,
a pikeman's boy...

238
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,594
For your country?

239
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,389
No. I fought for food.

240
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,936
You fight to eat.

241
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,519
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

242
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,810
How many flags do you fight for?

243
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,859
I don't know.

244
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,275
I fought for Harold
against the Danes.

245
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,745
I saved a Duke's life.
I fought for him until he died.

246
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,907
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

247
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,913
Fought for the Franks
against Boulogne.

248
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,786
I fought for the Pope.

249
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,752
Many flags.

250
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,091
We are not the same.

251
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,771
Meet me on the Wall.
I have something to show you.

252
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,607
He should be careful with her.

253
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,278
She's very powerful here.

254
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,819
Then it is a fair contest.

255
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,451
Come.

256
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,882
You wish to try?

257
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,814
She says men
have so much to teach us.

258
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,156
I don't think
that's what she said.

259
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,287
You know what I think?

260
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,365
I think you're afraid.

261
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,827
You said that this morning.

262
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,089
And yet,

263
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,673
- here I am.
- Yes.

264
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,963
Here you are.

265
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,645
Will you jump? Or not?

266
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,529
These men know
what they're doing?

267
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,696
Wrong question.

268
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,662
Whether or not
the cable is attached,

269
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,790
that is the question.

270
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:35,998
And the answer?

271
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,377
Xin ren.

272
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,132
Xin ren
means trust. To have faith.

273
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,764
Here, in this army,

274
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,055
we fight for more
than food or money.

275
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,603
We give our lives
to something more.

276
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,895
Xin ren is our flag.

277
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,280
Trust in each other.

278
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,406
In all ways, at all times.

279
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,176
Well, that's all well and good,
but I'm not jumping.

280
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,596
I'm alive today
because I trust no one.

281
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,929
A man must learn to trust

282
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,470
before he can be trusted.

283
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,562
Then you were right.

284
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,061
We're not the same.

285
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,913
My God!

286
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,333
A taste, a glimpse.

287
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:59,252
A few pilfered grains from Strategist
Wang's supply of black powder.

288
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,799
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

289
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,258
People speak of a weapon.

290
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,139
There are many weapons here.

291
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,594
Why have we not seen them?

292
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,894
There are many
things you have not seen.

293
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,348
And many things you should
pray will not be needed

294
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,892
before the siege is through.

295
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,980
The Tao Tei will return.

296
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,533
When the drums call to battle,

297
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,113
the guards leave their posts and
take their positions on the Wall.

298
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,828
That is our moment.

299
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,208
We want to be riding away

300
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,669
as the battle rages.

301
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,879
And the armory doors?
You have keys?

302
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,798
I have black powder.

303
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,845
Enough for several doors.

304
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,843
He brings us in. We get us out.

305
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,856
As you fought,
where was this stone?

306
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,358
In my bag.

307
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,229
Its unseen force is powerful.

308
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,696
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

309
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,494
We try everything.

310
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,866
Where are the Tao Tei now?

311
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,414
The mountains, regrouping.

312
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,663
Where do they come from?

313
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,378
About 20 centuries ago,

314
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:29,297
there was an emperor whose greed brought
deep suffering to all of China.

315
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,674
The heavens sent the meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain,

316
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,094
turning it green
and releasing the Tao Tei.

317
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,185
From that day on, the Tao
Tei rise every 60 years

318
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,102
to scourge the north of China.

319
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:48,899
They come to remind us of what
happens when greed is unchecked.

320
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,569
They eat anything,
alive or dead,

321
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,863
and take food to their queen.

322
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,249
She depends on her
soldiers to feed her.

323
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:03,129
Only with the food they provide
is she able to multiply.

324
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:10,463
The capital, and its two million
people, is only 800 li away.

325
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,303
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourishment,

326
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,765
no corner of the world
would be safe.

327
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,770
You can't hunt them?

328
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,139
Men try.

329
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,644
They disappear.

330
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,519
We never find their bones.

331
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,255
This is envoy
Shen from the palace.

332
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,817
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

333
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,407
A 900-year-old battle report.

334
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,514
At the Hansha gates,

335
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,662
three beasts mounted the Wall.

336
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,588
They killed many men
as they went forward.

337
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,341
Then, by the grace
of the ancient gods,

338
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,752
the beasts stopped...

339
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,925
...and sat peacefully
as we slaughtered them.

340
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,600
At the Hansha Gate,
was a magnet just like this one.

341
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:01,404
I believe that magnet was the
reason that two of you Westerners

342
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,572
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

343
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,990
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

344
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,535
Without instruction,
they fall still.

345
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,162
How can we be sure?

346
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,879
Why not try it?

347
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,633
Capture a Tao Tei.

348
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,963
See if it works.

349
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,641
How?

350
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,758
No net is strong enough.

351
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,055
Hunt them. Like a whale.

352
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,228
You know what that is.

353
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,350
Uh... A water beast.

354
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,146
Hundred times
the size of a Tao Tei.

355
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:43,321
A spear that grabs.
Hook the bone. Pull them up.

356
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,698
I've seen it done in Spain.

357
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,663
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,437
We need to be free
when the attack comes.

359
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,104
How many chances do you
think we will get?

360
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,252
Be injured. Be missing.
Be a coward.

361
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,962
Get out of this.

362
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,510
We did enough.

363
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,025
He'll be here.

364
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,210
When? When it's over?

365
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,041
We start and he will find us.

366
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,171
Start?

367
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,965
We're jumping off a cliff here.

368
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,973
I have everything.
Powder, tools, maps.

369
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,138
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.

370
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,552
Once we start,

371
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,184
there's no going back.

372
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,376
- I'll find him.
- Forget him.

373
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,254
He'd rather die trying to
impress the new general

374
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:16,047
than grab the key to every counting
room and brothel in the world.

375
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,758
Good God, man.
The time is now!

376
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,555
I can't go without him.

377
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,049
More the spoils for us!

378
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,135
We need his bow!

379
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,054
No, no, no. Stop!

380
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,501
There's too much tension.

381
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,981
Chain will break.

382
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,649
That way. That way.

383
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,017
Let him run!

384
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,398
Stop! Stop!

385
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,867
We need longer for the
sleeping potion to work.

386
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,542
That way. That way.

387
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,078
We need to isolate it.
Separate it from the others.

388
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,815
The chain won't hold much longer!

389
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,264
William, wait.

390
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,125
These arrows will
scream as the Tao Tei run.

391
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,748
Aim for the sound.

392
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,416
I'm only saving
you so I can kill you myself.

393
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,219
Grab an ax,
we're fighting blind.

394
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,851
- Not yet.
- I know what to do!

395
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,461
The fire's not
holding them back.

396
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,389
Die well, brother.

397
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,643
What the hell are you doing?

398
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,894
She's listening.

399
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,497
Did it work?

400
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,170
Yes.
The beast was captured.

401
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,207
My friend...

402
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,171
He was unharmed.

403
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,180
Why did you go over the Wall?

404
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,864
Did I say it right?

405
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,196
Thank you.

406
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,461
Black powder.

407
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,215
It is a terrible weapon.

408
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,886
It would be better if
you had never seen it.

409
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,353
I know very little
of the outside world.

410
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,513
But it seems to me,

411
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,066
the greed of men is not that
different from the Tao Tei.

412
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,561
Is that true?

413
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,523
The strong take what they want.

414
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,916
Forget what you have seen.

415
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,415
Hmm?

416
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,346
You're much
braver than they think.

417
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,619
You wounded?

418
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,040
I was looking for you.

419
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,122
To say thank you.

420
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,709
You feel good, huh?

421
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,133
Maybe you sing
a little song, eh?

422
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,928
I will join you.

423
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,222
We can sing together how you
saved the grateful chinos.

424
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,767
You saw what happened out there
and that's what you say?

425
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:53,979
I see black powder.

426
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,059
I see a man forget his friends.

427
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,693
The black powder's
not going anywhere.

428
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,863
What goes nowhere is you.

429
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,948
You'll never get
what you want from this.

430
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,414
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?

431
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,582
A man of virtue?

432
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,495
Maybe you can fool them,

433
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,581
but I know what you are.

434
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,255
You know what you are.

435
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,636
A thief,

436
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,554
a liar,

437
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,262
and a killer.

438
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,351
And you can never undo
the things you have done,

439
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,182
and you will never be anything.

440
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,442
Good to see you again, amigo.

441
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,428
- Nothing?
- No.

442
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,829
How do you know
he won't betray us?

443
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,968
I don't.

444
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,874
They'll kill him.
They'll kill him no matter what.

445
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,854
The time they spend killing him

446
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,145
is time they are not chasing us.

447
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,357
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

448
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,034
Tovar.

449
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,103
Have a look.
See if it's gone out.

450
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,598
Is it safe?

451
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,266
Of course it is.

452
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,505
Shake it off, man.
To work.

453
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,185
I thought you said it was safe?

454
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,688
We're in, aren't we?

455
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:16,902
You're here.

456
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,033
We've come to our senses, eh?

457
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,947
Ballard has planned well.

458
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,907
Getting out is easy.

459
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,334
There's a gate.
20 miles west.

460
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,336
We dodge the hill tribes.

461
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,508
We can make it.

462
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,000
They need us here.

463
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,881
They need more than us.

464
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:36,179
These people are doomed.

465
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,342
Don't be a fool.

466
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,475
I've been a fool.

467
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,258
I'm done with it.

468
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,185
Brother, please.

469
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,347
We've been fighting for nothing.

470
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,477
For greed.

471
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,235
Amigo, after all the blood,

472
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,813
and cold, and pain,

473
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,316
with this black powder
in our saddle bags,

474
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,901
we win.

475
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,411
You come with me.

476
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,448
I can't do that now.

477
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,705
Stay and fight.

478
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,371
William...

479
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,008
Think he's dead?

480
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,132
It'd take a lot more than that.

481
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,432
Come on.

482
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:11,979
Hyah.

483
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:38,194
- I tried to stop them...
- You dare to speak to me?

484
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,439
I didn't do this.

485
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,027
And you came here to trade.

486
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,035
And you knew nothing
of black powder.

487
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,665
What a fool you must think I am.

488
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,994
If I was with them,
why would I be here?

489
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,328
I tried to stop them.
I tried...

490
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,249
You lie.

491
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,010
Some part of you knows
that's not true.

492
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:08,012
If I were not the General,
I would kill you myself.

493
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,963
Which way, left or right?

494
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,429
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.

495
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,980
Hyah!

496
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,406
No!

497
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,486
No! Bastard!

498
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,187
What happened?

499
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,368
What happened?

500
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,332
We have failed.

501
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,915
The Tao Tei are in the Kingdom.

502
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:26,919
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

503
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,087
This was the
General's final order.

504
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,380
Where is she?

505
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,386
To do what?

506
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,592
To fight?

507
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,013
Is there a chance?

508
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,261
There's only one.

509
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,764
Kill the Queen.

510
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,020
Kill the Queen, or we all die.

511
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,943
Leave.

512
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,613
Tell the world
what you have seen,

513
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,861
and tell them what is coming.

514
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,507
I'll need my bow.

515
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,809
If I'm to join you,
I'll need my bow.

516
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,405
He wishes to join us.

517
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:32,937
No.

518
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,029
No.

519
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:39,701
No.

520
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,582
No.

521
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:50,118
No, don't throw
that thing near fire!

522
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,740
Above you!

523
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:26,555
Behind you!

524
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,736
I set you free.

525
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,071
And here I am.

526
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,900
There's the Queen!

527
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,287
They will not attack
while the Queen is feeding.

528
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,330
We have a chance!

529
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,501
Hold on!

530
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,384
There is
an underground canal here.

531
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,337
Has it been breached?

532
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,944
The Tao Tei should
all be above ground.

533
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:25,841
And the one we captured?

534
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,545
We load it up.

535
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:29,803
We feed it.

536
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,846
And it will return to its Queen.

537
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,059
Good.

538
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,540
You'll have one hell of
a scar, but you'll live.

539
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,379
We'll come back for him.

540
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,860
They've broken through!

541
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,979
Patience, William.

542
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,049
And it will go to the
Queen when it's done?

543
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,509
It should.

544
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,091
It will.

545
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,069
Let it in.

546
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,421
I can get a shot from above.

547
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,762
Go! I'll hold them back.

548
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,283
Wait. Not yet.

549
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:18,966
Hit.

550
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,146
Go higher.

551
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,645
I'll get a better shot.

552
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:44,954
General!

553
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:46,323
It's up to you now!

554
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,832
We have one black
powder weapon left.

555
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,383
Give me the spear.

556
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,012
I've trained for
this my whole life.

557
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,425
I'll get you the shot.

558
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,605
I've got you.

559
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,606
So, how's life without me?

560
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,271
A little slow.

561
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,147
You're a hero after all.

562
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,941
Well, it looks that way.

563
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,368
You seem pleased with yourself.

564
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,867
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?

565
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,041
A bag of gold?

566
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,787
A victory parade
along the top of the Wall?

567
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,289
All the black powder
I can carry.

568
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,588
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

569
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,049
Well, congratulations.

570
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,967
Thank you.

571
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,343
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?

572
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:34,968
Well, would you blame me?

573
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,426
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

574
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,473
And the time before that,
I saved your life.

575
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,895
True.

576
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,817
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.

577
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,111
I could take the black powder,

578
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,613
or I could take you.

579
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,408
Please tell me
you chose the powder?

580
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,376
I don't even know you anymore.

581
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,706
The horses are
saddled and waiting.

582
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,087
Best we ride before nightfall.

583
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,261
I'll be inside.

584
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,217
Don't leave without me.

585
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,108
I came to say goodbye.

586
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,693
I understand congratulations
are in order.

587
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,113
General of the
northwest territory.

588
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,952
That's quite an honor.

589
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:45,577
Seems you've made your choice.

590
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:46,794
Him?

591
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,832
Believe me, I'm already thinking about
trading him back for the powder.

592
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,966
I heard that.

593
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,759
Perhaps we were both wrong.

594
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,975
We are more similar
than I thought.

595
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,360
Thank you, General.

596
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,343
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?

597
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,018
Of course I do.

598
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:44,678
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.
