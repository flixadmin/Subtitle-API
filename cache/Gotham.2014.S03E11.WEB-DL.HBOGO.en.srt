1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,280
My name is Volk. My brother Jacob.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,600
We are called the Whisper Gang.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,920
Those men were willing to kill
for this key,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
- but what does it open?
- A safe.

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Inside, there is a device
that we believe can destroy them.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,360
They call themselves
the Court of Owls.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,680
Isabella was murdered.
Her brake lines were cut!

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
And I know who did it.

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,160
You can stop the blade
from being released.

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
If you click this button,
it will send a fatal jolt to Butch.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,440
Hey, Butch, you're sweet.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,080
- You really didn't kill her?
- No!

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,200
Guilty!

15
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,400
The lab analyzing Alice Tetch's
blood has developed a test.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,360
- You're kidding.
- Don Falcone, please.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,480
We'll pull your car around.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,840
Carmine's not the target.

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
You are. Get down!

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,360
- Why are you coming after me?
- You know why.

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,840
Why are you trying to kill my son?

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,840
We will expect your assistance
when called on.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,320
Until then, your son is safe.
At least from us.

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,080
Maybe it's all we have left.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,800
Or we just haven't done it
properly yet.

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,440
Bye, James Gordon.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,360
<i>- She loves him, she loves him...</i>
- You lost?

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,160
She loves me.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Hey.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm getting married tomorrow.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Congratulations.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,920
People always talk about
love at first sight.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
I never believed it.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,520
But the moment I saw her, I knew.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,480
Yeah.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
So, what do you do?

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm a hematologist.

39
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,240
At Gotham Bio-Lab.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,800
You aren't working
on that blood virus,

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,680
are you, from, what's her name?

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,840
Tetch? Alice Tetch?

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,560
My fiancée
is with the police department.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
She's the medical examiner
on the case.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Oh. Yes.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,720
She said you had come up
with a test for the virus.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I really can't talk about it.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,240
She almost married someone else.

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,680
I think her ex still hopes
she'll come running back.

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Not gonna happen.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
<i>She loves him.</i>

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,200
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
Do you hear me, Jim?

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,240
I won't let you have her!

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Volk is dead?

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,640
{\an5}We found his and Dmitry's bodies
early this morning.

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,720
{\an5}They were killed Talon,
the Court's assassin.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,920
{\an5}Well, that certainly changes
things a bit, doesn't it?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,200
{\an5}How? You possess the key.
The key opens the safe.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
{\an5}Inside the safe is an object that can
bring down the Court of Owls.

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,080
None of this has changed.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
{\an5}If this assassin saw us with Volk...

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
{\an5}That means the Court already knows

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,680
{\an5}that you're breaking your deal,
Master Bruce.

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,680
{\an5}I wish we knew for certain.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,360
{\an5}Yeah, well, I wish we knew
for certain

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,080
{\an5}what was in that blinking safe
or how far we can trust this little

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,280
{\an5}Whisper Gang front.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
{\an5}Ask yourself this:

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,680
{\an5}Is bringing down the Court
really worth the risk?

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,000
{\an5}The Court of Owls
has taken over my company,

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,040
{\an5}threatened people I care about,

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,280
{\an5}and is likely responsible
for my parents' deaths.

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
{\an5}What's our next step?

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,040
- I'm giving this one to Alvarez.
- No.

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
I told you to take the day off.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
I know.

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,440
{\an5}You do know I'm acting
captain now, right?

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
{\an5}Yeah.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,320
{\an5}Jim, there will be another
dead body tomorrow.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
{\an5}Seriously, take the day.
Go fishing, get drunk.

82
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
{\an5}Harvey, this is my job.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,200
{\an5}Lee getting married
doesn't change that.

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,920
{\an5}Take a look at this guy's head.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,320
What's that coming out of his ear?

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,920
His skull was crushed.

87
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
{\an5}Like someone squeezed
it from either side.

88
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,360
{\an5}Can you imagine
the strength needed to do that?

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,480
{\an5}I got to tell you,
my first thought...

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
- Oh, no.
- Barnes.

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
{\an5}Stop it! Barnes had the virus.
He's at Arkham.

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
{\an5}That story's over.
This is what I was afraid of.

93
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Wallet's here, but the killer
took a badge or something

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
from around his neck.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Your emotions are all stirred.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,920
{\an5}You're seeing things
that aren't really there.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,640
{\an5}This is just a classic case
of wrong place, wrong time.

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
{\an5}One man takes another man's skull
in his bare hands and crushes it.

99
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,160
I see it all the time.

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Receipt, from the cafeteria
at Gotham Bio-Lab,

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,320
where Alice Tetch's blood
is being tested.

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
- Crap.
- I'm gonna swing by.

103
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Finish up here, will you?

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Sure, Jim. Happy to oblige.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
No rest for the wicked.

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Relax.

107
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm not here to get revenge
for you lopping off Tabby's paw.

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Though I am surprised
to find you back at work

109
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,080
and not tracking down who really did
kill your lady love.

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,280
That's because you don't see
the full picture.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
The mayor has many enemies.

112
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,840
These enemies understand that I am
a fundamental part of this operation.

113
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,160
They weaken me, they weaken him.

114
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,480
That was clearly
the intent of killing Isabella.

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Also, I have spies
all over this city.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,520
Soon enough, whoever killed Isabella
will reveal themselves,

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
and I will strike.

118
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
Poor blind baby.

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,040
It's always hardest to see
what's right under our noses.

120
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,360
Penguin!

121
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,240
Did you just fake cough "Penguin"?

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,880
Needless to say, that is,
absurd on a number of levels.

123
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Really?

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,040
All a crime requires
is means, motive and opportunity.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
And your beaky little buddy

126
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,040
certainly has the means
and opportunity.

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
But no motive.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,080
Oh, I would say he had
the oldest motive in the book.

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,680
"Rich men want it,

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,040
wise men know it,
the poor all need it..."

131
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
Love. What does that have to do...

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,480
And the penny drops.

133
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
You are suggesting...

134
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,040
...that Oswald...

135
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
...is in love with me?

136
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,880
That is ridiculous.

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,360
I know. I mean, personally, I find
you a bit of a cold fish, but...

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Ozzie saw you being taken away
from him by that bookish vixen.

139
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
And...

140
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh, no!

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,720
No.

142
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,120
In fact, I'm beginning to wonder
what your motive is in all this.

143
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
That's for later.

144
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,040
Right now, I,
just want to see justice

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,920
for that poor, sweet girl.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Ms. Kean,

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
I need you to understand two things.

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
One, Oswald did not kill Isabella...

149
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,200
...and two, he's not in love with me.

150
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,400
Are you so certain?

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,640
Don't you owe it to her to find out?

152
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,560
Let me know how it goes.

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
The Court of Owls maintains
a number of buildings in Gotham.

154
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,480
This one is rarely occupied
and always well guarded,

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,680
and there are two alarms.

156
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,120
The first covers points of entry.

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,360
Last week, we managed
to disarm one of the windows.

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,640
Once inside, the front door
can be opened using a code

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
that we possess.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
The second alarm is in the basement.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
In the room with the safe.

162
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,800
The floor is fitted
with infrared sensors.

163
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,160
You must cross it on a rope.

164
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
I have trained for this.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
You will give me the key you found,
and I will retrieve the object.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,040
But you still don't know
what the object is, right?

167
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,640
Only that the Court protects it,
fears it.

168
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
And that with Talon hunting us,
we have no time.

169
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Right, so...

170
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,960
- Let's go through this again.
- What'd you decide?

171
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
We're gonna break in today.

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
We can't wait any longer.

173
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
- You okay?
- Fine.

174
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Just hungry.

175
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
G.CP.D.

176
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,560
Guy named Ryan Pfeffer work here?

177
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Yeah.

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,800
It's sublevel three.

179
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,120
- What, he in trouble?
- He was killed last night.

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,280
I need to talk to his colleagues.

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,480
You guys keep track
of when key cards are used?

182
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,600
Yeah.

183
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
All right.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,840
If anybody uses his, call me.

185
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
Sure, but, his was used
20 minutes ago.

186
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
He hasn't logged out.

187
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,120
Call the police. Now.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
Jim, Jim.

189
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
You're ahead of schedule.

190
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Our paths weren't meant
to cross just yet.

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,600
But I'm not gonna kill you yet.

192
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,640
I do that, you become the martyr,

193
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,760
and she'll carry you
in her heart forever.

194
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,960
No. Before I kill you,
she has to hate you.

195
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
And she will.

196
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,200
Come find me, Jim.

197
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,000
So you didn't get a look at the guy,
and he's not on the cameras.

198
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,400
We might get something off
the prints, but...

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,920
Doubtful, if he was smart enough
to avoid the cameras. I'm good.

200
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,120
He seems to have been
interested in the research

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
into Alice Tetch's blood.

202
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,320
Pfeffer's office was ransacked,
and their files were missing.

203
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,360
So someone else is infected
with the virus? That's just great.

204
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,320
It isn't you, is it? Because that
sure would make things easy.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
No, it's not me.

206
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
What's that on your hand?

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,560
"Arkham." I didn't write it.

208
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
Okay, let's all just calm down.

209
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
So the virus-infected
killer wrote on your hand.

210
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,720
He wants you to go to Arkham.

211
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
- Barnes is in Arkham.
- No.

212
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,600
It's not about Barnes.

213
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
- Jim, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Hello, Jervis.

215
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
James.

216
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
What an unexpected pleasure.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,440
Someone else is infected
with your sister's blood.

218
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
You don't say.

219
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
And I've been thinking
it's possible...

220
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,040
...she infected them accidentally.

221
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,960
Yes, possible. Possible.

222
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,680
But your reaction tells me you knew.

223
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,160
So, you infected them
after you stole your sister's blood,

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,480
but you stayed quiet,

225
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
waiting for them to show symptoms.

226
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,720
Well, that would be darn
sneaky of me, wouldn't it?

227
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,360
I need the name.

228
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,880
You need the name.

229
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,160
So, I've been quiet about it
all this time,

230
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,760
and now I'm going to help you
because we're such good friends?

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,480
Because I can make your life
here very uncomfortable.

232
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
More uncomfortable than having
Captain Barnes next door

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
screaming "Guilty!"
all hours of the night?

234
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,480
Give me the name!

235
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,680
Oh, James, I would love to see
what Alice's virus would do to you.

236
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,440
The beast in you is right there.

237
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,400
So desperate to get out.

238
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,480
And I know of whom you speak.

239
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Oh, yes, indeed.

240
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,520
I stabbed him and pricked him
and caused him to bleed.

241
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,680
But nothing you can say,
no words you might possess,

242
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,400
can pry from me the smallest guess,

243
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
for this game is my game!

244
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
I say when it's done.

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,760
And right now
I'm having too much fun.

246
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,000
You want to play a game, Jervis?

247
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,480
Fine. Let's play a game.

248
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,800
Whoever you infected...

249
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,480
...has some sort of plan.

250
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
I want you to tell me
the name of this man.

251
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,160
Wow James, I, have to give
that effort an "F."

252
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,800
- And can you really imagine that...
- Two are dead.

253
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,240
More may die soon.

254
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
This isn't a game. Give me his name.

255
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,240
You will only know his name
when it's too late!

256
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
When the one you love
has been murdered by hate!

257
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,520
Guard! Take me to my cell!

258
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
What do you mean the one that I love?

259
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,040
- Guard!
- Give me his name, Tetch.

260
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,600
Give me his name
or you'll share the blame!

261
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,160
Nothing! Nothing!
I'll tell you naught!

262
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
His name shall be neither
spoken nor taught.

263
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,880
He'll cut and he'll crush
and the blood will run thick.

264
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,640
Though from healer to killer
is no easy trick.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
"Healer to killer."

266
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
He's a doctor.

267
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
My God.

268
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
You'll never stop him, James.

269
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
He'll kill, and he'll kill,
and he'll kill!

270
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,840
This is Gordon.
Give me Dr. Mario Calvi immediately.

271
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
On my damn authority! Just do it!

272
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
I take it you're off?

273
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,600
When we were casing that place,

274
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,320
I got a feeling
we were being watched.

275
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,600
And if this Court of Owls
is all you say,

276
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,640
they're not gonna be too cool
with Bruce breaking their deal.

277
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
That's very true.

278
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,320
And Master Bruce knows the Court

279
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,200
will catch up with him sooner
or later.

280
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,600
And if he has the opportunity
to take them out,

281
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,400
- then he'll take them out.
- That's a big if.

282
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,240
Especially when your stupid job
is supposed to be protecting him.

283
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,960
My stupid job, miss,
is to make sure that he grows up

284
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,360
to be the man he's meant to be.

285
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Still...

286
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
...kind of a punk move for him

287
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,520
to make a deal with the people
who killed his parents.

288
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,920
Yeah, well, you understand this,
then.

289
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
He only did what he did
to protect the people he cares about.

290
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
For you.

291
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,280
And it cost him dearly.

292
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,240
Are you serious? Arresting
Don Falcone's son on his wedding day?

293
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,080
I had no choice. He's got the virus.

294
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,000
Do you really think Lee Thompkins,
Dr. Lee Thompkins,

295
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,000
wouldn't know if her own fiancé
had the virus?

296
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,720
How long did Barnes have it
and hide it?

297
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Tetch must have infected him
that night in the hospital

298
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
when he dosed me;
it would explain things.

299
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Like what?

300
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Mario hitting me
at the engagement party.

301
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,080
You know what also
would explain that?

302
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,440
You telling Tetch
to shoot his fiancée.

303
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,640
You should've seen his face

304
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
when those assassins
attacked us, his rage.

305
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,160
He was being attacked by assassins!

306
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
What was I supposed to do, Harvey,

307
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,400
wait until he kills again,
till he hurts Lee?

308
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,840
You were supposed to wait
until you had enough proof.

309
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,400
And why would Tetch infect
Mario in the first place?

310
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
To hurt me.

311
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,960
Okay, let's say you're right.
Let's say that Mario is infected.

312
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,080
So he crushes some guy's skull,
he breaks into the lab,

313
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,960
he attacks you, and then
he writes "Arkham" on your hand?

314
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,600
Why would he want you to find him?

315
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I don't know.

316
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
He doesn't have the virus.

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,760
What? No, no, no, no. Run it again.

318
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,560
I ran it three times. He's clean.

319
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,080
I could've told you that.
But, hey, I'm glad it's official.

320
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,920
Dr. Calvi, on behalf of the G.C.P.D.,
I just want to apologize for any,

321
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,080
inconvenience or embarrassment
this may have caused you.

322
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
No need.

323
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
Living with Lee, I understand
the pressures you're all under.

324
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,440
But if you'll excuse me,
I have a wedding to attend.

325
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,200
Jim, I understand
this is a tough day for you,

326
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,440
but, no hard feelings.

327
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
The test.

328
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,520
That's why you broke into the lab.

329
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
To find out how to beat it. But why?

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
- Jim...
- I know you have the virus.

331
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm gonna prove it.

332
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,600
And I promise,
you will never marry Lee.

333
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
But she didn't say anything?

334
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,880
She said she thought
we were being watched.

335
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,240
Personally, I think
she's just got the jitters.

336
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,320
She can't still be mad
I told Ivy she was my girlfriend.

337
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,240
It just slipped out.

338
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,560
She can call herself
whatever she wants.

339
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,280
Fascinating as I find this tale
of young

340
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,840
unrequited love is, Master Bruce,

341
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,480
please can we just concentrate
on the task at hand?

342
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Do you have the key?

343
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Excellent.

344
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,840
Alfred, you know
when we get this thing,

345
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
whatever it is,

346
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,600
the Whispers are gonna
try to take it from us.

347
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,760
Well, to be honest, Master Bruce,

348
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,160
it's not the Whispers
I'm worried about.

349
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,920
And have we made any headway
on the waterfront negotiations?

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,880
I have spoken with the union leader.
He agreed to our offer.

351
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
So those photos can go back
in the vault.

352
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
They were quite saucy, weren't they?

353
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,920
- And how about the...
- Your approval for the new casino

354
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,160
should come through tomorrow.

355
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
Demolition can begin right away.

356
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Ed, I cannot tell you how good it is
to see you back to your old self.

357
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
Just one last signature.

358
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,400
This is your resignation.

359
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,400
Isabella's death has altered things,
and I can't continue...

360
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
No!

361
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,440
Ed, I will not let you leave.

362
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,600
It is not in your best interest.

363
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
You have to stay busy.

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How can I say this?

365
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
We're friends.

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Aren't we, Oswald?

367
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Of course!

368
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Since the accident...

369
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,720
And-and I never thought
that this could happen.

370
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,960
I've had the desire to become
more than employer-employee.

371
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,760
More than friends.

372
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,080
I have been feeling the same.

373
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
I didn't want to mention it,

374
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,840
because of all the awfulness
about Isabelle.

375
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Isabella!

376
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
But...

377
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
...one cannot deny love.

378
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,240
What is it? What's wrong?

379
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
There...

380
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,160
...there's been a misunderstanding.

381
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
I was going to,

382
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,920
propose that we become partners.

383
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,400
Business partners.

384
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Partners?

385
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
- Then...
- Excuse me.

386
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,640
Lee? You here? It's Jim!

387
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
Hello, Jim.

388
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,920
I saw you left Lee a message.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,080
I accidentally took her phone
this morning.

390
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,600
She's not here, by the way.

391
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

392
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
How'd you pass the test?

393
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,960
Because I don't have the virus.

394
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Or do I?

395
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,280
You gonna arrest me, Jim?

396
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,160
Do you want to look even more
like the paranoid ex-lover?

397
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,680
I'll only pass the test again.

398
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,200
We'll find out how you beat it.

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,040
Only a matter of time.

400
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,160
Let's say I do have the virus

401
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,320
- How would I have gotten it?
- From Tetch.

402
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,640
When he dosed me with hallucinogen.

403
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,120
Dr. Calvi, I'd like you
to meet my sister, Alice.

404
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,600
With Barnes, the virus stoked
his anger at the guilty.

405
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,200
What dark part of me
has it brought to life?

406
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Jealousy.

407
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,240
You're afraid of losing Lee.

408
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
If that's true,

409
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,920
that means the woman
we both know you still love

410
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,520
is gonna marry a lunatic
who'll do anything to keep her.

411
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,040
Are you sure
you don't want that drink?

412
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
What I want to know is
why you put me on your trail.

413
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
What are you after?

414
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Let me give you a hint.

415
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,600
You see, what keeps me up at night

416
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,120
is not the thought that you love her.

417
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
It's the thought,

418
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,240
that a part of her still loves you.

419
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,520
Well, in that case, let's find her.

420
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Let her decide
if she's gonna marry you.

421
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

422
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
Virus made you strong,
not bulletproof. Let's go.

423
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,080
You know what, Jim,
with all this virus talk,

424
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,520
you keep forgetting one thing.

425
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm still Carmine Falcone's son.

426
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
You know Victor.

427
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Hi-ho.

428
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,560
Victor, were you listening to him?

429
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,840
He has the same virus as Barnes had.

430
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
What's that?
Oh, no. I wasn't listening.

431
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
- You have to let me go.
- Uh-huh.

432
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,720
- Does Falcone know you're here?
- Wait.

433
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Wait.

434
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,640
You're free to go, Jim.

435
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I'll keep this.

436
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
I don't understand.

437
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,760
I was only supposed to keep you
until the big hand was on nine

438
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,960
and the little hand...

439
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,520
My mag, now.

440
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,960
Sorry, Jim. But, hey,
give the bride a kiss for me.

441
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I asked.

442
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
And it is with great pleasure
that I present this award

443
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,960
to Mr. Kyle Davis
for his magnificent book,

444
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,960
"Gotham's Sewers: an Oral History."

445
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,080
Looks just fascinating.

446
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Thank you.

447
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,440
- Oh, you're too kind.
- I love sewers.

448
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Ed.

449
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,960
I was worried when you ran off

450
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
that I might have upset you.

451
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,600
Can't we just pretend
that nothing happened?

452
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
Go back to the way things were?

453
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,680
You are the best friend
I've ever had.

454
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
I don't want to lose you.

455
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Please?

456
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,720
You're my best friend as well,
Oswald.

457
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Remember that.

458
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Jim, what are you doing here?

459
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Are you okay?

460
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,560
- Where's Mario?
- He's out at the church.

461
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,920
We're about to get married.

462
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,840
You can't marry him.

463
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Oh, my God.

464
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,280
- Just give us a minute.
- Yeah.

465
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,600
Listen to me, and I know
how this is gonna sound...

466
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,880
You think that he has
Alice Tetch's virus.

467
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,680
- He told you.
- Yes.

468
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,080
And he told me
that you had him arrested today,

469
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,680
on our wedding day.

470
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,800
And you had Lucius give him
the test three times, and he passed.

471
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
What's wrong with you?
He cheated the test, Lee.

472
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,360
I don't know how, but he did.

473
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
Tetch infected him
that night in the hospital.

474
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
- You went to see Tetch, didn't you?
- Yes.

475
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,040
Jim, don't you see?
Tetch is planting ideas in your head.

476
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
- No.
- Don't you remember?

477
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,280
- He's done this before.
- No, this isn't like that.

478
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay, what is more likely,

479
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,680
that Tetch is planting ideas
in your head to screw with you

480
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,360
or that Mario has Alice's virus?

481
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
Lee, you cannot marry him!

482
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,800
Mario said that you would
never let us be happy.

483
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,200
I thought he was overreacting,
but he's right.

484
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Tetch or not, you are obsessed.

485
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Let it go.

486
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
This is what he wanted.

487
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,560
- What are you talking about?
- This.

488
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Me coming here.

489
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,120
That's why he put me on his trail.

490
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,760
He got the test so he could
find out how to beat it.

491
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,880
He had me arrest him
so I'd look like a jealous ex.

492
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,160
That's why Zsasz let me go,
so I'd race here...

493
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,160
...finally push you away.

494
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Oh, Jim.

495
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,720
I say this as someone
who cares about you.

496
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,640
Get help.

497
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I love you.

498
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
I love you.

499
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,200
I've never stopped.

500
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,440
I should've come to see you
as soon as I got out of prison,

501
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
but I couldn't.

502
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
I was ashamed.

503
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,000
I thought I had to set things right.

504
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,480
But I did finally come, Lee.

505
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,960
I saw you, through the window...

506
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
...with him.

507
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
You were smiling.

508
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You looked happy.

509
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,680
I couldn't bring myself to go in.

510
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
I've regretted it every day since.

511
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Please.

512
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Don't marry him.

513
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
After the wedding...

514
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,920
...Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

515
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
I'll never see you again.

516
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
- Lee...
- Damn you...

517
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,040
...for telling me this now.

518
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,320
You come in here
with these crazy accusations,

519
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,240
and when I don't believe you,
you pull this?

520
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
How dare you?

521
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Don't you see?

522
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,720
- He wants you to hate me.
- Well, he succeeded.

523
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,280
- Get the hell out of here!
- No!

524
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Fine.

525
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Carmine.

526
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,560
Can you please help
Detective Gordon find the exit?

527
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Certainly.

528
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,240
And if you're ready, my dear.

529
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I am.

530
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,360
Do you, Leslie,
take Mario to be your husband?

531
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I do.

532
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,000
And do you, Mario,
take Leslie to be your wife?

533
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
I do.

534
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,320
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

535
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,720
You may kiss the bride.

536
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Calvi.

537
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
Well, I think it's safe to admit

538
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,440
that our foreign friends are no-show,
Master Bruce.

539
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,600
It was a right dodgy plan, anyway.

540
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Where are you going?

541
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,600
That would be home.

542
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,760
Alfred, this is our only shot
to take down the Court.

543
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
You don't know that, do you?

544
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,040
I mean, it was a moot point, anyway.

545
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,600
I mean, walking across
the entire length of a room

546
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,000
- on a bloody tightrope?
- I can do it. I, I did it.

547
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
Yeah, three times out of twenty.
I counted.

548
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,280
- No, thank you very much.
- I can do it.

549
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,080
Oh, that's bloody marvelous,
isn't it?

550
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Hey?

551
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
Right.

552
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,720
The deal is this.
You stay on coms at all times.

553
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,720
If I order abort, you abort.
Is that clear?

554
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,760
I need my head examined.

555
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
Really do.

556
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
What?

557
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Just wondering.

558
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,840
Does this mean you are my girlfriend?

559
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Shut up.

560
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,400
So, I thought, if I were Mario,
how would I beat the test?

561
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, the test looks
for this one marker in the blood,

562
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,320
but that marker can be masked
by an abundance

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,480
of certain other drugs.

564
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,920
The two most easily available,
Cloracinamine and...

565
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Lucius, just-just get to the point.

566
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,800
Mario's blood came back off
the charts for Cloracinamine.

567
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,280
Alvarez!

568
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,960
Get a unit on Lee Thompkins
and Dr. Mario Calvi,

569
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
and don't let them out of your sight!

570
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,320
This isn't proof that Mario
killed those men.

571
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,920
No, but it's enough
for a search warrant.

572
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Now I got to go find Jim Gordon.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,040
Don't mess with Falcone!

574
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Hey.

575
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,640
All right, straight to the safe room.

576
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm gonna check the rest
of the house. Go ahead.

577
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
This way.

578
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Not exactly hiding it.

579
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
There's no point.

580
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
The floor is alarmed.

581
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't let go.

582
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Come on!

583
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,320
Out the way you came!

584
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
- Let's go!
- No!

585
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
No!

586
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,360
We have to leave.

587
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,040
And exactly who are you?

588
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,400
You're the one
who's been following us.

589
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Hey.

590
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
You know her?

591
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
That's my mom.

592
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,200
- Now can we get out of here?
- You're bloody right.

593
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,520
Found it! In his trash.

594
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Cloracinamine.

595
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Oh, yes.

596
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,080
We got him. Tell Alvarez.

597
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,680
That was Alvarez.

598
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,880
Lee and Mario snuck
out of the reception.

599
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
He lost them.

600
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,280
I can't even hold a knife.

601
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,080
- I swear, when I see Nygma...
- We'll kill him together.

602
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
- Real slow.
- How sweet.

603
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Son of a bitch!

604
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Hear him out.

605
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Please.

606
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I don't want to kill him.

607
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,000
I want to destroy him.

608
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,920
I want to take away...

609
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,760
...everything that he loves.

610
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,960
I want to make him...

611
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,800
...despised.

612
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,400
- What are you talking about?
- Penguin.

613
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,640
- He killed the librarian.
- What?

614
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,080
And you cut off my hand?

615
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,240
I assume you want something.

616
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,120
With Penguin gone, the underworld
will need a new leader.

617
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
I think it's time Gotham
had a woman's touch.

618
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,600
The crime families
will never follow you.

619
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,800
Well, that's where you come in.

620
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,960
You know the families in and out.

621
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,000
Not to mention,
you're a whiz at strategy.

622
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Think about it, Ed.

623
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,560
Your brains, their brawn,

624
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,920
...my, me.

625
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,480
We could make quite a team.

626
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,960
We destroy Penguin first.

627
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Of course.

628
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,840
But there is one thing
you need to do.

629
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Okay.

630
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,040
- I'm sorry about your hand.
- Apology not accepted!

631
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,800
Well, we'll work on that.

632
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Drinks!

633
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Hey.

634
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Thank you.

635
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,040
Thank you for letting us
leave that party early.

636
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,120
Of course. I wanted to.

637
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,160
I love this house.

638
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,640
It's my father's refuge.

639
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,000
Not many people know about it.

640
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,200
I know Gordon came to the church.

641
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Talked to you.

642
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,400
It was just like you said.

643
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,920
He said you had the virus.

644
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He was obsessed.

645
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,560
And what did you say?

646
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
That after the wedding,
we would be leaving Gotham.

647
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,920
That I would never see him again.

648
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Is that it?

649
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
What are you asking me?

650
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm asking...

651
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,960
...if there's any part of you,
however small,

652
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
that still has feelings for him.

653
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,400
And I swear,
I will never ask you again.

654
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,240
A part of me will always care
for him.

655
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,200
But I married you.

656
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,240
I love you.

657
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,400
That's all I needed to know.

658
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Where are they?

659
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,640
- Don Falcone, he just...
- Where are they?

660
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
You don't give up, do you?

661
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
Your son has Alice Tetch's virus.

662
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,120
He's killed two people we know of.

663
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,880
Every cop in this city is after him.

664
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
Where is he?

665
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,520
You knew?

666
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,440
That Mario had the same virus
as Barnes? No.

667
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,160
I knew he was in danger,
but I didn't know why.

668
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,680
I never suspected this.

669
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,880
You're saying the attacks
on Mario, the car bomb.

670
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,840
It's because of the virus?

671
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,600
How is that possible?
Who knew he had it?

672
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
I can't tell you that.

673
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,480
I'll send my men to bring Mario in.

674
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,960
You think I'd trust Lee's life
with these two goons?

675
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,080
Tell me where they are.

676
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,400
If I do that, you'll kill him.

677
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I know you, James.

678
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,120
Mario is my son.

679
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,280
There is nothing
and no one more valuable to me.

680
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,960
And if he does have this sickness,
he needs help.

681
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,760
And if he kills Lee,
he'll cross a line

682
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,440
he'll never come back from.

683
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,840
Even if he's cured,
knowing that will destroy him.

684
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
I'm your only hope.

685
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,800
Still, I'll send my men.

686
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
You mean these two?

687
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,880
Anyone else you want to send?

688
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,600
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

689
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
I swear.

690
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Now, where are they?

691
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,480
<i>She loves him. Loves him!</i>

692
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,800
<i>She loves him.</i>

693
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,960
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

694
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,520
<i>She loves him.</i>

695
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,920
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

696
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,080
<i>She loves him.</i>

697
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,400
<i>She loves him.</i>

698
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,600
<i>She loves him. She loves him.</i>

699
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,760
Lee!

700
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Jim?
