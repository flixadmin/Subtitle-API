1
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,125
<span style="style.default_1">It's a joyous day for me,</span>

2
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,500
<span style="style.default_1">because my autobiography,</span>

3
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,500
<span style="style.default_1">is being released.</span>

4
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,666
I'm a very misunderstood man.

5
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,916
If you want to know the real Sanjay Dutt,

6
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,541
read my autobiography.

7
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,666
It's my story,
but written by my buddy, D. N. Tripathi.

8
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,500
And he wishes that I read you a chapter.

9
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,208
"Chapter one...

10
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,875
Bapu and Sanju.

11
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,166
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

12
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,583
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

13
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,708
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph."

14
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,750
-Hey, Tripathi...
-Yes.

15
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,916
Killer opening! Moved me to tears.

16
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,000
Your wish is my command.
I've put my soul into it.

17
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,625
Mohammed... Sudama... come here.

18
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,833
Tripathi has written a rump-ripping book.

19
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,916
Read us a chapter. Nanny, take a seat.

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,416
The book is titled "Sage Sanju".

21
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
"Chapter one...

22
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,375
Bapu and Sanju.

23
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,125
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,500
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

25
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,250
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph.

26
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,916
For instance, we've both spent
a lot of time in prison.

27
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,541
He's a national hero.

28
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,291
I'm a Bollywood hero.

29
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,291
He was against violence.

30
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,291
He walked with a stick
but never used it as a weapon

31
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,958
I had an AK-56 rifle
and never used it either.

32
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,375
He dreamed of a free India.

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,250
I dream of... my freedom."

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,041
Maanyata, it's a slow starter.

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,583
Don't worry, the story picks up later.

36
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,416
Hold this...

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,000
pick up the bell... ring it.

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,125
Go around and worship me.

39
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:00,375
You've elevated me to Mahatma Gandhi
in the first chapter.

40
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,500
By the end, you'll turn me into god!

41
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,708
Find a temple for sale.

42
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,833
He'll put me on the altar.

43
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,291
Sorry, Tripathi.

44
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,625
Buddy, tell me...

45
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,500
are shoes allowed inside a temple?

46
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,041
Not at all, Sanju.

47
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Then how dare you wear shoes
in front of God?

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,000
Sanju, I'd told you, I'm no biographer.

49
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,791
I'm a songwriter...

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,666
Sanju... please!

51
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,583
What about me reminds you of Gandhi?

52
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,416
I'll write another draft.

53
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,166
<span style="style.default_1">Shithead, you jacked my book!</span>

54
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,041
<span style="style.default_1">Our correspondent is outside</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the Supreme Court.</span>

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,208
<span style="style.default_1">In moments, we'll know</span>
<span style="style.default_1">whether the actor, Sanjay Dutt,</span>

56
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,500
<span style="style.default_1">will go to prison or be free.</span>

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,333
<span style="style.default_1">In 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court</span>
<span style="style.default_1">had sentenced Sanjay Dutt</span>

58
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,583
<span style="style.default_1">to six years imprisonment</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the Mumbai bomb blast case.</span>

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,458
<span style="style.default_1">He'd appealed to the Supreme Court</span>
<span style="style.default_1">against the judgment.</span>

60
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:16,041
<span style="style.default_1">The judgment was expected next week.</span>

61
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,541
<span style="style.default_1">But we've just received information</span>

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,583
<span style="style.default_1">the Supreme Court</span>
<span style="style.default_1">will give its verdict today.</span>

63
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,583
<span style="style.default_1">Stay tuned, as we report live</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from the Supreme Court.</span>

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,291
<span style="style.default_1">Dinesh, give us an update.</span>

65
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,208
<span style="style.default_1">The verdict is out.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sanjay Dutt will go to prison.</span>

66
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,041
<span style="style.default_1">The Court has sentenced him to five years,</span>

67
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,916
<span style="style.default_1">for possession of an AK-56 rifle.</span>

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">When does he go to prison?</span>

69
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,000
<span style="style.default_1">The Court has given him</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a month to surrender</span>

70
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,333
<span style="style.default_1">so he can complete his films.</span>

71
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,416
<span style="style.default_1">His father, late Sunil Dutt,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">popular actor and politician...</span>

72
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:56,000
<span style="style.default_1">his mother, late Nargis,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">iconic actor of the '60s...</span>

73
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,666
<span style="style.default_1">the scion of this eminent family,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sanjay, will go to prison.</span>

74
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,541
<span style="style.default_1">Let's hear what people have to say.</span>

75
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,625
<span style="style.default_1">Five years is nothing.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He should be hanged!</span>

76
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,125
<span style="style.default_1">Traitor... a bloody terrorist!</span>

77
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">Celebrities have it easy.</span>

78
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,000
<span style="style.default_1">Such terrorists should be shot dead!</span>

79
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,375
Come inside.

80
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,500
<span style="style.default_1">When the kids start school,</span>

81
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,500
<span style="style.default_1">they are sure to be asked...</span>

82
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,625
<span style="style.default_1">"Where's your terrorist-dad? In prison?"</span>

83
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,541
<span style="style.default_1">It'll be easier for them to say,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"No, he's dead."</span>

84
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,166
<span style="style.default_1">Sanju!</span>

85
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,541
Suicide may solve your problem,

86
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,875
not your kids'.

87
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,541
They'll still be called terrorist's kids.

88
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,208
We decided to fight, didn't we?

89
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:36,125
-That we'll get the truth out there.
-Didn't we try?

90
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,500
What did we get? Bapu and Sanju!

91
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,541
That's what you get with knuckleheads.

92
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,750
Write it yourself.

93
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,750
Struggled with a four-line suicide note.

94
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,708
Imagine a 400-page book!

95
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,166
We'll find a good writer.

96
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,625
Why will they be interested?

97
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,750
It's said,
"Bad choices make good stories."

98
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,750
And you're the king of bad choices.

99
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,083
Some writer out there
will understand this.

100
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Sanju, be respectful.

101
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,333
<span style="style.default_1">She's no Tripathi. She's Winnie Diaz.</span>

102
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">World's top biographer.</span>

103
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,458
<span style="style.default_1">She's down from London.</span>

104
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,500
Control slang like...
rump-ripper, jacked...

105
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,208
Got it.

106
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,291
Winnie

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,041
I won't take much of your time.

108
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,458
-I wanted--
-I can't write your biography. I'm sorry.

109
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,041
Why not?

110
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,916
...I asked around and...

111
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,666
And they said I'm a terrorist.

112
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,208
Who are these people? Do they know me?

113
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,875
Do they hang out with me?

114
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,333
Then how can they be so sure?

115
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:23,083
Their opinion is based
merely on TV and print news.

116
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
And these TV anchors, newspaper reporters,

117
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
who dish out opinions every day,

118
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,583
haven't met me either!

119
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,500
The media has maligned me.

120
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,791
So, I need a good writer
to present my side of the story.

121
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:44,541
You think millions
will read your biography?

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,875
It doesn't work like that.

123
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,625
Thousands of books
rot away in book stores.

124
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,333
Once in a blue moon a book comes that--

125
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,875
That's a rump-ripper!

126
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,000
My story's that!

127
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,916
What's there in your life story?

128
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,625
Give me just one hour.
Guns, drugs, alcohol...

129
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,416
Pick any chapter, I'll tell you the story.

130
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,958
I guarantee, you'll be jacked...

131
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,666
I mean... jack... it'll be a J K Rowling.

132
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,125
I have a month to surrender.

133
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,625
This time I may not survive.

134
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,666
One hour, please.

135
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,875
5 p.m. tomorrow. Right here.

136
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,208
At 6 p.m., I'll tell you
if I'm jacked or not.

137
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,500
From Amitabh Bachchan to Sachin Tendulkar

138
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
you've upset everyone.

139
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,916
So many heroes, but you'll pen
a terrorist's biography!

140
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,083
This is fake news.

141
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,791
He too is a fake.
This is a pressure tactic.

142
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,541
-Who are you?
-Zubin Mistry.

143
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,708
I construct malls.

144
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,083
I suggest you don't write this book.

145
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,625
<span style="style.default_1">And you came all the way to suggest it?</span>

146
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm here daily to jog. Saw you here, so...

147
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,583
Jog in a suit? Is work-wear shorts?

148
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
He hit me.

149
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,916
He's on cocaine, LSD, heroin...

150
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:58,666
A womanizer, too. Ask him his score.

151
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,833
Any number less than 200, he's lying.

152
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,833
Want to know his truth? Call me.

153
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,041
Sanju.

154
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,708
For once, I feel like thanking the press.

155
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,583
One headline, and you're here.

156
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,500
-Why did you get this printed?
-I didn't, Winnie.

157
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,166
Reporters live outside my gate.
They follow me everywhere.

158
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,833
If you were a doctor,

159
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,958
they'd print, "Sanju ill",
an actress... "Sanju's new lady."

160
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,875
They want spicy headlines. Not the truth.

161
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,541
-That's why we've come to you.
-Will he tell me the truth?

162
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Nothing but the truth. Fire away.

163
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,833
Excluding your wife,
how many women have you slept with?

164
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,500
Look here.

165
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,666
Should I count the prostitutes or...

166
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,708
No, let's keep them aside.

167
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,583
Never kept a score-card.

168
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,500
But once, I did the math,
I recalled around 308.

169
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:25,125
I must've missed a few.
On the safe side, let's say... 350.

170
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,166
Do you know him?

171
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,000
Zubin! He was my friend.

172
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,583
I nicknamed him "God".

173
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,791
Since you picked him,
let's start with chapter "God".

174
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,250
1981... my debut film.
He was always on the sets.

175
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,958
Dad was directing me
and I was nervous as hell.

176
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,500
<span style="style.default_1">Is this love?</span>

177
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,541
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my dove!</span>

178
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,750
Cut...

179
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,291
Sonny, your lips are off sync.

180
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,541
Match them to the song.

181
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,958
And... a romantic reaction
when the girl sings.

182
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,083
But, Dad, where's the girl?

183
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,500
How do I react to a cold camera?

184
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,166
An actor's job is to imagine.

185
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:35,750
Imagine a beautiful actress
in front of you.

186
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,375
Ganpat, come here. Observe.

187
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,958
<span style="style.default_1">Is this love?</span>

188
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my dove!</span>

189
00:14:55,083 --> 00:15:00,291
<span style="style.default_1">In your absence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Day and night eclipse</span>

190
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,166
<span style="style.default_1">And an hour is forever</span>

191
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,708
<span style="style.default_1">Is this love?</span>

192
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,583
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my dove!</span>

193
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,375
Cut.

194
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,708
Come. Give it a go.

195
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,291
Let's give him a heroine.

196
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,041
Ganpat, come here.

197
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,958
Hold this and stand here.

198
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,250
-Don't move.
-Good idea.

199
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,000
<span style="style.default_1">Is this love?</span>

200
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,875
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my dove!</span>

201
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:48,000
<span style="style.default_1">In your absence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Day and night eclipse</span>

202
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,666
<span style="style.default_1">And an hour is forever</span>

203
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,958
<span style="style.default_1">Is this love?</span>

204
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,458
<span style="style.default_1">Yes!</span>

205
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,500
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my dove!</span>

206
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,166
Cut it!

207
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,458
Well played, Ramu. Ace!

208
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,291
Sonny...

209
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,333
-You've been smoking?
-No, Dad.

210
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,875
Now you lie, too?

211
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:25,166
Thousands struggle to be an actor...
with no luck.

212
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,166
You've got it on a silver platter,
respect that.

213
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,458
Drinking, smoking...
will show on your face.

214
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,708
The camera spares no one.

215
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,083
Quit smoking or I'll shelve the film.

216
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,625
Smoke with your left hand.
Fathers sniff the right hand.

217
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,333
Bro, I'm the first actor in the world
to romance a bandit.

218
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,541
But, dad praised the cameraman.

219
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,583
"Well played, Ramu! Ace!"

220
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,916
However well I do, he never praises me.

221
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,166
He insults me publicly.

222
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,500
-Reason with him.
-That would be suicide.

223
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,166
You're too scared of your dad.

224
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey, try this.

225
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,708
It bumps up confidence.

226
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:47,166
Gladiators would take this before a fight.

227
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,416
Watch.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,958
Put this in your nose... and snort it all.

229
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,250
I make my Pomeranian snort it
and he thinks he's an Alsatian.

230
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,250
Try it.

231
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,416
Hey! I've been taking it for years.

232
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,958
I'm stronger than you. Try me.

233
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,750
<span style="style.default_1">O light of my soul!</span>

234
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:40,708
<span style="style.default_1">If you're heaven's king, I'm your queen</span>

235
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,875
<span style="style.default_1">If you're the needle, I'm the thread</span>

236
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,583
<span style="style.default_1">Then why our union</span>

237
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,583
<span style="style.default_1">So half-baked, half-baked?</span>

238
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,541
Dad thinks that I can't lip sync to songs.

239
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,250
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a fine catch, so are you</span>

240
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">Marry me, my love</span>

241
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:34,458
<span style="style.default_1">Let sparks fly</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So fine, so bright</span>

242
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,750
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a fine catch, so are you</span>

243
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,666
<span style="style.default_1">But, I'm a free bird</span>

244
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,000
<span style="style.default_1">Keep your fireworks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Too fine, too bright</span>

245
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,791
<span style="style.default_1">Take my hand</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Marry me quick</span>

246
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,875
<span style="style.default_1">Make me yours in a click</span>

247
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,541
<span style="style.default_1">Listen up, I'm a wild stallion</span>

248
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,875
<span style="style.default_1">Why reduce me to a mere medallion?</span>

249
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,583
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a fine catch, so are you</span>

250
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,500
<span style="style.default_1">Marry me, my love</span>

251
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,666
<span style="style.default_1">Let sparks fly</span>
<span style="style.default_1">So fine, so bright</span>

252
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">No way, love!</span>

253
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,166
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a fine catch, so are you</span>

254
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,916
<span style="style.default_1">But, I'm a free bird</span>

255
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:34,541
<span style="style.default_1">Keep your fireworks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Too fine, too bright</span>

256
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,333
<span style="style.default_1">That night, one more Pomeranian</span>
<span style="style.default_1">turned into an Alsatian.</span>

257
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,541
<span style="style.default_1">God's powder was magic.</span>

258
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,125
<span style="style.default_1">My confidence was sky-rocketing.</span>

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,250
-Where's the bottle?
-Your dad chucked it.

260
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,708
Damn! For how long will he control me?

261
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,625
My father controlled me for 60 years.

262
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,250
-How did he let go?
-He popped it.

263
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,625
Dudes, don't leave. The vodka's coming.

264
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,916
The bar's closed, Sanju.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,750
Dad thinks cutting supply
will make us quit?

266
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,916
I have a back-up daddy

267
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,208
who'll fill up our mugs.

268
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,000
-Back-up dad?
-My girlfriend's pop.

269
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Is daddy home?

270
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,375
Yes, don't sneak in through the balcony.

271
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,291
I'll ring the doorbell. Wake him.

272
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,666
At this hour?

273
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,416
What's so important?

274
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,541
I want something, baby.

275
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,291
I'll be there in five. Open the door.

276
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,708
Wake up your dad.

277
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:21,666
Dad, mom... wake up. Sanju's here.

278
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,958
At 1 a.m.? Is everything okay?

279
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,208
Took him six months to muster courage.

280
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,958
He'd said, once his career kick started,

281
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,583
he'll ask for my hand.

282
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,541
Just the hand, or all of you?

283
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,208
We'll ask for the 18-year-old scotch.

284
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,833
Will the old fart agree?

285
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,875
If he doesn't agree, we grab and flee!

286
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,166
Hello, child. How are you?

287
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,375
Before you ask for anything,
I have something for you.

288
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,250
Ten rupees?

289
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,666
My father's gift to me
when I joined the Navy.

290
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,166
He said, "There are two kinds of bills."

291
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,958
"Real and fake."

292
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,000
When you tug at a real bill...

293
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,375
it won't tear.

294
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,708
You're starting your career.

295
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:22,000
Life will pull you left and right.

296
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:27,458
But if you stay honest,
nothing can rip you apart.

297
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,208
My father's wisdom is now yours.

298
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,291
Homi, let him sit.

299
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,041
Sit.

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,541
Now tell us.

301
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,666
What brings you here?

302
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:47,791
The real reason we're here is...
we have the midnight urge.

303
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,750
Can't control it anymore.

304
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,666
Look, we're weak with idioms.

305
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,291
Tell us clearly, what's a "midnight urge"?

306
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,208
Midnight urge means...

307
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,416
I'm 21 now. It's a biological need.

308
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:19,291
As soon as midnight strikes...
the urge surges.

309
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,708
I need it now... or I'm gonna explode!

310
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,958
But dad doesn't allow it.

311
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,250
He's orthodox. So I sin in secret.

312
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,500
Once, I was enjoying an 18-year-old
on the terrace... dad walked in.

313
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:38,333
I told him frankly, "Dad, I'm an adult.

314
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,625
My friends do it every night.
Their parents never object."

315
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:46,166
He said, "Alright, have your 18-year-old.
But don't hide.

316
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,000
Do it openly on the dining table,
before the family.

317
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,500
And that too, only once a month."

318
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,333
Daddy, how will once a month
quench this thirst?

319
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,791
Now I frequent the illicit joints.

320
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:59,458
16, 18, 21...
I grab whatever is available.

321
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:05,083
I park on a lonely stretch,
and indulge in the backseat.

322
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,833
Only fear is the cops.

323
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,666
They peek when you're about to peak.

324
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,333
Ma'am, try the backseat.

325
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,666
You were a Navy Captain.

326
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,000
You must've tasted the best
on every shore.

327
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:27,333
Be kind, let us taste some from your home.

328
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,958
-May we get one each?
-What!

329
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,666
Okay, we'll share one.

330
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,625
When daddy gets the urge,
you happily serve.

331
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:42,666
All we get is a "How dare you!"
Sorry, I've promised my friend.

332
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,833
I'm gonna grab one.

333
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,166
Stop!

334
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,083
Soda or water?

335
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,625
And return my papa's box.

336
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,958
Can I say something?

337
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,625
Your papa was wrong.

338
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:13,791
Life doesn't just pull you left and right.

339
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:17,416
It also pulls you up and down.

340
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,791
<span style="style.default_1">I drank all night with my friends.</span>

341
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,916
<span style="style.default_1">And returned home in the morning.</span>

342
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,541
I'm going for a jog.

343
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,583
Sit.

344
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,166
Sorry, sonny. I yelled at you publicly.

345
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:08,375
I'm stressed, so couldn't control myself.

346
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,166
A request...

347
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,000
Please focus on your work.

348
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,750
Your mother should feel proud
when she sees your first film.

349
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:23,541
She may not be able to see your next.

350
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,541
Why?

351
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,416
She has cancer of the pancreas.

352
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,875
I'm taking her to New York.
Sloan Hospital.

353
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,708
Why didn't anyone tell me?

354
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,250
She hid it from you
so your work won't suffer.

355
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,375
She's been in pain all year.

356
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,333
But acts fit in front of you.

357
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,083
Where are you?

358
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,000
In the dining. Want some tea?

359
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,333
Half a cup.

360
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,875
Hide it.

361
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,500
Don't cry in her presence.

362
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,583
She's acting. So must you.

363
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,583
Up so early?

364
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,333
Did you tell Sanju we're off to New York?

365
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,750
What? Haven't shared the news?

366
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,750
Take a deep breath.
You're gonna be shocked.

367
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:25,125
I've been offered a Hollywood film.

368
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:28,333
Now I'll mouth English dialogues.

369
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,583
James Bond.

370
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,166
I wish they had songs like our films.

371
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:52,583
<span style="style.default_1">This heart has lost its mate</span>

372
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:57,166
<span style="style.default_1">No one knows where my liver went</span>

373
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,958
A song here, a dance there,

374
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:03,000
and the Oscar's mine!

375
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,791
You shouldn't have retired!

376
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,916
Retired? I still act, don't I?

377
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dad took mom to New York.</span>

378
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,541
<span style="style.default_1">And I started spending more time with God.</span>

379
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,875
I was 18 when I lost my parents
in a car crash.

380
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,458
I was going to kill myself.

381
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,000
A fakir saved me.

382
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,166
He said, "The Lord who created pain,
also created a remedy."

383
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,833
Here.

384
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,083
Put it under your tongue.
It'll melt away all pain.

385
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,375
He gets it from the Himalayas.
So it's expensive.

386
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,916
But I'll send him the money.

387
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:31,916
<span style="style.default_1">The first time I did drugs,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was 'cause I was upset with dad.</span>

388
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,166
<span style="style.default_1">The second time, 'cause mom was dying.</span>

389
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,750
<span style="style.default_1">By the third time, I was an addict.</span>

390
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,833
<span style="style.default_1">Then I got the news</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that mom was in a coma.</span>

391
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:47,250
<span style="style.default_1">Dad summoned me to America.</span>

392
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,375
<span style="style.default_1">I traveled with my sisters...</span>

393
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,416
<span style="style.default_1">and 20 grams of cocaine.</span>

394
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,000
<span style="style.default_1">Being caught at the airport,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would've meant</span>

395
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,833
<span style="style.default_1">20 years in prison... even for my sisters.</span>

396
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,250
<span style="style.default_1">But back then, 20 years in prison,</span>

397
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,958
<span style="style.default_1">versus 20 grams of cocaine...</span>

398
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,250
<span style="style.default_1">my choice was crystal clear.</span>

399
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,041
<span style="style.default_1">I was so irresponsible</span>

400
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,291
<span style="style.default_1">that instead of spending time with mom,</span>

401
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,125
<span style="style.default_1">I'd smoke away in the fire exit.</span>

402
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,500
<span style="style.default_1">Then one night, walked into my life...</span>

403
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,875
<span style="style.default_1">Mr. Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.</span>

404
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,625
-What did you steal?
-Twins...

405
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,000
-O Lord Ganesha!
-This is Jesus' jurisdiction.

406
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:53,416
Lord Ganesha doesn't operate here.
What did you steal?

407
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,916
I'd gone to keep the idol inside.

408
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,250
I'm a fan of your parents.

409
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,750
Thought Lord Ganesha
will heal your mother.

410
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,083
But, what's "Twins"?

411
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,625
Eggs. Back home we call them Twins.

412
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,291
Hope "The Twins" haven't parted ways.

413
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:30,916
They are out of shape.

414
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,250
Come.

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,875
-Where?
-To get The Twins back in shape.

416
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,916
Ever seen a topless girl?

417
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,000
Of course, I have.

418
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,083
-Where? On TV?
-No, live.

419
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,916
My physics teacher, back home...

420
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,375
his mother slipped in the bathroom.

421
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,458
I broke the door,
hauled her on my shoulder

422
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:33,083
and put her in the ambulance.

423
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,000
Stark naked... topless, bottomless.

424
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,125
How old was she?

425
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,833
Ninety. No, 91.

426
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,125
I did see stuff. I'm not naive.

427
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,208
-Ever had alcohol?
-Of course.

428
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,708
There's a saying back home...

429
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,083
"Jam-jam bam-bam."

430
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,666
Translate that.

431
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,666
"Jam-jam" is money.

432
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,666
And "bam-bam"?

433
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,333
Sex.

434
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,000
Your jacket took away jam-jam,
I lost my bam-bam.

435
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:33,208
You owe me a blonde.

436
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,833
Cover me.

437
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,583
Don't! You'll land in prison.

438
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,083
Relax.

439
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,666
Run!

440
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,416
Stop joking. We could've been arrested.

441
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,833
Noble cause, brother.

442
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:17,458
Your mom's in the hospital
and you're snorting?

443
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,875
Hey, Mr. Righteousness.

444
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,041
We've been friends for just five minutes.

445
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,333
-Control your emotions.
-Friendship?

446
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:29,166
You aren't a good son!
How'll you be a good friend?

447
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,041
Get lost! I don't need a friend.

448
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,458
Hey, stop!

449
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,666
I just can't quit.

450
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,041
Alright, go!

451
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:05,000
If my friend was on drugs,
I wouldn't abandon him.

452
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,666
I'd thrash him till he quit.

453
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,375
Throw it.

454
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,000
-I'll quit tomorrow.
-Now.

455
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,750
I promise, tomorrow.

456
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,625
-Let go my twins.
-Let go the powder.

457
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,083
-Twins first.
-Powder first.

458
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,791
-I'm desperate.
-It's the time to fight.

459
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,416
Say, "I'm a tiger."

460
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,083
-Now, rorr.
-"Rorr"?

461
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,916
Once more.

462
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,416
I quit! I promise.

463
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,958
Never abandon me, Master.
Such words of wisdom...

464
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,625
Rorr, jam-jam bam-bam, twins.

465
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,083
Guess what?

466
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,750
You didn't twist my twins...

467
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,958
but this.

468
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,083
<span style="style.default_1">I was seeking drugs in New York.</span>

469
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,000
<span style="style.default_1">Instead, I found a friend.</span>

470
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,333
Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
They call me Kamli.

471
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:21,375
As Sex-spear has said, "What's in a name?"

472
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:24,500
-Who?
-Sex-spear.

473
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,625
William...

474
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,500
-Sir, will you have snakes?
-Snakes?

475
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,083
Snakes. There are lots in the hole.

476
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,125
I'll get it, sir.

477
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,750
<span style="style.default_1">In his accent, snacks were "snakes"</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and hall was "hole".</span>

478
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,041
<span style="style.default_1">He brought back our smiles.</span>

479
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:51,083
<span style="style.default_1">And miraculously,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">his idol got mom out of coma.</span>

480
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,833
Ready, everyone?

481
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,000
Smile.

482
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:15,291
At your film premiere,
I'll sit between father and son.

483
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,375
As you appear on screen, I'll whistle.

484
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:28,125
At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.

485
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,583
Warn Ruby not to be embarrassed.

486
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:38,333
<span style="style.default_1">Mom didn't know Ruby wasn't talking to me.</span>

487
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:44,541
<span style="style.default_1">Mom didn't have much time left.</span>

488
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,333
<span style="style.default_1">I decided</span>

489
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:50,625
<span style="style.default_1">I'd apologize to Ruby's dad</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and ask for her hand.</span>

490
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,083
I love Ruby and I want to...

491
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,916
I've come to apologize.

492
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,125
-I misbehaved that day.
-It's alright, child.

493
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,291
-A tipple often does that.
-No, Daddy.

494
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,041
I wasn't just drunk...
I had also done cocaine.

495
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,833
Let me confess. The next day I did LSD.

496
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:16,458
But I've been clean for a month.

497
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,083
Congratulations!

498
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,250
I'll go meet Ruby.

499
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,291
-Ruby.
-Wait.

500
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,291
Meet her on the 22nd
at Hotel Sun and Sand,

501
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,416
with these flowers.

502
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,833
-What's on the 22nd?
-Wait.

503
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,125
That's for your parents.

504
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:48,375
And that's for you. Write your name.

505
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,291
"Ruby weds..." Who's this Rustom?

506
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:58,375
All this for a 10 rupee bill?
I'll glue it up.

507
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:02,416
I'm glad you tore it. It led us to Rustom!

508
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,750
He's a doctor in New York.
Not a junkie like you.

509
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,375
Daddy, let me meet Ruby--

510
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,416
Then what should I call you? Old fart?

511
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:20,416
Meet Ruby over my dead body.

512
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,375
Fine, I'll wait.

513
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,333
For what?

514
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:25,083
For you to die, old fart!

515
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,916
Rascal! Scoundrel!

516
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,416
Get out!

517
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,541
I'll break your legs, you swine.

518
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,333
<span style="style.default_1">Every addict looks for an excuse</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to start again.</span>

519
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,833
<span style="style.default_1">My excuse was Ruby.</span>

520
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,375
<span style="style.default_1">Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let's rendezvous</span>

521
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,375
<span style="style.default_1">To have you back</span>

522
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:13,708
<span style="style.default_1">Your old man I'll hack</span>

523
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,666
<span style="style.default_1">It's a win-win!</span>

524
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,708
<span style="style.default_1">He gets heaven, I get you</span>

525
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,083
<span style="style.default_1">The world has no heart</span>

526
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:34,791
<span style="style.default_1">So leave it, old fart</span>

527
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,166
<span style="style.default_1">Goodbye, old man! Just die, old man!</span>

528
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:44,750
<span style="style.default_1">Your daughter, don't worry</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Once you're dead, we'll marry</span>

529
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:49,291
<span style="style.default_1">The sincerest prayers are always granted.</span>

530
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,916
<span style="style.default_1">The old man died</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of a massive heart attack.</span>

531
00:42:55,083 --> 00:43:00,583
<span style="style.default_1">The news was tragic. But I won't lie,</span>

532
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,833
<span style="style.default_1">I was ecstatic.</span>

533
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:08,625
<span style="style.default_1">Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Get set to rendezvous</span>

534
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,916
<span style="style.default_1">Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You and I, we'll rendezvous</span>

535
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,875
<span style="style.default_1">This was my chance to win back Ruby.</span>

536
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:36,041
<span style="style.default_1">I had to show her,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was more reliable than her fiancé.</span>

537
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,458
<span style="style.default_1">A minor problem... I was stoned.</span>

538
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:45,125
Papa!

539
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,708
Don't abandon us, Papa.

540
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,333
-Sanju, that's not papa.
-Wake up.

541
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,000
That's not papa!

542
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,958
Ha! I wondered how he'd shrunk so much.

543
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,333
Is this our papa?

544
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,583
Papa!

545
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,375
Why did you abandon us?

546
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,458
Wake up. Try!

547
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,375
He isn't waking up.

548
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,041
Mummy, don't cry.

549
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,500
Your son-in-law is with you.

550
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,708
Have you read the Holy Gita?

551
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,416
"Everything happens for the best."
Superb!

552
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,916
"Nothing we create...

553
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,208
so nothing should we mourn."

554
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:47,083
Did you create this old man?
Gave him birth?

555
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,708
Let her grieve.

556
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,583
When my puppy died, I was bawling.

557
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:00,458
A full-grown husband's exit
deserves howling.

558
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:02,125
Take your time, Mummy.

559
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:06,416
But remember, only the body perishes.

560
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,250
The soul is eternal.

561
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,041
Away with this body.

562
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,291
Focus on the soul.

563
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:18,291
Papa conked and you say, "All okay?"

564
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,458
How shall we dispose the body?

565
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,791
Bury it? Cremate it?

566
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,416
God, that's not our papa.

567
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,416
Move that body. It's freaking confusing.

568
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Move it.

569
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,875
So, Ruby...

570
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,958
What did I do?

571
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:49,416
No one can tell it's secondhand.

572
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,291
A very fair price.

573
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,583
Five hundred dollars.

574
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,000
What's this?

575
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,083
Robbed a beggar?

576
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:02,000
Robbed a barber! He cuts his own hair.

577
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,166
Puts three dollars in the piggy bank.

578
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:08,375
-Who's gonna count this?
-Call from India. It's Sanju!

579
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,541
Awesome!

580
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:18,208
Sanju, perfect timing.
I'm buying my first car.

581
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,166
I need you here, bro.

582
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,916
Ruby's getting married.

583
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,250
<span style="style.default_1">Please come.</span>

584
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,791
-You snorting again?
-No. I swear.

585
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,375
Please... come down.

586
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,625
Sanju... Hello?

587
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,166
Sir, no need to count.

588
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,708
-The car will have to wait.
-Why?

589
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:47,083
Need to buy a ticket to India.

590
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:50,958
Sorry, sir.

591
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,125
Didn't want the car? Why make me count?

592
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:02,958
Hello, Ruby.

593
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,291
I'm Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
Sanju's friend.

594
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,041
Sir, can you go inside?

595
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,416
Take a loo break.

596
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,208
-Need to discuss a private matter.
-Come.

597
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,750
Whatever the matter,
say it in front of me.

598
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,250
It'll upset you.

599
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,541
Take a stroll outside. Lovely weather.

600
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,000
Really?

601
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,750
Then name Ruby's favorite animal.

602
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,041
You live in New York?

603
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:51,166
Ask any jeweler there...

604
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,583
They'll all say... "Penguin".

605
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,458
-Know why?
-Why?

606
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:00,166
For a month, Sanju hopped
from jeweler to jeweler

607
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:04,291
for a wedding necklace
with a penguin pendant.

608
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,375
And finally got it!

609
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,375
But when he returned to India,

610
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,083
he discovered that you were engaged.

611
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:15,083
He was shattered, so took to drugs again.

612
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,416
But yesterday, he braved up.

613
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,708
Flushed all the drugs down the drain.

614
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:22,541
Swore never to touch them again.

615
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:25,375
He prayed, "Lord, bring Ruby back."

616
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,083
Sanju's back.

617
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:29,791
Can you come back?

618
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,208
The wedding date, venue... it's all set.

619
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,541
Nothing changes, except the groom.

620
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,541
The wedding cards have been printed.

621
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,750
We'll put a "Sanju" sticker
over your name.

622
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,375
Don't sweat the small stuff.

623
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,750
Ruby, in America
there'll be no house help.

624
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,208
You'll be cleaning, mopping, washing...

625
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,916
Imagine washing his sweaty underpants!

626
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,166
I told you, you'd be upset.

627
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,083
Sanju will be at the Marriage Registrar's,
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

628
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,666
Mister, what's her favorite food?

629
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,416
Waffles. Sanju knows.

630
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,625
Her favorite film?

631
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,250
<span style="style.default_1">Mary Poppins.</span>

632
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,291
Sanju knows. You have no clue.

633
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,208
Ruby, 4 p.m. tomorrow.

634
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,750
The Marriage Registrar's office.

635
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:57,791
Where did you get money for this?

636
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,250
Your wallet, checks... They're with me.

637
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,291
The wedding necklace...

638
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,500
What about it?

639
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,083
I sold it to God.

640
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,875
-Where's he?
-He isn't home.

641
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:25,833
<span style="style.default_1">Woo-hoo!</span>

642
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,166
I wait at the Registrar's office
and you get stoned here?

643
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,416
No sweat. We'll marry tomorrow.

644
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:54,791
You'd flushed the drugs!
Fished them out again?

645
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,083
Where's the wedding necklace?

646
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,291
Where is it?

647
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:10,083
Where's the bloody necklace?

648
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,708
The wedding necklace.

649
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:48,250
Please wait, Ruby.

650
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,375
I'm sorry...

651
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,166
Yuck.

652
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:58,083
He's not in his senses.
Won't remember a thing tomorrow!

653
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,708
I swear, he did buy the wedding necklace.

654
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,291
He's too far gone

655
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,208
and to expect you'll hang on is not right.

656
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:14,083
You move on, I'm with him.

657
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,875
Kamlesh.

658
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,208
Yes, Ruby.

659
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,458
Don't ever tell him what he did.

660
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,708
He'll be devastated.

661
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,333
Tell him...

662
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:36,916
that rotten Ruby never showed up.

663
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,416
You've been drinking?

664
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:02,375
What I wanna say needs courage.

665
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,791
So I downed a couple.

666
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,916
Tell me.

667
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:12,625
Your son will die before your wife!

668
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,291
-He can't handle his life.
-Why?

669
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:20,041
He sees you nursing your ailing wife.

670
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,375
Any responsibility at home,
film industry, society...

671
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,333
he sees you never shirk it.

672
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,000
And your son...

673
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,875
He's an ordinary guy.

674
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,291
No goals, no purpose in life.

675
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:45,041
He says,
"There are three things to life, bro."

676
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:49,333
"C, B, S."

677
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:53,458
"Chew, brew and scr..."

678
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,833
The problem is, you want him to be you!

679
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,916
He's buried...

680
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:09,708
buried under the weight of your legacy!

681
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,125
He knows, however hard he toils,
he can never be as great.

682
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:17,083
So, he doesn't even try.

683
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:22,125
Feels a hero with nobodies like me.

684
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:25,750
"Yo, Kamli...", "Hey, Kamli..."

685
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:32,666
What should I do, Kamlesh?

686
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,291
Sir, you...

687
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,833
Just be his friend.

688
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,833
Sit with him.

689
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,666
Drink with him.

690
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,416
Use a few cuss words, and say...

691
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,291
"Sonny, it's okay to be ordinary."

692
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:54,958
"You don't have to be Sunil Dutt."

693
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,833
"It's okay to be Sanjay Dutt.”

694
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,916
Sir, please save him.

695
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,833
If he dies,

696
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:08,708
whom will I tell, "Let go my twins"?

697
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,416
Please, sir, save him.

698
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:19,000
Save him.

699
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:41,291
I showed the distributors your film.

700
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:46,458
They went crazy...
"What a freaking actor!"

701
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,791
Has mom seen the posters?

702
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,916
She's in hospital.

703
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:57,375
What happened?

704
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:01,083
She slipped into a coma again.

705
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:04,916
-I just met her yesterday!
-No, day before.

706
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,833
You've woken up after two days. It's okay.

707
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,958
I've spoken to the doctors.

708
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:18,166
They recommend a rehab center in America.

709
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,375
Ready?

710
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,125
No!

711
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,875
Please don't send me there, Dad.

712
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,750
Just a few days, sonny.

713
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,416
No.

714
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,125
Come out. We won't send you anywhere.

715
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:37,041
I had one cigarette, you packed me off
to boarding school.

716
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:39,958
I was just six.
Couldn't even tie my shoelaces.

717
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,333
I missed mom.

718
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,166
Please come out.

719
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:47,208
I won't go anywhere.

720
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
I'll stay with mom in the hospital!

721
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dad agreed... on one condition.</span>

722
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:01,416
<span style="style.default_1">That I wouldn't do drugs in the hospital.</span>

723
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,125
<span style="style.default_1">And I promised.</span>

724
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,166
<span style="style.default_1">I started spending</span>
<span style="style.default_1">every night at the hospital.</span>

725
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,291
<span style="style.default_1">I'd stare at mom for hours.</span>

726
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,083
<span style="style.default_1">I'd hold her hand and talk to her.</span>

727
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,500
The premiere's next week.

728
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,000
Won't you come?

729
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,458
Get up, Mom.

730
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,625
You gotta see me act.

731
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,916
You'll be proud, Mom.

732
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,958
Mom.

733
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,666
<span style="style.default_1">Then one day...</span>

734
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,250
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't resist.</span>

735
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,375
<span style="style.default_1">Sanju...</span>

736
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,666
<span style="style.default_1">Mom never saw my film.</span>

737
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:02,083
<span style="style.default_1">She died three days before the premiere.</span>

738
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,000
<span style="style.default_1">She'd left a note...</span>

739
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,000
<span style="style.default_1">"Even if I'm gone, the show must go on."</span>

740
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:20,041
<span style="style.default_1">They call me Rocky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my name is Rocky!</span>

741
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:28,041
<span style="style.default_1">Friend and foe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To both I say hello</span>

742
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:35,500
<span style="style.default_1">Friend and foe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To both I say hello</span>

743
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,666
<span style="style.default_1">They call me Rocky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, my name is Rocky!</span>

744
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,250
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

745
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:51,708
Excuse me, Mr. Dutt.
Is anyone sitting here?

746
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,500
Yes... my wife.

747
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,625
<span style="style.default_1">Sanju, you'll be a film star!</span>

748
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dad worries a lot about you.</span>

749
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:28,000
<span style="style.default_1">I've been offered a Hollywood film.</span>

750
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,916
<span style="style.default_1">At your wedding, I'll dance on the table.</span>

751
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:37,333
Sanju.

752
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,125
What happened?

753
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,958
Mom opened her eyes before she died.

754
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:55,208
She touched my head to bless me.

755
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:02,416
Not sure if it happened
or I was hallucinating...

756
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:04,875
I'm a mess, Dad.

757
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:08,333
I can't tell what's real
and what's imaginary.

758
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,958
Are you real, Dad?

759
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,750
Buddy, listen.

760
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,750
Is that Mr. Sunil Dutt?

761
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,916
-Is dad there?
-Yes.

762
01:01:23,916 --> 01:01:25,208
Please save me, Dad.

763
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,541
I want to quit drugs.

764
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,166
I want to live.

765
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,500
You'll be fine, sonny.

766
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,958
<span style="style.default_1">Dad got me to America for treatment.</span>

767
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:51,875
<span style="style.default_1">I was given a list.</span>

768
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,958
<span style="style.default_1">He was shocked that I was still alive.</span>

769
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,041
<span style="style.default_1">My treatment started.</span>

770
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,416
<span style="style.default_1">As the drugs stopped, my body rebelled.</span>

771
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:20,666
<span style="style.default_1">A storm unleashed within.</span>

772
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,791
<span style="style.default_1">Often I shivered as if inside an ice slab.</span>

773
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,041
<span style="style.default_1">Biting cold I couldn't bear.</span>

774
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,083
<span style="style.default_1">Often my body was ablaze.</span>

775
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,750
<span style="style.default_1">I was burning.</span>

776
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,916
<span style="style.default_1">Bombs exploded in my head.</span>

777
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,750
<span style="style.default_1">My pulse would spike up to 150.</span>

778
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,916
<span style="style.default_1">My hands would tremor.</span>

779
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,666
<span style="style.default_1">Depression, anxiety... I couldn't bear it.</span>

780
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,625
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't take it. I ran away.</span>

781
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,833
<span style="style.default_1">I was desperate for drugs.</span>

782
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,958
<span style="style.default_1">The only person who'd lend me money</span>

783
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,375
<span style="style.default_1">was 1500 miles away, in New York.</span>

784
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:42,250
<span style="style.default_1">Like a madman,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I took off for New York... on foot.</span>

785
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,125
<span style="style.default_1">I realized the power of attire.</span>

786
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,583
<span style="style.default_1">When the clothes were clean, I got rides.</span>

787
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:23,416
<span style="style.default_1">When dirty, I got alms.</span>

788
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,458
<span style="style.default_1">Both served well.</span>

789
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,500
<span style="style.default_1">A few days of begging</span>
<span style="style.default_1">earned me a bus ticket.</span>

790
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,791
<span style="style.default_1">In 12 days, I was in New York.</span>

791
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,708
I'll have one drink and go back.

792
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,791
Never had a drink with you.

793
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,375
Just one and I'll go away.

794
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,583
When your mom was in hospital,

795
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:52,250
she'd send these recordings.

796
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,208
Ever listened to them?

797
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:03,166
<span style="style.default_1">Silly piglet, how are you?</span>

798
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:07,833
<span style="style.default_1">Remember, when angry,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'd call you "piglet"?</span>

799
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:12,708
<span style="style.default_1">And you'd say, "Why are you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">calling your husband names?"</span>

800
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:16,333
<span style="style.default_1">"If I'm a piglet, my father's the swine!"</span>

801
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:20,583
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, Sanju. This is Mr. Swine.</span>

802
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,750
<span style="style.default_1">-Working hard?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-Don't worry about me.</span>

803
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,541
<span style="style.default_1">I won't die before I see your film.</span>

804
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:29,500
<span style="style.default_1">I'm by your side. Steadfast!</span>

805
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,375
<span style="style.default_1">Like a Master said,</span>

806
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:35,416
<span style="style.default_1">Wherever you go</span>

807
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,625
<span style="style.default_1">My shadow will follow</span>

808
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,833
<span style="style.default_1">Tell him your theory of the Masters.</span>

809
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,541
<span style="style.default_1">Before the movies, I was a radio jockey.</span>

810
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:51,208
<span style="style.default_1">I encountered thousands of songs</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with beautiful, deep verses.</span>

811
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,875
<span style="style.default_1">I accepted those songwriters</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as my Masters.</span>

812
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:58,333
<span style="style.default_1">When in trouble, I say,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"Guide me, O Master."</span>

813
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:01,000
<span style="style.default_1">And a song comes to rescue.</span>

814
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,625
<span style="style.default_1">So which Master can help Sanju?</span>

815
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,750
Majrooh Sultanpuri.

816
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:09,708
<span style="style.default_1">Presenting from Sloan Hospital...</span>

817
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:11,833
<span style="style.default_1">Water, please.</span>

818
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,791
Dad, it's the tape.

819
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:21,250
<span style="style.default_1">Here's some water. Please rest.</span>

820
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,333
<span style="style.default_1">What about the song?</span>

821
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:27,125
<span style="style.default_1">Tomorrow, I promise! Rest now.</span>

822
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,916
Which song was it, Dad?

823
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,333
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you ever stop</span>

824
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,333
<span style="style.default_1">With your head hung in despair</span>

825
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,583
<span style="style.default_1">After this woeful walk over thorns</span>

826
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:48,791
<span style="style.default_1">You will enjoy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The embrace of blossoms</span>

827
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:52,750
<span style="style.default_1">Wanderer,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">O wanderer</span>

828
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,041
<span style="style.default_1">O Wanderer</span>

829
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:10,083
<span style="style.default_1">Break every shackle</span>

830
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:19,166
<span style="style.default_1">Smith each into</span>

831
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,458
<span style="style.default_1">A sword</span>

832
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:31,708
<span style="style.default_1">Fight every battle</span>

833
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:37,916
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

834
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,083
<span style="style.default_1">You may be shattered</span>

835
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,458
<span style="style.default_1">Show them you ain't battered</span>

836
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:59,625
<span style="style.default_1">Hope still simmers in your soul!</span>

837
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">When your spirit you wield</span>

838
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,708
<span style="style.default_1">The heavens will yield</span>

839
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,916
<span style="style.default_1">Lead you unfettered to your goal</span>

840
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:14,625
<span style="style.default_1">If by miseries you're hunted</span>

841
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,500
<span style="style.default_1">If your weapons are blunted</span>

842
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:22,625
<span style="style.default_1">Stop failure's advances</span>
<span style="style.default_1">With those broken lances</span>

843
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:25,000
<span style="style.default_1">Climb every mountain</span>

844
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,166
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

845
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:31,333
<span style="style.default_1">Strive, do not bow down</span>

846
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:34,000
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

847
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:36,625
<span style="style.default_1">Climb every mountain</span>

848
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,458
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

849
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,875
<span style="style.default_1">Strive, do not bow down</span>

850
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

851
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">Take by the scruff of the neck</span>

852
01:10:05,458 --> 01:10:08,583
<span style="style.default_1">The dark clouds of misery</span>

853
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:13,208
<span style="style.default_1">Rattle them till they reveal</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The abode of Victory</span>

854
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:16,791
<span style="style.default_1">With the stars you'll be crowned</span>

855
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,958
<span style="style.default_1">The sky, your playground</span>

856
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:25,000
<span style="style.default_1">Break away from the herd</span>

857
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:30,583
<span style="style.default_1">Fortune will be yours</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That so far frowned</span>

858
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:35,416
<span style="style.default_1">Stop failure's advances</span>
<span style="style.default_1">With those broken lances</span>

859
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,416
<span style="style.default_1">Climb every mountain</span>

860
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:44,333
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

861
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,041
<span style="style.default_1">Strive, do not bow down</span>

862
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:50,125
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

863
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,833
<span style="style.default_1">Climb every mountain</span>

864
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,708
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

865
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:58,916
<span style="style.default_1">Strive, do not bow down</span>

866
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:01,541
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

867
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:07,125
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

868
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:13,333
<span style="style.default_1">Attain what you seek!</span>

869
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:25,666
<span style="style.default_1">Fight every battle</span>

870
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:32,166
<span style="style.default_1">Conquer every peak</span>

871
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,375
He's off drugs for 18 months.

872
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,916
Wear sunglasses,
our boy is glowing like a floodlight.

873
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:50,125
As your Sex-spear says,
"All's well that ends well."

874
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,750
Take the bags. The taximeter's on.

875
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:56,833
Hurry up.

876
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,000
It's not "the end" yet.

877
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,208
<span style="style.default_1">The doctor warned, he could relapse.</span>

878
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:05,458
If he starts again, he'll die.

879
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,833
Please keep him away from bad company.

880
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:10,791
Thank you, son.

881
01:12:28,666 --> 01:12:32,333
Dad, you carry on. I'll join you.

882
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,250
For how long can we stop him?

883
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:44,708
Now he must fight his own battles.
Let's go.

884
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,083
I thought you wouldn't meet me.

885
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,375
How could I not?

886
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:53,000
I thought of you every day
the past 18 months.

887
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,541
I have a special welcome-back gift.

888
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,041
Haven't seen such fine stuff in 18 years.

889
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,125
Just to celebrate your return.

890
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:09,750
Normally, I don't share
such exclusive stuff with anyone.

891
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,833
To your health.

892
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,250
Bro, that's my dose. It's potent.

893
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,000
Too strong for you.

894
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,958
Doesn't such potent stuff
ruin your health?

895
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,708
Your parents must've
gifted you strong genes.

896
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,333
How are they?

897
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:33,666
They're fine... by the grace of God.

898
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,416
Amazing!
They're reborn after the car crash?

899
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,833
Glucose powder suits me fine.

900
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:49,875
Now try that!

901
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,375
I cracked it!

902
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:02,750
You took glucose and fed me drugs.

903
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:06,750
You aren't an addict, you're a peddler!

904
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,458
Posed as a friend for my money.

905
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:16,000
Bro, I'll return your money.

906
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,833
Great idea!

907
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:21,166
Return those five years
which I was too numb to feel.

908
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:27,000
My father hasn't slept in five years.
Return that lost sleep.

909
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,333
I lost Ruby. Can you get her back?

910
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,666
My sisters stopped smiling.
Return that smile.

911
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,916
Can you? You peddler!

912
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,250
My real gods.

913
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,125
And one more.

914
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:15,416
Lord Ganesha, MD.

915
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,250
He's lived with me in prison, too.

916
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,416
You're crying?

917
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,083
Was the story so bad?

918
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:31,875
Will you write it?

919
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,000
We'll continue then.

920
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,458
Winnie, do you have a boyfriend?

921
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:56,125
-Yes. Why?
-Tell him, he's very lucky.

922
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:58,750
'Cause I'm intelligent and good looking?

923
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:02,458
-'Cause I'm going to prison.
-Stop it.

924
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,666
When he's happy he blabbers.

925
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,583
So, you met the terrorist.

926
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:33,375
Also figured why you're
desperate to stop me.

927
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:37,708
Once a drug-peddler, now a big builder.

928
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,208
Even his lies seem true.

929
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:49,458
Ask him why his best friend, Kamlesh,
hasn't spoken to him in 20 years.

930
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:52,083
Ask him.

931
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,083
I'm writing a book
on your friend, Sanjay Dutt.

932
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,291
He's not my friend.

933
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:35,458
But he says, "Kamli is my best friend."

934
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:38,708
In a past life.

935
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:46,291
Then in this life, why are you
glued to the TV watching his news?

936
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,916
-You called from India?
-Right. And you hung up.

937
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:47,166
So, I'm here.

938
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:52,625
Look, I promise, I won't even
mention you in the book.

939
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:58,833
-Shall we sit somewhere?
-Sure.

940
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:01,916
I know a great place.

941
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:05,833
Where?

942
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:10,208
Follow Aunt Annie.

943
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,708
Remember this place?

944
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:46,375
He loves you. Why did you cut off ties?

945
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,541
Do you know what RDX is?

946
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,041
It was used in the Mumbai bomb blasts.

947
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,875
And where was it stored?

948
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:00,875
In a truck parked at Sanjay Dutt's house.

949
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,916
He knew Mumbai would be bombed,
but kept mum.

950
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,291
-Who told you?
-The man who loved him the most.

951
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:09,708
Who?

952
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,125
Sunil Dutt... his father.

953
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,375
Tell me your side of the story.

954
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,541
If he's a terrorist, I'll scrap the book.

955
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:42,583
I flew 12000 km just to meet you.

956
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:45,625
And I wasted 12 years of my life with him.

957
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,208
No more time for him.

958
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,375
He's the one with no time.
He's off to prison.

959
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,250
Know what he's taking along?

960
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:06,791
This story has four characters.

961
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,750
Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt,

962
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,583
I, and the Babri mosque.

963
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Babri mosque was demolished
on 6th December, 1992.

964
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,291
Riots burned the country.

965
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:23,541
<span style="style.default_1">Mr. Dutt was then a Member of Parliament.</span>

966
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,125
<span style="style.default_1">He'd stopped making films.</span>

967
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,375
<span style="style.default_1">All his time was spent serving people.</span>

968
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,291
<span style="style.default_1">When riots erupted in his constituency</span>

969
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:34,083
<span style="style.default_1">and Muslim homes were burnt,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he plunged into relief work.</span>

970
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:38,125
<span style="style.default_1">And his son, unconcerned,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">lived in his own world.</span>

971
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:50,583
<span style="style.default_1">He was no longer the drug-addict.</span>

972
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:55,000
<span style="style.default_1">He reigned as an A-list film star</span>
<span style="style.default_1">those 12 years.</span>

973
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:58,458
<span style="style.default_1">As for me... my IT business</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was prospering.</span>

974
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,541
<span style="style.default_1">I made tons of money.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But had one grouse...</span>

975
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:03,833
<span style="style.default_1">I was still a virgin.</span>

976
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:07,208
<span style="style.default_1">Then I met a girl, Pinky.</span>

977
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:12,958
<span style="style.default_1">I flew every weekend to Mumbai,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">hoping to get lucky.</span>

978
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,875
<span style="style.default_1">The result... I was jetlagged 24/7.</span>

979
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,791
Still on the runway? Not taken off?

980
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,958
Sir, we've landed.

981
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:24,875
Landed?

982
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,791
<span style="style.default_1">This time, Sanju had</span>
<span style="style.default_1">invited Pinky for dinner.</span>

983
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,500
<span style="style.default_1">The mission was to make sure I score.</span>

984
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,750
Pinky loves pink.

985
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,333
She asked for a pink t-shirt.

986
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,833
So you bought the store?

987
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:45,791
Superb!

988
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,333
Control... You're drinking too much.

989
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,958
Need courage to open my account.

990
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,541
Account! Which bank?

991
01:22:56,666 --> 01:23:00,666
My aunt's cousin is a banker.
You'll be done in a jiffy.

992
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,708
-You need an account, too?
-No, I have many accounts.

993
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,500
What's all this?

994
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,666
All for you.

995
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,916
This pink t-shirt, sweater,

996
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,916
lin-jer-ree...

997
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:32,333
This pink nightie, just for you! Try it.

998
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:37,541
No, I'll stick to the t-shirt.

999
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,458
One moment.

1000
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,666
Do you know why
nighties are called nighties?

1001
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,416
Why?

1002
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:53,625
'Cause they are worn at night.

1003
01:23:55,166 --> 01:24:00,125
Scriptures say,
hour and attire must match.

1004
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,083
I've got her in the nightie.

1005
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,958
-Your job is to get her out of it.
-Done!

1006
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:26,416
Don't overdrink,
or there'll be no bam-bam.

1007
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:31,125
I'm out of here. Freshen up.

1008
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:32,416
I'll change, too.

1009
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:00,833
<span style="style.default_1">On a journey to the moon</span>

1010
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:06,083
<span style="style.default_1">Let's dance, let's swoon</span>

1011
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:10,750
<span style="style.default_1">It's one night's delight</span>

1012
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,916
<span style="style.default_1">Then our paths will divide</span>

1013
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:20,375
<span style="style.default_1">On a journey to the moon</span>

1014
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:25,250
<span style="style.default_1">Let's dance, let's swoon</span>

1015
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,833
<span style="style.default_1">Just one night's delight</span>

1016
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:34,500
<span style="style.default_1">Come, set me alight</span>

1017
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,375
Kamli...

1018
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,375
Kamli, wake up.

1019
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:45,666
Get up.

1020
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,958
Time for bam-bam.

1021
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,541
Wake up. You're a tiger.

1022
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,958
Roar!

1023
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,291
Come on.

1024
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:14,458
<span style="style.default_1">You are no saint</span>

1025
01:26:14,791 --> 01:26:18,833
<span style="style.default_1">Nor am I</span>

1026
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:24,208
<span style="style.default_1">It's one night's delight</span>

1027
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,625
<span style="style.default_1">Let's not be uptight</span>

1028
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:36,916
<span style="style.default_1">On a journey to the moon</span>

1029
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:42,000
<span style="style.default_1">Let's dance, let's swoon</span>

1030
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:46,791
<span style="style.default_1">Just one night's delight</span>

1031
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:51,291
<span style="style.default_1">Come, set me alight</span>

1032
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,708
Baby, you ready?

1033
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:10,333
Have breakfast, Kamli.

1034
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:13,291
-You're meeting some girls today.
-I have a girlfriend.

1035
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,291
Forget her. She's a floozy.

1036
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,541
-Shush... she'll hear you.
-She's gone.

1037
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,666
You were very irresponsible last night!

1038
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:25,625
You passed out and I had to bam-bam...

1039
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:28,458
and then wrap up your pink store.

1040
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:32,416
Chill, I'll set it up
for the next attempt.

1041
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,291
Tell me you're lying.

1042
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:40,041
I was checking her loyalty towards you.

1043
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,833
I held her hand,
she rubbed it with her thumb.

1044
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,875
That's all she does.

1045
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:50,458
Never goes further.

1046
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,125
With me, she went further, bro.

1047
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,500
I said, "Nightie."

1048
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,666
She took it off?

1049
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:09,166
It was clear,
she can't be my sister-in-law.

1050
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,875
No one cheats on my best friend!

1051
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:16,125
It was guilt-free bam-bam.
What's her name?

1052
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,625
You slept with her
and don't know her name?

1053
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,875
Name after the game? Bad manners!

1054
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,083
You swine!

1055
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,666
I've unveiled her true colors.

1056
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,458
You should be grateful.

1057
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,875
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, Sanju.</span>

1058
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,875
<span style="style.default_1">Your pop's buddying up to the Muslims.</span>

1059
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,333
-Drill sense into him.
-Who the hell...?

1060
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">You half-Muslim!</span>

1061
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:44,291
<span style="style.default_1">Your sister is sizzling hot.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Shall I get her raped?</span>

1062
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,458
Hey!

1063
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:50,541
<span style="style.default_1">It's a stone. Could've been a grenade.</span>

1064
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:54,500
<span style="style.default_1">Your pop's loading trucks</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with relief material, right?</span>

1065
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:59,166
<span style="style.default_1">-I'll bump him off.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-Hello!</span>

1066
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:17,083
-Let's get out of here.
-We've got a threat call.

1067
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:20,125
You wake up late. I've already got five.

1068
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,208
Barking dogs seldom bite.

1069
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:24,541
Out here you can be shot.

1070
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,708
We'll shield him.

1071
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:28,083
We'll take the bullet.

1072
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:32,083
We'll defend Mr. Dutt
till our last breath.

1073
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:34,166
With that toy? Does it even work?

1074
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,083
Yes, it does.

1075
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:44,625
When did you last fire it? World War II?

1076
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:46,500
Stop it, Sanju.

1077
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:48,375
Hurry, load the truck.

1078
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:50,958
Reason with dad. He never listens to me.

1079
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:54,208
Look at him, and then at yourself.

1080
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,833
He helps strangers.

1081
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:59,166
While you bam-bam your best friend's girl.

1082
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,500
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, Kamli, remember the strip club?</span>

1083
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,916
I lost out on a chick for your jacket.

1084
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:31,875
<span style="style.default_1">Remember, you owed me a blonde.</span>

1085
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:34,833
Let's say Pinky is the blonde,
and we're square!

1086
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:38,083
<span style="style.default_1">I'm in New York on the 22nd.</span>

1087
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,083
I'll wait outside the same club.

1088
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:43,000
Wear that red jacket

1089
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:45,958
<span style="style.default_1">and I'll know you've forgiven me.</span>

1090
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,666
Kamli, please forgive me.

1091
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,500
Kamli...

1092
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:04,041
<span style="style.default_1">They say, "Life is what happens</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when you're making other plans."</span>

1093
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:09,041
<span style="style.default_1">While he was planning his trip,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">life had other plans.</span>

1094
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:32,625
<span style="style.default_1">Twelve bombs exploded that day.</span>

1095
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:35,666
<span style="style.default_1">250 people died. 800 were injured.</span>

1096
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,250
<span style="style.default_1">Police investigations revealed a name...</span>

1097
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,000
<span style="style.default_1">Tiger Memon.</span>

1098
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,166
<span style="style.default_1">In the riots following</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the Babri mosque demolition,</span>

1099
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:46,750
<span style="style.default_1">Tiger Memon's office was burnt down.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He struck back.</span>

1100
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">As the truth unfolded, many were arrested.</span>

1101
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,000
Kamlesh, read the news?

1102
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:58,250
No. Why?

1103
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,708
Your friend was involved
in the Bombay bomb blasts.

1104
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:02,875
He's been arrested.

1105
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:05,333
He had an AK-56 rifle.

1106
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:12,291
Did you possess an AK-56 rifle?

1107
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:13,666
No, sir.

1108
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:25,666
Did you possess an AK-56?

1109
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,333
I'll tell you, sir.

1110
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,625
I'll tell you everything...

1111
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:32,000
but please don't tell dad.

1112
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,958
-Babu?
-Kamli.

1113
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:49,875
I knew you'd come.

1114
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,541
I'm glad.

1115
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:56,125
Sir, I'm sure the AK-56 charges are bogus.

1116
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,166
-Here's Sanju's confession.
-Read it.

1117
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,458
Dad would send relief material
to riot victims.

1118
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:17,416
Majority of them were Muslims.

1119
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,458
Some people didn't approve.

1120
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,875
They thought dad was pro-Muslim.

1121
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:27,125
That's when the threats started...

1122
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:31,375
to murder us and rape my sisters.

1123
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,500
I was terrified.

1124
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:37,708
Then there were two attacks on dad.

1125
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:40,750
I requested special protection,
but was denied.

1126
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,500
I feared a mob attack any time.

1127
01:33:45,958 --> 01:33:49,125
Hanif and Samir, producers of my film...

1128
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:54,125
suggested I keep... an assault rifle,
for protection.

1129
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:08,208
<span style="style.default_1">In January, Samir, Hanif,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and Salem came home.</span>

1130
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:40,000
<span style="style.default_1">They gave me three rifles</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and some bullets,</span>

1131
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:42,208
<span style="style.default_1">which I kept in my car.</span>

1132
01:34:45,541 --> 01:34:47,125
<span style="style.default_1">Soon, I panicked.</span>

1133
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:52,625
I'll keep only one rifle
till the riots end.

1134
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,875
Please take away the rest.

1135
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,083
<span style="style.default_1">They came back two days later.</span>

1136
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:02,291
<span style="style.default_1">I returned two rifles.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Kept one rifle and 250 bullets.</span>

1137
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:07,708
<span style="style.default_1">On 2nd April, I went to Mauritius</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for a film shoot.</span>

1138
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">I got news of Hanif and Samir's arrest.</span>

1139
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,625
<span style="style.default_1">I feared they'd rat me out.</span>

1140
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:18,625
<span style="style.default_1">I called my friend, Yusuf Nulwala.</span>

1141
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:22,500
Yusuf, go to my house.

1142
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:25,250
<span style="style.default_1">Go to my room.</span>

1143
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:28,000
<span style="style.default_1">You'll find a black bag.</span>

1144
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:33,125
<span style="style.default_1">There's some stuff in it.</span>

1145
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:35,083
<span style="style.default_1">Destroy it.</span>

1146
01:35:50,041 --> 01:35:51,541
<span style="style.default_1">Then one day, dad called.</span>

1147
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:56,125
The papers say,
you possess an AK-56 rifle.

1148
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,333
AK-56? No, Dad!

1149
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:01,083
I've got you a meeting
with the Police Commissioner.

1150
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,333
Come to Bombay.

1151
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:06,875
<span style="style.default_1">Dad informed the cops about my arrival,</span>

1152
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:11,125
<span style="style.default_1">and assured them he'll get me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the police station.</span>

1153
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,541
<span style="style.default_1">But...</span>

1154
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:17,833
Mr. Sanjay Dutt.

1155
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,833
Deliver the luggage to his father.

1156
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,083
Come with me.

1157
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,083
-What's the problem, officer?
-Come.

1158
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:34,666
Sir, what happened?

1159
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,750
Get in.

1160
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:51,708
Last time, we won the fight against drugs.

1161
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:57,750
But this time...
the battle will be tougher.

1162
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:02,875
-I'll need you, son.
-I'm not going anywhere, sir.

1163
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:06,083
The "snakes" are in the "hole."

1164
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:07,791
Grab a bite.

1165
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,041
Sleep in Sanju's room.

1166
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:13,875
I'll be here for a while.

1167
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:20,750
Switch off the fan.

1168
01:37:21,375 --> 01:37:23,000
Sir, it's hot.

1169
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,583
He sleeps without a fan, too.

1170
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:54,708
<span style="style.default_1">For security reasons,</span>

1171
01:37:54,791 --> 01:38:00,166
<span style="style.default_1">Sanju was kept in isolation</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in a windowless cell.</span>

1172
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:04,208
<span style="style.default_1">His only companions were ants.</span>

1173
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:07,250
It's been seven days, soldiers.

1174
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:09,500
When will I get bail?

1175
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:14,708
Tell me.

1176
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,083
Please...

1177
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,625
Sir, the pot is overflowing.

1178
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,708
Sir.

1179
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:48,291
Please help!

1180
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,166
Help!

1181
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:06,875
<span style="style.default_1">He suffered inside prison</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and his dad, outside.</span>

1182
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,666
Look, the terrorist's pop.

1183
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:33,791
Come.

1184
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,125
Give him a shave.

1185
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,666
You're done.

1186
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,166
Come, wash your face.

1187
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,416
You speak English!

1188
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:52,000
I've done my Masters. Even had a bank job.

1189
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:54,666
How'd you land here?

1190
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:57,000
My wife cheated on me.

1191
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:58,916
I killed her!

1192
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,625
Chopped her into pieces,

1193
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:05,916
stuffed her in a bag
and left it on a long distance train.

1194
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:07,916
A porter saw me,

1195
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:09,833
and here I am.

1196
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:13,291
-I'll skip the shave.
-Why?

1197
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:16,500
Need a beard for my next film.

1198
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:19,750
I'm playing Santa Claus.
He had a big beard.

1199
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:23,583
I've to let it grow.

1200
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,833
Hello! This is Sunil Dutt.

1201
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,583
A moment.

1202
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:31,291
Mr. Dutt.

1203
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:35,125
Sir, the minister's bathing.

1204
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:39,958
Morning, noon and evening?

1205
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,750
He's always in the bath!

1206
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:44,500
Health reasons, sir.

1207
01:40:44,916 --> 01:40:48,750
He has a fungal infection on his thigh.

1208
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:51,791
I'll pass on your message.

1209
01:40:53,916 --> 01:40:55,875
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone avoided Mr. Dutt.</span>

1210
01:40:56,041 --> 01:41:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">Terror charges being stigmatic,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">no one wanted any involvement.</span>

1211
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:07,416
Partner, we've been roomies for 180 days.

1212
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:11,250
That's longer than any girl
I've been with.

1213
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:17,083
Supreme Court will hear
my bail petition today.

1214
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,791
Which means I'm a free bird.

1215
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:26,625
I'll miss you.

1216
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:31,000
-Your bail's been rejected.
-What?

1217
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:34,333
Bail is always tough in the Terror Act.

1218
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,375
Sir...

1219
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,166
Dad, what's up with my bail?

1220
01:42:18,291 --> 01:42:22,208
Don't worry, sonny.
We're going to the Supreme Court.

1221
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,375
You get better.

1222
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:27,166
Why are you lying?

1223
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:32,750
I know my bail's rejected.
I've been in for six months.

1224
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:35,666
You know the Prime Minister...
the President... speak to them.

1225
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,625
What have I done?
Killed anyone? Fire a bullet?

1226
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:42,166
Just kept a gun, for your protection!

1227
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:44,041
My protection?

1228
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:50,541
I'd rather you shot me with that gun!

1229
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:59,000
He'll never appreciate me.

1230
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:05,666
Praises my sisters all the time...
"Ace! Well played!"

1231
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,166
I want to die.

1232
01:43:09,666 --> 01:43:10,500
Please help me.

1233
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,583
There's cyanide in the tea.

1234
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:22,708
Drink up.

1235
01:43:29,166 --> 01:43:30,458
Vodka in the tea?

1236
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:32,875
Now chill! Don't blabber about dying.

1237
01:43:32,958 --> 01:43:34,375
Think of your dad!

1238
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:36,916
He strives from dawn to dusk
for your bail.

1239
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:40,875
Begs lawyers, politicians, cops...

1240
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:44,458
Sleeps on the floor
'cause you have no bed.

1241
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:47,041
Doesn't use the fan
'cause you don't have one.

1242
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:50,875
People call him, "Terrorist's pop."

1243
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:54,916
You've twisted his twins,
now spare him your suicide!

1244
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:57,791
Fight! You'll definitely get bail.

1245
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:08,083
Once out of prison...

1246
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,875
get a sexy girlfriend.

1247
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:15,166
I'll get you drunk and bam-bam her!

1248
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,250
Then, we're even.

1249
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:22,583
"I want to die." Enough! You're a tiger.

1250
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:25,958
"Rorr"... come on.

1251
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,916
"Rorr!"

1252
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:39,166
<span style="style.default_1">He spent 452 days in prison.</span>

1253
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,375
<span style="style.default_1">The Supreme Court finally</span>
<span style="style.default_1">granted him bail.</span>

1254
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,500
<span style="style.default_1">But his name was now</span>
<span style="style.default_1">synonymous with the word...</span>

1255
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:51,166
<span style="style.default_1">The public and the press hated him.</span>

1256
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:55,541
<span style="style.default_1">He was being tried under the Terror Act...</span>

1257
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:58,166
<span style="style.default_1">he feared his bail would be canceled.</span>

1258
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,208
<span style="style.default_1">His only hope was political intervention.</span>

1259
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:06,708
<span style="style.default_1">An influential minister in the capital</span>
<span style="style.default_1">agreed to meet him.</span>

1260
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,000
Hello, sir.

1261
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:12,500
Come... sit.

1262
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,791
How's daddy?

1263
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:16,500
He has a fever.

1264
01:45:16,583 --> 01:45:18,375
Very good...

1265
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,625
What brings you here?

1266
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:23,916
Sir, I'll be honest.

1267
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:26,166
I did possess a gun.

1268
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,416
I should be tried under the Arms Act.

1269
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:32,333
But they've slapped me
with the Terror Act.

1270
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:36,625
If I was involved in the bomb blasts,

1271
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,291
would I return to India?

1272
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,000
I could've run away from Mauritius.

1273
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:43,375
Taken asylum in another country.

1274
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,291
-He's dozed off!
-Speak louder.

1275
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,875
Sir, I got a gun because
I feared a mob attack.

1276
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">If the minister really slept</span>
<span style="style.default_1">or play acted to avoid us</span>

1277
01:46:10,708 --> 01:46:12,625
<span style="style.default_1">is still a mystery.</span>

1278
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:18,666
How's daddy?

1279
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,375
-He has a fever.
-Very good...

1280
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:26,625
What brings you here?

1281
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:31,291
Our legs brought us here...
we'll go back swimming.

1282
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:33,833
Very good...

1283
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:36,291
Let me know if I can help.

1284
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:39,000
<span style="style.default_1">It was evident, we were on our own.</span>

1285
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:42,916
<span style="style.default_1">I decided that until Sanju was cleared</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of terror charges,</span>

1286
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:46,708
<span style="style.default_1">I'd be by his side. But the next day...</span>

1287
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:55,833
Babu, where's Sanju?

1288
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,750
In the preview theatre.

1289
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:10,666
No one goes in. Mr. Dutt's orders.

1290
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:16,833
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1291
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,791
Kamlesh,

1292
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:22,375
please wait outside.

1293
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:39,041
Where are you going?

1294
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:42,333
FBI raided my office.

1295
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:44,083
Why?

1296
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:51,750
What's that got to do with the FBI?

1297
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,750
My company works with
the American government.

1298
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:58,333
Now they'll investigate our association.

1299
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,916
Terror charges freak them out.

1300
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,208
Sorry, buddy.

1301
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,000
I've put you through all this...

1302
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:14,000
-Call me when you get there.
-No... my phone will be tapped.

1303
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:18,208
We must disconnect for a few years.

1304
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:23,958
Don't worry. I understand. Go...

1305
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:27,791
Hey, Kamli. You're a tiger.

1306
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,458
Let's go.

1307
01:48:47,875 --> 01:48:50,250
First time ever I lied to Sanju.

1308
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:52,125
I can be friends with an addict.

1309
01:48:52,916 --> 01:48:58,666
Even with a guy who slept with my girl.
But with a terrorist? I'm no fool!

1310
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:04,166
Every time I drink, I miss him...

1311
01:49:04,791 --> 01:49:06,208
yearn to call him.

1312
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,500
Then I remind myself...

1313
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:13,708
there was a truck full of RDX
at his house.

1314
01:49:13,791 --> 01:49:15,583
He's a bloody terrorist!

1315
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:18,958
Are we done?

1316
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:23,958
<span style="style.default_1">Mail from Winnie.</span>

1317
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,625
Where's she?

1318
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:27,541
America.

1319
01:49:28,916 --> 01:49:30,083
She won't write the book.

1320
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:36,208
<span style="style.default_1">Sanjay Dutt was given 30 days</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to surrender.</span>

1321
01:49:36,375 --> 01:49:37,708
<span style="style.default_1">That time is over.</span>

1322
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:42,125
<span style="style.default_1">He's on his way to prison.</span>

1323
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:43,666
<span style="style.default_1">Clothes off.</span>

1324
01:49:44,666 --> 01:49:45,833
Raise your hands.

1325
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:49,875
Turn.

1326
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:55,041
Bend.

1327
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:58,791
Cough.

1328
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:00,541
Harder.

1329
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,958
You dropped Sanju's story
for a book on museums?

1330
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:49,125
-Museums don't lie.
-Nor did Sanju.

1331
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:53,375
But a news report
became your gospel truth.

1332
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:56,958
What's this?

1333
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:00,916
Prison has a community radio
for prisoners' reform.

1334
01:51:01,333 --> 01:51:03,750
Sanju hosts a show.

1335
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:06,666
He wants you to hear this episode.

1336
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:08,416
Took great pains to smuggle it out.

1337
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,125
My number.

1338
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,458
You'll need it after you're done.

1339
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:33,125
<span style="style.default_1">Howdy, Yerwada!</span>

1340
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:37,750
This is your buddy, Sanju!

1341
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:46,291
Today's topic is "newspapers."

1342
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:50,000
There were no newspapers 400 years ago.

1343
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:52,125
News traveled word of mouth.

1344
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:54,375
<span style="style.default_1">Then, someone printed the first newspaper.</span>

1345
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,833
<span style="style.default_1">Soon, selling news became big business.</span>

1346
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:04,750
Today, India has 105,437
registered publications,

1347
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:08,333
thousands of radio stations,
TV channels and the internet.

1348
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:11,583
And they're in a rat race...

1349
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,625
fighting for readership.

1350
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:18,333
More readers means more money from ads.

1351
01:52:19,416 --> 01:52:23,458
And how do you lure readers?
With the truth?

1352
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:25,750
No.

1353
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:29,416
With news that's spicy!

1354
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:33,416
And how do you do that?

1355
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,875
Easy! With a question mark.

1356
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:44,583
When I was on bail,
these question marks were on my tail.

1357
01:52:44,666 --> 01:52:46,333
SANJU IN A BRAWL?

1358
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:53,083
SANJU SOZZLED?

1359
01:52:56,208 --> 01:52:59,833
<span style="style.default_1">Dad decided to fight back.</span>

1360
01:52:59,916 --> 01:53:02,625
Mr. Dutt, what a surprise!

1361
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:04,750
How many pages does your paper have?

1362
01:53:05,666 --> 01:53:07,625
-Twenty four.
-Cut it down to eight.

1363
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:11,666
Then you won't need
fake news to fill pages.

1364
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:13,666
Please come.

1365
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:20,916
If our reportage bothers you, sue us.

1366
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:24,458
How can I fight you?

1367
01:53:24,541 --> 01:53:26,166
You have James Bond with you.

1368
01:53:27,041 --> 01:53:27,958
James Bond?

1369
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:31,041
James Bond has a license to kill.

1370
01:53:31,333 --> 01:53:34,208
He has legal immunity.

1371
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:37,083
Similarly, you have these question marks.

1372
01:53:37,416 --> 01:53:40,250
In Court, you'll state,
"This isn't confirmed news."

1373
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:43,666
"Just speculation.
Don't miss the question mark."

1374
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:45,500
"According to sources..."

1375
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:50,916
These are your James Bond!

1376
01:53:56,708 --> 01:54:00,916
<span style="style.default_1">Bandu Boss, I'll be there. Tell me when.</span>

1377
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:04,166
<span style="style.default_1">Last day of Ganesha festival.</span>

1378
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,000
<span style="style.default_1">Done.</span>

1379
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:12,833
Your son graces events by gangsters.

1380
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,416
Cops have 60 such phone taps.

1381
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:20,333
He's not focused on work.
His last 12 films tanked.

1382
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:26,416
His bail can be revoked.
In short, he's finished!

1383
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,750
Then state that with conviction.

1384
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:35,083
Put a full stop. Not a question mark.

1385
01:54:49,541 --> 01:54:53,583
Mr. Editor, don't write his obituary yet.

1386
01:54:53,666 --> 01:54:55,583
My son will rise again.

1387
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:59,375
I'll prove you wrong.

1388
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:01,875
I'm around, and so are you.

1389
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:03,250
We'll meet again.

1390
01:55:08,875 --> 01:55:13,916
<span style="style.default_1">A lousy editor writing me off</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was unacceptable to dad.</span>

1391
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:18,625
<span style="style.default_1">He resolved to get my life back on track.</span>

1392
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:23,166
If you hobnob with gangsters,
won't the press hound you?

1393
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,250
Gangster? Who, Dad?

1394
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:28,958
Bandu Boss.

1395
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:32,041
Aren't you attending his event?

1396
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:37,291
What's the option? They're dangerous.

1397
01:55:38,166 --> 01:55:39,375
Don't go.

1398
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:42,833
They'll kill me. They shot Gulshan Kumar.

1399
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:46,000
-Fired at Rakesh Roshan.
-Don't go, sonny.

1400
01:55:46,375 --> 01:55:50,125
If the snoopy press
ensures my safety, I won't go.

1401
01:56:11,333 --> 01:56:12,583
Why are we here, Dad?

1402
01:56:12,666 --> 01:56:15,791
When I was to marry your mom,

1403
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,041
a notorious don... Mastan, got livid.

1404
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:24,625
"Nargis is the pride
of the Muslim community."

1405
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:28,291
"If a Hindu marries her,
we'll slaughter him."

1406
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,875
I called him and said...

1407
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:35,541
"Let's meet and talk."

1408
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:40,500
He agreed. 1 a.m... right here.

1409
01:56:41,916 --> 01:56:44,583
-You came here alone?
-No.

1410
01:56:45,083 --> 01:56:47,000
My Master was with me.

1411
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:49,875
-Which one?
-Sahir Ludhianvi.

1412
01:56:50,458 --> 01:56:53,458
I reached an hour earlier.

1413
01:56:53,875 --> 01:56:57,500
I let Sahir's song
play in my mind on loop.

1414
01:56:58,125 --> 01:57:03,958
When the don arrived,
I said, "I love Nargis deeply."

1415
01:57:04,791 --> 01:57:06,333
"I want to marry her."

1416
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,083
"And I'll keep her happy forever."

1417
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:13,500
"If to love someone is wrong, shoot me."

1418
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:16,916
"If right, give me a hug."

1419
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,958
On our wedding day,

1420
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:21,541
the biggest bouquet...

1421
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:24,041
came from Mastan!

1422
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:29,583
-What song was it, Dad?
-Will you sing it?

1423
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:32,625
Sing along with me.

1424
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,875
<span style="style.default_1">Vicious or vile, let no power</span>

1425
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:41,500
<span style="style.default_1">Ever let you cower</span>

1426
01:57:41,708 --> 01:57:45,000
-Dad, not here.
-Come on, catch the beat.

1427
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,666
<span style="style.default_1">Vicious or vile, let no power</span>

1428
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:52,666
<span style="style.default_1">Ever let you cower</span>

1429
01:57:53,291 --> 01:58:00,291
<span style="style.default_1">Look evil in the eye</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Your head held high</span>

1430
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:07,583
<span style="style.default_1">So what if this be your last breath?</span>

1431
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:15,083
<span style="style.default_1">Rejoice, you never died before your death!</span>

1432
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:30,500
Sonny, go... let Bandu Boss have it.

1433
01:58:30,916 --> 01:58:32,750
He'll never call again.

1434
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:36,583
<span style="style.default_1">Break</span>

1435
01:58:36,666 --> 01:58:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">Every shackle</span>

1436
01:58:42,625 --> 01:58:48,541
<span style="style.default_1">Smith each into</span>

1437
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:53,000
<span style="style.default_1">A sword</span>

1438
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:55,416
Stop!

1439
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:00,958
Hey, the great Sanju!

1440
01:59:01,083 --> 01:59:03,125
Boss, look who's here.

1441
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:06,041
The star!

1442
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:08,416
Welcome!

1443
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:12,625
No calendar at home?
You're ten days early!

1444
01:59:12,708 --> 01:59:16,500
Welcome... sit.

1445
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:22,666
May I speak in private?

1446
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:23,916
In private?

1447
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,333
They're family.

1448
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:29,291
Close your ears.

1449
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:35,458
We reject condoms
and eject large families.

1450
01:59:36,583 --> 01:59:38,416
Now tell me.

1451
01:59:41,041 --> 01:59:43,083
I can't attend the Ganesha festival.

1452
01:59:45,333 --> 01:59:46,916
Are you sloshed?

1453
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:49,416
I've already announced to the world.

1454
01:59:49,541 --> 01:59:51,625
My parents are joining, too.

1455
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:54,416
I too have a father. He disapproves.

1456
01:59:57,041 --> 01:59:59,250
He approves when you meet
the gangs in Dubai?

1457
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:03,166
Did I have a choice? I was scared.

1458
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:07,416
You ain't scared of me?

1459
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:10,583
Boys, show him fear.

1460
02:00:32,291 --> 02:00:34,625
Wanna see your brains?

1461
02:00:37,791 --> 02:00:40,875
Blow them out, but first... hear me out.

1462
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:47,541
If I attend your event,
the press will print...

1463
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:49,000
"Sanju-Gangsters Romance."

1464
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:53,750
If I don't attend, "Gang kills Sanju."

1465
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,041
Either ways, it'll make headlines.

1466
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:00,250
But, the second headline
won't shame my dad.

1467
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,458
He'll cry gallons.

1468
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:06,791
But when he faces the world,
his head will be held high.

1469
02:01:07,458 --> 02:01:09,166
Not bowed down in shame.

1470
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:14,875
If this makes sense... fine.

1471
02:01:18,208 --> 02:01:19,333
If not, shoot me.

1472
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,041
-Boss...
-Shut up!

1473
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,625
I'll leave now.

1474
02:01:33,416 --> 02:01:35,708
If I've overstepped, I'm sorry.

1475
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:02,583
<span style="style.default_1">Bandu Boss never called.</span>

1476
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:05,416
<span style="style.default_1">But he showed up!</span>

1477
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,916
It's a family tradition.

1478
02:02:14,333 --> 02:02:16,625
No murders during the Ganesha fest.

1479
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,250
Decided to kill you after the fest.

1480
02:02:19,708 --> 02:02:21,708
These ten days, I only thought of you.

1481
02:02:22,291 --> 02:02:26,291
You risked life to keep
your dad's head unbowed.

1482
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:29,791
Who does such a stupid thing?

1483
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:33,000
Head, a few degrees up or down,
what bloody difference?

1484
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:37,666
I prayed to the Lord for you.

1485
02:02:38,041 --> 02:02:40,500
Told him, "He's one gutsy guy."

1486
02:02:40,750 --> 02:02:44,291
"Help him. Get his charges dropped."

1487
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:46,791
The Lord said, "Bandu Boss, done!"

1488
02:02:47,916 --> 02:02:49,125
Here are the offerings.

1489
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,458
Success guaranteed!

1490
02:02:54,666 --> 02:02:56,500
-Lord Ganesha...
-Glory be thine!

1491
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:58,416
Be thine!

1492
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:00,833
Stay in touch.

1493
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:02,041
Let's go.

1494
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:12,083
Get Bandu Boss teary-eyed often.

1495
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,208
Free sweets will follow.

1496
02:03:15,333 --> 02:03:16,500
Sir, it's the director.

1497
02:03:20,291 --> 02:03:21,625
Yes, bro.

1498
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:23,500
Where are you? We are ready to shoot.

1499
02:03:23,583 --> 02:03:26,916
Insane traffic on the highway.

1500
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:29,750
A truck hit a car.

1501
02:03:32,083 --> 02:03:35,458
Hey, move that taxi.

1502
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:37,625
Listen.

1503
02:03:37,875 --> 02:03:39,291
I've called the landline.

1504
02:03:42,791 --> 02:03:44,541
Landline's for all and sundry.

1505
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:46,583
You're my bro, always call on my cell.

1506
02:03:46,666 --> 02:03:49,250
We missed the sunrise shot.

1507
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:52,208
Shoot it at sunset.

1508
02:03:52,333 --> 02:03:54,291
The audience won't know shit.

1509
02:03:54,375 --> 02:03:57,625
<span style="style.default_1">Now hang up or we'll miss the sunset.</span>

1510
02:03:59,083 --> 02:04:02,291
Time to introduce you to Master no. 2.

1511
02:04:03,583 --> 02:04:06,916
He'll teach you to respect work.

1512
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:09,666
If you keep missing sunrise shoots,

1513
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,208
the sun will set on your career.

1514
02:04:12,458 --> 02:04:15,333
Do good work and the press
will change its opinion, too.

1515
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:17,791
Good work?

1516
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:19,541
With such trashy scripts.

1517
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,916
Here...

1518
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,666
Kinky King, Rowdy Romeo...

1519
02:04:28,291 --> 02:04:31,708
Munnabhai MBBS, Punky Prince...

1520
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:33,666
Aamir and Shah Rukh grab the best.

1521
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:37,958
-Do you read these scripts?
-Cover to cover.

1522
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:41,000
All read and rejected.

1523
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:44,250
"Munnabhai MBBS." Read this one?

1524
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:46,791
-I did.
-What's the story?

1525
02:04:49,291 --> 02:04:50,708
It's trash!

1526
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:54,583
There's a hospital...

1527
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:59,125
where a patient gets murdered...
every day!

1528
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:03,583
Then kidneys are stolen.
It's a horror story.

1529
02:05:03,833 --> 02:05:05,416
I need a family film.

1530
02:05:05,708 --> 02:05:09,083
The draft I read has no murders.

1531
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:15,500
-Why did you read it?
-I'm playing your father in this film.

1532
02:05:16,083 --> 02:05:19,583
I'll set up Master no. 2 in your car.

1533
02:05:19,666 --> 02:05:23,500
Listen to the song on loop at full volume.

1534
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:34,291
<span style="style.default_1">If you shirk from work</span>

1535
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:39,875
<span style="style.default_1">You get no perk, you jerk</span>

1536
02:05:39,958 --> 02:05:41,708
Turn it off!

1537
02:05:41,791 --> 02:05:44,666
It's Mr. Dutt's order to play this song
the whole month.

1538
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:48,250
And check that you lip sync.

1539
02:05:54,708 --> 02:05:56,916
<span style="style.default_1">If you shirk from work</span>

1540
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,375
I am singing.

1541
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:02,250
<span style="style.default_1">You get no perk, you jerk</span>

1542
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:05,291
<span style="style.default_1">If duties you duck</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You land up in muck</span>

1543
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:08,250
<span style="style.default_1">On bankruptcy's brink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Not a dime for a drink</span>

1544
02:06:08,416 --> 02:06:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">Toil hard buddy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Listen to your daddy...</span>

1545
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:13,833
-Lip sync fine?
-Yes.

1546
02:06:13,916 --> 02:06:16,791
Report to dad. Bloody snitch!

1547
02:06:20,458 --> 02:06:23,500
<span style="style.default_1">Dad signed this film after a 12 year gap</span>

1548
02:06:23,666 --> 02:06:26,125
<span style="style.default_1">just to discipline me.</span>

1549
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:30,750
Must an ER patient fill an admit form?

1550
02:06:35,625 --> 02:06:37,583
<span style="style.default_1">He was always punctual on the sets.</span>

1551
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:40,041
-Has the hero arrived?
-Yes, sir.

1552
02:06:40,625 --> 02:06:43,750
<span style="style.default_1">So I too, had to be on time.</span>

1553
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,208
Shall we rehearse?

1554
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,000
Just for the shot, Dad!

1555
02:06:58,291 --> 02:07:00,916
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here.

1556
02:07:03,250 --> 02:07:07,208
You lied to me shamelessly for ten years.

1557
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:17,083
"Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?"

1558
02:07:17,291 --> 02:07:20,750
That's my dialogue.
I'm playing the father.

1559
02:07:21,291 --> 02:07:23,166
But, Father...
I couldn't become a doctor."

1560
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,166
Again.

1561
02:07:24,708 --> 02:07:28,250
You lied to me shamelessly for 10 years.

1562
02:07:28,791 --> 02:07:32,583
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?

1563
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:33,750
Once again?

1564
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:37,708
<span style="style.default_1">Prison time was easier than this.</span>

1565
02:07:37,833 --> 02:07:40,041
<span style="style.default_1">Dad's discipline roasted me.</span>

1566
02:07:41,041 --> 02:07:44,875
<span style="style.default_1">But, I won't ever forget</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that "magic hug" scene.</span>

1567
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,416
Your mom gets a thousand hugs.

1568
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,916
Spare one for dad.

1569
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:59,541
<span style="style.default_1">Neither of us heard it</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when the director called, "Cut!"</span>

1570
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:01,750
<span style="style.default_1">We were weeping.</span>

1571
02:08:02,125 --> 02:08:04,833
<span style="style.default_1">It was a lifetime since we had hugged.</span>

1572
02:08:13,416 --> 02:08:15,666
...Sanjay Dutt for "Munnabhai MBBS."

1573
02:08:20,541 --> 02:08:21,583
Go on, sonny.

1574
02:08:35,666 --> 02:08:38,750
Mr. Dutt, didn't I tell you
that Sanju will be back!

1575
02:08:39,125 --> 02:08:41,375
Really? Did you?

1576
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:42,708
Didn't I?

1577
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:46,541
-I told... someone.
-Who?

1578
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:48,625
Our Associate Editor.

1579
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:51,250
Told him to print, "Sanju will be back."

1580
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:53,666
He must've forgotten.

1581
02:08:53,916 --> 02:08:57,208
Make it tomorrow's headline...
"Sanjay Dutt is back."

1582
02:08:59,916 --> 02:09:02,083
Without a question mark.

1583
02:09:11,125 --> 02:09:12,791
Look, Munnabhai's pop!

1584
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:23,375
<span style="style.default_1">Look, the terrorist's pop!</span>

1585
02:09:27,416 --> 02:09:28,458
What happened, Dad?

1586
02:09:28,541 --> 02:09:33,416
It's the second time
you've made me cry with joy.

1587
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">The first time dad cried with joy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was in our preview theater.</span>

1588
02:09:39,583 --> 02:09:43,916
<span style="style.default_1">That day a headline read,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"RDX truck at Dutt house."</span>

1589
02:09:55,958 --> 02:10:01,541
<span style="style.default_1">Tell the judge that you knew about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the bomb blast conspiracy.</span>

1590
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:12,583
<span style="style.default_1">The first time dad cried with joy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was in our preview theater.</span>

1591
02:10:12,833 --> 02:10:17,041
<span style="style.default_1">That day a headline read,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"RDX truck at Dutt house."</span>

1592
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:20,000
<span style="style.default_1">But that's another episode.</span>

1593
02:10:20,208 --> 02:10:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">I'll save it for another day.</span>

1594
02:10:21,708 --> 02:10:24,000
<span style="style.default_1">Let's get back to dad.</span>

1595
02:10:24,125 --> 02:10:26,541
<span style="style.default_1">I got another chance to make dad happy.</span>

1596
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dad was being honored</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at a Consulate dinner.</span>

1597
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:34,916
You guys never praise me.

1598
02:10:35,291 --> 02:10:37,458
So, here I am as chief guest.

1599
02:10:37,666 --> 02:10:41,958
<span style="style.default_1">Dad was unaware, his son would</span>
<span style="style.default_1">sing his praises tonight!</span>

1600
02:10:42,041 --> 02:10:46,041
<span style="style.default_1">I was to make the introduction speech.</span>

1601
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,166
Dad, I'll be back.

1602
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,583
Sir, there's a minor problem.

1603
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:06,750
Today's headline said, "Blast suspect
to attend diplomatic event."

1604
02:11:07,666 --> 02:11:12,000
The Embassy wanted you off the guest list.

1605
02:11:12,458 --> 02:11:15,625
We said, "That would be rude."

1606
02:11:16,291 --> 02:11:19,208
"We'll seat him away from the diplomats."

1607
02:11:32,125 --> 02:11:34,291
My speech... When's that?

1608
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:57,833
Sonny, what's the problem?

1609
02:11:59,041 --> 02:12:02,791
I'm right here. Read out your speech.

1610
02:12:05,291 --> 02:12:06,791
I wanted everyone to hear it.

1611
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:15,208
Learn to ignore such people.

1612
02:12:15,916 --> 02:12:22,083
Time for Master no. 3.
I'll set the song in your car.

1613
02:12:22,666 --> 02:12:23,708
Anand Bakshi.

1614
02:12:23,791 --> 02:12:28,375
He'll teach you to deal with humiliation.
Okay?

1615
02:12:30,958 --> 02:12:33,333
Sanju...

1616
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:42,708
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here!

1617
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,583
Go, sleep.

1618
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:53,750
<span style="style.default_1">Wish I'd read him the speech,</span>

1619
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:56,833
<span style="style.default_1">for... the next morning,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he didn't wake up.</span>

1620
02:14:08,083 --> 02:14:09,958
<span style="style.default_1">If life had a rewind button...</span>

1621
02:14:10,666 --> 02:14:13,875
<span style="style.default_1">I'd go back and read him the speech!</span>

1622
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:25,208
Today, I'll try the impossible...
an attempt to thank dad.

1623
02:14:25,666 --> 02:14:28,833
In the past, I never found the words.

1624
02:14:28,916 --> 02:14:33,708
To define what dad's done for me...
every word fell short.

1625
02:14:40,791 --> 02:14:42,708
<span style="style.default_1">...a wife dying in the hospital,</span>

1626
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:45,583
<span style="style.default_1">a son destroyed by drugs.</span>

1627
02:14:46,083 --> 02:14:48,458
<span style="style.default_1">Dad fought all alone.</span>

1628
02:14:48,916 --> 02:14:51,291
He's the reason I'm alive.

1629
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:57,000
Tried to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1630
02:14:57,375 --> 02:15:00,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dad walked long peace marches…</span>

1631
02:15:00,583 --> 02:15:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">from Hiroshima to Nagasaki...</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Mumbai to Amritsar.</span>

1632
02:15:04,333 --> 02:15:07,000
<span style="style.default_1">But none wore off his shoes as much as</span>

1633
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:09,583
the jostle between courts and cops.

1634
02:15:10,375 --> 02:15:13,375
<span style="style.default_1">Legal costs forced dad to sell his house.</span>

1635
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:15,500
<span style="style.default_1">Not once did he complain!</span>

1636
02:15:16,166 --> 02:15:21,916
Wanted to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.

1637
02:15:22,875 --> 02:15:27,333
Now, after a lifetime,
I've found the words.

1638
02:15:31,916 --> 02:15:36,166
You deserved a better son, Dad.

1639
02:15:37,125 --> 02:15:40,625
<span style="style.default_1">One who'd support you... not be a burden.</span>

1640
02:15:41,583 --> 02:15:44,750
<span style="style.default_1">One known for his honesty,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">not his travesties.</span>

1641
02:15:45,333 --> 02:15:48,375
One more like you and less like me.

1642
02:15:54,958 --> 02:15:58,166
That son would've never loved you as much

1643
02:15:58,250 --> 02:16:00,500
as this no-good sonny does!

1644
02:16:01,041 --> 02:16:02,458
<span style="style.default_1">I could never say it, but...</span>

1645
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:07,500
You're my strength,

1646
02:16:08,291 --> 02:16:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">my solace,</span>

1647
02:16:10,416 --> 02:16:11,750
my pride.

1648
02:16:11,833 --> 02:16:13,333
You're my world, Dad.

1649
02:16:18,083 --> 02:16:19,333
Love you, sonny.

1650
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,958
<span style="style.default_1">Had dad lived another year,</span>

1651
02:16:32,041 --> 02:16:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">he'd have witnessed what he yearned for.</span>

1652
02:16:39,416 --> 02:16:42,416
...I do not find you to be a terrorist.

1653
02:16:47,583 --> 02:16:49,500
<span style="style.default_1">I was acquitted from the Terror Act.</span>

1654
02:16:49,875 --> 02:16:53,958
<span style="style.default_1">I got six years under the Arms Act.</span>

1655
02:16:54,291 --> 02:16:57,291
<span style="style.default_1">The judge clearly said</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was not a terrorist.</span>

1656
02:16:57,958 --> 02:16:59,208
<span style="style.default_1">But the next morning,</span>

1657
02:16:59,375 --> 02:17:02,958
<span style="style.default_1">no headline read "Dutt not a terrorist."</span>

1658
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">All said, "Dutt gets</span>
<span style="style.default_1">six years in the blast case."</span>

1659
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:14,500
Till date, I'm branded a terrorist.

1660
02:17:20,625 --> 02:17:25,458
Master no. 3 was to teach me
to deal with insults.

1661
02:17:27,083 --> 02:17:31,291
But with dad's death,
that song remains a mystery.

1662
02:17:32,041 --> 02:17:36,916
If you can crack that song, do tell.

1663
02:17:37,416 --> 02:17:41,666
Until tomorrow,
Sanju says, "Adios, amigos."

1664
02:17:57,333 --> 02:17:58,916
I want to meet Sanju.

1665
02:18:19,291 --> 02:18:20,458
How are you?

1666
02:18:20,708 --> 02:18:23,208
They don't let me step out,
the rest is fine.

1667
02:18:23,333 --> 02:18:27,458
Yeah. Sticklers for rules!
Weren't letting me in, either.

1668
02:18:27,958 --> 02:18:29,958
Missing me? Boyfriend vamoosed?

1669
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,000
I'm no Pinky.

1670
02:18:36,083 --> 02:18:38,791
-You met Kamli?
-Yes.

1671
02:18:38,875 --> 02:18:40,583
In your recording, you say...

1672
02:18:41,333 --> 02:18:46,958
on the day the RDX news appeared,
your dad cried with joy.

1673
02:18:47,041 --> 02:18:48,250
Yes.

1674
02:18:48,333 --> 02:18:49,750
Kamlesh has a different version.

1675
02:18:49,833 --> 02:18:52,333
When he came to the preview theater,

1676
02:18:52,791 --> 02:18:56,250
your dad was urging you
to confess in court

1677
02:18:56,416 --> 02:18:59,250
that you knew about
the bomb blasts conspiracy.

1678
02:19:06,333 --> 02:19:07,416
The moron!

1679
02:19:08,833 --> 02:19:09,916
Get Kamli here.

1680
02:19:11,291 --> 02:19:14,833
-Tell me about it.
-No. I'll tell him directly.

1681
02:19:14,916 --> 02:19:17,666
It's hard to get permission.

1682
02:19:21,666 --> 02:19:24,291
Remember this number, 88.0.

1683
02:19:24,541 --> 02:19:26,291
-What's that?
-A radio frequency.

1684
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:28,583
There's an FM mic in our studio.

1685
02:19:29,125 --> 02:19:34,500
Park close to the prison walls
and tune in.

1686
02:19:37,666 --> 02:19:38,791
Kamlesh won't come.

1687
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:45,458
Tell him... 6th June. He won't refuse.

1688
02:19:48,625 --> 02:19:52,708
It's his dad's birthday.
Bloody emotional blackmailer!

1689
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:54,375
Will you come?

1690
02:20:28,916 --> 02:20:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">Howdy, Yerwada!</span>

1691
02:20:31,125 --> 02:20:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">This is your buddy, Sanju!</span>

1692
02:20:38,708 --> 02:20:41,666
Today's topic is "friendship."

1693
02:20:42,083 --> 02:20:44,208
My best friend was Kamli.

1694
02:20:45,125 --> 02:20:49,041
Great guy. But fell prey to drugs.

1695
02:20:49,916 --> 02:20:52,833
<span style="style.default_1">No... not the psychotropic drugs.</span>

1696
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:59,833
But the ones that are slid
under our doors, daily.

1697
02:21:00,666 --> 02:21:02,833
<span style="style.default_1">We have them with our morning tea.</span>

1698
02:21:03,333 --> 02:21:06,666
Drugs called "News."

1699
02:21:07,541 --> 02:21:09,333
<span style="style.default_1">These drugs are sold on TV too.</span>

1700
02:21:09,666 --> 02:21:14,041
Haven't you heard those
cacophonous debates

1701
02:21:14,333 --> 02:21:16,625
that numb our minds?

1702
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:20,541
Courts take years
to just understand a case.

1703
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:24,375
But these panelists
pass verdicts in an hour.

1704
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,875
Back then, a headline said...

1705
02:21:32,541 --> 02:21:34,416
<span style="style.default_1">It was fake news.</span>

1706
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:38,166
No cop, no prosecutor,
no witness ever said

1707
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:40,375
there was a truck with RDX at my house.

1708
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,166
<span style="style.default_1">So, why this headline?</span>

1709
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:47,458
During riots, a truck with relief material
was parked at our house.

1710
02:21:49,458 --> 02:21:51,833
<span style="style.default_1">Some jerk spread a rumor it had RDX.</span>

1711
02:21:51,916 --> 02:21:54,916
And a journo printed this spicy news.

1712
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,208
Read my Supreme Court judgment.

1713
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:00,875
I was never accused of possessing RDX!

1714
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:07,000
But which journo bothers with facts?

1715
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:10,125
All they want is "Breaking News!"

1716
02:22:12,750 --> 02:22:14,541
This headline worked like a drug.

1717
02:22:15,583 --> 02:22:18,416
In Kamli's head,
I morphed into a terrorist.

1718
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:23,416
He put a full-stop to our friendship.

1719
02:22:24,458 --> 02:22:28,083
Didn't even notice
that the headline had a question mark!

1720
02:22:38,666 --> 02:22:40,916
<span style="style.default_1">This news shattered dad.</span>

1721
02:22:41,333 --> 02:22:44,458
In desperation, he brought in a lawyer.

1722
02:22:45,833 --> 02:22:48,541
-What's this?
-Your ticket to freedom.

1723
02:22:48,833 --> 02:22:50,750
Sign and turn approver.

1724
02:22:50,833 --> 02:22:53,083
-Approver?
-Government witness.

1725
02:22:55,708 --> 02:23:00,458
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.

1726
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:04,625
Kamlesh, please wait outside.

1727
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,916
-I knew nothing about the bomb blasts.
-But tell the Court that you knew.

1728
02:23:13,291 --> 02:23:16,291
Tell them who got the RDX,
who made the bombs,

1729
02:23:16,708 --> 02:23:18,083
and who planted them.

1730
02:23:18,166 --> 02:23:22,083
-I know nothing!
-I'll give you the names.

1731
02:23:22,416 --> 02:23:25,625
You help the State with missing links.

1732
02:23:25,708 --> 02:23:30,583
In return, the State
will let you go scot-free.

1733
02:23:31,708 --> 02:23:35,208
-I'll be branded a terrorist.
-You're already branded.

1734
02:23:35,291 --> 02:23:38,041
It's a lie, a sign will make it the truth.

1735
02:23:39,083 --> 02:23:41,208
The country will spit on me.

1736
02:23:42,041 --> 02:23:43,500
Leave the country.

1737
02:23:43,833 --> 02:23:45,416
London, Kenya... Pick a place.

1738
02:23:46,583 --> 02:23:51,541
And dad? My sisters? Dad, heard that?

1739
02:23:51,625 --> 02:23:54,916
Don't worry about us. Leave the country.

1740
02:24:00,666 --> 02:24:04,291
Sir, I don't have a law degree.

1741
02:24:05,041 --> 02:24:06,875
In fact, I'm a college dropout.

1742
02:24:07,125 --> 02:24:10,083
But I know, this is rotten advice.

1743
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:13,958
I brand him "Terrorist's pop"
and run away?

1744
02:24:14,583 --> 02:24:16,208
People will hate dad.

1745
02:24:16,416 --> 02:24:19,833
His life's work, respect...
All down the drain!

1746
02:24:19,916 --> 02:24:22,416
-Listen to me...
-You listen to me.

1747
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:25,750
Get lost!
You might be a great lawyer,

1748
02:24:25,833 --> 02:24:29,541
but with a broken nose,
you'll look like a clown.

1749
02:24:36,458 --> 02:24:38,958
You're going to pay for this.

1750
02:24:53,458 --> 02:24:54,625
What happened, Dad?

1751
02:24:55,958 --> 02:24:57,375
Ace, sonny!

1752
02:25:07,291 --> 02:25:09,875
<span style="style.default_1">For the first time,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my father cried with joy.</span>

1753
02:25:10,666 --> 02:25:12,333
That day, I was his hero.

1754
02:25:14,541 --> 02:25:17,250
The same day,
I turned villain for my friend.

1755
02:25:18,291 --> 02:25:22,333
Hey, Kamli. Hope you can hear me.

1756
02:25:23,875 --> 02:25:25,458
When I come out...

1757
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:29,041
meet me once, buddy.

1758
02:25:30,833 --> 02:25:32,625
If you do, I'll be happy.

1759
02:25:34,333 --> 02:25:37,750
If you don't,
I'll live with your fond memories.

1760
02:25:40,333 --> 02:25:45,708
I'll remember, the first nude girl
my friend saw was 91.

1761
02:25:48,666 --> 02:25:52,375
I'll remember, he perked me up
with vodka-infused tea.

1762
02:25:54,583 --> 02:26:00,583
And to meet me, he bought an air-ticket
with the pennies saved for his first car.

1763
02:26:02,833 --> 02:26:06,083
Hey, Kamli. We're getting old, bro.

1764
02:26:08,416 --> 02:26:10,291
Give me one last hug.

1765
02:26:18,291 --> 02:26:22,083
Tiger, this one's for you.

1766
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:26,875
<span style="style.default_1">On the pathway of time,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">At this bend</span>

1767
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:31,458
<span style="style.default_1">I am glad I met such a friend</span>

1768
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:36,250
<span style="style.default_1">Scars are healed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And sorrows end</span>

1769
02:26:36,333 --> 02:26:40,750
<span style="style.default_1">Just at the thought</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I have such a friend</span>

1770
02:26:40,833 --> 02:26:45,208
<span style="style.default_1">On the pathway of time,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">At this bend</span>

1771
02:26:45,458 --> 02:26:49,666
<span style="style.default_1">I am lucky to find such a friend</span>

1772
02:27:38,875 --> 02:27:40,333
Sanju, take care.

1773
02:28:01,708 --> 02:28:03,833
Sanju! Here...

1774
02:28:04,291 --> 02:28:07,750
A picture, please!

1775
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:18,250
<span style="style.default_1">Sanju!</span>

1776
02:29:09,833 --> 02:29:10,791
Did you marry?

1777
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,166
Opened your account?

1778
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:19,125
Bam-bam without marriage?

1779
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:23,166
At 80, we'll go to the holy river
to wash our sins.

1780
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:26,000
If I don't sin, what'll I wash?
My underwear?

1781
02:29:29,583 --> 02:29:31,333
One pic, please!

1782
02:29:33,583 --> 02:29:35,375
Look here.

1783
02:29:43,458 --> 02:29:44,375
The book?

1784
02:29:46,541 --> 02:29:48,500
Master no. 3's song...

1785
02:29:51,083 --> 02:29:52,500
Named the book the same.

1786
02:29:53,583 --> 02:29:54,666
I've cracked it, too.

1787
02:29:56,333 --> 02:29:58,500
Really? Which song?

1788
02:29:58,583 --> 02:30:02,791
Hey, terrorist! Give me a bloody pic!

1789
02:30:07,208 --> 02:30:09,291
<span style="style.default_1">Let them talk</span>

1790
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:11,000
<span style="style.default_1">Let them mock</span>

1791
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:13,666
<span style="style.default_1">The path beckons</span>

1792
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:16,125
<span style="style.default_1">You just walk</span>

1793
02:30:17,333 --> 02:30:18,208
Let's go, Kamli.

1794
02:30:21,375 --> 02:30:25,833
<span style="style.default_1">Let them talk</span>

1795
02:30:26,583 --> 02:30:29,416
<span style="style.default_1">Let them mock</span>

1796
02:30:32,125 --> 02:30:37,291
<span style="style.default_1">The path beckons</span>

1797
02:30:37,583 --> 02:30:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">You just walk</span>

1798
02:30:49,875 --> 02:30:51,125
Papa, what's this?

1799
02:30:52,833 --> 02:30:56,291
A story of two dads.

1800
02:30:56,875 --> 02:30:59,458
Your dad and my dad.

1801
02:31:00,416 --> 02:31:02,083
Read it someday.

1802
02:31:02,416 --> 02:31:05,666
And be like my dad, not like your dad.

1803
02:31:09,125 --> 02:31:11,416
Your son resembles your dad.

1804
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:13,250
It's him, reincarnated.

1805
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:20,125
Just kidding.

1806
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">Woke up this morning</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Opened the newspaper</span>

1807
02:32:05,625 --> 02:32:08,416
<span style="style.default_1">One fake news</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Gave me the blues</span>

1808
