1
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,878
Come on.

2
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,755
- Just come with.
- No.

3
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,716
- Please?
- No fucking way.

4
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,886
This may be their last reunion tour ever.

5
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,180
Yeah, I fucking hope so.

6
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,765
They're the best band.

7
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,850
Oh, come off it.

8
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,144
I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

9
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,521
I'll buy you front row seats.
You take Rachel.

10
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,856
I don't want to take Rachel.

11
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,025
I want you to come with me.

12
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,361
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

13
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,154
- I'll make a mess everywhere.
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,906
Then I would just have to clean it up.

15
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,532
- You would?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,701
Smart-ass.

17
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,203
You love it.

18
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,330
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

19
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,456
Yeah.

20
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,396
- Hi.
- Good morning.

21
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,610
Morning, deputy director.

22
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,574
How did you get in here?

23
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,077
You're like the fucking mould

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,953
on my laundry room tiles.

25
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,623
You scrape it off, comes right back.

26
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,919
Sounds like you got a bit
of a moisture problem, love.

27
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,046
Security, please.

28
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,548
I can stop them getting Supes
in the military.

29
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,592
What makes you think I care?

30
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,678
Personally, I can't wait until they're in Syria.

31
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,931
Yeah, I'll bet.

32
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,810
Last week. A-Train,

33
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:50,689
mainlining before the big race.
His fuck buddy, Popclaw,

34
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,358
pinning the same stuff.

35
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,278
They call it Compound V.
It's some kind of booster or steroid for Supes.

36
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:59,198
Jacks them right up.
Now, word gets out that Supes

37
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,534
are nothing but a bunch of juice junkies,

38
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,161
no one's gonna want them
in national defence.

39
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,832
Got a sample?

40
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,042
Not yet.

41
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,460
This could be heroin.

42
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,878
It could be anything.

43
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,296
You don't trust me.

44
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,298
Susan, I am shocked and saddened by that.

45
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,467
Really? I'm sure.

46
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,052
Speaking of which,

47
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:23,222
I haven't seen Translucent around anywhere.

48
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,183
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

49
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,726
Cunt's invisible.

50
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,770
He could be standing in that fucking corner,

51
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:32,523
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

52
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:38,195
Look, you think Supes are cunts now?
You just wait till they're wearing camo.

53
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,156
I mean, what's to stop Sergeant Homelander

54
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,368
from killing a couple of hundred thousand Chinese?
How are you gonna try him for war crimes?

55
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,788
He's gonna murder the bloody lot of us
before he steps one foot in The Hague.

56
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,166
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

57
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,334
over to Vought right now.

58
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,340
You're really working this one, huh?

59
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,552
Just being an upstanding citizen, love.

60
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,679
Oh, I know.

61
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,807
Okay.

62
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:09,268
You get me some hard proof,

63
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,480
something actionable that I can use,

64
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:16,066
and maybe I'll throw you a few bucks.

65
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,194
For your operating costs.

66
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,117
But if you fuck me on this,

67
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,537
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

68
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,831
at a black site.

69
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,250
Say you understand.

70
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,631
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

71
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,884
You can't have two alpha males,
because inevitably someone's...

72
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,054
Say you fucking understand.

73
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,141
I understand.

74
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,977
Remind me, what was our deal?

75
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,438
- What?
- What was our fucking deal?

76
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:58,067
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the...

77
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,362
Yeah, runs the Compound V
to the noodle shop up on Division.

78
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,864
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

79
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,658
Wherever he's going, it's around there,

80
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,326
every time he leaves with the V,

81
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,787
he comes back with noodles.
That's all I know.

82
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,039
Well, you'd better be right, love,

83
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,876
or you and your dearly departed landlord
are gonna find yourselves on Pornhub

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,711
in the Fatal Cunnilingus section.

85
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,548
You son of a bitch, if you even...

86
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,972
Sorry, baby, just, work's
just been a motherfucker lately.

87
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,516
You know I'd much rather be at home,
rubbing on them toes

88
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,852
than out here breaking up yard fights,
but a brother got to get paid.

89
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,646
Oh, most definitely.

90
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,067
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers, tearing it down.

91
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,278
Champagne showers.

92
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,948
I know, I know, I'm just kidding.

93
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,659
All right, sweetheart. Talk to you.

94
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,499
Say something.

95
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,420
Well, you know, Jean-Paul Sartre said

96
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,173
marriage stifles our essential male urges.

97
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,594
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
an old, lonely motherfucker.

98
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,638
Not to mention his girl
was shacking up with some other dude.

99
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,765
Oui, they were free to explore.

100
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,518
Explore what? Gonorrhoea?

101
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,936
Come on, Frenchie.

102
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,480
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

103
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,482
to go home to and sleep next to at night?

104
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,360
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

105
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,446
Because you're an old, lonely fucker, too.

106
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,281
And you're gonna die by yourself.

107
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,992
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

108
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,077
why are you lying to her about where you are?

109
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,548
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

110
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,968
About time we see something.

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,802
We got to go in there, don't we?

112
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,845
Don't be scared, Petit Hughie.

113
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,932
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm 6 feet tall.

114
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,239
Let's hurry up, let's go.

115
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,866
Check those boxes.

116
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,999
Frenchie, look for the V.

117
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,593
Frenchie, come on, let's go,
check these boxes.

118
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,806
Come on, Frenchie, what are you doing?

119
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,602
Are you deaf?

120
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,898
Jesus.

121
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,156
Who's that?

122
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,574
I think we should let her go.

123
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,660
No, no. We're here for the V, and we get out.

124
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,829
This isn't a rescue.

125
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,581
You sound like Butcher.

126
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,125
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

127
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,297
Goddamn it, Frenchie, what the...?

128
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,300
Hey! Don't set her free!

129
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,226
Oh, my God!

130
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,740
Oh, fuck.

131
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,784
Hughie, let's go! Let's go, Hughie!

132
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,661
Come on!

133
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,979
Couple weeks ago, we were all getting...

134
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,648
We were all getting wasted
in the common room.

135
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,192
It was, like, Super Bowl, I think.

136
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,238
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk...

137
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,951
but, you know, I tried.

138
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,913
I really tried...

139
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,625
to talk to the guys.

140
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,751
About...?

141
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,130
Dolphins.

142
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,673
Did you know, in Japan, that they

143
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,759
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

144
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,219
Intelligent animals.

145
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,556
Yeah, that have regional accents,

146
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,851
and a great sense of humour.
I mean, they're...

147
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,269
They're hilarious.

148
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,606
Yeah.

149
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,733
And that night, A-Train...

150
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,362
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

151
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,325
With lipstick on its blowhole.

152
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,785
Yeah, real creative pricks.

153
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,165
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,168
That must have hurt.

155
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,089
Yeah, I'm... I'm the diversity hire.

156
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,217
I'm a joke.

157
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,057
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

158
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,810
How often do you need to be saved by
a school of salmon?

159
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,564
Kevin, that's just not true.

160
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,609
Where would that Carnival cruise ship be
without you?

161
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,571
Yeah. I know.

162
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,244
Okay, I need to... self-actualise,

163
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,622
show more confidence.

164
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,333
After all, who are you?

165
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,834
I'm one of the Seven.

166
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,419
And what does that mean?

167
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,130
I can do anything I set my mind to.

168
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,007
What do you want to set your mind to?

169
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,620
What a mess.

170
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,999
You all right?

171
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,668
Just when you think
this shit can't get any more horrible...

172
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,086
Nah, don't worry.

173
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,339
It can get a lot more horrible.

174
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,986
Butcher, come check this out.

175
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,367
Take a look.

176
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,246
V.

177
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,250
So, A-Train's running it here,

178
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,586
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

179
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,131
- Yeah, back when they had eyeballs.
- Yeah, but why?

180
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,718
Is it a Vought thing or, like, a side hustle?

181
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,970
Came gift-wrapped in this.

182
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,266
Find out where it came from.

183
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,226
I'll shake a few trees.

184
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,313
Why the hell were they dosing her?

185
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,440
Why don't we ask foie gras over here?

186
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,400
He's the one that let her out.

187
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,986
- She looked innocent.
- Innocent?

188
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,616
She's locked up in a cage, underground,
with armed guards?

189
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,201
I had a feeling about her.

190
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,954
Nah, Frenchie, you just didn't follow the plan.
You never follow the plan, man.

191
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,249
- You need to unclench your asshole.
- You need to eat my clenched asshole.

192
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,087
Why are you two carrying on
like a bunch of fucking twats?

193
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,881
We're sniffing down a shit sandwich
the size of Watergate.

194
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,801
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

195
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,012
All we got to do is find the female first.

196
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,436
Keep looking.

197
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,857
Who's that, then, eh?

198
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,734
It's nobody.

199
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,992
"Annie"? Starlight?

200
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,162
Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to go on a date.

201
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:58,542
Not a date, just, she asked me
if I wanted to ask her for her number,

202
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,211
and then we just kind of platonically
exchanged information.

203
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,463
The word "date" was never mentioned.

204
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,507
Call her back. You're fucking going.

205
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,011
As a rule, I don't usually go out
after a gory massacre.

206
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,847
Listen, here's the job.

207
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,306
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

208
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,600
From now on, we hear everything she says.

209
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,145
I mean, this is a golden opportunity.

210
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,523
And after all you done, piece of cake.

211
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,402
Yeah, she's not a... She's not a bad person.

212
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,365
She's a Supe, Hughie.

213
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,701
Just like the fucking rest of them.

214
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,250
Okay, we are not gonna be able
to cover this up forever.

215
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,545
Translucent does not show his face soon,
people are gonna start to notice.

216
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,631
What if we just get in front of it?
Tell the world he died tragically

217
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,091
in the service of his country.

218
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,594
We could have an amazing funeral,
bigger than Kennedy's.

219
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,556
I don't know, admit that one of our unkillable
superheroes just got killed?

220
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,641
Kiss that military bill goodbye.

221
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,809
Let's not overthink it.

222
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,895
We just say he's on a classified mission.

223
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,731
We can't say where,
in the interest of national security.

224
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,066
All we can say is he's fighting MS-13.

225
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,359
Oh, yes. That's good.

226
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,861
Simple. Done. Boom.

227
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,030
MS-13. I like it.

228
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,407
Hello?

229
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,621
What? When?

230
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,250
How many people know?

231
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,752
Seven minutes ago,

232
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,297
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

233
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,757
was hijacked mid-air.

234
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,593
- Seven minutes ago?
- A source from NORAD gave us a heads-up.

235
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,262
- How many hijackers?
- Looks like three.

236
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,764
Did they scramble F-16's?

237
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,307
Yep, as we speak.

238
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,185
But you can get there quicker.

239
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,647
Can I please have the room?

240
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,692
Oh, middle of the Atlantic.

241
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,402
- Yep.
- No man's land.

242
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:53,615
You can't operate on foreign soil,
but a plane hijacked over international waters...

243
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,285
If you intercept, no one will protest.

244
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,205
If you bring those passengers back alive,

245
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,207
not one congressman will have the balls

246
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,167
to vote against our bill.

247
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,175
This is our chance.

248
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,595
More important than Translucent.

249
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,432
More important than anything.

250
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,146
Concentrated halothane.

251
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,608
It's not a guarantee,

252
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,278
but it should knock out your girl.

253
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,864
Merci, pumpkin.
I must go, this girl, she's got a head start.

254
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,617
Hey, I miss you.

255
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,871
I got us a pied-á-terre on the Bowery.

256
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,000
When will you be coming by?

257
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,420
As soon as I can.

258
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,838
Promise.

259
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,047
Promise?

260
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:58,221
Don't make me use that gas on you,
huh, pumpkin?

261
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,514
Yeah?

262
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,974
Okay.

263
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,712
Fuck!

264
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,800
When will they intercept?

265
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,136
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

266
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,805
I need a goddamn update.

267
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,391
Jesus.

268
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,726
Hey. Do you have a second?

269
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,478
It is not really a good time.

270
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,229
I'd really appreciate it. Super quick.

271
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,357
- Pretty please? Thank you.
- No... Oh, okay.

272
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,320
So... I found a mission.

273
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,533
And I think it's really important.

274
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,703
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

275
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,330
What? Where?

276
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,416
- Oceanland.
- Oceanland?

277
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,421
Yeah. So, get this, the dolphins there,

278
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,550
I mean, they are really underfed and abused.

279
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,803
To be quite honest, they're really frustrated.

280
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,265
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

281
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,434
I think people would really respond to that.

282
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,313
You do realise that you are at the centrepiece

283
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,440
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

284
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,901
Yeah, well, I mean,
we could just bail on that, right?

285
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,236
The deal sucks anyways.

286
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,905
- No, we can't.
- Listen, I'd just like to, you know,

287
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,283
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

288
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,244
Okay.

289
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,496
- Yeah? Okay.
- I hear you. Yes.

290
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,582
Deep...

291
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,875
play to your strengths.

292
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,936
Hey, baby. Hey.

293
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,819
What'd you do?

294
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,572
What the hell are you talking about?

295
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,991
Who did you tell about Compound V?

296
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,328
Nobody. Why? What...?

297
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,165
Because you're the only person who knew,
other than me,

298
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:33,543
that I had it, where I was taking it.

299
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,838
I didn't tell anyone anything.

300
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,298
You're being paranoid.

301
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,258
Who else did you fucking tell?

302
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,474
Don't yell at me.

303
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,310
Listen to me.

304
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,604
Sit down.

305
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,868
Look, I love you. You know I do.

306
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,579
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

307
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,499
Oh, really?
I heard you at the race.

308
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,627
No girlfriend. Open to offers.

309
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,420
Come on, I have to say those things.

310
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,632
You know this. They make me.

311
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,967
It's my brand.

312
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,805
Come here.

313
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,225
Come here.

314
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,900
You remember when you relapsed?

315
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,278
- Yes.
- And I stayed and I rubbed your back.

316
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,531
Cleaned up your puke.

317
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,536
I'm there for you, always.

318
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,376
I know, baby.

319
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,379
Please,

320
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,966
tell me who you told.

321
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,719
Because we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

322
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,770
I didn't tell anyone.

323
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,039
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

324
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,417
so get everything that you need.

325
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,419
Why? Where are we going?

326
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,087
I'm gonna take care of this,

327
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,464
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

328
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,216
before Homelander finds out.

329
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,804
I love you.

330
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,644
I love you, too.

331
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,923
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

332
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,807
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

333
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,435
starring these two knuckleheads.

334
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,481
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

335
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,067
All right, let's see what you got.

336
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:01,459
You said you bowled before?

337
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,378
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

338
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,798
- You?
- Yeah. Here, actually.

339
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,549
My whole life.

340
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,761
I had my first kiss with Amy Seeler
in the men's bathroom when I was 14.

341
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,889
- It was really romantic.
- Yeah.

342
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

343
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,977
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

344
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,646
Prom.

345
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,523
It was amazing.

346
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,693
Wait, senior prom?

347
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,695
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

348
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:34,200
Which you're not joking about,
and that's fine, that's great.

349
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,995
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

350
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,292
Yeah!

351
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,965
He never asked me out again.

352
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,843
Sorry. What were you saying?

353
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,762
No, just about prom.

354
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,181
- What about...?
- Nothing.

355
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:58,516
It's stupid.

356
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,146
I'm gonna... I'm gonna throw one.

357
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,903
So what's Translucent like?

358
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,282
That's a conversational left turn.

359
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,284
Yes, it was. I'm sorry about that.

360
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,495
Sorry. Yeah, it just popped into my head.
As a kid, he was my favourite.

361
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,206
You said the other ones were dicks,
is he a dick, too?

362
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:27,211
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

363
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,255
I will say that.

364
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,008
But otherwise, he seems like a loner.

365
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,886
He spends most of his free time with his son.

366
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:41,100
- He's got a son?
- Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

367
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,685
He's about 10.

368
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,813
Hunter or Maverick or something like that.

369
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,426
It's okay.

370
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,633
All right, everyone, it's all over.

371
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,469
It's all safe. You're all gonna be fine.

372
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,931
Thank you, Homelander!

373
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,350
Oh, no, no.

374
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,729
Come on, now. You guys.

375
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,147
You guys made it.

376
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,024
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

377
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,318
- Yeah? Good for you.
- Yeah.

378
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,571
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

379
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:17,613
Go, Maeve!

380
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,533
Hey, let's get a round of applause
for Queen Maeve.

381
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,826
Yeah!

382
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,708
Captain?

383
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,964
- Stop. Stop.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

384
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,550
Take it easy.

385
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,677
There you go, just relax.

386
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,899
ATC!

387
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:55,401
It's dead!

388
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,613
Can you fly a plane?

389
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,114
Wouldn't matter if I did!

390
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,536
What do we do?

391
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,926
All right, everyone, remain calm.

392
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,387
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

393
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,640
You got to go out there, lift the plane up.

394
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,518
Lift the plane? How?
There's nothing to stand on.

395
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,521
- It's fucking air.
- I don't know, fly at it, ram it straight.

396
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,983
No, that kind of speed,
either the plane goes ass over tit

397
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,986
or I'll punch straight through the hull, or...

398
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,867
Whoa, that was a big one!

399
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,578
Everything's fine, don't worry about it.

400
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,376
Okay. Okay.

401
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,170
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

402
00:29:56,253 --> 00:30:00,049
And what? Come back 123 times?

403
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,051
Maeve, think.

404
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,306
We're done here.

405
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,393
- Please.
- Everything's fine, guys.

406
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,771
- Everything's fine. You're okay.
- Wait, you're leaving us?

407
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,190
No, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

408
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,568
Oh, my God, you're leaving.

409
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,153
- He's leaving us.
- I said I'm not.

410
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,908
Homelander, are you going to save us?

411
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:30,538
Oh, sweetheart, of course I'm gonna save you,
you betcha.

412
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,290
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

413
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:37,294
- Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

414
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:41,966
Maeve!

415
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:06,282
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

416
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,118
Now!

417
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,290
- Take these two!
- No, no.

418
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,376
- Just these two! Please!
- No! So they can tell the world that we left

419
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,878
the rest of them to fucking die?

420
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:22,590
- Come on!
- No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

421
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,300
All of you, stay back.

422
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,219
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

423
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,056
I will laser every fucking one of you!

424
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,516
Stay back!

425
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,851
Let's go.

426
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,937
No, Maeve, no!

427
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:38,647
- Please stay!
- I'm sorry.

428
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,607
- Take us!
- Maeve!

429
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,568
Please, don't leave us. Please!

430
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,236
Maeve!

431
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,113
Don't die with them.

432
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,325
Maeve.

433
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,577
- What is wrong with you?
- Please, Maeve!

434
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,830
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

435
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,624
Please take her.

436
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,001
Take my daughter!

437
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,714
- Please! Please take her!
- Please.

438
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,633
Take her!

439
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,123
Oh, look at this.

440
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,500
- Homicide.
- You got here fast.

441
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,628
- Yeah, it was on the squawker.
- What's with the accent?

442
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:43,921
What's with yours?

443
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,258
You ever seen her here before?

444
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,969
Maybe a year ago.

445
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,517
It's a gang hit.

446
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,687
A gang hit?

447
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,482
- And who told you that, eh?
- I'm not arguing with him.

448
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,986
I'm looking into it.

449
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,988
Excuse me.

450
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,575
Cheers, mate.

451
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,346
A-Train saw me a fucking week ago.

452
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,850
- What if he made me?
- He didn't see you.

453
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,477
That's easy for you to say, Butcher,
but I got people.

454
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,605
Oh, and I don't?

455
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:49,153
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

456
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,738
He was after the female.

457
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,407
Hey, man, who was the woman?

458
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,159
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

459
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,704
loved Mexican food,
and smuggled in a ton of immigrants

460
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,790
- from all over the Pacific.
- Like our girl.

461
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,293
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

462
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,795
I got it.

463
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,258
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

464
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,302
He's gonna find her before we do.

465
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,639
No, he won't. I know where she's going.

466
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,891
Penn Station.

467
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:22,144
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

468
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,611
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

469
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,696
June 6 to 10 at the Fairgrounds.

470
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,990
Sponsored by Samaritan's Embrace.

471
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,283
We're gonna have music,

472
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:38,619
we're gonna have worship, food trucks,

473
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,873
and, oh, yeah, Christ.

474
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:46,502
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from the Seven.

475
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,254
- Hey.
- I know.

476
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,714
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

477
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,676
I'm just... I'm doing a panel for teens.

478
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:58,514
And I'm donating my appearance fee
to the Covenant House.

479
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,850
You are literally the nicest person in the city.

480
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,185
No, seriously.

481
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,689
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

482
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,440
I mean, that's why I do it.

483
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,235
Vindictive personal glory.

484
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:17,783
You okay?

485
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,452
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

486
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,582
You seem a little...

487
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,210
I don't know.

488
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,401
Okay.

489
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,697
I'll come clean.

490
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,991
If I'm being honest...

491
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,535
I'm a little suspicious of you.

492
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,538
You are?

493
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,499
Yeah. I mean, you say you bowled a lot.

494
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,711
And, you know, you have, like, superpowers,

495
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,422
yet you are a remarkably shitty bowler.

496
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,760
You know what I think is happening?

497
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,763
I think you're holding back for some weird,

498
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,849
"not gonna show me up on a first date" reason.

499
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,270
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

500
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,198
Holy shit.

501
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,452
Now that's a strike.

502
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,164
Yeah.

503
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,796
Yeah, that's great, man.
Good looking out. Thanks.

504
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,798
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

505
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,051
Deshawn grew up on my block,
but now he delivers packages.

506
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,095
Yeah, not the part I'm interested in.

507
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,513
He ran down the account number

508
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,682
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

509
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,394
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

510
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:12,314
What the fuck's that Jesus-thumping,
elastic bastard got to do with it?

511
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,192
Maybe we find the girl, we find out.

512
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,236
Yeah. All right.

513
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,030
Platforms, ground floor, I'll take upstairs.

514
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,491
Whoever pings her, get onto Frenchie
and stick with her

515
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,284
till we use the gas, all right?

516
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,714
If you're just tuning in,

517
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:41,260
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

518
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,638
of hijacked Flight 37 and fear the worst.

519
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,267
Search planes have begun to fan out
over the flight path off the Atlantic...

520
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:54,374
No, no.

521
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:01,089
It's okay. It's gone.

522
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,718
It's gone, you see?

523
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,679
I'm not here to hurt you.

524
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,521
You like music, huh?

525
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,274
Well, me, too.

526
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:25,280
Can I tell you a secret I never told anyone?

527
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,413
When I was a boy,

528
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,541
my father, he stole me from Mama.

529
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:40,337
In Marseilles, middle of the night,
just broke in, took me.

530
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,548
Kept me with him for years.

531
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,174
Hotel after hotel.

532
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:48,262
Every few nights, take me out for a walk.

533
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,141
Smoke a Gauloises, tell me he loved me, then...

534
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,818
I tried to run away so many times.

535
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:10,075
I jumped buses, trains.

536
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,744
Anything to get back to Marseilles.

537
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,623
To Mama.

538
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,836
But every time, he find me.

539
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,384
So I know what it's like to want to go home.

540
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,893
You see, I know your secret.

541
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,107
You're not a bad person.

542
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,569
Just a scared one.

543
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,287
Let me help you.

544
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,425
...reports of suspicious activity...

545
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,098
Coming through.

546
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,939
No, no, no...

547
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,275
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

548
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,027
- I don't know.
- Did you try to gas her?

549
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,111
- No.
- Why not?

550
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,197
- It didn't seem right, huh?
- You went off plan

551
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,866
- because it didn't seem right?
- I'm sorry, okay?

552
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:40,832
Sean Jakowski. Cross-country team.

553
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,460
I had such a huge crush on him,

554
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,504
and he finally asked me out to this party.

555
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,216
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

556
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,343
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

557
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,261
and then he hit him.

558
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,806
So I stepped in, I kicked the guy's ass.

559
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,518
- Good for you.
- Want to know how Sean thanked me?

560
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,853
- How?
- Never spoke to me again.

561
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:03,438
Not one word.

562
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,441
And that's when I learned,

563
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,111
never show your strength to a boy you like.

564
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,115
Well, to be honest,

565
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,075
Sean Jakowski had a tiny little baby dick.

566
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,875
It doesn't bother you that I could
whip your ass in bowling?

567
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,712
And in everything?

568
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,797
And bench-press you?

569
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,717
Oh, my God, is that a threat or a promise?

570
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,261
No. No. I...

571
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:39,307
I really think it's awesome, the real you.

572
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,356
You got... ketchup.

573
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,027
What? You don't like that?

574
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,029
Doesn't work for you?

575
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,792
Save my spot. I'll be right back.

576
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,704
- Hey.
- Hey.

577
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,210
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

578
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,712
Since you're the psycho chick whisperer
all of a sudden.

579
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,548
Maybe subway.
Maybe she wants to find a train, huh?

580
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,550
How deep up your ass did you pull that out?

581
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,470
- It depends. How deep does your tongue go?
- You lost her, man.

582
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,555
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

583
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,599
We're professionals, we count on each other.

584
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,477
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

585
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,270
Even Hughie, a fucking white Urkel,

586
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,231
- is more professional than you.
- It's hard

587
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,233
for someone who's anally OCD to understand.

588
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,026
Then help me understand, Frenchie.

589
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,570
What happened the night
Mallory had you tail Lamplighter?

590
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:19,825
- Oh, that's enough.
- Mallory was our boss, man. We had orders.

591
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:23,245
And you were supposed to follow him.
You were supposed to follow Lamplighter,

592
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,413
- tail him, but you let him go.
- I didn't know.

593
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,958
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

594
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,919
- I didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

595
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,172
You didn't follow orders and it costs some lives.

596
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,425
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

597
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,220
- Knock it off.
- You know what?

598
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,097
Fuck this, Butcher.

599
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,225
And fuck you. I'm done!

600
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,769
- Stupid fucker...
- M.M., wait.

601
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,773
You said this time would be different.

602
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:54,609
But this motherfucker's still here
doing the same old shit.

603
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:57,612
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

604
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:00,407
- Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
- Fuck this.

605
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,658
Oi, both of you.

606
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,910
- M.M.
- What?

607
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,163
What's Sporty Spice up to?

608
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,040
Who?

609
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,459
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

610
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,339
I don't know.

611
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:19,175
Exactly. How about Posh?

612
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:21,344
- You know what she's doing?
- I don't understand.

613
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,972
Making clothes for anorexics. Right?

614
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,057
Not exactly a growth market.

615
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,685
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

616
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,397
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

617
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,608
And Scary Spice?

618
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:38,737
Up to her eyeballs in lawsuits and sex tapes.

619
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,156
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

620
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:45,994
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream if You Wanna go Faster.

621
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,164
They'll all make your ears bleed.

622
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,666
You see, when they're apart,

623
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,419
they're absolute fucking rubbish.

624
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,881
But you put them together,

625
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,843
they're the goddamn fucking Spice Girls.

626
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,643
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

627
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:14,064
Look, the point is,

628
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:18,568
that we're all shite by ourselves.

629
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,612
We need each other.

630
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:24,574
We need each other,
or we're fucking dead in the water.

631
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,493
You guys can beat the living fucking shit

632
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,745
out of each other, I really don't care,

633
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,997
it ain't gonna change the past.

634
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,757
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

635
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,344
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

636
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,351
Jesus, he gives the worst pep talks.

637
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,061
He really, really does.

638
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,696
Yes, yes, yes!

639
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,906
That's right.

640
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,825
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

641
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,619
That's right. That's right.

642
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,873
What?

643
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:17,127
Okay. Okay, yeah.

644
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,005
I mean, let's just focus on the escape first
and, you know,

645
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,424
we can talk about that some other time.

646
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,096
Well, I like you, too. You know that.

647
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,557
But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

648
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,896
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

649
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,191
Plus, you're making things awkward.

650
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,654
Okay, okay! If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

651
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,744
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

652
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:52,495
I made you a promise.

653
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,043
Shit.

654
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,554
- Let's go.
- No, Frenchie.

655
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,514
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

656
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,979
A-Train! Over here! Look, everybody!

657
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,772
It's A-Train right over here!

658
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:43,982
Look, it's A-Train!

659
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,069
Hey.

660
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,989
Cool, look who's here.

661
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,532
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

662
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:56,244
A-Train, hey.
Hey, can we take a selfie?

663
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,956
Oh, sure, absolutely. I can take one or two.

664
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,916
A-Train, over here.

665
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,612
No. Let me talk to her.

666
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,655
Don't be fucking stupid.

667
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,075
What if she's a Spice Girl?

668
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,787
Frenchie.

669
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,769
Let me help you go home.

670
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:40,974
She ain't no Spice Girl.

671
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,439
Once again, the horrific wreckage
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

672
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:31,733
just beginning to wash up on shore.

673
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:35,111
Every passenger onboard presumed dead.

674
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,865
They didn't have to die.

675
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,578
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

676
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,246
Do you have a comment?

677
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,791
I said they didn't have to die.

678
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,462
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

679
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,047
And why?

680
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,759
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

681
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,180
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

682
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,639
then we could've saved them.

683
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:07,727
One hundred and twenty-three men,
women and children.

684
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,771
Excuse me.

685
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:18,738
But if they let us into the military,

686
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,991
then this will never happen again.

687
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,452
That is my solemn promise to you.

688
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,413
Right, Maeve?

689
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,876
Talk to your congressmen.

690
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,961
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

691
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,172
And together...

692
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,509
Together, we will make sure
that this never happens

693
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,970
to our great nation ever again!

694
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,184
God bless you.

695
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,019
God bless America.

696
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,771
We hear you, Homelander!

697
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:55,942
And I hear you, brother! I hear you!

698
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,153
And the world hears you!

699
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:01,989
And very, very soon, my friend,

700
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:05,535
whoever did this to us will hear from all of us!

701
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:11,416
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!
