He crossed a continent
to serve me.

6
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,757
He was a loyal friend.

7
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,636

There's something I want
to do, something I...

58
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,252
have to do.

59
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,588
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,173
Bitterly.

61
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,426
Half the men

I give the order.

62
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,388
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

63
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,390
Do it.

64
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,933
But you don't know
what it is.

65
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,186
That doesn't matter.

66
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,521
You do.

67
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,527
You will find little joy
in your command.

68
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,738
But with luck,

69
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:55,410
you will find
the strength to do
what needs to be done.

70
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,289
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

Where have they gone?

76
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,443
Who leads them?

77
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,654
They followed Mance.

78
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,448
They won't follow
anyone else.

79
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,036
What about you?

80
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,207
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

81
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,420
What if I unchained you?

82
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,382
Why would you do that?

83
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,343
Because you
are not my enemy.

84
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,178
And I'm not yours.

85
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,806
You sure seemed like
my enemy when you were
killing my friends.

86
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,475
For 8,000 years
the Night's Watch
have sworn an oath

87
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,521
to be the shield
that guards the realms
of men.

88
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,066
And for 8,000 years
we've fallen short
of that oath.

89
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,319
You belong
to the realms of men.

90
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,154
All of you.

91
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,116
And now everything
is going to change?

92
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,867
- It is.
- Why now?

93
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,122
Because now
I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

94
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,208
What would you
have me do,

95
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,669
Lord Commander?

96
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,506
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

97
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,302
Gather the remaining
free folk wherever they are
and bring them back here.

98
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,638
I'll open the gates
for them and let
them through.

99
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,725
I'll find them
lands to settle
south of the Wall.

100
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,645
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

101
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,356
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

102
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,026
I want them
to fight with me
when the time comes.

103
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,653
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

104
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,614
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

105
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,074
and make me eat them.

106
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,535
And how many
of your people
can't fight?

107
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,830
The women,
the children,
the old, the sick--

108
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,999
what happens to them?

109
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,876
You're condemning
them to death.

110
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,755
Worse than death
because you're too proud
to make peace.

111
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,302
Or maybe
you're not proud.

112
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,805
Maybe you're
just a coward.

113
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,857
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

114
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,925
Your people
need a leader.

115
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,303
And they need
to get south of the Wall
before it's too late.

116
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,305
We don't have much time
and they have less.

117
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,768
The walkers are coming
and they'll hit your
people first.

118
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,938
I'm not asking
you to make peace
to save your skin.

119
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,775
Make peace to save
your people.

120
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,536
Most of them
are at Hardhome.

121
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,829
You know where that is?

122
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,288
Up on Storrold's Point.

123
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,958
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

124
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,918
You can get there
in a week.

125
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,546
We'll need ships.

126
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,507
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

127
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,429
All right, then.

128
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,434
You're coming with me.

129
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,270
<i>You're the Lord Commander</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

130
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,439
They need
to hear it from you.

131
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,816
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

132
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,152
won't be torched
in the middle of the sea.

133
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:02,490
You come with me
or I don't go.

134
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,120
<i>( men shouting )</i>

135
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,165
( shouting continues )

136
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,917
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

137
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,671
Men, women, and children
will die by the thousands
if we do nothing.

138
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,716
Let them die.
We got our own
to worry about.

139
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,969
- Less enemies for us.
- ( cheering )

140
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,596
Fewer.

141
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,307
- What?
- Nothing.

142
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,060
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

143
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,521
- ( men laughing )
- Land that no one uses now.

144
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,148
A dozen
abandoned villages.

145
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,734
And why do you think
the farmers abandoned
those villages?

146
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,196
<i>Because the wildlings</i>
<i>raided them for years.</i>

147
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,699
Cut them down just like
they did this boy's people.

148
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,368
Men:
Aye!

149
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,122
Alliser:
<i>We've been fighting them</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

150
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,208
They've slaughtered
villages.

151
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,543
<i>They've slaughtered</i>
<i>our brothers.</i>

152
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,378
And we've slaughtered theirs.

153
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:04,219
I will follow
you anywhere,
you know that.

154
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,721
- But they killed Grenn.
- Men: Yes.

155
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,349
- And they killed Pyp.
- Men: Aye.

156
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>They killed 50</i>
<i>of our brothers.</i>

157
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,145
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

158
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,605
I can't forgive it.

159
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,274
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

160
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,110
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

161
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,363
<i>We can learn to live</i>
<i>with the wildlings</i>

162
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,907
<i>or we can add them</i>
<i>to the army of the dead.</i>

163
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,370
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

164
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,372
( all arguing )

165
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,935
<i>( pounding at door )</i>

166
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,941
Thank you.

167
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
<i>Olly.</i>

168
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,781
<i>If you have something</i>
<i>you want to say to me,</i>

169
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,616
<i>say it.</i>

170
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,250
It's all right.

171
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,588
You don't mean it,
do you?

172
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,966
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

173
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,176
You're just doing it
to trick them.

174
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,636
It's not a trick.

175
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,179
They burned my village.

176
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,307
They put an arrow
through my father's head

177
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,850
right in front of me.

178
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,186
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

179
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,363
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

180
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,285
I know this is hard
for you.

181
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,497
But winter is coming.

182
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,168
We know what's
coming with it.

183
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,128
We can't face it alone.

184
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,845
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

185
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,350
No.

186
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,775
( sighs )

187
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,152
- ( horse neighs )
-<i> ( people chatting )</i>

188
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,704
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

189
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>( door opens )</i>

190
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,085
<i>( door closes )</i>

191
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,053
She's far away
from the Lannisters.

192
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,763
<i>This is her home.</i>

193
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,726
Maybe Lady Sansa's
better off here.

194
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,271
Better off
with the Boltons

195
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,108
who murdered
her mother and brother?

196
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,577
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

197
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,496
<i>( door opens )</i>

198
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,260
Thank you.

199
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,888
You've lived here
a long time?

200
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,684
Aye.

201
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,270
Did you know Lord Eddard?

202
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,524
I knew him

203
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,027
and his father
before him.

204
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,239
The Starks are gone now.

205
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,074
Not all of them.

206
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,869
<i>I know who's inside</i>
<i>that castle.</i>

207
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,871
Everyone knows.

208
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,330
The Boltons.

209
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,583
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

210
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,420
I need to get
a message to her.

211
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,130
To Sansa Stark.

212
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,800
Who are you?

213
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,636
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

214
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,513
Swore to who?

215
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,599
Her mother.

216
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,684
Her mother's dead.

217
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,395
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

218
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,151
I served Lady Catelyn.

219
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,570
I serve her still.

220
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,199
Who do you serve?

221
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,582
Ramsay:
<i>Come back here.</i>

222
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,587
Myranda.

223
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,506
I saw you
staring at her.

224
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,299
I'm going to marry her.

225
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,636
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

226
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,766
You said you'd marry me.

227
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,519
And I meant it.

228
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,896
When I was a bastard
named Snow.

229
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,148
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>

230
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:13,361
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

231
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,738
I'm furthering a dynasty.

232
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,076
Do you think
she's pretty?

233
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,662
( scoffs )
Of course I do.

234
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,205
I'm not blind.

235
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,669
( sighs )

236
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,887
You think
she's pretty, too.

237
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,976
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

238
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,646
But don't worry,
I'll have plenty
of time for you.

239
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,440
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

240
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,068
( laughs )

241
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,323
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

242
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,577
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

243
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,627
You're mine.

244
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,588
You're not going
anywhere.

245
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,007
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

246
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,802
Jealousy bores me.
You remember what happens
to people who bore me.

247
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,475
You're not
going to bore me,
are you, Myranda?

248
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,037
Never.

249
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,350
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

250
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,482
Beg pardon, my lady.

251
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,859
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

252
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,819
Oh, I don't need--

253
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,573
You still have
friends in the North.

254
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,408
If you're ever
in trouble,

255
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,996
light a candle
in the highest window
of the broken tower.

256
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,791
- But who--
- You're not alone.

257
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,497
I like your dress.

258
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,959
Who made it for you?

259
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,670
I made it myself.

260
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,547
Really?

261
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,384
Who-- who are you?

262
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,471
I'm Myranda,
the kennel master's
daughter.

263
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,018
May I?

264
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,316
Oh, wonderful.

265
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,277
The stitching.

266
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,655
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

267
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,827
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

268
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,120
Thank you.

269
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,166
It's good
that she taught you.

270
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,667
It was a gift.

271
00:22:56,751 --> 00:23:01,589
Now every time you wear
something you made,

272
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,466
you can remember her.

273
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,092
I'd rather
have a mother.

274
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,763
I know.
It's not the same.

275
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:12,433
Still, it's good
to remember.

276
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,685
Remember the way
things were.

277
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,939
I almost forgot.

278
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,901
There's something else

279
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,361
<i>to help you remember.</i>

280
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,496
<i>( dogs barking )</i>

281
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,123
Down there
at the end.

282
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,918
What is it?

283
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,795
That would spoil
the surprise.

284
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,171
<i>( dogs growling )</i>

285
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,257
Go ahead,
it's perfectly safe.

286
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,551
You won't believe it
when you see it.

287
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,054
<i>( growling continues )</i>

288
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,014
<i>( dogs barking )</i>

289
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,357
-<i> ( barking continues )</i>
-<i> ( chains rattling )</i>

290
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,365
Theon?

291
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,669
You shouldn't be here.

292
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,645
<i>( wind whistling )</i>

293
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,985
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

294
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,239
Pour me some wine.

295
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,641
Do you have
something to tell me?

296
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,560
No, my lord.

297
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,270
Reek.

298
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,151
She saw me.

299
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,527
Who?

300
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,405
Sansa.
Lady Sansa.

301
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,241
She came to the kennels.

302
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,826
She saw you?

303
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,204
Yes.
I'm sorry, master.

304
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,248
Forgive me.
I didn't think--

305
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,041
Come here.

306
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,261
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

307
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,971
Get on your knees.

308
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,485
Give me your hand.

309
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,384
I forgive you.

310
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,857
I trust you
find your chamber
suitable, my lady.

311
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,942
Yes, thank you,
my lord.

312
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,652
Allow me.

313
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,325
Mother.

314
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,118
Thank you, Ramsay.

315
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:55,883
My lady,
we are all a family,
we northerners.

316
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,386
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

317
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,389
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

318
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,809
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

319
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,102
to the Last Hearth.

320
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,021
To your wedding.

321
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,856
To your wedding.

322
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,908
It must be difficult
for you being in
a strange place.

323
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,452
This isn't
a strange place.
This is my home.

324
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,871
It's the people
who are strange.

325
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,086
You're right.

326
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,587
Very strange.

327
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,425
More wine, please.

328
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,810
Ramsay:
<i>I heard you two</i>
<i>had been reunited.</i>

329
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,938
A fitting place for it.

330
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,984
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

331
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,986
was in this very room.

332
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,367
<i>Are you still</i>
<i>angry with him</i>

333
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,202
<i>after he...</i>

334
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,166
what he did?

335
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,544
Don't worry.

336
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,629
The North remembers.

337
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,216
I punished him
for it.

338
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,468
He's not ironborn
anymore.

339
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,721
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

340
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,557
He's a new man.

341
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,145
A new person, anyway.

342
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,813
Aren't you, Reek?

343
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,481
Yes, master.

344
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,775
That's his
new name-- Reek.

345
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,027
Why are you doing this?

346
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,991
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

347
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,576
Don't you, Reek?

348
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,588
An apology.

349
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:07,556
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

350
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,059
Apologize for murdering
her two brothers.

351
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,275
I'm sorry.

352
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,738
Look at her, Reek.

353
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,490
<i>An apology</i>
<i>doesn't mean anything</i>

354
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,284
<i>if you're not looking</i>
<i>the person in the eye.</i>

355
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,627
- I'm sorry.
- Ramsay:<i> Sorry about what?</i>

356
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,421
For killing your brothers.

357
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,893
There, over and done with.

358
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,438
<i>Doesn't everyone</i>
<i>feel better? I do.</i>

359
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,317
That was getting
very tense.

360
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,818
Whew.

361
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,824
You know what,
my lady?

362
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,744
What with him
having murdered
your brothers

363
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,288
and the rest
of your family gone...

364
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,503
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

365
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,547
that you have left.

366
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,008
Reek.

367
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,760
You will give away
the bride.

368
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:33,100
Someone has to.
What better person?

369
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,726
Good? Good?

370
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,146
Yes, yes, very good.

371
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,940
Wonderful.

372
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,486
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

373
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,530
since we're all together.

374
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,037
We're going
to have a baby.

375
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,128
I'm very happy for you.

376
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,130
From the way
she's carrying,

377
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,133
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

378
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,358
Ramsay:
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

379
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,485
Sure of what?

380
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,487
That she's pregnant.

381
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,489
I mean...

382
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,241
how can you tell?

383
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:34,119
Maester Wolkan
has assured us
beyond all doubt.

384
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,089
So how did
you manage it?

385
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,924
Manage what?

386
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,302
Getting her pregnant.

387
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,429
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

388
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,557
Of course,
but how did you...

389
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,184
find it?

390
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,353
You disgraced yourself
at dinner

391
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,897
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

392
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,441
- And if it's a boy?
- ( chuckles )

393
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,320
You're worried about
your position.

394
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,614
My position
is quite clear.

395
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,241
I'm your son

396
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,952
until a better
alternative comes along.

397
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,506
You've never asked me
about your mother.

398
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,221
Why would I?

399
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,849
She had me,
she died.

400
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,977
And here we are.

401
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,563
She was a peasant girl.

402
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,774
Pretty in a common
sort of way.

403
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,276
She was the miller's wife.

404
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,072
Apparently
they had married without
my knowledge or consent.

405
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,573
So I had him hanged

406
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,910
and I took her
beneath the tree
where he was swaying.

407
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,079
She fought me
the whole time.

408
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,331
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

409
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,583
<i>A year later</i>
<i>she came to my gates</i>

410
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,919
<i>with a squalling baby</i>
<i>in her arms.</i>

411
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,255
<i>A baby she claimed</i>
<i>was mine.</i>

412
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,340
I nearly had her whipped

413
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,342
and the child
thrown in the river.

414
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,391
But then I looked at you

415
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,352
<i>and I saw then</i>
<i>what I see now.</i>

416
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,479
You are my son.

417
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,120
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

418
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,581
But he won't
stay for long.

419
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,459
He wants the Iron Throne,

420
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,087
and the road
to King's Landing comes
right through Winterfell.

421
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,132
He means to take the North.

422
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,053
But the North is ours.

423
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,931
It's yours and mine.

424
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,684
Will you help me
defeat him?

425
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,812
Yes.

426
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,324
Is this every
book there is?

427
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,409
Every book there is?

428
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:23,455
- In the world.
- Well, no.

429
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,209
There are thousands
and thousands of books
out there.

430
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,044
This library is rather
small, actually.

431
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,171
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

432
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,216
My father's not
the most literate man.

433
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:39,888
They say the Citadel
has the largest library
in the world.

434
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,599
Where's that?

435
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,519
The Citadel?

436
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,354
In Oldtown.

437
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,362
I'm sorry
I don't know things.

438
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,365
Oh, Gilly,
look at me.

439
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,077
<i>You know how to do</i>
<i>a hundred things</i>
<i>I can never do.</i>

440
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,329
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

441
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,165
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

442
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:09,751
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

443
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,171
- Well...
- Why does the Citadel have
the biggest library?

444
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,216
<i>It's where they train</i>
<i>the maesters.</i>

445
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,884
Like Maester Aemon?

446
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,762
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

447
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,894
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

448
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,066
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

449
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,820
I wouldn't have met you.

450
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
<i>( footsteps )</i>

451
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,452
Ah, Your Grace.

452
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,254
You're Samwell Tarly?

453
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,299
I am,
Your Grace.

454
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,593
Your father
is Randyll Tarly.

455
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:06,182
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

456
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,311
<i>Only battle</i>
<i>Robert ever lost.</i>

457
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,981
I told him he shouldn't
go so far west so soon,
but he never listened.

458
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,320
<i>Fine soldier,</i>
<i>your father.</i>

459
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,156
You don't look
like a soldier.

460
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,409
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

461
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,119
I did, Your Grace.

462
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,370
<i>How?</i>

463
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,789
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

464
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,999
Dragonglass?

465
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,542
What the maesters
call obsidian.

466
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,794
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

467
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,172
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

468
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,632
I don't know.

469
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,717
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

470
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,802
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

471
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,931
is that the children
of the forest used to
hunt with dragonglass.

472
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,935
The Lady Melisandre
told me that death
marches on the Wall.

473
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,648
I've seen it,
Your Grace.

474
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,316
Seen what?

475
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,069
The army of the dead.

476
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:03,114
- And when they come--
- We have to know how
to fight them.

477
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,745
Keep reading,
Samwell Tarly.

478
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,723
It's time.

479
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,850
Uh, Your Grace.

480
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,019
Wouldn't it
be better to wait?

481
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,356
When Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings, we could
have thousands more men.

482
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,191
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

483
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,110
We can't wait that long.

484
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:43,196
We have the advantage--
more men, more horses,
all fed and rested.

485
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,616
<i>But every day we wait,</i>
<i>the odds shift in</i>
<i>Bolton's favor.</i>

486
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,451
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

487
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,412
We have to act now.
Give the order.

488
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,871
We march at sunrise.

489
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,748
I'll choose
a dozen men to stay

490
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,334
and guard the queen
and the princess.

491
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,503
No need.
They're coming with us.

492
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,798
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

493
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,426
- Won't they be safer--
- Here?

494
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:09,305
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

495
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,391
No, they march with us.

496
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,438
As you wish,
Your Grace.

497
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,273
( wind howling )

498
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,284
-<i> ( chatter )</i>
-<i> ( horses snorting )</i>

499
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,591
Shireen:
<i>Do you think Father will let</i>
<i>me go down into the crypt?</i>

500
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,468
Davos:
Beg your pardon?

501
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,136
At Winterfell.

502
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,138
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

503
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,973
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and--

504
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,309
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

505
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
And then we have
to take the castle.

506
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,188
Is there going
to be a battle?

507
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,398
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near--

508
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,485
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

509
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,278
You'll scare the child.

510
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,655
Davos:
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

511
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,036
- I'm not scared.
- Well, I am.

512
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,122
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

513
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,083
I promise.

514
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,397
I hope you know
what you're doing
with these wildlings.

515
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,691
I need those ships.

516
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,987
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

517
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,866
Have a safe journey,
Your Grace.

518
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,702
And thank you.

519
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,567
Man:
<i>Mount up!</i>

520
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,443
<i>Colors!</i>

521
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,578
<i>( horses neighing )</i>

522
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,951
( groans )

523
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,912
No.

524
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,039
You're still too weak.

525
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:25,501
( speaking Valyrian )

526
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,426
Ser Barristan?

527
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,454
<i>Are you ashamed?</i>

528
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,458
<i>You were ambushed,</i>
<i>outnumbered.</i>

529
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,335
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>you could have known.</i>

530
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,587
This is not why.

531
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,384
Wounded in war,

532
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,553
there is no shame
for this.

533
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,639
I am ashamed

534
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,475
because when
the knife go in

535
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,645
and I fall to the ground,

536
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,689
I am afraid.

537
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,192
All men fear death.

538
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,112
No, not death.

539
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,242
I fear

540
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:44,872
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

541
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,286
Now you have
given the Masters
what they deserve.

542
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,871
If I give everyone
what they deserve,

543
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,206
I'll have no one
left to rule.

544
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,542
Ser Barristan
counseled mercy

545
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,503
when I took
this city right up
to the morning he died.

546
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,256
<i>Daario Naharis</i>
<i>thinks I should kill</i>
<i>the former Masters</i>

547
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,885
<i>and let the rest</i>
<i>of the city fend</i>
<i>for itself.</i>

548
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,762
What do you think?

549
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,349
Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

550
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,642
to have an opinion
on these matters.

551
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:49,520
You are as fit
as anyone I know.

552
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,815
You know why I'm here.

553
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,194
And you know who
will suffer the most
if this all falls apart.

554
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,113
<i>So what do you think?</i>

555
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:05,078
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

556
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:09,707
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

557
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,628
I have seen you
lean on their experience
when your own was lacking

558
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:18,341
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

559
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,719
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

560
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,599
because there was
a better choice.

561
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,185
One that only
you could see.

562
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,247
My-- my queen,
please do not do this.

563
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,040
<i>What about</i>
<i>"valar morghulis"?</i>

564
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,918
I did not want
to die a coward.

565
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,092
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

566
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,969
( sniffles )

567
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,681
It takes courage
to admit fear.

568
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,393
And to admit a mistake.

569
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,354
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

570
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:19,110
I was wrong
and you were right.

571
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,613
About tradition.

572
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:27,243
About bringing the people
of this city together.

573
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,707
I will reopen
the fighting pits.

574
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,334
To free men only.

575
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:39,630
Slavery will never
return to Meereen,
not while I live.

576
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,549
Yes, my queen.

577
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,973
And in order to forge
a lasting bond with
the Meereenese people,

578
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,809
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

579
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,106
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

580
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,178
Don't worry.

581
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,473
I'll be fine.
Nothing broken,
I don't think.

582
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,602
Where are we now?

583
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,646
Not the Rhoyne.

584
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,154
Long, sullen silences

585
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:48,741
and an occasional
punch in the face.

586
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,912
The Mormont way.

587
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:58,459
Let's start over.

588
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,046
I apologize for before.

589
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,258
<i>My mouth sometimes</i>
<i>runs away from me.</i>

590
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,052
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

591
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,935
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together
on the way to Meereen.

592
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,395
We are.

593
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:22,358
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

594
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,110
would be some wine.

595
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,445
No wine.

596
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,785
I am a person who drinks.

597
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,455
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

598
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,749
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>they're not...</i>

599
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,800
I know where we are.

600
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,219
You're taking us
through Valyria.

601
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,762
I am.

602
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,806
Have you sailed
this route before?

603
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,391
No.

604
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,310
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

605
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,770
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

606
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,273
I think you'll be plenty.

607
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,568
<i>You know what they say.</i>

608
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,654
The Doom
still rules Valyria.

609
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:12,491
What about the demons
and the flames?

610
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,493
<i>Aren't you afraid</i>
<i>of the Doom?</i>

611
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,537
Jorah:
<i>No.</i>

612
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:19,749
But pirates are.

613
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,917
Oh.

614
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,673
Tyrion:
The Smoking Sea.

615
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,634
How many centuries
before we learn

616
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,845
how to build cities
like this again?

617
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,514
For thousands of years
the Valyrians were

618
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:39,602
the best in the world
at almost everything.

619
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,729
And then...

620
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,482
And then they weren't.

621
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,275
And then they weren't.

622
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:53,699
"They held each other
close and turned their
backs upon the end.

623
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,410
<i>The hills</i>
<i>that split asunder</i>

624
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,413
and the black
that ate the skies;

625
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,666
The flames that shot
so high and hot

626
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,501
that even dragons burned;

627
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,461
Would never be
the final sights

628
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,922
that fell upon
their eyes.

629
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,883
A fly upon a wall,

630
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,804
the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned--"

631
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,890
"The city
of a thousand years,

632
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,934
and all that men
had learned;

633
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,396
The Doom consumed
it all alike,

634
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,107
and neither
of them turned."

635
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,195
I would clap.

636
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,619
I suppose
this is it, then.

637
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,039
This is what remains.

638
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,620
<i>( water splashes )</i>

639
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,373
What was that?

- ( rasping )
- Stone Men!

641
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,549
Don't let them
touch you!

642
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,734
Get behind!

643
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,781
Mormont, cut me free!

644
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,115
Mormont!

645
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,163
( rasping )

646
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,959
( snarls )

647
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,591
Mormont!

648
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,510
- Mormont!
- ( shouts )

649
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,964
( faintly )
Tyrion?

650
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,719
Tyrion.

651
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,304
Tyrion.

652
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:05,474
Tyrion.

653
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,811
You're all right.

654
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,656
You're heavier
than you look.

655
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,661
Did any of them
touch you?

656
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,207
You?

657
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,132
I've seen
greyscale before,

658
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,758
but nothing like that.

659
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:44,221
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

660
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:48,100
It'd be kinder to put
daggers in their hearts
and be done with it.

661
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:55,316
Thank you for saving me.

662
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,654
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

663
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,823
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

664
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,330
So what now?

665
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,332
We walk
up the coast.

666
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,542
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

667
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,628
Maybe another boat.

668
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,546
Without luck?

669
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,382
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

670
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,346
I'll get some wood
for a fire.

671
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,265
Try to get
some rest, huh?

672
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,143
That's the best idea
you've had all day.

673
00:55:22,987 --> 00:56:41,065
