1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,591
Give me your hand.

2
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,526
Did you cut it?

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,862
You try to kill yourself, huh?

4
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,364
I heard you named me in your suicide note.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,008
You said you can't go on because of me.

6
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,674
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,303
- What a disrespectful loser.
- You motherfucker.

8
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,747
If you transfer afterwards,
how does that make me look?

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,291
- Have I ever fucking hit you, huh?
- No, never.

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,960
No, right? That's right.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,753
He's all yours.

12
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,429
There.

13
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,431
You asshole! You asshole!

14
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,950
- Hit me back, asshole.
- No, wait.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,938
- Please, stop.
- Hey.

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,207
- Stop.
- Hey!

17
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,834
Just fucking stop!

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,783
You psycho.

19
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,016
Get up. You bastard!

20
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,004
- Hey, you splash me!
- Shit!

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,012
Are you out
of your fucking mind, man?

22
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,727
Asshole.

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,979
Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,523
Motherfucker!

25
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,238
Fuck.

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,647
All right. Knock it off.

27
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,090
Let's go. Come on, we're out of here.

28
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,889
You fucker.

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,516
Get him off!

30
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,185
Cut it out already.

31
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,813
Come on.

32
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,996
What? You scared?

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,207
Not at all. I'm not scared.

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,667
Yeah, whatever.

35
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,466
Shit.

36
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,094
His BP is okay, but he's drowsy.

37
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,680
He has severe edema
in the back of his head

38
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,975
and tenderness in his left thorax
so I say TBI and abdominal bleeding.

39
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,477
I'll transfer him right away
for emergency surgery.

40
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,355
If he isn't in surgery within an hour,
he'll be DOA no question.

41
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,232
Yes.

42
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,693
We'll intubate him,
put in a c-line, then send him over.

43
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,444
Yeah.

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,071
Okay.

45
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,159
What the hell is taking them so long?
I called two hours ago.

46
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,412
RESTRICTED AREA

47
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,386
Dad.

48
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,932
Are they okay?

49
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,102
- Huh?
- I'm sorry, Dad.

50
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,395
I knew it wasn't right,

51
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,106
but I wanted to kill them.

52
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,819
It'll never happen again, Dad.

53
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,321
It's okay.

54
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,074
Do you mean that, Dad?

55
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,658
It'll all be okay, son.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,452
What's gonna be okay, huh?

57
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,662
Everything.

58
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
All of it.

59
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,626
Has anything gotten better?

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,296
Just answer me.

61
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,383
Has anything gotten better, Dad?

62
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,010
Either I die...

63
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,845
...or they die.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,889
It won't get better until someone dies.

65
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,353
Jin-su.

66
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,854
Stop!

67
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm gonna kill them all.

68
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,569
Stop it, Jin-su.

69
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,154
No!

70
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,993
Jin-su. I'll fix everything,
just stop, okay? Jin-su.

71
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,160
Do you wanna die, Dad?

72
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,788
Should I kill you?

73
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,082
Son, you need to stop it!

74
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,276
I'm sorry, Jin-su.

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,325
HOLY BIBLE

76
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,743
I love you.

77
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,169
Jin-su.

78
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,245
Tag. I got you.

79
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,164
TEACHER'S OFFICE

80
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,290
Over here.

81
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,810
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, how are you?

82
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,841
- Ms. Jung. I'm heading out, okay?
- See you tomorrow.

83
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,404
- Okay. See you.
- Bye.

84
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,699
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Keep up the good work

85
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,433
and don't forget your homework, alright?

86
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,629
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

87
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,990
<i>The seemingly never-ending heat
has finally died down.</i>

88
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:15,286
<i>And the muggy, scorching weather
has been replaced by a fresh, cool breeze.</i>

89
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,081
Today, our topic
is a fascinating study from abroad.

90
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,460
A psychologist in the US
conducted an experiment.

91
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,505
He gathered 48 men and women
who had never met.

92
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,988
To one group, he gave a specific...

93
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,014
Well, maybe next time
you should learn how to pass the ball.

94
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,224
Whoa, look out.

95
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,934
Hey.

96
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,354
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

97
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,606
I don't know about that.

98
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,027
Where are you going? Wait up!

99
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,446
What the...

100
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,449
Idiot. Come here.

101
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,331
WE ROOT FOR
THE HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL ARCHERY TEAM

102
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,402
Let's go
get <i>tteokbokki</i> later.

103
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,588
Shouldn't we
wake up Hyeon-ju?

104
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,332
But it's so yummy.

105
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,471
Oh, she's just fine.

106
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,083
Ah, shit! I told them to wake me up.

107
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,654
What the?

108
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,842
Hey.

109
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,014
Hey.

110
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,641
Come here.

111
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,811
Where are you going?

112
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,605
Damn it. Won't listen.

113
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,399
Hey.

114
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,276
Hey.

115
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,862
Hey.

116
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,323
Oh...

117
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,827
What the hell? You bastard.

118
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,053
What are you doing?

119
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,682
Nothing. It bit me. I'm pissed.

120
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,434
Goodbye.

121
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,782
So the restaurant moved?
How about a grand opening?

122
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,075
But we're not doing one.

123
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,952
What? What...

124
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,536
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

125
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,831
Seriously? I told them to change the name.

126
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,082
What about the old name?

127
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,668
We're not doing it.
The fryer hasn't even come in yet.

128
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,587
I heard there'll be one.

129
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,857
MOM: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
CHEONG-SAN: CAN YOU NOT USE MY NAME?

130
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,984
I mean, I would know better than you,
don't you think?

131
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,402
MOM: OKAY. SO WHICH ONE?
CHEONG-SAN: MOM...

132
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,052
My mom's the worst.

133
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,598
- Hey.
- Damn, my phone!

134
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,932
You can't run away.

135
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,144
Hey, gopher. Let's get some chicken.

136
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,437
But we're not open yet.

137
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,521
Sure you are.

138
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,541
Your mom says she's testing out
a new recipe today.

139
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,484
You're going, right?

140
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,693
Of course.

141
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,405
- Are you going too?
- Mm. Yes.

142
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,966
I mean your mom told On-jo
to bring her friends.

143
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,700
Uh, so, is this a double date?

144
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
What the hell?

145
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,413
- Weird, we're not open today.
- Cool.

146
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,582
Uh, what do you know?
Let's get out of here.

147
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,690
- You like chicken that much?
- Oh, you bet.

148
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,874
I'm gonna eat two whole ones.

149
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,347
Looks great. Thank you.

150
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,532
- Thanks a lot.
- It looks so good.

151
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,658
- Why'd you bring out so much?
- Oh, yes.

152
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,392
Remember On-jo eats a lot.

153
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,769
I don't eat a lot.

154
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,686
I just eat well.

155
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, yes, sure. That's what I like to hear.

156
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,898
Eat up, Gyeong-su.

157
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
- Yep.
- You too, A-sak.

158
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
It's I-sak, not A-sak.

159
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,112
You change your name?

160
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,952
Mom. If you wanna change names,
you should start with the restaurant.

161
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,054
Why are you using my name?

162
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,789
I named it Cheongsan Chicken
way before you were born.

163
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,792
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

164
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,210
- Hey. Ah...
- I don't like...

165
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,503
Quiet. Okay.

166
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,939
I really like it. Sounds like a tradition.

167
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,381
- Yeah?
- Of course.

168
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,924
He's right.

169
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,011
Look, so this is a new recipe
we just came up with.

170
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,515
So this one is just a little spicy,
and this one's really hot.

171
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,350
What do you think?

172
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,193
You can be totally honest with me.

173
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,689
It's super crazy mad good.

174
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,898
It's delicious.

175
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,610
- Really?
- Oh, ma'am, look.

176
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,572
If you ever need a delivery boy,
I'll work for cheap.

177
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,490
You guys need to study.

178
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,285
On-jo. Is it too hot?

179
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,745
It's salty.

180
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,122
Yeah?

181
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,205
Oh...

182
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,834
How about this one? Is it spicy?

183
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,711
No. It's salty.

184
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,130
Wait a sec. That's not...

185
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,298
Uhm, honey!

186
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,301
- Yeah?
- She says it's salty.

187
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,051
It's salty?

188
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,095
- On-jo says it's salty.
- Wait, I...

189
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,513
- It can't be.
- It's good.

190
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,700
- Maybe you left...
- I don't think it's salty at all.

191
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,392
- Yeah, it's good.
- It tastes good to me.

192
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,768
Let me see.

193
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,520
Stop eating. It's salty.

194
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,064
It still tastes good.

195
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,651
Ah.

196
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,156
Did you hear our science teacher?

197
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,450
What about him?

198
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,053
Well, he smells like a rotting corpse.

199
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,746
Oh, Na-yeon spread that rumor, right?

200
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,955
It's true.

201
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,207
He was absent after his son went missing.

202
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,542
But then he came into class...

203
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,255
Oh!

204
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,235
<i>...she said
he smelled like a corpse.</i>

205
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,321
<i>How does she know
what a corpse smells like?</i>

206
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,638
<i>Has she smelled one before?</i>

207
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,600
I swear she knows every other smell
except that one.

208
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,728
Since she never smelled it before,
it has to be a rotting corpse.

209
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,230
When his son went missing,
he started acting weird.

210
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,434
He was an outcast.

211
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,193
I heard he got bullied all the time.

212
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,612
Mm-hm. It sucks.

213
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,572
I feel really bad for Mr. Lee.

214
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,867
Remember last week
when he just left class?

215
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,377
BETWEEN TISSUE CELLS

216
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,172
CELLULAR RESPIRATION

217
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,823
Did the bells ring?

218
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,098
<i>He's never done that before.</i>

219
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,829
They say he was a genius.

220
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,539
Lots of geniuses go crazy.

221
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,209
Well, at least you won't have
to worry about going crazy.

222
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,088
Hey. Are you talking trash?

223
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,817
- I'm so full.
- Come on. Hurry up.

224
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,300
We're late anyway.

225
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,552
Cheong-san, hold on.

226
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,306
Why? We're late.
And I have a music test.

227
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,142
I just need to ask you something.

228
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,810
What is it?

229
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,603
- Nothing.
- What?

230
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,897
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

231
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,523
What is it?

232
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,535
Is this better like this?

233
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,370
Or like this?

234
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,289
Look close.

235
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,625
Like this? Or Like this?

236
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,089
This way, right?

237
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,979
Get lost.

238
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,620
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

239
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,696

COMMENDATION
NAM SO-JU

241
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,841
Do exams start next week?

242
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,386
You always bring up tests when I'm eating.

243
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,346
When else should I ask?

244
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,265
Wait a minute.
We have to finish the sprouts.

245
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,809
All right?

246
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,815
I mean, you're not gonna get
good grades anyway.

247
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,359
No point in stressing about it.

248
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,821
Don't give up on me, Dad. I can do it.

249
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,530
I'm not giving up.

250
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,615
Just no expectations.

251
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,034
That's giving up.

252
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,662
Is these from Cheong-san's?

253
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,581
Mmm.

254
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,249
Two days ago...

255
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,547
...there was an accident by a tollgate,
so I went to the scene,

256
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,175
and whether you're rich or poor,
got good grades or bad ones,

257
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,385
everyone's equal in an accident.

258
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,304
Grades are not that important.

259
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,473
Being healthy and safe.
That's all that really matters.

260
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,935
I mean it.
I can make it into tier five this time.

261
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,811
Don't push yourself.

262
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,065
Then I'll make it into tier six, okay?

263
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,526
You shouldn't lie to your dad. Here, eat.

264
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,654
It's salty but tasty.

265
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Cheong-san.

266
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,250
Always on time.

267
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,668
Bye, Dad.

268
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,254
Hey, have another bite, okay?

269
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,172
Hey, kid!

270
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,340
Are you okay?

271
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,718
That punk.

272
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,015
Come on. She basically
didn't eat anything at all.

273
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,478
Guess I should start
with her leftovers, huh.

274
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,315
- Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, shoot!
- One, two, shoot!

275
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:38,445
One, two, shoot!
One, two, shoot! One, two, shoot!

276
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,113
Yeah!

277
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,699
Yes!

278
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,744
I'm seriously going to kill you now.

279
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,249
Hey, On-jo!

280
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,332
Nam On-jo!

281
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,054
Play fair, you punk.

282
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,432
God, I'm spent.

283
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,351
Carry it.

284
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,981
But look at this.
I got hurt making breakfast.

285
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,902
Let's go, gopher.

286
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,537
Nam-ra.

287
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,123
Class president!

288
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,628
Hey, hey! Hurry up!

289
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,674
RESIDENTS ONLY
STUDENTS OF RENTAL APARTMENTS STAY AWAY

290
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,237
- I'm going first!
- Hold up!

291
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,594
Hey, kids!

292
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,138
- Bye.
- Okay.

293
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,517
Hey, kids! You get back here!

294
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,496
Hey you!
You live in the rental apartments.

295
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,360
Hey! You punks!

296
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,442
Hey!

297
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,818
Hello.

298
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,987
See you later!

299
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,905
Wait for me! Shit!

300
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,325
That fucking shithead.

301
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,875
Ji-min!

302
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,252
Share this with your friends
at choir, will you?

303
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,378
I said I don't want it.

304
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,005
Boy, oh, boy.

305
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,091
She skipped breakfast as well.

306
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,913
- Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
- Hurry. Hurry, hurry!

307
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,183
- Wake up five minutes earlier, okay?
- All right, that's it!

308
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,793
Stop right there! Stop, stop, stop!

309
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,504
Put your names down.

310
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,174
Let's see.
One, two, three, four,

311
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,093
five, six, seven, eight.

312
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,385
You have been chosen.

313
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,155
- Please, sir.
- You get three demerits each.

314
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,639
You three are always late.

315
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,310
Get moving.

316
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,909
Hey.

317
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,621
Is it my fault
that idiot Jin-su went missing, huh?

318
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,932
That's not it.

319
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,000
Then why the hell did you decide
to tattle on me, you little prick?

320
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,753
The teacher said
to write down everything we knew.

321
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,130
And what do you know, huh?

322
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,173
Asshole.

323
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,092
Seriously, what the hell do you know?

324
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,053
You're just
freaking unbelievable.

325
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,888
Hey. Go ahead.

326
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,559
Over here. Huh?

327
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,687
Where you looking at, huh?

328
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,565
Uh, fuck!

329
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,962
It's okay. Take it off.

330
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,155
- Hands off.
- Don't you dare move.

331
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,283
Stay still, yeah?

NEW CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

334
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,336
You perverted freak.

335
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,255
You like it?

336
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Hey.

337
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,012
The video.

338
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,725
You asshole.

339
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,479
Go on.

340
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,482
Just press record.

341
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,778
- You wanna die, asshole?
- That's enough.

342
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,448
Stop.

343
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,503
Shit. Son of a bitch.

344
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,092
We're not playing around, you moron.

345
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,473
You used to party with us.

346
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,558
Don't act all holier-than-thou,
you hear me?

347
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,142
Fuck off.

348
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,811
You need to grow up.

349
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,692
Get outta here.

350
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,738
Go ahead.

351
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,325
You might be safe.

352
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,916
Move.

353
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,254
You always gonna be like this?

354
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,507
Go.

355
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,220
You look really sexy in this.

356
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,639
Should I send it to your mom?

357
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,017
You know I'm friends with her on Facebook.

358
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,273
What kind of weirdo
makes friends with an old lady?

359
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,735
I can't go.

360
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,988
It's okay. You can do it.

361
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,533
It's not okay.

362
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,369
Because if I leave now...

363
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,789
it'll be worst tomorrow.

364
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,262
Take it off.

365
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,472
Should I do it for you?

366
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,894
Hurry up, jeez.

367
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,739
- Su-hyeok.
- Hey. Morning.

368
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,795
What?

369
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,797
If you have time,
come to the roof after lunch.

370
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,925
Why? I don't fight anymore.

371
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,303
You think I'd wanna fight you?

372
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,387
Then why?

373
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,722
See you later.

374
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,191
Weird.

375
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,421
Are you changing?

376
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,165
- Give back my ball.
- Seriously.

377
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,843
- You have some water?
- Mine's too warm.

378
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,951
Let me have some.

379
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,721
- Have you heard her...
- I can't hear anything at all actually.

380
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,164
- Are you an idiot?
- Do you hear the song?

381
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,041
Hey, you lost me big-time yesterday.

382
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,894
- Hey.
- No, it's all because of the keyboard!

383
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,395
- I go there all the time.
- Yeah, definitely the keyboard.

384
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,172
- Because the lady who works there is cute.
- I'm telling you, dude

385
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,483
I gave you a head start.

386
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,109
- What are you talking about?
- I said I'd beat you, right?

387
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,885
That's not true.

388
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,988
Gyeong-su beat you, right?

389
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,013
That's bullshit!

390
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,264
What do I do?

391
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,408
Don't bullshit me.

392
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,767
- What?
- I'm serious.

393
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,018
I don't know.

394
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,189
- What do I do?
- Wait. What? Why?

395
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,482
I don't know.

396
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,236
- I'm gonna tell you later.
- Tell me what?

397
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,590
- Uh, It's my crappy keyboard.
- Huh?

398
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,009
- Oh, your keyboard is better than mine.
- That's bullshit.

399
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,909
Sleeping beauty.

400
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,012
- Su-hyeok.
- I smell your feet from here.

401
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,414
This jerk didn't wear socks.

402
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,541
- Hey, hey, hey.
- It's not okay.

403
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,060
- Take him out. Come on.
- Hey.

404
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,293
- Hey.
- Really?

405
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,313
- That's ridiculous.
- Hey, seriously.

406
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,006
- What's the name? Paulo?
- Give me a break.

407
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,984
- Let's break his leg.
- Go ahead.

408
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,778
- Hey!
- Then I'll break his fingers.

409
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,554
Whoa. What the fuck.

410
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,139
Get off of there. You stink.

411
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,890
Oh, okay. My bad.

412
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,977
What's the big deal? Sorry.

413
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,729
Cut it out! You're so dirty.

414
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,730
Hey, what the hell?

415
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,249
Hey, just let it go.

416
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,149
What the hell is your problem?

417
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,150
What I do, huh?

418
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,544
What I do that was so wrong?

419
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,421
- Tell me what I do.
- Hey, you punks.

420
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,697
Come on guys. Take your seats.
Come on, move it.

421
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,741
Attention!

422
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,034
Hi, there.

423
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,536
Hello!

424
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,954
Hi. Good morning.

425
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,457
Time to hand-in your phones.

426
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,454
Who's in touch with Hyeon-ju?

427
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,466
Nobody?

428
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,985
So none of you have tried
calling her today?

429
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,887
Uh, we cleaned the science lab

430
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,140
together yesterday,
but I haven't seen her since.

431
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,017
Okay.

432
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,729
If anyone hears from her
some time the next few days,

433
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,481
let me know right away, okay?

434
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,483
Okay.

435
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,445
Exams start next week,
so get your acts together.

436
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,696
Hey, your phone.

437
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,702
Hey, uh...

438
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,913
I heard that.

439
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:50,872
Why didn't you silence it?

440
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,831
One more time.

441
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,166
Hand over your phones, please.

442
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,503
- Dae-su. Seriously?
- You idiot.

443
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,379
How stupid is he?

444
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,758
Why is it so much fun to mess with him?

445
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,841
Huh?

446
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,326
What you gonna do about it?

447
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,434
On-jo.

448
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,395
This is your phone from last year.

449
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,773
Take it, please.

450
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,652
Take it now.

451
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,989
Uh, hello, Mr. Lee.

452
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,574
- Uh, hello there.
- Hi.

453
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,702
Uh, you know Kim Hyeon-ju from my class?

454
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,246
She didn't make it home last night.

455
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,329
And...

456
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,957
The kids haven't seen her

457
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,960
since she was cleaning
the science lab yesterday.

458
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
Oh, really?

459
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,422
Do you remember seeing her by any chance?

460
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,509
No, I haven't.

461
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,428
Uh, so yesterday you went home

462
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,222
without stopping by
the science lab, right?

463
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,140
That's what I told you.

464
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,476
I...

465
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,853
...I'm sorry.

466
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,398
Apparently, no one seen her
since she was in here, so...

467
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,113
Is someone in there?

468
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,615
Yeah.

469
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,952
It's just a hamster.

470
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:15,248
- Oh...
- I should probably get ready for class.

471
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,749
Oh, okay.

472
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,626
- Thanks.
- Hmm.

473
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,343
SUPPLY ROOM

474
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,564
A student was bit by the hamster.

475
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,276
I injected her with benzodiazepine...

476
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,657
It's only slowing down the infection

477
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,076
by a few hours...

478
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,653
Don't kill me.

479
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,163
Don't kill you?

480
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
Don't bother having any hope.

481
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,599
<i>A virus...</i>

482
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:03,648
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

483
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

484
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,825
Everything that evolves in this manner

485
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,996
should be considered
an independent living organism.

486
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,417
Mr. Lee, the textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

487
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,420
Whether or not it's categorized that way

488
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,381
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

489
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,844
If its will is so strong...

490
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,682
I'M SO SEXY

491
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,814
The instinct to survive
actually surpasses intelligence.

492
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,235
And eventually the ecosystem
is dominated by that will.

493
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,613
Humanity has never once
completely defeated a virus.

494
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,327
<i>Leucochloridium paradoxum.</i>

495
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,498
This parasite's
final destination is a bird.

496
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,629
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its ocular tentacles.

497
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,341
That makes the snail put itself
in the path of predatory birds.

498
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,721
So the infected snail commits suicide
at the whim of the parasite.

499
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,516
Tell me.

500
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,937
Now, is that because the snail
is less intelligent?

501
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,901
It's not.

502
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,738
It's because
the parasite's will to survive

503
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,448
is much stronger than the snail's.

504
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,719
- Shut up when the teacher's talking.
- The evolving...

505
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,870
...and hereditary will to survive is...

506
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,953
Keep your head up.

507
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,459
...the sole standard by which
living organisms are defined.

508
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,337
So is the textbook wrong?

509
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,675
The textbook?

510
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,348
It's wrong.

511
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,661
In fact, none of us
are completely free from prejudice.

512
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,622
We all have
preconceived ideas about others.

513
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,334
Here, "free from" means
the lacking in or unincumbered by.

514
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,212
Anyone want to interpret this?

515
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,299
Okay.

516
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,634
Hee-su.

517
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,512
I need to use the bathroom.

518
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,972
Okay, go.

519
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,434
Okay, then.

520
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,687
Anyone wanna have a crack at it, huh?

521
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,523
Class president?

522
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,154
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

523
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,532
We all have preconceptions
about other people.

524
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,576
Hmm, okay. Nice.

525
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,245
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

526
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,705
Stand up.

527
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,040
Yes?

528
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,458
What's with "Bare-su"?

529
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,918
Mm...

530
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,421
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

531
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,755
Ah.

532
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,425
He hates wearing socks.
He's so weird about it.

533
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,136
I can smell it a mile away.

534
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,973
Okay, Bare-su.

535
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,766
What did Nam-ra say a minute ago?

536
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,769
Ah...

537
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,189
Ah...

538
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,658
She was absolutely correct.
A hundred percent.

539
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,114
What was her absolutely correct
answer then?

540
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,949
Hmm...

541
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,911
All right...

542
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,972
Huh?

543
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,291
Hyeon-ju.

544
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,461
Hey, Hyeon-ju.

545
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,921
Hyeon-ju!

546
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,006
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

547
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,592
- Hey, Hyeon-ju.
- Is that blood?

548
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,843
Ms. Park.

549
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,387
Yeah, it's me. Do you recognize me?

550
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,972
He grabbed me...

551
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,060
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

552
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,579
He locked you up?

553
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,729
The science teacher?

554
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,689
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan, huh?

555
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,441
He tied me up...

556
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,169
I told you, didn't I?

557
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,473
Just shut up, okay?

558
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,112
Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

559
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,948
- What kind of a psycho does this?
- Nam-ra.

560
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,383
Make sure
they study on their own.

561
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,567
And please don't say anything to anyone
until I come back and confirm the facts.

562
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,121
Hyeon-ju. Can you get up?

563
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,039
I'll carry her.

564
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
Okay.

565
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,584
- Can someone help him out, please.
- Here.

566
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,669
- Good.
- Okay.

567
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,439
Go back to your seats!

568
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,464
Now.

569
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,182
- Hyeon-ju.
- What's wrong?

570
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,517
Guys, hold her still.

571
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,021
What's wrong with her?

572
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,320
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

573
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,739
What do I do?

574
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,503
Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

575
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,533
Let me see.

576
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,035
Please help.

577
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,870
- Huh?
- Uh, wait, hold on.

578
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,871
Put her on the bed.

579
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,715
- Please take a look at her.
- Here, lookout.

580
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
Her temperature is way too low.

581
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,966
Here, hold it down
so she doesn't kick it off.

582
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,510
Hold her. Hold her.

583
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,280
- Hyeon-ju, Hyeon-ju. It's okay.
- Call an ambulance right now.

584
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,906
I'll give her a sedative
and clean her wounds.

585
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,930
Okay.

586
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,758
Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

587
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,645
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

588
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,903
EMERGENCY CALL

589
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,716
- Too hot.
- Hang in there, Hyeon-ju.

590
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,110
Your temperature is a little too low.

591
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,719
Too hot. I'm too hot.

592
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,030
You're going to the hospital soon.

593
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,814
We're all here for you,
so don't worry, okay?

594
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,558
The science teacher gave me a weird shot.

595
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,393
A shot?

596
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,854
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a weird shot?

597
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,482
He tried to kill me.

598
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,587
Hey, Hyeon-ju, tell me what shot?

599
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,613
I'm gonna kill them all.

600
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,239
Hyeon-ju.

601
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,119
Hey, are you okay?

602
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,538
- Hold her down so I can give her the shot.
- Okay.

603
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:37,792
Just a minute, okay?

604
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,127
Hyeon-ju. Just hang on.

605
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,235
It's so strange.
Hyeon-ju was really odd.

606
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,177
- Yeah, totally.
- It's weird.

607
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,430
Everyone else saw that, right?
First, she just disappeared all day,

608
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,266
then she comes in all bloody
talking about the science teacher.

609
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,435
She could have gone somewhere
and got hurt,

610
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,455
then came back here
and collapsed all of a sudden.

611
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,815
- It's got to be true.
- Did you hear something?

612
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,152
You know how we heard
his son went missing?

613
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,531
I heard he didn't go missing.

614
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,033
- Suicide.
- Come on, don't fall for that.

615
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:11,951
- That's silly.
- He committed suicide?

616
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,787
- You believe that?
- No, really. It's true, okay?

617
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,582
Hyeon-ju hung out with the same crowd
that bullied Jin-su all the time.

618
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,752
So the science teacher
went after them one-by-one.

619
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,878
He hunted them down.

620
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,756
- And kill them.
- Who said that?

621
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,008
- All his students.
- Which one?

622
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,095
Last time I saw Hyeon-ju
was in the science lab.

623
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,221
Hey.

624
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,682
I think maybe...

625
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,101
Mr. Lee made porn with Hyeon-ju.

626
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,978
- Porn?
- Hey, you moron.

627
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,771
Get your mind out of the gutter, asshole.

628
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,856
You fat ass.

629
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,579
Why are you cursing at me, dick?

630
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,085
Because you're a fucking pervert,
dumb ass.

631
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,586
So why did he kidnap her then?

632
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,810
- Have you ever been kidnapped?
- Of course not. Stupid.

633
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,382
Easy, I'm your brother-in-law.

634
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,126
I told you to stop saying that.

635
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,388
Hey, tell us what happened?

636
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,164
I-sak, wait, what happened?

637
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,475
- Hey, what happened?
- How is she?

638
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,619
How's Hyeon-ju?

639
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,312
It's no joke.
She was biting people and trashing around...

640
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,171
Where's On-jo?

641
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,130
She got hurt.

642
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
Where? How bad?

643
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,508
She'll be fine.

644
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,093
Uh, Hyeon-ju bit her?

645
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,470
I think she went crazy.

646
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,031
Her temperature is super low,
but she said she was hot.

647
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,557
She tried to bite us.

648
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,285
- What the hell?
- So does she have rabies?

649
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,602
What an idiot.

650
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,896
And Hyeon-ju had this weird smell.

651
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,082
- What smell?
- The same one as the science teacher.

652
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,524
- A rotting corpse.
- Yeah, that.

653
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,859
- I knew it.
- And she said,

654
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,736
Mr. Lee gave her some kind of weird shot.

655
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,404
What a total psycho.

656
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,883
Shouldn't we tell the police about this?

657
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,493
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she's gonna handle it.

658
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,204
Look...

659
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,498
She's just been sitting there studying.

660
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,416
Yeah, well, she is the top student.

661
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,544
- So? Where's On-jo?
- In the infirmary.

662
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,729
It seems like she went
into shock due to hypothermia.

663
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,092
I manage to give her a sedative.

664
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,251
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

665
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,487
Yeah. I did. They're on their way.
Please take good care of her.

666
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,821
- Will do.
- Thank you.

667
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,199
AMBULANCE

668
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,200
Thank you.

669
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,844
- Are you okay?
- That was scary.

670
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,620
Look at me. Were you scared?

671
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,871
Definitely.

672
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
Man.

673
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,085
So, what's wrong with her?

674
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,796
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

675
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,132
I'm on calls, so I won't be home.

676
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,552
Just try not to get it wet.

677
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,475
Call me right away
if you need anything at all.

678
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

679
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,307
- Okay.
- Good. Bye, hon.

680
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,852
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

681
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,398
Thank you and take good care
of her for me please.

682
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,482
Given the situation,

683
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,166
- I can't stick around.
- Okay.

684
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,872
- Hurry up, Dad.
- You should go.

685
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,790
Thank you for your help, guys.

686
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,376
I'm going to head back in a few minutes...

687
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,214
Please make sure you don't tell anyone
about this just yet, okay?

688
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,340
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

689
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,424
All right.

690
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,195
I think it's better not to tell anyone
for the time being.

691
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,219
Sounds good.

692
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,890
Go back to class. Let's go.

693
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,311
Are you okay? Does she bite you?

694
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,481
- No, it's just a scratch.
- You sure you're all good?

695
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,821
Hey. You wanted to meet on the roof?

696
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,449
- What?
- You said come up after lunch.

697
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,286
Can you just tell me now?

698
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,590
I'm actually
playing basketball after lunch.

699
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,673
What's that?

700
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,764
NAM ON-JO

701
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,474
Wait. This means...

702
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,726
you wanna go out with me.

703
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,646
Yeah.

704
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,189
But aren't you with Cheong-san?

705
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,523
No.

706
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,360
We've lived next door
ever since we were little kids,

707
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,163
and his mom always gives me free chicken...

708
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,613
...and I do like chicken.

709
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,906
I love it actually.

710
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,709
But not him, I swear.

711
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,034
Ah, okay.

712
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,901
- On-jo!
- So I...

713
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,372
Where did you get hurt?

714
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,333
How bad is it, huh?

715
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,709
You're such a klutz sometimes.

716
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,002
I'm fine.

717
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,675
How bad was she hurt?
She's pretty clumsy, huh?

718
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,759
No.

719
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,928
Hyeon-ju tried to bite us.

720
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,763
She got hurt
trying to stay out of the way.

721
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,846
Hey.

722
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,933
You're going out with On-jo?

723
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
Right?

724
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,022
Mm-hm. Right.

725
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,026
Can't believe you bought that? You freak.

726
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,946
Seriously, even if it was
the end of the world,

727
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,614
and it was her, me, and a zombie,

728
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,491
I'd honestly rather date the zombie.

729
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,451
Why do you ask?

730
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,786
No reason.

731
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,830
Let's go.

732
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,593
Anyway, what's for lunch today?

733
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,124
Do you have any idea?

734
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,751
I want some <i>tonkatsu</i>.

735
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,299
How far are we from the hospital?

736
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,884
We're almost there.

737
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,532
She went to the hospital.

738
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,577
- Wait.
- Mr. Lee. Wait.

739
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,580
You don't understand.
She can't be in a hospital.

740
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,580
- Let all calm down.
- What are you talking about?

741
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,081
No! Let go of me!

742
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,292
No! It's time for you
to explain yourself here.

743
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,853
We can't send Hyeon-ju to a hospital.

744
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,503
We have to put her in quarantine.

745
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,713
Hey.

746
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,964
Sit down, Mr. Lee.

747
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,400
You've already turned things upside down

748
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,444
when you're at school
with the story about your son.

749
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,637
How the hell could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

750
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,431
And of course, you forced us to bury it.

751
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,476
Oh, that's some crack of bullshit, huh?

752
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,039
You know how the school's evaluation
is just around the corner.

753
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,273
You should've called me
before calling an ambulance, Sun-hwa.

754
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,042
What do you think
is gonna happen if the police come?

755
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,610
Well, I already called the police.

756
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,773
A teacher should deal
with school matters internally.

757
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,506
I'll call the police
if we need them.

758
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,448
- Tell them not to come.
- I mean...

759
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,691
Mr. Lee.

760
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,326
Police.

761
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,752
It's been a while,

762
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,712
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan.

763
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,574
Huh?

764
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,220
It's so good.

765
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,597
- What?
- Nothing.

766
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,602
Hey, Cheong-san can feel that.

767
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,271
I wasn't looking at him.

768
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,856
Yeah, right.

769
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,667
The whole school knows
you two are going out on dates.

770
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,691
We're not dating.

771
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
I'm serious.

772
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,905
Mm-hm, sure. Yeah.

773
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,617
Actually...

774
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,244
You can't tell anyone, okay?

775
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,912
About what?

776
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,040
Well...

777
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,374
It was you, right?

778
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,667
Forget it.

779
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,004
- Hey, come on.
- Stop it.

780
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,130
Tell me.

781
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,340
Stop. No.

782
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,070
You slept with Cheong-san, didn't you?

783
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,846
You did. I got it, am I right?

784
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,222
- Are you insane?
- Ow!

785
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,141
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

786
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,018
What?

787
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,771
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

788
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,273
You mean?

789
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,317
- What?
- My gosh.

790
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,694
- Quiet.
- Oh, my god. I can't believe it.

791
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,614
- Quiet.
- Are you completely insane?

792
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,908
Him? Su-hyeok?

793
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:13,991
Quiet.

794
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,163
- You eat it. It's okay.
- What?

795
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,351
How'd you do it? What did you say?
Did you ask him on a date or what?

796
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,209
My name tag.

797
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,691
So you threw yourself at him.

798
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,839
So?

799
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,427
Well, that's all.

800
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,011
Huh?

801
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,056
He didn't say anything?

802
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,141
- Mm-hm.
- Not even a vibe?

803
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,351
Mm-hm.

804
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,813
You couldn't tell how he felt or anything?

805
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,856
I'm going crazy.

806
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,526
You're making me go crazy.

807
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,413
Wearing those for too long
is bad for your ears.

808
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,626
Earbuds. They're bad for your ears.

809
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,252
I know.

810
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,808
Do you wanna go visit Hyeon-ju later?

811
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Why?

812
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,265
You're our class president.

813
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,897
You know my mom made me class president

814
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,108
by donating a bunch
of money to the school.

815
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,738
That's why no one else thinks of me
as the real class president.

816
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,615
So why the hell should I act like it?

817
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,578
What?

818
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,661
I'm surprised.

819
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,458
I've actually never heard you talk
that much before.

820
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,754
I thought you never said
more than five words at a time.

821
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,828
I want to cut class.

822
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,604
I'm sleepy.

823
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,731
What the hell?

824
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,024
INFIRMARY

825
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:09,983
Hey, hey.

826
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,066
Come here, come here.

827
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,152
- What?
- Check this out.

828
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,490
Oh, boy. What's wrong with her?

829
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,035
Probably drunk
out of her mind.

830
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,787
Is she serious?
She's gonna get fired.

831
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,042
What's she doing
in bare feet?

832
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,923
What the hell?

833
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,675
God. Damn.

834
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,905
- She really hit her head.
- That was freaky.

835
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,971
What's wrong with her?

836
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,557
<i>Is she sick?</i>

837
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,061
<i>I think she likes you.</i>

838
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,813
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

839
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,749
What is she doing?

840
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,525
Help!

841
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,488
Shit. What the fuck?

842
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,668
Holy shit, run!

843
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,043
Shit.

844
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,031
Eun-ji.

845
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,536
Don't do it.

846
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,790
Wanna come up?

847
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,291
Eun-ji.

848
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,794
Uh, come down.
Let's just talk down here, please.

849
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,128
Come on.

850
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,212
They said...

851
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,966
they'll gonna post it online.

852
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,175
Huh? No.

853
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,409
They said they delete it.

854
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,304
They, they promised me they would.

855
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,889
This is a living hell.

856
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,892
So I'm just trying to escape from hell.

857
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,310
I'll take care of it.

858
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,728
I can do it.

859
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,189
I'll delete them all.

860
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,565
Just...

861
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,610
Please don't...

862
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,488
I'm begging you.
Please don't do it, Eun-ji.

863
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,911
Why are you crying?

864
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,082
Do you...

865
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,668
like me?

866
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,393
Two losers who liked each other,
that's hilarious.

867
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,816
But when two losers go out,
they get even lamer.

868
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,238
So stay away from me.

869
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,699
Eun-ji.

870
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,409
And stay away from...

871
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,536
my dead body.

872
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,922
Eun-ji. Eun-ji, Eun-ji!

873
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,544
Hey, Prez!

874
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:23,880
Hurry!

875
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:24,963
Hurry!

876
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,508
Run!

877
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,142
I have a great idea.

878
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,977
Just ask Cheong-san.

879
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,854
Forget it.

880
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,774
Seriously, he and Su-hyeok
are really close.

881
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,276
Why don't you
just ask Cheong-san how he feels?

882
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,569
No.

883
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,781
On-jo. You have to listen to me.

884
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,076
There's a good chance Su-hyeok
already told him everything.

885
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,745
It doesn't matter. He'll make fun of me.

886
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,581
Put mine away too, gopher.

887
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,958
Hey, Cheong-san.

888
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,085
On-jo needs to talk to you.

889
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,715
Hey. So, you're close to Su-hyeok, right?

890
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,551
For sure. Why?

891
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,469
Told you?

892
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,096
What is it?

893
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,349
Nothing. So get lost.

894
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,352
- So, On-jo...
- Hey.

895
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,312
You're dead.

896
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,396
Understood.

897
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,192
Hey. A real friend
would help out right now.

898
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,987
What is it?

899
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,828
Wait a second? Did Su-hyeok say something?

900
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,911
No.

901
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:39,997
Did you fight?

902
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,583
I just said no.

903
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,378
Then what's going on,
did he say that he likes you?

904
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,006
Did he say that?

905
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,716
- What?
- That he likes me?

906
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
Who? Su-hyeok?

907
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,680
No? He didn't say anything?

908
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,016
Hmm, what are you talking about?

909
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,893
Earlier...

910
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,606
- You can't tell anyone, okay?
- About what?

911
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,024
You really can't tell anyone.

912
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,442
About what, On-jo?

913
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,780
I asked him out earlier, but I don't know.

914
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,282
He hasn't said anything.

915
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,538
Hey.

916
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,873
Yeah, what?

917
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:25,084
Any chance you could ask him
what he thinks about me?

918
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,921
We're not close.

919
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,715
Yeah, you are.

920
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,759
No, we're not, really.

921
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,679
Can't you help me out for once?

922
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,556
You're not my friend.

923
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,471
Shit. Shit.

924
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,356
Move! Move!

925
