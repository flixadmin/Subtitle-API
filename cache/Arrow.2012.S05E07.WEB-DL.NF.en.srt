A HUNDRED TIMES ALREADY.

473
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,253
OK. SO YOU MUST BE
GETTING REALLY GOOD
AT TELLING IT THEN.

474
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,840
OK. THE LAST FEW WEEKS,
I'VE BEEN BLACKING OUT.

475
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,010
LAST WEEK, I WOKE UP,
WITH, UH...I DON'T KNOW...

476
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,137
ALL BLOODY,
AND MY ARM'S CUT WITH THAT.

477
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,306
SO I HAD A FRIEND
ON THE FORCE RUN
FORENSICS ON IT,

478
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,849
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT THING IS CONSISTENT

479
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,310
WITH THE THROWING STAR
KILLER AND HIS VICTIMS.

480
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,812
OK. SO...SO WHAT?

481
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,982

YOU'RE HIM,

482

00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,448
BUT, NO, I DON'T THINK
EVEN MY DRINKING

486
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,408
COULD TURN ME
INTO A PSYCHOPATH.

487
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,620
SO WHY DID YOU EVEN
RESIGN THEN?

488
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,497
BECAUSE I LIED TO YOU

489
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,042
ABOUT GOING TO THE MEETINGS,

490

492
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,884
HE'S TARGETING ME.

493
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,390
I'M DAMAGED GOODS, THEA.
