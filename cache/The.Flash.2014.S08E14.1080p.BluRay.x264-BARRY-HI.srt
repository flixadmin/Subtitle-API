00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,378
[female police officer] Freeze!
Put your hands in the air!

7
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,558
[grunts]

8
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,764
[Blockbuster in robotic voice]
Well, hello, officers.

9
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,961
Now, that was fun.

10
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,296
[sighs wearily]

11
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:09,839
I'm so not in the mood for this.

12
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,942
[breathing heavily]
All right, big guy.

13
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,844
I'm gonna give you
one chance to stand down.

14
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,680
I'll give you one chance to beat it.

15
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,140
Chester, what's he wearing?

16
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,224
[Barry] <i>Chester.</i>

17
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,062
Sorry. Just give me a second to, uh...

18
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,647
Okay. Okay, I got it.

19
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,692
The armor matches the description
of an exo suit stolen from Ivo Labs.

20
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,904
It's charged by amplifying
the wearer's biochemistry.

21
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,822
So everything from his movements

22
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,366
to even his emotions...

23
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,076
Are fuel that makes him stronger.

24
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,703
You should have run away
when you had the chance, Flash.

25
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,622
Now, this has to happen.

26
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,621

30
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,004
There's a lot of people in there.

31
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,087
[Chester] <i>Okay, Flash.</i>

32
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,359
He just compromised
two steel girders in that substructure.

33
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,759
<i>That building's gonna collapse.</i>

34
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,606
Allegra, Cecile,
I'm gonna use my lightning

35
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,262
to weld those girders back together.

36
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,347
Take this guy down.

37
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,349
Okay, Let's do a classic
corral and contain.

38
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,518
Allegra, charge up
and hit him with a UV burst.

39
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,312
- Hey, snow pants. Over here.
- [powers charging up]

40
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,939
And then, Frost, you swoop in...

41
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,774
[dramatic music playing]

42
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,733
[car explodes]

43
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,195
Allegra!

44
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,092
The blast knocked her out,
but she's still breathing.

45
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,616
[hesitates] I am so sorry.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,284
[Cecile] <i>Chester,
I need you to focus.</i>

47
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,846
You've got to help me figure out
how I'm going to stop this guy.

48
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,123
Your friend should learn how to aim.

49
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,000
If you can try to calm his emotions,

50
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,210
that could depower the suit.

51
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,771
- [breathes deeply]
- [powers whooshing]

52
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,797
You trying to mess with my head?

53
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,672
[screaming]

54
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,674
[gasps]

55
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:37,759
What just happened?

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,446
[voice shaking]
It's all of my grief from Frost,

57
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,638
[breathing heavily]

58
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,473
and all the panic inside the building.

59
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,225
[breathing heavily]

60
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,310
[crying] I can't take it,
it's overloading me.

61
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,937
I can't use my powers.

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,065
Pathetic. Worst heroes ever.

63
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,612
[breath trembling] Allegra. Allegra.

64
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,489
[softly] Hey, hey.

65
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:00,115
You guys okay?

66
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,160
Yeah.

67
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,077
Chester, where'd he go?

68
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,954
I don't know. He just vanished.

69
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,998
[suspenseful music playing]

70
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,550
[somber music playing]

71
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,512
[sighs]

72
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,682
[device beeping]

73
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,353
[inhales sharply]

74
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:37,528
The <i>CCC</i> tip line still has nothing
on Mark Desmond, aka Blockbuster.

75
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,988
Keep digging, please.

76
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,701
Chester says his suit has some kind
of cloaking tech we can't track,

77
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,496
which means... [sighs]
we're not going to see him again.

78
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,163
Until he attacks.

79
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,957
And when he does?

80
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,337
[softly] Iris, we can't go
back out there like this.

81
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,881
I mean, we should have
easily stopped Desmond,

82
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,883
but Allegra and Cecile
were almost killed.

83
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,010
We're all still pretty
messed up about Frost.

84
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,680
I think with any normal job,
we would take time off to grieve.

85
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,725
- But with Team Flash...
- This isn't a normal job.

86
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,519
[Barry breathes deeply]

87
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,189
Iris, how am I supposed to tell people
who just lost a family member,

88
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,526
they need to find a way to mourn

89
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,319
and still get the job done?

90
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,694
I don't know.

91
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,842
But if there is anyone
who can find the right words

92
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,660
to inspire us right now, it's you.

93
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,708
Thanks for taking the time
for this meeting, guys.

94
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,229
Yeah. We realize it's a crazy time
with everything going on.

95
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,253
[Cecile] Of course.

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,256
Yeah. We need to be together.

97
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:39,590
Now, more than ever.

98
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,259
Speaking of, where's Caitlin?

99
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,361
[Barry] I didn't want to bother her.

100
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,595
I think she's preparing
for the funeral tomorrow.

101
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,305
Maybe we should do the same thing.

102
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,389
[sighs]

103
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,391
Look, while your satellite
is looking for Desmond,

104
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,685
Kramer put out an APB

105
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,855
and she's got a unit
placed at every bank in town.

106
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,440
And luckily, we have the time
to take a break.

107
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,026
In a perfect world, it would be great
to take some time off.

108
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,110
God knows we all need it.

109
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,697
But at any moment,
we could face something worse.

110
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,509
And, whether we like it or not,
we're this city's first line of defense.

111
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,410
We all saw what happened out there.

112
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,705
Yeah, if it had been
Bloodwork or Despero...

113
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,623
You know, Frost is gone.

114
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,041
And we all need to mourn her.

115
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,296
But we also need to find a way
to protect this city.

116
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,590
I didn't realize
we were having a team meeting.

117
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,802
We figured you might need
some alone time.

118
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,135
It's fine.

119
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,307
I haven't been sleeping very much,
so I could use the distraction.

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,767
Are you sure? I know
you must be dealing with a lot,

121
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,645
and I know how hard it can be
to organize a funeral.

122
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,814
Actually, my mom is handling
all the arrangements.

123
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,901
Okay. I mean, if that's what you want,

124
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,444
but we're all happy to pitch in.

125
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,446
Like I said, my mom's got it covered.

126
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,091
But if you've got a problem with that,

127
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,316
feel free to give her a call.

128
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,532
Offer your help.

129
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,411
'Cause I'm not going
to any damn funeral.

130
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,038
[somber music continues playing]

131
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,332
- Caitlin.
- Barr.

132
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,958
Give her some space.

133
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,085
Dad, she's hurting.

134
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,670
Baby girl, I know. We all are.

135
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:03,549
But like Barry said,

136
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,761
we just lost a family member,

137
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,848
and that pain will keep us

138
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,850
from protecting those in need.

139
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,520
It will cloud everything we do

140
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,189
until we face it,

141
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,689
and heal.

142
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,499
Yeah, but how are we
supposed to do that?

143
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,945
By honoring Frost.

144
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,030
Look, I just...

145
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,868
took watercolor classes
at the community center

146
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,787
because Frost made me promise

147
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,790
that I would try to
express myself through art.

148
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,209
And I got to admit,
when I saw the first canvas...

149
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,670
[chuckles softly]

150
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,549
[shakily] I felt Frost
smiling down on me.

151
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,720
And we all have to find our own ways

152
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,721
to honor her.

153
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,059
'Cause it is the only way,

154
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:58,354
we are going to heal as a family.

155
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,333
There's still zero hits
on the tip line about Blockbuster.

156
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,920
It's already tough
knowing that people almost died

157
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,839
because we weren't ready to face him.

158
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,425
But knowing that he could reappear
at any moment,

159
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,403
it makes what we're going through
that much harder.

160
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,427
I know.

161
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,096
Which reminds me,

162
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,766
I think I've decided how I'm going to
take Joe's advice and honor Frost.

163
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,310
After her court battle last year,

164
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,229
wrongly imprisoned metas?

165
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,691
That became a cause
really close to her heart.

166
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,651
So, effective immediately,

167
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,195
I am going to dedicate
25% of my caseload

168
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,905
to pro bono work in her honor.

169
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,866
Frost would love that.

170
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,949
Yeah?

171
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,246
[sighs] I'm going to write
a special obituary for her on <i>CCC.</i>

172
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,873
That's a great idea.

173
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,792
Yeah, but every time
I sit down to write it, I can't.

174
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,377
Because...

175
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,173
I mean, to write about her
in any meaningful way,

176
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,884
like how she died
saving her sister, I...

177
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,720
You risk exposing yourself
as a member of Team Flash.

178
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,388
Yeah.

179
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,973
But this is my job, so,

180
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,309
why can't I push through?

181
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,354
Hey, Aariz.

182
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,320
When you interviewed last year,
you mentioned writing obits once.

183
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,687
[Aariz] For <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

184
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,240
When I was on active duty
with the Army in Afghanistan,

185
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,617
sometimes I'd help write obits

186
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,411
for soldiers who died
on classified missions

187
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,579
or had no family.

188
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,957
If I wasn't privy to all the details,

189
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,627
I'd find other ways
to honor their memory.

190
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,836
That's amazing.

191
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,589
Do you think that you could
take over Frost's obit

192
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,673
for tonight's headline?

193
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,010
I always admired how she handled
those ridiculous charges against her.

194
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,429
I could have it ready in, say, an hour.

195
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,764
Yeah, that would be great.

196
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,167
- Thank you.
- [Aariz] You got it.

197
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,184
[softly] Hey, Iris.

198
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,355
Honey, are you sure you want
to hand over something so personal

199
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,816
to somebody who never even met Frost?

200
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,361
Well, I think an objective point of view
is exactly what I'm missing.

201
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,199
[Iris West] So, does it do her justice?

202
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,701
Well... [sighs]

203
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,206
You think Aariz did a terrible job?

204
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,336
It's well written
and factually accurate,

205
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,171
but it feels cold.

206
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,217
Like it was written by someone
who didn't know Frost.

207
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,804
But that's not why I wanted to talk.

208
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,889
I could have read this over email.

209
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,725
I wanted to see how you're doing.

210
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,645
[exhales sharply]

211
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,732
I feel the same way.

212
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,484
[breathes deeply]

213
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Iris,

214
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,488
why didn't you write this?

215
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,740
I mean, you've known Frost
longer than I have.

216
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:01,787
I guess, at first,
I felt like if I wrote it,

217
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,582
I wouldn't be able to say everything
that I wanted to say.

218
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,768
But the more I think about it,

219
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,210
the more I realize that...

220
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,213
I don't know what to say. [chuckles]

221
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,760
Carla, I may have known Frost longer,
but I didn't...

222
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,761
get to know her.

223
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,891
And now you're angry at yourself
for lost opportunities,

224
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,560
because you thought you had
all the time in the world.

225
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,648
[sighs] I felt the same way being
estranged from Caitlin for so long.

226
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:33,110
And then I almost made the same mistake
when Frost came around, but...

227
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,694
[chuckles softly]

228
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,447
Luckily for me, she didn't let me.

229
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,283
[clicks tongue]

230
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,952
And in the end,
I got to know her just a bit...

231
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,581
and I'm... I'm better for it.

232
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:51,921
So, what do I do now? [chuckles]

233
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,047
[Dr. Tannhauser] Well, here's one thing
I do know.

234
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:57,593
Frost wouldn't care about some obituary
that sung her praises.

235
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,221
She didn't give a damn
what people thought.

236
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,141
She just wanted to protect them.

237
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,602
That was her legacy.

238
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:08,885
[Dr. Tannhauser whispers] Yeah.

239
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,567
Thank you, Carla. [sniffles]

240
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,319
Yeah.

241
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,840
- I think I know what to do now.
- [softly] Okay.

242
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,864
[sucks teeth]

243
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,492
[softly] Thanks.

244
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,260
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- [softly] Yeah.

245
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,999
Oh, excuse me.
Could I get that iced drink? The Frost.

246
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,335
Sure, but it's actually called
Killer Frost.

247
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:33,962
[sighs]

248
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,130
Well, it shouldn't be.

249
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,550
Never mind. Thanks.

250
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,513
[sighs wearily]

251
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,816
Welcome to <i>Citizentopia,</i>

252
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,068
where you, the citizens of Central City,

253
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,736
share your stories.

254
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,865
I am here today
to talk about a fallen hero.

255
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,327
Someone who was often misunderstood.

256
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,579
A woman that you all know as...

257
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:08,664
[inhales deeply]

258
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,789
Killer Frost.

259
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,960
But to the people who really knew her,

260
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,545
she was no killer.

261
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,383
Frost saved lives
and she changed them for the better.

262
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,720
And I am here with two people
who are proof of that.

263
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,555
Kamiko, Jamal, thank you for joining us.

264
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:25,596
- Hello.
- Hi.

265
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,807
- Sure.
- Thanks for having us.

266
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,520
So, I understand that you both
had a unique encounter with Frost?

267
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,897
It was during Bloodwork's attack
on the city

268
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,649
and, uh, we were in the subway.

269
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,694
It was just completely overrun
by his blood brothers.

270
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,987
<i>I was so scared.</i>

271
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,321
[Kamiko] <i>We all were.</i>

272
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,758
<i>It was a bunch of strangers trapped,</i>

273
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,075
while those things
picked us off one by one.

274
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,578
Until Frost showed up.

275
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,956
Seeing her courage in court,

276
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,709
I knew I was on
the wrong side of the bench.

277
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,963
So, when she was released,
I reached out,

278
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,257
asking for forgiveness.

279
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,552
She caught me right in the middle of it.

280
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,219
But she didn't turn me in.

281
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,555
[Kamiko] It was amazing.

282
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,184
Frost froze those blood brothers
and helped us escape.

283
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,227
We owe her our lives.

284
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,438
And what did Frost say?

285
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,106
[woman] That I did my job.

286
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,234
But maybe I should get a better one.

287
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,526
[chuckles]

288
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,197
[man chuckles]
<i>Man, I was a tagger.</i>

289
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,281
If it wasn't for Frost,
I'd be in jail right now.

290
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,785
Instead, I got my first
gallery exhibit next week.

291
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:33,040
So, the next day,
I quit the State Prosecutor's Office.

292
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,585
Now I'm defending metas in Star City.

293
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:40,339
If it wasn't for Frost, we... [chuckles]
would have never gotten married.

294
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,304
[Kamiko] <i>So, wherever you are, Frost,</i>

295
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,138
<i>thank you.</i>

296
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,025
[exhales sharply]

297
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:18,460
There must be one perfect thing
to do to honor Frost.

298
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,463
Just because Joe handed out
some greeting card advice

299
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,424
doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

300
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,177
I don't know.
It sounded pretty on point to me.

301
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,681
How can one thing honor someone
as amazing as Frost?

302
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,848
[scoffs]

303
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,519
Barry told us about
the eternal flame for Oliver Queen.

304
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,060
[chuckles]

305
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,565
What if we made, like,
a Frost-ified version?

306
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,942
Yeah, yeah,
like if I took her superhero costume

307
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,028
and I put it in a glass case

308
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,488
with cryo coolers,

309
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:51,034
so that it could create
a self-sustained blizzard.

310
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,945
So, it'd stay frozen forever.

311
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,247
You mean a snow globe?

312
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,332
[playful music]

313
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,294
You know, it'd help if

314
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,046
I wasn't the only one
coming up with good ideas.

315
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,132
Passive aggressive, much?

316
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,300
No, no, not passive...

317
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,218
Passive aggressive
is getting Hirschfield's

318
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,554
to put hummus on our sandwiches.

319
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,349
Oh, wow. I didn't see you
getting butt-hurt over a sandwich

320
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,433
on my bingo card today.

321
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,144
Also, you love hummus.

322
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,187
I do. I do.

323
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:21,106
Hummus is wonderful,
but it's not a condiment.

324
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,733
Ketchup, is a condiment.

325
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,235
Mustard, also a condiment.

326
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,362
Hummus is like a side dish.

327
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,655
No, no. Hummus is a dip.

328
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,450
Easy, Condiment King.

329
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,702
I don't need you
Runk-splaining hummus to me.

330
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,996
I don't need you being so cavalier
with our sandwiches.

331
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,957
Don't worry, because I am never
bringing you lunch ever again.

332
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:39,957
- [scoffs]
- [air whooshing]

[gasps]

334
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,169
[panting] Sorry. Sorry.

335
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,096
Do you guys know
where the Arctic parkas are?

336
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,089
The cozy ones?

337
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,549
Yeah.

338
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,675
Starchives.

339
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,469
[softly] Right. Thank you.

340
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,845
[breathing heavily] Gotta run.

341
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,180
- [air whooshing]
- Ah!

342
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,390
- [cell phone buzzing]
- [Allegra sighs]

343
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,683
[inhales sharply]

344
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,686
<i>CCC</i> tip app's blowing up.

345
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,731
Something crazy is happening
at O'Shaughnessy's.

346
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,983
Is Blockbuster here
to settle his late fees?

347
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,568
No, it's not Blockbuster,

348
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,631
but I have a feeling
we're going to wish it was.

349
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,406
[upbeat music playing]

350
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,075
Aw, come on, man!

351
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,370
[music ends abruptly]

352
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,249
[rock music playing]

353
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,252
[yells] I am a party god!

354
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:32,927
[bottle shattering]

355
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,898
- [Mark grunting]
- We can never unsee this.

356
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:36,764
[bartender] Hey.

357
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,683
Is that your friend?

358
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,725
Uh...

359
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,728
Because that jerk just froze
half the bar.

360
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,940
[Allegra sighs] Sorry.

361
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,817
He's had a rough week.

362
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,236
- Here.
- [powers whooshing]

363
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,613
[exhales sharply]

364
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,824
I'm going on break.

365
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,451
If he's not gone by the time
I get back,

366
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,744
I'm having him arrested.

367
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,794
[chuckling] Hey, Chuckles, Garcia.

368
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,671
Come to join the party, have you?
Yeah?

369
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,214
[gruffly] Yeah, you did.

370
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:10,464
[Mark grunts]

371
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,025
- [utensils clinking]
- [glass breaking]

372
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,427
What's your poison?

373
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,554
You look like a Fuzzy Navel man.

374
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,950
- Coming right up.
- [glasses clinking]

375
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,766
Thanks, but I actually... [chuckles]

376
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,977
I actually don't drink.

377
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,354
Awesome. More for us.

378
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,065
[humming]

379
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,572
[people laughing]

380
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:39,995
[grunts]

381
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:42,164
[breathing heavily]

382
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,460
Oh, big night out, huh?

383
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,462
Yeah, I've been there myself.

384
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,129
Sure.

385
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,342
Right now, love is all
cupcakes, puppies and monster trucks.

386
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,761
But just you wait until one of you dies

387
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,305
battling an interdimensional
death demon.

388
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Oh, yeah.

389
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,225
Pain is coming.

390
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,439
[Chester] Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.
Use your knees.

391
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,774
There you go. No, no. Oh...

392
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,900
You're okay, buddy.

393
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,468
All right. You guys want to rob
a tech facility or something?

394
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,073
It might quiet the voices.

395
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,493
This man needs Vibeaccinos,
lots of them. I could run to Jitters.

396
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,745
And leave me here with Chillbooze?

397
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,912
No way.

398
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:27,668
You know, you can't just shoot down
my ideas without offering another.

399
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,878
Fine, let's get some food in him.

400
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,546
Do they serve fries here or something?

401
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,881
[Chester] They must.

402
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,342
Ketchup bottle, see.

403
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,718
Mustard bottle.

404
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,470
[gasps] Ooh, look.

405
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,972
- [scoffs]
- No hummus bottle. Case closed.

406
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,236
- It's a condiment.
- [Chester] It's a dip.

407
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,426
- [Allegra] You're a dip.
- Well, call me hummus, then.

408
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,317
- Ugh! You are impossible.
- I can't believe...

409
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,396
Hey!

410
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,605
- What?
- What?

411
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,734
You two are really killing
my party's vibe.

412
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,110
All right?

413
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,197
Besides, you're not even fighting.

414
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,032
You're just doing what friends do,
baby.

415
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,620
Helping each other to see the world
in your own unique way.

416
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,832
That's what Frost did for me.

417
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,042
She shared her real self with me.

418
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,381
Only I was too dumb to share me
with her, and now it is too late.

419
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,345
But I'm glad
I got to see things her way.

420
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,645
[Mark snoring]

421
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,482
[powers whooshing]

422
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,108
[Chester groans]

423
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,153
Oh! All those muscles are heavy.

424
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,779
Sweet dreams, party god.

425
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,531
[both panting]

426
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,410
[both breathing heavily]

427
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,262
- AI, I am so sorry.
- Chuck, I'm sorry.

428
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:46,329
[both chuckle]

429
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,332
- I can't believe we're fighting.
- Over a dip.

430
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,375
[chuckles softly]

431
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,378
Yeah, I miss her, too.

432
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,840
You know, even though Mark
might be drunk as a skunk,

433
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:58,924
he was right.

434
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,011
We are really good friends.

435
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,678
The best.

436
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,390
So if we listen to each other,
I'm sure we could find

437
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,642
that one perfect thing to honor Frost.

438
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,313
Yeah, actually,
now that I'm listening to you,

439
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,941
I think that your costume idea
was on to something.

440
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,819
- Yeah?
- Can I suggest one tweak, though?

441
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,530
- For sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

442
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,241
[triumphant music playing]

443
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,128
She told me she first felt
like a hero wearing this jacket.

444
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,881
Now that's how we'll remember her.

445
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,216
Always.

446
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,719
[triumphant music continues]

447
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,396
[wind blowing]

448
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,527
[winds howling]

449
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,918

00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,841
[air whooshing]

453
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,474
[crowd cheering]

454
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,186
[in English] Hold on to your badges.
We have a tight one.

455
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:20,859
CSI Barry Allen and reigning champ,
Officer Daisy Korber,

456
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,694
down to their last dog.

457
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,486
And...

458
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,449
[crowd cheering]

459
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,492
[buzzer sounds]

460
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,871
[crowd cheering]

461
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,874
Allen wins it
in the upset of the century!

462
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,876
[officers laughing]

463
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,001
Thank you.

464
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,923
[exhales sharply] Fine.

465
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,634
But I want a rematch next year, Allen.

466
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,135
Sure.

467
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,262
[exhales]

468
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
[snorts]

469
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,858
[trilling]

470
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,243
[objects clattering]

471
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,514
[Barry] How long were you in there?

472
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,457
[Mark breathing heavily]

473
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,918
I was hoping you could tell me.

474
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,188
Hey, do you mind telling the contractors

475
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,714
to knock off all the hammering
or whatever that is?

476
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,343
Uh... That's not construction.

477
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,803
[gasps] Great.

478
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,035
Guess I overdid it with the bourbon.

479
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:37,727
[breathing heavily] And the tequila,
and the vodka.

480
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,396
[pills rattling]

481
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:40,772
[Mark] Hey, what's that?

482
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,776
Uh, satellite scans
looking for Blockbuster.

483
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,405
No sign of him yet, but... [inhales]
he'll show up sooner or later.

484
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,573
This team still isn't ready to face him.

485
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,702
Not all that. I'm talking about this.

486
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,587
Did you do all of these already?

487
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,299
How are you doing?

488
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,221
I never even got to tell her how I felt.

489
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,701
Did she ever tell you about the time
that she signed us up

490
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,518
for a couples' tag-team
wrestling tournament?

491
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,938
We crushed it, obviously.

492
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,233
But then she gave
our championship belts away

493
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,986
to some kids at the ramen joint
where we were celebrating.

494
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,516
Because it wasn't about winning.

495
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,448
It was about the experience.

496
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,577
- You really knew her well.
- I thought so. Yeah.

497
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
[exhales sharply]

498
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,957
I also thought finishing this list

499
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:45,378
would be a way to honor her memory.

500
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:49,799
But even with everything crossed off,
it still doesn't feel complete.

501
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,302
Look, man.

502
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:56,139
As wild and crazy
as her lust for adventure was,

503
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,809
what my Snowflake lived for
more than the thrills,

504
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,410
was taking care of the people she loved.

505
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,732
That's what she really wanted
to do with her life.

506
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:10,278
Hell, she was literally born
to be Caitlin's savior.

507
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,449
She never lost sight of that.

508
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,700
[chuckles silently]

509
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,455
I know how to honor Frost's memory.

510
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,415
[uplifting music playing]

511
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,460
But right now, it seems impossible.

512
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,879
What's impossible for the Flash?

513
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,937
'Cause I'm not going
to any damn funeral.

514
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,440
[Barry] Caitlin.

515
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,572
[melodic sad pop song playing]

516
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,264
[sighs deeply]

517
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,764
[knock on door]

518
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,015
[door creaks]

519
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:50,647
- I'm still not going.
- I... I just came to apologize.

520
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,942
And to listen.

521
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:58,363
I suppose it's no use shutting the door
on someone who can phase through it.

522
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:04,535
Look, Caitlin, um... [exhales sharply]
about yesterday morning in the lounge...

523
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,330
It's fine.
I know you were just trying to help.

524
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,875
You know, trying and knowing the right
words to say aren't the same thing.

525
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:11,959
And I'm sorry.

526
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:14,212
I said everything wrong.

527
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,941
We've both been through a lot
over the last couple of days,

528
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,965
so I think it's okay
to let ourselves off the hook.

529
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,760
But you don't have to worry about me.

530
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,262
I'm good, honest.

531
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,807
[suspenseful music playing]

532
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,244
You're still having trouble sleeping?

533
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,394
I've had a lot on my mind.

534
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,563
So, yes, I've had
a few sleepless nights,

535
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,066
but medically speaking,
I'm not in any danger.

536
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,567
So, thank you for coming.

537
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,651
Caitlin,

538
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,946
I know you'll regret
not going to your sister's funeral.

539
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,863
Unbelievable.

540
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,200
I mean, do you hear yourself right now?

541
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,910
This isn't even about me.

542
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,788
This is about you
and your need to be the hero.

543
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,874
I am not one of your missions, okay?

544
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,752
And not everything can just
be fixed with speed healing.

545
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,797
But I need to grieve Frost
in my own way.

546
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:01,718
So if you don't mind,
will you please leave?

547
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:04,011
[Barry sighs]

548
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:11,060
Look, Caitlin, I will leave you alone,
if that's what you really want,

549
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,605
but before I go,
just ask yourself one thing.

550
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,902
What would Frost want for you?

551
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,659
You knew her better than anybody.
Would she want you to pull away?

552
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,078
Would she want us to let you?

553
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,932
[Frost] But you have to promise me
something, all right?

554
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:35,793
You will never shut yourself off from me

555
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,527
or the rest of the team, all right?

556
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,510
She'd tell me to stop being an idiot.

557
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,306
Get off my ass and live my damn life.

558
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,807
Hmm.

559
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,935
That does sound like her.

560
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,813
You know,
Frost was the voice inside my head

561
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,400
before I even knew she had a name.

562
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,739
She was the one telling me to be brave.

563
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,450
To be strong when I felt weak.

564
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,079
That I was never as powerless
as others made me feel.

565
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:15,624
[sighs]

566
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,587
[crying] Barry, when Frost died,
her singing died, too.

567
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,798
Her laugh.

568
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,383
[sniffles]

569
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:29,347
[softly] That voice...
That voice that made me whole.

570
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:32,849
[sniffles]

571
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,450
[crying] So I can't go to the funeral...

572
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:38,189
because if I do,
if I see her in that casket...

573
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:41,775
[breath trembling]

574
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,694
I'll know that she's gone for good.

575
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,409
- [Caitlin sighs]
- What if that's not the case?

576
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:51,908
[softly] What do you mean?

577
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,206
Her voice is still inside you.

578
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:57,750
As long as that's true...

579
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,379
She's not really gone.

580
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,092
[Barry breathes deeply]

581
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:12,223
Joe suggested that we all... [exhales]
find a way to honor Frost.

582
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,395
It was pretty hard finding my answer.

583
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,690
But you?
You just have to listen to her.

584
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,776
So what's Frost saying
she wants you to do?

585
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,708
[solemn music playing]

586
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:38,934
[sighs gently]

587
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,375
Most of you know that I did not want
to be here today.

588
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,793
Not at first.

589
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,467
I was afraid that seeing her here
would make her death seem more real.

590
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:13,468
[inhales deeply]

591
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,469
And I was scared.

592
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,683
You see, Frost was always
the fearless Snow sister.

593
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,435
Like that time
she went swimming with sharks

594
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,062
and picked a fight with a shark.

595
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:29,193
Or when she was at Jitters
for their Slam Poetry open mic night,

596
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,987
and just grabbed the mic

597
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,991
and read a poem she'd scribbled
on a napkin five minutes before.

598
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,536
[sighs] See, Frost was always honest.

599
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:43,833
[crying] And the truth is...

600
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,210
[breath trembling]

601
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:50,214
I thought that if
I saw my sister laying here,

602
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,552
that I would have to say goodbye.

603
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,178
[sniffles]

604
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,225
But then...

605
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,147
a friend of mine reminded me that

606
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:09,233
that's not true.

607
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:14,071
That she lives on in all of us.

608
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,197
Not just in me.

609
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,244
In her selflessness...

610
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,874
[crying] her unique way
of seeing the world...

611
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,416
[breathes deeply]

612
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,795
[softly]...and her deep love
for her family and friends.

613
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:31,922
[inhales deeply]

614
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:36,385
So if we keep those parts of her
alive in us,

615
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:38,888
then she's not really gone.

616
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,392
And I can't think of a better way
to honor her memory.

617
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,578
I'll keep you alive, Frost.

618
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:04,621
I promise.

619
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,166
[somber music playing]

620
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,231
[lighthearted music playing]

621
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,274
[Joe] It normally works.

622
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:34,985
Dad, what were you thinking?

623
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,529
Bleach takes out stains

624
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,030
and the curtains were dirty. So...

625
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:42,118
[chuckling] I'm sorry, but no. No.

626
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,579
This whole retirement thing,
he's still real new at it.

627
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,374
Look, this is the cleanest spot
in the whole house,

628
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:52,002
and I would have done a whole lot more
if Frost hadn't taken

629
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,797
- my cleaning supplies for her collages.
- [all chuckling]

630
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,134
Oh, yeah. I still don't know
how she carried that stuff

631
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,136
while ice-bridging across town.

632
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,889
She didn't. People were finding sponges
and yellow gloves for miles.

633
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,518
Actually, I think Wild Dog uses
one of Joe's mops as a bo staff.

634
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,061
- [all laughing]
- Really?

635
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:11,313
This feels good.

636
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,357
Remembering Frost like this.

637
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:15,776
Your advice worked, Joe.

638
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,362
That had more to do with you
than with me.

639
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,322
It was a beautiful eulogy.

640
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:24,160
More than anything we did to
honor Frost, you helped us heal today.

641
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,537
Thanks for putting us back together.

642
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:28,914
I didn't make it easy on you guys.

643
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,626
So, thanks for telling me
what I needed to hear anyway.

644
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:35,087
- [devices beeping]
- [Joe] Ooh.

645
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,008
That Blockbuster jerk's back.

646
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,885
I'll have Kramer call C.C.P.D.

647
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,428
No way. This guy's ours.

648
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,180
Plus, we all wanted a rematch, right?

649
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,474
And this time, we're ready.

650
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:47,766
Barry?

651
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,436
Tell Kramer to warm a holding cell.

652
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,688
Let's go get this guy.

653
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,064
[whooshes]

654
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,151
I will tell the troops
to prepare an early headline.

655
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,781
- Hey.
- [door opens, closes]

656
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,800
Do you have somewhere to be, too?

657
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:04,740
Nope.

658
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:06,902
Because I'd love to hear
some more stories about Frost.

659
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,914
- I'd like that, too.
- I'm going to make us some coffee.

660
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:10,997
Perfect.

661
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:16,796
[sighing softly]

662
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,009
[dialing]

663
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,849
Hey. We need to talk.

664
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,897
- [whistling]
- Hey.

665
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,688
Hey, you know
it's rude to keep your guests waiting?

666
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,714
I got a bar I'm supposed to be
getting thrown out of right now.

667
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,118
Sorry. I thought I had time for one more
supply run before you got here.

668
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,617
Is that a genome sequencer?

669
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,913
- Yes.
- And did you steal it?

670
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:52,747
I borrowed it.

671
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,376
Whatever, Caitlin.
Game recognizes game.

672
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,963
Look, you called, I'm here.

673
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:00,672
What do you want?

674
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:02,757
Your help.

675
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:04,884
Oh.

676
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,519
Did you forget
to pay your electricity bill?

677
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,144
[thuds, groans]

678
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,524
[suspenseful music playing]

679
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,445
Okay.
That's not too creepy or anything.

680
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,620
Caitlin, what is it that you want?

681
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,281
I'm going to bring Frost back.

682
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,922
And you're gonna help me.

683
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,382
[exhales sharply]

684
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,370
[staff member] So, what do you think?

685
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:54,767
[clicks tongue]

686
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,354
I think we just found
tomorrow's front page.

687
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,981
[gasps] Crushed it!

688
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,734
Uh... I mean, thank you.

689
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:05,154
I will interface with publishing and get
this out the door ASAP. [chuckles]

690
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,614
It's okay. Own it.

691
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,824
This is a great article.
You should be proud.

692
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:13,203
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I still have a ton of work to do.

693
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:15,331
It's gonna be a late night.

694
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:16,749
Sure. [chuckles softly]

695
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,046
By the way, it's really good
to have you back from Coast City.

696
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,007
CCC Media was not the same without you.

697
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:26,884
You guys had Allegra.

698
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,247
I hear she did great filling in.

699
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,428
From who? [laughs]

700
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,182
I'm, uh... I'm gonna leave now.

701
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,265
[chuckles nervously]

702
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,646
But, hey, about
the Flash's latest takedown,

703
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,314
I know he worked with Frost,

704
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:43,901
but there have been reports
of him working with other people, too.

705
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,903
Only no one knows who they are.

706
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,031
Shouldn't we investigate them?

707
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,533
Hmm, um...

708
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,077
I will think about it.

709
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,836
[groans, clicks tongue]

710
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:09,009
I forgot my... phone.

711
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:12,513
Iris?

712
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,682
[suspenseful music playing]

713
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:16,766
Hmm.

714
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,353
[crackling]
