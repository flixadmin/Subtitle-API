1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,800
HANK: I still think
about the night

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,640
your mother and I
had to leave you.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,480
JANET: Hopefully,
it's not for long,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,480
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,480
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,520
Mommy?

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,240
Jellybean.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,240
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,520
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,720
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,400
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,000
eyes...

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
-

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,240
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,560
Janet, we gotta go.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,840
-

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,920
HANK: I wish we could have
put down our bags...

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,200
tucked you back
into your bed...

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
but too many lives
were at stake.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,800
HANK: Oh, my God.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
They've already launched.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
JANET: We have to stop it.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Come on.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,040
HANK: To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
but the plating was too thick.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,080
The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,000
JANET: I can't get through.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,360
Hank.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,520
HANK: We both knew
that if you go that small...

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,760
there is no coming back.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,840
It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,040
Your mother's wasn't.

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,160
JANET: Tell Hope I love her.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
HANK: She turned it off.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Janet. No!

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,560
Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,200
knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,480
Alone.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,840
Afraid.

43
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,600
Gone forever.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,760
was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,400
But then Scott showed up.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,080
And when he went
to the quantum realm...

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
and came back.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,160
Everything changed.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,040
I started to wonder...

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
could your mother
still be alive?

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,440
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,160
Dad, what are you saying?

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,840
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,840
SCOTT: Okay. We're in.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,120
Oh, this place is a maze.

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,160
Where's that map?

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,760
We're definitely close.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,720
-You ready?
-I'm ready, Daddy.

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,880
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,000
I eat fear for breakfast.

64
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,640
Wow. That is super cool.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,880
Come on.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,320
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Anton, which way do we go?

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,040
Anton, which way do we go?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,160
Thanks, Anton!

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,800
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,680
Oh no, lasers!

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh! I think I got lased!

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,320
The secret vault.

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,280
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

75
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
-Yup.
-

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,160
Perfect! Right there.

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,520
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,320
My trophy?

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,000
It looks like treasure.

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
Oh, it is to me.

81
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, no, you can't do that.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,480
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm so touched you think

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,800
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,280
It was the only one they had.

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,160
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,640
Oh, no, the fuzz!

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Hey, Scotty...

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,840
I was looking
at the schematics

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

93
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
and I think we have

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,960
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
No, no, not at all.

96
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,920
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
I know what he needs.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,120
Who's the security expert
in our business?

99
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,080
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
And if we overquote him...

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
he's gonna go somewhere else.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,080
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,440
He ain't goin' anywhere.

104
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,680
And the expression is
"land this fish."

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,280
No, it's "land the bird."

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,520
Just like you land the plane.

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,160
I know it's silly
to get hung up

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,760
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
How am I gonna land a fish?

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,120
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

112
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,480
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,640
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Now, if you just excuse me...

116
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm in the middle of trying to

117
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,640
steal something
with my daughter.

118
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm gonna go recheck it.

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,560
-To the escape ant!

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

121
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,560
SCOTT: The po-po?
How do you even know that?

122
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

123
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
-

124
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,960
Crash landing!

125
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,680
-CASSIE: Whoo!
-

126
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,400
I wish we could shrink
for real.

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,080
Oh. That is pretty cool.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
But I feel
like I'm way better.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,160
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,400
And my hands are shaking.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,520
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

134
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
It's gonna be great, Luis!

135
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,200
You got nothing
to worry about!

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

137
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
-Daddy!

139
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,000
SCOTT: Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

140
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
Why would I try to escape?

141
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,840
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

144
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,400
-Thank you.

145
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,680
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

146
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
Our flying ant crashed.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,480
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
when you can't leave
the house.

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,040
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,880
Close-up magic.

151
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
I learned that.

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,520
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

153
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Oh, Cassie.

154
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,040
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

155
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,480
Well, think of it this way.

157
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,360
Your school has rules, right?

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

160
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,480
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

161
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,000
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

162
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

163
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

164
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,520
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

165
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

166
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,880
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,760
followed by three years
of probation.

168
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,720
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

169
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,000
or contact with any
former associates who were...

170
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,400
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Or any related statutes.

172
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
Okay, sweetie?

173
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,880
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

175
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,680
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

176
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,160
but you haven't had
any contact

177
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,520
-No.
-You sure?

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,560
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

180
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,240
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,240
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,520
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

183
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,400
that any violation
of your agreement

184
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,200
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

185
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,840
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
They hate his guts.

187
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks, peanut.

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,120
How'd you do it, Scott?

189
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,880
Do what?

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
The card trick.

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
Seriously?

192
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,800
Oh, my God!

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,280
You people
can't just show up here

194
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,920
whenever you want
and search the place.

195
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Actually, they can.

196
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,080
You need a warrant.

197
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,280
Actually, they don't.

198
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,960
Really? Wow.

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,200
MAGGIE: Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
-Yeah.
-MAGGIE: All right.

201
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,360
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

202
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,120
All right.

203
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Oh, get on the inside of this.

204
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
-

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,000
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,280
-I'm proud of you, bud.
-Thank you.

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
You know what?
Give me another one.

208
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,040
MAGGIE: Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

209
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

212
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Once I'm outta here,

213
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,520
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

215
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,400
You're gettin' good at that.

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,600
How'd you do that?

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,640
CASSIE: Bye, Daddy.
MAGGIE: Bye.

218
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,200
-Bye.
-CASSIE: Bye.

219
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Three days.

220
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,240
Easy-peasy.

221
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,360
And that is misdirection.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,440
We had a dream

224
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,160
We'd go travelin' together

225
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on

226
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,480
Easy-peasy.

227
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Where are you?

228
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,680
HANK: Everything
that you know...

229
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,680
Lost...

230
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,240
in the quantum realm.

231
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,960
SCOTT: What?

232
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,440
JANET: I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

233
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
I found you!

234
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,200
You always find me, Mommy.

235
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,560
SCOTT: What the hell?

236
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,600
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

237
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,240
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

238
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,760
And I'm probably
the last person

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
you wanna hear from.

240
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,720
But I just had
a really weird dream.

241
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,000
And I know that doesn't

242
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
sound like an emergency
or anything...

243
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,560
but it just felt very real.

244
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,240
I was back
in the quantum realm...

245
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
and I think I saw your wife.

246
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,520
And then I was your wife.

247
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,520
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

248
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
You know,
hearing this out loud,

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm sorry to bother you.

251
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

252
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,560
That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...

253
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,960
Could be one,
little, tiny universe.

254
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
-

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Hope?

256
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
Is this another dream?

257
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
Do you think it was a dream...

258
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,480
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

259
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,640
I'm not sure.

260
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,440
I can't be here!

261
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,240
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

262
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,240
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,840
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

265
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
you're still at home.

266
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
Whoa!

267
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Scotty?

268
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,320
HOPE: He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

269
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,840
Nine hours in bed.

270
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,160
Five hours in front of the TV.

271
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,440
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

272
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
That's totally inaccurate.

273
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

274
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
Are you spying on me?

275
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

276
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,000
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

277
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

278
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,520
They said it was
a matter of national security.

279
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
That Cap needed help, so...

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,240
Cap?

281
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

282
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
It's what we call him.

283
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,720
If you're a friend.

284
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

285
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,240
He's nice. Whatever.

286
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

287
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,000
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

288
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,640
How's Hank?

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
How do you think he is?

291
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

292
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

294
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
because we need
what's in your head.

295
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,120
Is this where you're living?

296
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,520
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

297
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,040
We're fine.

298
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

299
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
Save it!

300
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,880
-Can we start?
-HOPE: Yeah.

301
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,400
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

302
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,960
we were building this.

303
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

304
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,200
To my mom.

305
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
We think she might still
be down there.

306
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
We just don't know where.

307
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,520
What?

308
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

309
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,320
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

310
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
You built all this
and you don't even know

311
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,040
if she's alive?

312
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,120
It's called a hypothesis.

313
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,000
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

314
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,280
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

315
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,040
But for a split second,

316
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,080
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

317
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,040
And?

318
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,320
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

319
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
We think
when you were down there,

320
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,680
you may have entangled
with her.

321
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,880
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

322
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,240
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

323
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
We think she might have put

324
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,960
some kind of a message
in your head.

325
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Hopefully, a location.

326
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

327
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,440
Your mom put a message
in my head?

328
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,160
Come on. That's insane.

329
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,360
No, Scott.

330
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Insane is going to Germany

331
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,320
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

332
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,600
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

333
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,560
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

334
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,920
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

335
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

336
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,480
That was my life's work!

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
What was I supposed to do?

338
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,800
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

339
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm sorry, Hank!

340
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm sorry I took the suit.

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

342
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,800
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
I wish that I did.

344
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,280
I just had a dream about her

345
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,960
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

346
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
What?

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,440
I had a dream.

348
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,240
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

349
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

350
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,560
Doesn't mean anything.

351
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,680
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

352
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
No.

353
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
Where was she hiding?

354
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,720
-What?
-The little girl.

355
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

356
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,240
No, it was in a tall dresser.

357
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,520
You mean a wardrobe.

358
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
Is that what that's called?

359
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,640
What color was it?

360
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,280
Red.

361
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
Were there horses on it?

362
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh, boy.

363
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,680
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

364
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,360
It doesn't sound like

365
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,480
you really got the gist
of the game.

366
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,720
She's alive.

367
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,080
I knew it.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,360
I knew it!

369
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
We need to get that part.

370
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
Okay.

371
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

372
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,560
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

373
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Does Burch have it?

374
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,240
HOPE: Yeah. Let's go.
SCOTT: What part?

375
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,520
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

376
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,480
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

377
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,120
from overloading again.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,840
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

379
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

380
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,440
but if I'm not at home
when they come

381
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,560
to take off
my ankle monitor...

382
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,200
then I'm going away forever.

383
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,320
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

384
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

385
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,680
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

386
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
You owe us.

387
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,320
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

388
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,840
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

389
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,480
Let's go.

390
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,480
-We good?
-Yeah.

391
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,200
I'll be right back.

392
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,840
-Can I have one of these?
-No.

393
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,280
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!

394
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,080
Sonny!

395
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,080
BURCH: Oui is French
for "yes."

396
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

397
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,160
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

398
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

399
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,640
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

400
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,280
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

401
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,520
Have a seat.

402
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,560
No, I'm good. Thank you.

403
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,000
Who is this guy?

404
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,200
HANK: Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

405
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,920
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

406
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
Could I just have one...

407
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
No.

408
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,800
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

409
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,080
And I say "special"...

410
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,040
because, well,
he tells me things

411
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
that I didn't previously know.

412
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
For example...

413
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
your name isn't Susan.

414
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
It's Hope Van Dyne.

415
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,840
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

416
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,120
-That's not good, Hank.
-No shit.

417
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,720
What do you want?

418
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,040
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

419
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

420
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,880
Our relationship?

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,800
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

422
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,760
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

423
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,840
but now, Hank Pym...

424
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,360
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

425
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,600
Do you have a point?

426
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,960
Oh, you think
that I don't know

427
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,400
what you've been building
with all this?

428
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Quantum technology.

429
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,600
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

430
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,880
forget cryptocurrency.

431
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,640
Quantum energy is the future.

432
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,480
It's the next gold rush.

433
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,640
Is that so?

434
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
I want in, Hope.

435
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,840
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

436
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

437
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,840
Starting bid...

438
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,600
one billion dollars.

439
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,360
Thank you, Sonny, really.

440
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,720
But my father and I
have something

441
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,240
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

442
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,520
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

443
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,880
BURCH: My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

444
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,800
So, we are
either in business together...

445
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,760
or we aren't
in business together.

446
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,600
Then I guess we aren't.

447
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
You can go.

448
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,520
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

449
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,640
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

450
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
Listen, Sonny.

451
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,680
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

452
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
if you just give me
that component.

453
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

454
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,120
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

455
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,920
Okay.

456
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,840
So, now what?

457
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,120
You'll see.

458
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

459
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,040
-Mmm-hmm.
-I want to know what it is

460
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,200
because if they're not working
with us...

461
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,840
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
I want some names...

463
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
Hold on, you gave her wings?

464
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,800
Get her.

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,720
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

466
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
Stop firing! Stop!

467
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

468
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,600
Go!

469
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Wings and blasters.

470
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,800
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

471
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
No, I did.

472
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,240
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

473
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,920
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

474
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,720
I can assure you of that!

475
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,040
What in the hell is that?

476
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,360
THE WASP: Dad,
are you seeing this?

477
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,440
Hope, get out of there!

478
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,720
-I gotta do something.
-Wait!

479
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,360
It is still
a work in progress.

480
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,120
ANT-MAN: You taught me
that kick. Remember?

481
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,480
THE WASP: Yeah, great form.

482
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,440
ANT-MAN: Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

483
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,720
THE WASP: Not the time, Scott.

484
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Damn it, where'd it go?

485
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I've lost it.

486
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,120
HANK: I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.

487
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
-Try looking...
-

488
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,200
THE WASP: Dad?

489
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Give me that.

490
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,480
Now.

491
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,240
-Are you okay?
-No!

492
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,440
He got the lab.

493
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,360
No.

494
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Come on!

495
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,120
What was that?

496
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,600
I don't know.

497
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,600
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

498
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,520
and figure out
where the lab is.

499
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,480
So, where to now?

500
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,480
How about my house? Hmm?

501
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

502
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,840
and Woo could walk in
any second.

503
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,240
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

504
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,600
What about your house?

505
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,480
Sorry.

506
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,360
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

507
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
No.

508
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,160
No, no, no, no!

509
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,920
No!

510
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,480
LUIS: Wow, Dr. Pym...

511
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,000
who would've thought that,

512
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,360
once again,
in your hour of need...

513
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
that you would turn to us,
you know?

514
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,680
Not me.

515
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,040
Mmm. Help yourself.

516
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,360
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

517
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

518
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,720
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

519
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
The oatmeal packets.

520
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,680
Oatmeal packets.

521
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,440
-It's insult.
-Why is it an insult?

522
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,680
Because it tastes like sand.

523
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,120
LUIS: You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

524
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,480
It's not organic, it's sand.

525
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
It's the most important meal
of the day.

526
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,720
LUIS: You know what,
you can get creative with it.

527
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
Break teeth.

528
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,160
Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.

529
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

530
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,400
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

531
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,200
We got bigger fish to fry.

532
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,840
Is that my desk?

533
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,560
-LUIS: Yeah.
-What?

534
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,160
Why do I have
such a small desk?

535
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

536
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
You snooze, you lose.

537
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,960
Well, I was
under house arrest.

538
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,800
Yeah.

539
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,040
SCOTT: You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

540
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
This is garbage.

541
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

542
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,160
I got it at a rummage sale.

543
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,800
SCOTT: So, you save money
on my desk?

544
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,840
Guys.

545
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,080
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

546
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,440
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

547
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

548
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,960
like what happened to you.

549
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

550
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,080
Like a ghost.

551
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,720
Like Baba Yaga.

552
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,360
Baba Yaga, the witch.

553
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,240
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

554
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,840
You know Baba Yaga?

555
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
HOPE: Whoever stole it...

556
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,840
we need to find it.

557
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,440
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

558
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,360
Like Baba Yaga.

559
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,240
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

560
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

561
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,040
Because if you didn't,

562
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,080
we have a variety
of affordable options.

563
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,640
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

564
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,280
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

565
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,400
They also looked like
they were phasing.

566
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Phasing?

567
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,320
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

568
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,640
through different states
of matter.

569
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,640
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

570
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,880
The lab emits radiation.

571
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

572
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,360
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

573
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,480
Where else can we find
that equipment?

574
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
Well, there is one person.

575
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,640
Bill Foster.

576
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Great!

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,360
Who's Bill Foster?

578
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,640
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

579
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,520
They had a falling out
years ago.

580
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,360
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

581
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
It's probably
just a waste of time.

582
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

583
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,040
Don't you think
we should check?

584
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,520
We need to find out
who took the lab.

585
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,520
SCOTT: Guys,
it's not a good idea

586
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,040
to be out in the open
like this.

587
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,040
HANK: Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

588
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,560
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

589
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,200
That's not a disguise, Hank.

590
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,480
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

591
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,560
BILL: In an isolated system...

592
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,240
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

593
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,600
If the system
is interfered with,

594
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,880
that stability becomes chaos.

595
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,840
Unpredictable.

596
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

597
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

598
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,360
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

599
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,160
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

600
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,880
In other words,
the object in question

601
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,600
would be both
in and out of phase...

602
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,000
with multiple
parallel realities.

603
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,560
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

604
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,440
I am noticing
an unusually high number

605
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,840
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

606
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,880
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

607
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,200
That'll be enough for today.

608
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,040
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

609
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,800
BILL: It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

610
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,920
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

611
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
Posner molecules
in your brains.

612
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

613
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

614
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,520
in front of everything?

615
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,400
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

616
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,960
Hope, I'd love to help you...

617
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,720
but I don't have anything

618
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,560
like the equipment
you're describing.

619
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,840
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

620
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,080
BILL: Don't condescend, Hank.

621
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

622
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,280
All because
you had to grow to a size

623
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,080
that finally fit your ego.

624
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

625
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,640
Really?

626
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

627
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,760
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

628
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
Actually, I do.

629
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,880
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

630
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,720
on a project called Goliath.

631
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,280
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

632
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

633
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,360
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

634
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,840
-Right...
-

635
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,120
I don't know.
How big did you get?

636
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,040
My record? 21 feet.

637
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,600
-Not bad.
-You?

638
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,600
I don't...

639
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,760
No, really, I'm curious.

640
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,400
-65 feet. Yeah.
-Whoa!

641
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,240
-Huge.
-65.

642
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,800
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

643
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,120
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

644
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

645
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,120
-Strange.

646
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
You had all the answers
back in the day.

647
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,560
That's why I left the project.

648
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,680
Left? I fired you.

649
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,000
BILL: Best decision
I ever made.

650
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,320
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

651
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,520
stubborn, impatient.

652
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,640
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

653
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,200
Just the mediocrities.

654
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,400
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

655
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
and chose to stick it out.

656
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,640
Watch it, Bill.

657
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,240
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

658
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,520
You son of a bitch.

659
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,880
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

660
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm trying to save my mother.

661
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Now, which office
would you say?

662
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,440
Oh, it's Woo.

663
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,840
Someone must have seen me.

664
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,200
Relax. If this is about you,

665
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,080
they'd be in your house
by now.

666
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
What are you, 15?

667
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,880
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

668
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

669
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,640
if you modify
the diffraction units

670
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,800
on one of your regulators.

671
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
-That could work.
-I don't know what that means.

672
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Thank you. Thank you.

673
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,320
But, Doctor,
campus police says

674
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

675
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,640
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

676
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,680
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

677
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
I can assure you
I'm the last person

678
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,040
he would want to visit.

679
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,280
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

680
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,960
WOO: Hey, hey.

681
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Why is that?

682
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,200
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

683
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,560
HANK:
So I'm a terrible partner?

684
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,080
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

685
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,360
in his unremarkable career.

686
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,480
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

687
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,440
Fine, one decent idea.

688
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,480
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

689
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,440
when I upgraded the suits.

690
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,080
So, if we had an old suit,

691
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
we might be able
to track down the lab?

692
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,720
Yes, but we don't.

693
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,840
-What if we did?
-HOPE: What do you mean?

694
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,360
I mean...

695
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,600
life's funny.

696
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

697
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,760
What?

698
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,120
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

699
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,760
I couldn't destroy that.

700
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,320
Before I turned myself in,

701
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

702
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,080
You sent my suit
through the mail?

703
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,240
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

704
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,640
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

705
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Where is it?

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

707
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,280
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

708
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,760
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

709
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,360
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

710
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,720
-Hey, get away from the plant.

711
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,840
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

712
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,520
Show-and-tell.

713
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Scotty?

714
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
No, stop!

715
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,640
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

716
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,280
ANT-MAN: Whenever you go
back to school...

717
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,160
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

718
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,800
This place seems huge.

719
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,000
What is it?

720
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,160
THE WASP:
It's the new regulator.

721
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,200
ANT-MAN: Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

722
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,920
How much of
a work in progress is this?

723
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,560
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

724
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
THE WASP: Oh.

725
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,760
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

726
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
THE WASP: Okay, okay.

727
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
HANK: What do you see?

728
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,080
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

729
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,560
Just let me...

730
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,440
-SCOTT: Ow!
-

731
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,400
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

732
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,400
Okay.
All right.

733
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,320
Try that.

734
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,480
Sorry.

735
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,480
What?

736
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,320
Awesome.

737
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,440
If only Cap could see you now.

738
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

739
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,840
TEACHER: Hey!

740
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
Where's your hall pass?

741
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,600
Hey, I'm talking to you.

742
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Hey!

743
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,320
Hey. Eh...

744
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,880
THE WASP: You can do it.

745
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,120
You almost got it.

746
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,040
Oh, peanut.

747
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay, let's go.

748
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,200
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

749
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,720
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

750
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,320
So cranky.

751
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,080
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

752
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,200
-Do you really have that?

753
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
HANK: Let's see
if Foster was right.

754
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,400
This has gotta be the lab.

755
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,360
Let's go get it.

756
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,720
Yeah.

757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,480
This seems right.

758
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,840
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

759
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,480
Makes you think, huh?

760
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,680
About what?

761
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,520
Germany.

762
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,560
What do you mean?

763
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,400
We were working together,
training together...

764
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,040
and other stuffing together.

765
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,520
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

766
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,240
I guess we'll never know.

767
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,960
But I do know one thing.

768
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,040
What?

769
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,960
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

770
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,120
Hey, Scott.

771
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,560
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

772
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,120
long enough to get my lab?

773
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,120
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

774
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,320
Okay, you're transmitting.

775
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,560
THE WASP:
What took you so long?

776
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,120
ANT-MAN: Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

777
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

778
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,040
You like it?

779
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,360
THE WASP: Hilarious.

780
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,160
HANK: I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.

781
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,480
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

782
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,600
Be careful.

783
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,280
ANT-MAN: You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

784
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,160
THE WASP: It's okay.
It's just the suit.

785
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,920
ANT-MAN: How do you know?
THE WASP: Look.

786
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,880
ANT-MAN: That's Ghost?

787
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,320
THE WASP: What is she doing?

788
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,600
ANT-MAN: Do you think
that suit is how

789
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,480
she goes through walls
and stuff?

790
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,520
THE WASP: Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

791
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,840
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

792
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

793
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,560
and not
somebody else's, right?

794
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,840
THE WASP: Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

795
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,080
I'll get it.

796
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,200
Hope. Hope! Hank.

797
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,120
Guys.

798
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,480
I don't think
they can hear you.

799
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,320
Hi.

800
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm Ava.

801
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,080
Scott.

802
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,080
So, you don't need the suit...

803
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,960
to go through things.

804
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,760
No.

805
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,640
It just helps me control it.

806
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,880
And the pain, supposedly.

807
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,720
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

808
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,120
and crush my heart, are you?

809
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,320
You're funny.

810
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

811
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,640
I need...

812
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
what's in your head.

813
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,160
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

814
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,480
and get this over with,
shall we?

815
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,520
Get up!

816
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,320
Come on!

817
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,200
-Dad?

818
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,440
Don't ever touch him again.

819
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,000
Now, now, Hope...

820
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,600
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

821
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,880
all things considered.

822
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,600
What the hell
are you talking about?

823
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,800
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

824
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,160
Bill.

825
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,360
What have you done?

826
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,360
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

827
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,240
You're with her?

828
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

829
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
What the hell
is going on here?

830
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,040
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

831
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,480
Why would he?

832
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,760
Elihas Starr.

833
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,080
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

834
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,560
Quantum research.

835
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,320
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

836
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,160
You had him fired.

837
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,440
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

838
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,880
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

839
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

840
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
No, no, no!

841
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Too many.

842
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,520
Until something went wrong.

843
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,040
He told us to run.

844
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,040
Elihas, what's happening?

845
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Just go. Go!

846
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,000
Daddy! Daddy!

847
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,440
AVA: I could tell
he was scared.

848
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,880
Daddy!

849
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,120
Ava, no!

850
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,160
AVA: I didn't want him
to be alone.

851
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,920
No! No!

852
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,920
When I woke up,
my parents were dead.

853
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,400
I wasn't so lucky.

854
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,200
AVA: They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."

855
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,240
A rather dull name, I think.

856
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,280
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

857
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,560
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

858
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,240
and stitched back together.

859
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,760
Over and over.

860
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,560
Every day.

861
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,960
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

862
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,760
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

863
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,920
Hello, Ava.

864
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,680
My name's Bill.

865
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,320
I was a friend
of your father's.

866
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,760
I brought you something.

867
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,440
It's all right.
Try again.

868
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,240
That's it.

869
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,280
AVA: Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.

870
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,440
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

871
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,160
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

872
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,000
They built me
a containment suit,

873
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,640
so I could control my phasing.

874
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,120
And trained me
to be a stealth operative.

875
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,520
They weaponized me.

876
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,440
I stole for them.
Spied for them.

877
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,560
Killed for them.

878
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,160
And in exchange for my soul...

879
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,200
they were going to cure me.

880
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,280
They lied.

881
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,840
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

882
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,000
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

883
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,240
but her condition
was progressive.

884
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,040
-I didn't know how to cure it.
-

885
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,880
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

886
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,240
and that she should
watch you instead.

887
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,880
And sure enough,
she discovered

888
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,200
that you were
building the tunnel.

889
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,360
Then, she told me about Lang.

890
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,960
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

891
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,440
-that's when I...
-

892
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Christ's sake!

893
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,120
That's me. I'm sorry.

894
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,800
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

895
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,560
"Cassie, 911."

896
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,640
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

897
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,080
No, that's not happening.

898
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,120
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

899
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,920
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

900
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,080
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

901
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,880
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

902
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,840
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

903
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,040
-

904
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,200
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

905
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,080
I can't find my soccer shoes.

906
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,200
What?

907
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,440
I have a game tomorrow.

908
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,680
MAGGIE: Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.

909
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,200
Can you just walk the phone
around the house?

910
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,760
No, I can't do that right now.

911
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,680
-Why not?
-Because I'm sick.

912
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,880
MAGGIE: Hey, can you just
maybe look around

913
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,880
later then and call me back?

914
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,400
Please? Thank you.

915
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,760
Bye, Daddy!

916
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,680
-Bye, peanut!
-Feel better!

917
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Feel better, buddy!

918
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,720
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

919
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,720
Ava, I want to help you.

920
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

921
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,280
Oh, really? How?

922
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Janet.

923
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,080
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

924
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
absorbing quantum energy.

925
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,680
We can extract that energy.

926
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,160
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

927
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,160
Extract it?

928
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,400
-Yes.
-Are you insane?

929
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,160
That would rip Janet apart.

930
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,160
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

931
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,600
When Janet's location

932
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,040
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

933
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

934
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,840
What?

935
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,760
BILL: You are gonna
stay here...

936
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
just in case I need your help.

937
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
Like hell I would help you!

938
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,600
You'll do whatever I say.

939
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,800
HANK: You're gonna kill Janet!

940
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,800
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

941
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,360
-HOPE: Dad?
-Calm down, Hank.

942
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,240
So help me God...

943
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,920
The pills.

944
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,600
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

945
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,640
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

946
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,400
He could die!

947
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,600
Come on!

948
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,600
Help him!

949
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,360
HOPE: Dad, just hang on,
all right?

950
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,760
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

951
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,200
Help him, man! Come on!

952
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,240
HOPE: The Altoid tin!

953
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,400
Wait!

954
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
-Thanks, guys.

955
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,640
Hank!

956
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,160
HANK: Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

957
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,520
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

958
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,080
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

959
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,760
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

960
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,680
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

961
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,840
Good job.

962
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
It'll work.

963
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

964
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,760
Look, we'll adjust the relays

965
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,640
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

966
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,400
It's going to be fine.

967
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,280
SCOTT: So, this is it.

968
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,440
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

969
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,040
to prepare I'd be more ready.

970
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,120
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

971
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,680
It kind of melts your mind.

972
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,680
I mean seeing my mom again.

973
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh.

974
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,880
What if she's a completely
different person?

975
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,480
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

976
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,040
I'm serious, Scott.

977
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,240
Or George Jefferson.

978
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,120
What if she's forgotten
about me?

979
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,320
When I was in prison...

980
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,040
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

981
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,440
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

982
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,960
I never would have
forgotten her.

983
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

984
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,280
until she can see you again.

985
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,040
Thank you.

986
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,400
Hey.

987
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,880
We got a big problem.

988
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,960
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

989
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,840
on the back of the building.

990
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,480
Oh, no.

991
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,160
And they're on the proposal,

992
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,720
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

993
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,280
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

994
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,000
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

995
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,040
No. No, no, no, no.

996
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,360
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

997
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,600
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

998
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

999
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,200
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

1000
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,800
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

1001
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
And you can fix them there.

1002
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,640
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

1003
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,720
It's complicated.

1004
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,160
What do you mean
it's complicated?

1005
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,320
As you can see, sir,

1006
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,440
this system
is state of the art.

1007
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,840
Security of tomorrow, today.

1008
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,200
Oh, that's so good!

1009
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,840
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

1010
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,960
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1011
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,960
so we can fix the plans.

1012
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,560
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1013
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,040
-DAVE: As you can see...
-Oh, oh, oh!

1014
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,480
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1015
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,200
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

1016
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,680
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

1017
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,080
Well, you said get the works.

1018
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,320
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1019
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,640
BURCH: He's right.

1020
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,520
The undercarriage wash,

1021
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,120
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

1022
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,480
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1023
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,840
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

1024
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,120
about car wash protocol?

1025
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,640
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1026
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,320
And I do my research, Luis.

1027
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,840
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

1028
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,640
at the FBI that you are

1029
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,360
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

1030
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,480
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

1031
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,280
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

1032
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,800
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

1033
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,640
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

1034
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,320
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

1035
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,520
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1036
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,600
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

1037
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,680
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1038
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,680
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1039
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,200
Now...

1040
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,200
Uzman is a master

1041
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,320
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

1042
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,960
through psychoactive means.

1043
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,320
Oh, is that truth serum?

1044
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

1045
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,400
That's just nonsense from TV.

1046
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,200
Well, what is it then?

1047
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,920
It's a little concoction

1048
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,720
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1049
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,760
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1050
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,000
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

1051
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,800
No, it's not.

1052
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1053
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,200
-Right?
-It's not a truth serum.

1054
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,680
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1055
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,080
ANITOLOV:
It's not a truth serum.

1056
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,560
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1057
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,760
The truth serum.

1058
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,680
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

1059
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,680
so you might wanna think
about that.

1060
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,320
We've got to get
that lab back.

1061
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,560
AVA: What?

1062
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,880
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1063
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,280
How long have I got?

1064
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,160
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1065
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,720
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1066
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,840
How?

1067
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,280
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

1068
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,480
You can't mean that.

1069
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,040
Ava!

1070
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,840
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

1071
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,840
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

1072
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,520
You're not the one who's about

1073
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,360
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

1074
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,600
I am!

1075
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,240
You said you could fix me!

1076
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,600
You promised.

1077
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,600
I know. I will.

1078
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,040
But not like that.

1079
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,640
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

1080
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,600
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1081
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,840
Fine.

1082
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,800
There are other options.

1083
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,840
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1084
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,200
Because I don't feel anything.

1085
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,080
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1086
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,120
This is truth serum!

1087
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,240
There's no such thing!

1088
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,960
Okay.

1089
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,320
Okay, okay.

1090
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,760
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1091
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,360
Okay.

1092
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,480
Where is Scott Lang?

1093
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,040
Well, see, that's complicated.

1094
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,000
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1095
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,600
And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.

1096
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,280
His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...

1097
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,360
"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"

1098
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,480
And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.

1099
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,480
"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...

1100
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,600
"but now I'm all alone."

1101
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,840
And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?

1102
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,240
"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.

1103
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,680
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

1104
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,920
And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,

1105
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,040
"and we're gonna be
best friends."

1106
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,080
BURCH: Okay, hold on, hold on.

1107
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,800
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

1108
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,120
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1109
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,360
with where Scott Lang is?

1110
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,400
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1111
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,800
You put a dime in him,

1112
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,080
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

1113
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,960
He like human jukebox.

1114
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,800
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1115
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,200
-Yeah, only played Morrissey.
-

1116
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,800
And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...

1117
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,480
You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."

1118
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,600
Then, ¡adios!

1119
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,160
What can I say?
We relate to his

1120
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,560
melancholy ballads,
you know?

1121
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,000
-Lang!
-Right, right, right.

1122
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,200
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

1123
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,240
and he starts working
for Hank.

1124
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,560
That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...

1125
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,080
"I want nothing to do
with you.

1126
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,760
"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."

1127
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,920
And then Scotty's, like,

1128
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.

1129
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,200
"And I'll probably
never find love again,

1130
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,400
"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"

1131
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,520
But then you fast forward

1132
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,560
and they're all
into each other, right?

1133
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,640
And then Scotty's, like,

1134
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,960
"You know what?
I can't tell you this...

1135
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,040
"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."

1136
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,800
And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!

1137
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,400
"Smell you later, dummy."

1138
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,640
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

1139
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,280
And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...

1140
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,880
"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been

1141
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"

1142
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
But fate brought 'em
back together.

1143
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,000
And then Hope's heart
is all...

1144
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,760
"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...

1145
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,520
"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"

1146
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,880
And then
my heart is all, like...

1147
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,800
"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red

1148
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,680
"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"

1149
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,680
"Out of business"?

1150
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,720
"Days away"?

1151
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,880
Damn truth serum!

1152
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,080
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

1153
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,120
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

1154
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,120
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

1155
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,120
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

1156
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,400
That's terrible bossing!

1157
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,440
Damn, bro!

1158
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,600
-That's on me! That's on me!
-BURCH: Hey!

1159
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,360
Enough.

1160
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,520
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

1161
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,200
Where is Scott Lang?

1162
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,320
I've been trying to tell you,

1163
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,400
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

1164
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,880
Emotionally speaking.

1165
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,080
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1166
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,520
Oh!
The woods.

1167
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,720
-The woods?
-

1168
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,440
Baba Yaga!

1169
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,160
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1170
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,400
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

1171
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,600
off the Panoramic Highway!

1172
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,880
For God's sake!

1173
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,560
Baba Yaga, come at night

1174
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,000
Little children, sleepy tight

1175
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,920
Damn it!

1176
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,960
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

1177
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,640
I'm never gonna see it.

1178
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,880
So, what do we do now?

1179
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,920
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

1180
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,320
than from the boogeyman.

1181
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,920
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

1182
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,800
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1183
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,200
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1184
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,040
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1185
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,280
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1186
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,560
Understood.

1187
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,360
Good news, gentlemen.

1188
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,720
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1189
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1190
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,280
KNOX: Right.

1191
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,880
-STOLTZ: Sir.
-Can you knock?

1192
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,080
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1193
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,200
Ooh, I love leads.

1194
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,000
System's in the green.

1195
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,760
Priming the coils.

1196
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,160
HOPE: Full charge.

1197
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,360
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

1198
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,600
let us know
if you get anything

1199
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,640
that could be a part of
her message.

1200
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,120
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1201
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,800
HANK: Okay, then.

1202
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Here it goes.

1203
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,920
We did it!

1204
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,960
You got anything?

1205
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,080
Nothin'.

1206
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,960
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1207
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,640
No.

1208
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,360
No, no, no, no!

1209
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,440
What's happening?

1210
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,320
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1211
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,760
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1212
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,840
HOPE: Then what else
could it be?

1213
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,800
-HANK: I don't know!
-

1214
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,240
-Scott, what are you doing?
-Scott, get away from that!

1215
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,280
Scott, you can't...

1216
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,120
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1217
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,480
I need to fix the algorithm.

1218
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,040
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1219
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,880
I've thought about it a lot.

1220
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,360
Janet?

1221
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,640
Hi, honey.

1222
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,560
Jellybean.

1223
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,320
Mom?

1224
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,960
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1225
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,880
It's all so rushed.

1226
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,360
You two have done
such great work.

1227
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,480
You just need a little...

1228
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,200
nudge.

1229
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,920
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1230
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,880
It wasn't a message you put

1231
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,280
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1232
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,000
Clever girl.

1233
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,520
-I'm so proud of you.
-

1234
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,360
Honey, tell us where you are.

1235
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,120
Tell us how to find you.

1236
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,120
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1237
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,640
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1238
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,240
You have to follow my voice.

1239
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,720
Of course!

1240
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,760
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1241
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,840
HANK: I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1242
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
between point two
and point nine.

1243
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,000
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1244
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,280
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1245
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
Look at us squabbling again.

1246
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,600
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1247
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,160
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1248
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,320
-Bullseye.

1249
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,040
Source lock.

1250
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,720
It's you.

1251
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,920
We got it!

1252
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,640
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1253
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,320
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1254
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,640
It's very dangerous,

1255
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,760
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1256
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,480
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1257
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,040
You have two hours.

1258
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,880
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1259
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,000
and it'll be another century

1260
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,520
before they align
like this again.

1261
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
HOPE: We'll find you.

1262
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,560
I know you will, Jellybean.

1263
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,600
Nope.

1264
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,600
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1265
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,800
Perfect.

1266
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,280
How did we get up here?

1267
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,840
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1268
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,160
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1269
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,040
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1270
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,640
Scott, I'll be fine.

1271
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,320
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1272
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,840
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1273
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,880
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1274
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,440
Hey, man, you coming?

1275
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,200
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1276
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,480
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1277
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,880
-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1278
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,280
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1279
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,240
And then all of a sudden

1280
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,520
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1281
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,280
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1282
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,600
I hate it, I hate it.

1283
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,600
-Uh...
-But you need to go home...

1284
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,240
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1285
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,280
And by the way...

1286
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,040
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1287
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,080
I feel like such a jerk.

1288
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,560
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1289
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,640
What?

1290
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,880
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1291
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,120
How?

1292
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,200
-I told Luis where we are.
-You what?

1293
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1294
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,600
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1295
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,840
Oh, my God!

1296
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,000
Look, we need
to land that account.

1297
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,280
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

1298
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,320
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1299
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,240
to find work these days?

1300
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,800
Jesus, Scott!

1301
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,920
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1302
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,840
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1303
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,720
I know!

1304
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,360
I'm really sorry...

1305
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,680
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1306
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,320
I have to go.

1307
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,760
Can I borrow the suit?

1308
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1309
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,520
Powering on.

1310
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,640
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

1311
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,040
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1312
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,760
-Don't bother.
-What?

1313
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,000
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1314
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,160
as soon as we've found my mom.

1315
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,520
-Hope...
-Scott, just go!

1316
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,680
-Scott?
-Daddy?

1317
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,960
It's us, buddy!

1318
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,320
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1319
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,880
He must be resting.

1320
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,120
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

1321
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,280
and look under your bed?

1322
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,600
Daddy, you upstairs?

1323
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,200
Daddy?

1324
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
PAXTON: What the...

1325
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,160
MAGGIE: He really lives
like a pig these days.

1326
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,560
Daddy?

1327
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,800
-Spread out!
-

1328
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,040
Again?

1329
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,520
You people have no shame!

1330
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,520
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1331
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,640
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1332
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,360
Cassie, let the man get by!

1333
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,080
But Daddy's super sick!

1334
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,440
I'll see about that!

1335
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,480
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1336
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,920
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1337
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,280
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1338
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,920
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

1339
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,080
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1340
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,880
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1341
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,760
-Yes!
-Forget it, move aside!

1342
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,160
CASSIE: No!

1343
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,680
-Woo!

1344
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,440
-What are you doing here?
-Scott.

1345
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,600
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

1346
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,880
I told you.

1347
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,360
SCOTT: Excuse me.

1348
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,000
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1349
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,480
Sorry.

1350
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,680
HANK: I'll start the van.

1351
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,040
You get the lab.

1352
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,360
AGENT: Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1353
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,880
Hank Pym...

1354
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,480
Hope Van Dyne...

1355
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,800
you're under arrest.

1356
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,680
This is harassment!

1357
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,960
Actually, it's not.

1358
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,600
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1359
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,160
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

1360
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,640
-WOO: His monitor check out?
-Of course it does.

1361
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,520
Damn it!

1362
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,080
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1363
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,320
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1364
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,680
Seriously? Yes!

1365
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,720
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1366
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,480
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1367
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,920
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1368
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,600
Anyway, I'll be back later

1369
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,960
for the official end
of your sentence!

1370
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,040
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1371
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,240
You should feel great
about yourself!

1372
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,120
AGENT 1: What is it?

1373
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,240
AGENT 2: We have a man down.

1374
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,160
And Pym's lab is gone.

1375
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,440
SCOTT: Hey.

1376
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,000
Thanks for covering for me.

1377
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,200
Sure.

1378
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,240
So...

1379
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,520
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1380
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,760
Not long.

1381
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,600
It just sort of happened.

1382
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,440
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1383
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,320
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1384
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,400
Daddy, it's okay.

1385
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,680
It's not.

1386
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,120
I do some dumb things...

1387
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,560
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1388
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Mainly you.

1389
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,160
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1390
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,640
I screw it up
just about every time.

1391
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,000
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1392
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,400
like a partner.

1393
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,520
Well, she's made it clear

1394
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,920
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1395
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,200
Who?

1396
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,680
Hope.

1397
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,440
Wait, who did you think?

1398
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,480
Me.

1399
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,720
Don't laugh.

1400
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,560
I'd be a great partner.

1401
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,440
Aw, peanut.

1402
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,800
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1403
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,200
I would be a terrible dad.

1404
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,880
Fine.

1405
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,720
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1406
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,960
She reminds me of you.

1407
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,640
You gonna go help her?

1408
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,800
I think you should help her.

1409
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
I wish I could...

1410
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,680
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1411
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,560
You can do it.

1412
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,960
You can do anything.

1413
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,200
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1414
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,680
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1415
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,800
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1416
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,240
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1417
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,120
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1418
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,680
All right, what's our plan?

1419
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,040
To shrink that wall.

1420
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,440
It looks load-bearing.

1421
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,760
The ceiling could collapse.

1422
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,440
Then we run like hell.

1423
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,760
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1424
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,760
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1425
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,240
They're all heavily armed.

1426
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,520
Not great odds.

1427
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,360
You got any better ideas?

1428
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
Nope.

1429
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,280
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1430
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,400
She'd be so proud of you.

1431
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
Okay.

1432
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,120
One...

1433
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,800
two...

1434
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,960
Scott?

1435
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,760
ANT-MAN: What're you two
just standing around for?

1436
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,400
We gotta go find that lab.

1437
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,360
What about me?

1438
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,880
Perfect.

1439
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,800
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1440
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,600
THE WASP: Okay, now what?

1441
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,320
You're asking me?

1442
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,120
Get in!

1443
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,440
Hi.

1444
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,040
Hi.

1445
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,840
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1446
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,760
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1447
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,840
until they start shooting
at us?

1448
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,760
-Yeah.
-

1449
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,840
-Hey, Burch.
-BURCH: Yeah.

1450
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,920
Yeah, they're out.

1451
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,440
I'm on my way.

1452
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,640
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1453
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,000
How could this happen?

1454
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,880
I mean, what the dickens?

1455
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,640
Thank you.

1456
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,640
You're welcome.

1457
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,760
So, uh, how do we find
the lab?

1458
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,160
After we lost it
the first time...

1459
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,120
I put on a new tracker...

1460
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,960
of sorts.

1461
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,400
That'll work.

1462
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,920
Is it ready or not?

1463
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,960
BILL: We can begin
the extraction process.

1464
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
Listen, Ava.

1465
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,920
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1466
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,920
Maybe we should...

1467
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,640
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1468
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,920
I've got days until I'm dead.

1469
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,600
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1470
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,760
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1471
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,120
We don't have much time before

1472
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,320
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1473
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,320
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1474
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,400
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1475
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,320
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1476
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,680
So, we should do that.

1477
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,960
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1478
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,560
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1479
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,880
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1480
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,440
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1481
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,160
Let's call it 2-A.

1482
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,680
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1483
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,400
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1484
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,760
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1485
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,920
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1486
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,800
Scott!

1487
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,840
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1488
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,720
I'm going to dive.

1489
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,640
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1490
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,920
together,
protecting the tunnel.

1491
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,960
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1492
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,480
Let me get her.

1493
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,760
I think he's right.

1494
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,080
"Whassup?"

1495
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,800
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

1496
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,880
"Whassup?"

1497
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,720
I had him follow us.

1498
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,760
I thought we could use
some help.

1499
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,560
SCOTT: All right.
I'm in position.

1500
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,760
The ants are headed in.

1501
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,160
Copy that.

1502
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,400
LUIS: Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.

1503
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,400
-Do you want Pez?
-No.

1504
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,640
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1505
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,240
By the way, I love that suit!

1506
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,360
Thanks, man.

1507
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,440
I wish I had a suit.

1508
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,760
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1509
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,600
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1510
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,400
What is it?

1511
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,240
Don't know.

1512
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,240
It's them!

1513
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,240
They can't be far.

1514
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,000
All right, Hank. Hank?

1515
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,520
-

1516
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,840
Dad, what's your status?

1517
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,920
HANK: Foster's taken care of.

1518
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,640
Suiting up now.

1519
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,800
I just wanted to save Ava.

1520
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,600
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1521
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,800
She's afraid.

1522
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,720
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1523
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,480
I promise.

1524
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,160
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1525
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,880
Good luck, Hank.

1526
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,000
Thanks, Bill.

1527
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,360
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1528
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,880
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Time remaining, 15 minutes.

1529
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,840
HOPE: Hank's in, Scott.

1530
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:50,960
Any sign of her?

1531
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,240
No, nothing yet.

1532
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,400
Ava!

1533
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,280
GHOST:
Call off the ants, Scott.

1534
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,640
Oh, boy!

1535
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,320
ANT-MAN:
Can I get a status report?

1536
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,000
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1537
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,600
Ready to dive.

1538
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,360
-In case I don't make it...
-HOPE: Don't.

1539
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,120
Don't say that.

1540
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,520
I can't lose you, too.

1541
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,960
I love you, Hope.

1542
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,800
ANT-MAN: Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1543
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,040
Now.

1544
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,160
ANT-MAN: Misdirection.

1545
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,840
One of the first things
they teach you

1546
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,280
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1547
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,240
GHOST: No!

1548
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,120
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1549
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,240
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1550
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,720
ANT-MAN: Okay, on my way!

1551
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,800
Oh, no.

1552
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,000
Really?
This guy again?

1553
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,280
ANT-MAN: Who?

1554
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1555
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,720
Change of plans.

1556
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,160
Hang on.

1557
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,560
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1558
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:19,160
Hold on.

1559
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,800
That undercarriage is filthy!

1560
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,400
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1561
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,840
ANT-MAN:
Hope, what're you doing?

1562
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,240
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1563
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,480
HOPE: Don't worry,

1564
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,640
I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.

1565
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,880
ANT-MAN:
Wait, what're you... Oh.

1566
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,520
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1567
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,800
We're gonna die!

1568

-Take the wheel.
-What? Wait! Whoa.

1580
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,800
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1581
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,400
THE WASP: Be careful up there!

1582
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,680
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1583
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,840
Oh, you got pezed!

1584

Up here!

1585
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,440
Oh, that's not good.

-No!

There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1589
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,760
Get the lab!

1590
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,120
THE WASP: I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1591
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,960
Hope! Wait!

1592
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,600
Hey, what about me?

1593
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,720
We got you now, Ava!

1594

Piece of junk!

Ah! Yes!

1600

Go, go, go, go, go!

Burch got the lab.

1602
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,600
I'm going after him.

1603
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,080
ANT-MAN: No, no, no,
no, no, no!

1604
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,800
Work in progress, my ass...

1605
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,320
THE WASP:
Scott, where are you?

1606
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,920
I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!

1607
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,160
ANT-MAN: I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1608
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,040
THE WASP: We're running
out of time.

1609
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,680
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning,
approaching quantum void.

1610
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,120
I'm coming to you, honey.

1611
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,240
Guys.

1612
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

1613
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,760
THE WASP: We can't grow
the lab without it.

1614
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,000
Get it to us fast.

1615
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,240
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1616
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,840
ANT-MAN:
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1617
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,760
LUIS: What?

1618
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,160
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1619
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,520
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1620
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,640
You gotta check the van!

1621
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,240
Huh?

1622
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,200
Awesome!

1623
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,360
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1624
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,720
Burch's boys are all over me.

1625
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,960
THE WASP: I'm on my way.

1626
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,200
ANT-MAN:
Right. I'll get the lab.

1627
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,640
THE WASP: Hi.

1628
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,320
Oh, that's badass!

1629
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,360
-Nice.
-

1630
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,480
ANT-MAN: Doink!

1631
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,880
Come here, you little weasel!

1632
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,760
No, you don't!

1633
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,800
I guess maybe you do.

1634
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,080
-

1635
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,520
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1636
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,160
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1637
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,280
-Would you just one time,

1638
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,760
please work!

1639
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,360
All right, I need help.

1640
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,600
-Yes!
-

1641
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,840
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1642
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,680
Somebody!

1643
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,360
Hey! Come on, man!

1644
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,880
Not cool!

1645
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,240
Murderers!

1646
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1647
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:43,080
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

1648
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,560
You're a badass!

1649
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,520
Yes!

1650
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,040
No, no, no!

1651
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,800
Ant-onio!

1652
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,760
Our friends, the humpbacks,

1653
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,720
dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...

1654
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,920
for a little leisure
and a little breeding.

1655
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,280
Listen, Uzman...

1656
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,600
And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.

1657
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,440
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

1658
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,640
In three hours.

1659
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,960
Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...

1660
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,920
but it looks like
we got some company.

1661
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,080
Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?

1662
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,400
There it is.
There's a breach.

1663
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,960
What the...?

1664
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,800
ANT-MAN: Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1665
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,160
It's okay. It's okay!

1666
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,920
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1667
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,160
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

1668
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,800
No, no! No, no!

1669
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,920
ANT-MAN: You're embarrassing
yourself now.

1670
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,000
-Come on. Let go.
-

1671
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,080
Thank you.

1672
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,480
-

1673
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,280
I'll take this now.

1674
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,480
It melts your mind.

1675
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,880
HOPE: A message in your head.

1676
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,360
SCOTT: I had a dream.

1677
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,200
YOUNG HOPE: Daddy?
Where's Mommy?

1678
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,800
ADULT HOPE: It's where I hid
every time that we played.

1679
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,000
JANET: I love you, Hank.

1680
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,800
YOUNG HOPE: Daddy?

1681
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,600
Daddy?

1682
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:43,440
Dad?
What's going on?

1683
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,760
Why haven't you found Mom?

1684
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,680
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1685
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,080
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1686
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,760
It's me.

1687
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,200
I'm so sorry...

1688
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,720
it took so long.

1689
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,160
No.

1690
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,200
You're here now.

1691
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,960
Let's go home.

1692
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,680
HANK: I thought I was gone.

1693
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,440
But that energy
from your hands...

1694
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,000
how did you do that?

1695
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,800
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1696
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,440
This place...

1697
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,440
it changes you.

1698
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:44,440
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

1699
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,800
evolution.

1700
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,360
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Lab coordinates not found.

1701
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,920
Do not ascend.

1702
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,280
I should probably tell you

1703
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,280
what we're dealing with
up there.

1704
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,800
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1705
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,240
Move.
Move.

1706
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,880
-Move!
-

1707
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,200
Get out of the way.

1708
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,960
Let's go.

1709
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,280
REPORTER: No one here appears
to be sure what this is.

1710
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:23,280
It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.

1711
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,200
-Get out of the way!
-

1712
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,240
I got the lab.

1713
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,320
The air feels chunky.

1714
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,040
HOPE: Oh, no. He's too big.

1715
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,960
LUIS: Scotty!

1716
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,000
Scott!

1717
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,000
ANT-MAN:
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1718
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,040
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1719
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,720
I just need five minutes.

1720
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,200
Five minutes!

1721
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,600
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

1722
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,360
-Scott's air won't last.
-Okay.

1723
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,120
LUIS: Move!

1724
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,080
-Move! Move!

1725
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,040
No, wait!

1726
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,120
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Lab at full scale.

1727
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,400
They did it.

1728
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,800
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ready to ascend.

1729
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,600
Let's go see our daughter.

1730
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,080
THE WASP: Scott!

1731
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,960
Scott!

1732
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,160
Scott, come on, wake up!

1733
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,800
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

1734
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,280
Gotcha.

1735
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,600
Scott?

1736
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:45,880
Hey.

1737
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:46,880
Hey.

1738
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,800
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

1739
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,800
Did you get crushed
by the building?

1740
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,440
Where's the remote, Luis?

1741
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,720
It's probably in there.

1742
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,840
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1743
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,800
I guess
this is where we say...

1744
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,920
Adiós, amigo.

1745
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,000
-LUIS: No, no, no, no!
-

1746
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,160
Thanks, guys.

1747
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,920
BILL: Ava?

1748
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,040
Ava!

1749
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,400
Ava!

1750
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,920
Almost ready for extraction.

1751
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,320
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1752
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,000
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1753
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,760
What if Hank is right?

1754
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,600
What if this process
kills Janet?

1755
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,000
What, you're worried
about her?

1756
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,080
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1757
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,480
She may be able to help.

1758
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,080
Oh, she will help. Right now!

1759
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,080
And if she dies, she dies!

1760
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,960
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1761
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,160
We have to find another way.

1762
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,280
This is the way.

1763
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,680
Janet!

1764
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,800
THE WASP: She started
the extraction.

1765
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,960
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1766
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,120
No!

1767
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,560
-ANT-MAN: Hope!
-

1768
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,720
Are you okay?

1769
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,400
Mom?

1770
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,960
Oh, my God.

1771
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,440
HOPE: We found you.

1772
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,040
I missed you so much.

1773
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,960
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1774
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,680
It's okay.

1775
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,840
I'm here now.
We have time.

1776
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,880
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1777
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,320
I promise.

1778
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,480
HANK: No, it's okay!

1779
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,400
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1780
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,320
-I'll be fine.
-Dad.

1781
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,080
Scott.

1782
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,920
Miss Van Dyne.

1783
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:49,080
It's nice to...

1784
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,680
Well, I guess
we've already met.

1785
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,240
Yeah. I guess we have.

1786
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,280
Wait.

1787
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,160
Your pain.

1788
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,400
I can feel it.

1789
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,240
It hurts.

1790
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,240
It always hurts.

1791
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,640
I'm sorry.

1792
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,840
I think I can help you.

1793
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,120
Did you know
she could do that?

1794
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,960
It's okay.

1795
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,800
Guys, the cops are coming!

1796
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,120
Whoa.

1797
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,040
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1798
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,320
-I gotta go.
-We gotta go!

1799
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,720
What about them?

1800
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,520
-Hands in the air!

1801
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,880
-No! We are going to our jobs.
-No.

1802
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,080
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1803
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,480
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1804
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,640
We traffic
in stolen technology.

1805
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,680
And we have killed many,
many people.

1806
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,320
Uh, he's in charge.

1807
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,480
That's true, I am.

1808
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,400
I've also committed

1809
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,680
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1810
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,080
Some of them would shock you.

1811
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,360
It is truth serum.

1812
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,960
We gotta get outta here.

1813
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,720
Fast.

1814
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,360
I have an idea.

1815
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,120
Giant figure, now spotted

1816
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,520
at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.

1817
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:09,720
All units move in.

1818
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,240
Go, go!

1819
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,760
WOO: There he is!

1820
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,440
It's over, Scotty!

1821
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,720
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

1822
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,400
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1823
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,880
There's nowhere to hide.

1824
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:33,840
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1825
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,000
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1826
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,720
Magic.

1827
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,880
Damn it!

1828
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,800
Get to Lang's, now!

1829
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,160
Well done, honey.

1830
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,800
-Let's go!

1831
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,920
Leave me here.

1832
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,200
We can make it.

1833
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,440
You said it yourself.

1834
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,840
I've hurt people.

1835
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,680
-But you haven't.

1836
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,400
Go. Please!

1837
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,880
We can make it, Ava.

1838
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,800
Bill...

1839
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,000
I'm not leaving you.

1840
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,600
-

1841
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,240
Oh, hey, guys.

1842
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,560
Are my two years up already?

1843
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,200
What's it like out there?

1844
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,440
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

1845
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,680
Are food trucks still a thing?

1846
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,640
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1847
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,000
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

1848
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,280
Where?

1849
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,200
Huh?

1850
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,880
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1851
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,200
Like, in general...

1852
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,200
The next time
you do something bad,

1853
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,720
-I'll be there to catch you...
-Oh.

1854
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,840
You'll be watching...

1855
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,400
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1856
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,800
Why would I do that?

1857
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,480
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1858
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,120
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1859
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:58,200
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1860
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,640
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

1861
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,920
Of course,
that would be strange.

1862
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,880
-Take it easy, Jimmy.
-Okay.

1863
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,360
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1864
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,680
I mean, because I'm free...

1865
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,200
Yeah. Come on.

1866
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,520
You ready?

1867
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:20,680
Yeah!

1868
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,360
-Hi.
-Hi. Hi.

1869
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,800
Oh!

1870
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,920
DAVE: Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1871
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,600
LUIS: X-Con Security.

1872
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,080
Mr. Karapetyan?

1873
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,920
Yeah, you saw that?

1874
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,880
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1875
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,560
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1876
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,400
-Yeah!
-

1877
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,440
That's how you close a deal!

1878
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,280
This is awesome.

1879
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,440
So, Cassie...

1880
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,160
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1881
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,440
I wanna help people...

1882
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,720
like my dad.

1883
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,720
Really?

1884
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,720
I wanted to be his partner.

1885
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,480
But he said he wants you.

1886
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,680
Is that so?

1887
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,720
Daddy!

1888
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,240
Whoa! Hold on.

1889
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,320
-Move, get outta here!

1890
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,240
-Scott, don't, don't, don't!
-

1891
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,720
-CASSIE: Ow.

1892
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,560
Oh, gross!

1893
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,960
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1894
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:57,080
-Go! Shoo! Shoo!
-

1895
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,320
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1896
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,480
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1897
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:11,000
Now, I got this.

1898
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,720
JANET: Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1899
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,480
This is... smaller.

1900
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:22,200
SCOTT: Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1901
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,200
Ah, I think it has flair.

1902
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,640
-

1903
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,600
All right. Control's online.

1904
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,120
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1905
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,120
It should automatically
start absorbing

1906
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,480
quantum healing particles.

1907
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,600
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1908
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,120
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1909
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,240
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

1910
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:44,480
We won't be able to save you.

1911
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,880
Okay.

1912
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,360
Going subatomic in five...

1913
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,640
four...

1914
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,120
three...

1915
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:56,640
two...

1916
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:57,720
one.

1917
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,960
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

1918
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
ANT-MAN: Mic check, one, two.
One, two.

1919
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,640
How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?

1920
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:14,960
Scott, we read you.

1921
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,720
ANT-MAN: I just wanna
make sure.

1922
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,320
Okay.

1923
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:26,240
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1924
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,360
HOPE: Great.

1925
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,160
Preparing for re-entry in...

ANT-MAN: Hello?

Ha, ha. Very funny.

Hank, quit screwing around.

01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,920
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.

01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,440
Bring me up, let's go.
