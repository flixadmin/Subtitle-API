1
00:00:00,402 --> 00:00:01,769
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,460
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:08,512
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:11,465
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:16,520
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:18,522
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,525
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,945
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,982 --> 00:00:28,799
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,484
As much as I would love
to make this city safer,

11
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:33,604
my first obligation is
to Queen Consolidated

12
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:34,989
and yours is, too.

13
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,106
I did some reading up
on Lawton.

14
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,408
Lyla, listen--

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,542
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

16
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:39,710
that he killed
your brother?

17
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,078
That you were using me?

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,713
I need to see
this guy in a bag.

19
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,281
You, of all people,
should get that.

20
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:46,083
Long time

21
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,302
particularly
for Bratva captain.

22
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,920
Mr. Queen.

23
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:51,589
Anatoly Knyazev,

24
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,557
he speaks
very highly of you.

25
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,476
He should.
I saved his life.

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,976
You were supposed
to sign this report

27
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,343
at last night's board meeting.
You know why you didn't?

28
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:17,178
Probably because I didn't
attend last night's board meeting.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,763
Where were you?

30
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:19,981
I have other interests
outside of this company.

31
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,133
I don't.
Mr. Queen--

32
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,268
I thought you were serious

33
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,003
when you said
we were partners.

34
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,755
Isabel, I missed
one meeting.

35
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:28,273
This week.

36
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:29,475
Last week, it was
two meetings.

37
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,642
Mr. Queen.

38
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:33,528
Companywide revenue
is at double digits

39
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,512
since you and I
took over.

40
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,730
Oliver!
Yes?

41
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,984
I'm sorry
to interrupt your...

42
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:39,985
Grr!

43
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:41,519
Um, I need to talk to you

44
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,289
about your plans
for this evening.

45
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,824
With Mr. Harper?

46
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,795
You'll have
to excuse me.

47
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,163
We have work to do.

48
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,131
It's important.

49
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:56,001
So are
my evening plans.

50
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,003
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,555
We are going to have
to work on your excuses.

52
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,140
You're right.

53
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,191
You should be
more careful.

54
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,177
You're
completely exposed.

55
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:25,996
I knew you were there.

56
00:02:25,998 --> 00:02:27,498
What, you wanted me
to tell you

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,333
when the funny money guys
were ready to make a sale?

58
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,868
Here we go.

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,170
Not "we." Go home.

60
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,872
I already have help.

61
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,209
Here's the fake.

62
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,598
Let's see the real.

63
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,106
You got two
right above you.

64
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,962
Another at your six.

65
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,838
Stay where you are,
don't move!

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,141
I want to make a citizen's arrest.
Don't move.

67
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:32,129
That's it. I'm clear.

68
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:36,817
Aah!

69
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,687
Task force X to Mockingbird.

70
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,939
We have the prize,
we're coming home.

71
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:45,964

73
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,596
Who are you people?

74
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,164
NSA? CIA?

75
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,851
My name
is Amanda Waller.

76
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,655
I thought you A.R.G.U.S. guys
were supposed to be more subtle.

77
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,607
For us,
this was subtle.

78
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,726
Then I want to see Lyla Michaels.
So do I.

79
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,294
Agent Michaels
has gone dark.

80
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,446
Lyla's missing?

81
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,348
What happened?

82
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,567
She was running down
a lead in Moscow.

83
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,352
She's missed two
of her scheduled call-ins.

84
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,487
Well, what are you
doing about it?

85
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:32,022
Speaking to you.

86
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:34,408
Even if we knew
where in Russia Lyla is,

87
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,593
my superiors believe sending in
an extraction team

88
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:38,529
could cause
an international incident.

89
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,847
As far
as they're concerned,

90
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,048
she's already
a framed picture

91
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,500
on our lobby wall.

92
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,004
Why are you
telling me all this?

93
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:53,644
Because I know how you and
Oliver Queen spend your nights.

94
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:57,514
And I know
your passport is up to date.

95
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:00,024
It would help to start
with what Lyla

96
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,521
was doing in Moscow
in the first place.

97
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:03,858
What was this lead
she was tracking down?

98
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:07,141
A line on the whereabouts
of Floyd Lawton.

99
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:09,893
Deadshot.

100
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:13,864
Lyla
was in Russia for me,

101
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:17,734
Agent Michaels is an asset
I can't easily replace.

102
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:22,506
I know you find her
similarly irreplaceable.

103
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,008
Bring her home,
Mr. Diggle.

104
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:38,138
Thanks.

105
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,140
It's been a while
since I arrested you.

106
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,059
I'd forgotten
how good it feels.

107
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:46,096
I was working
for...him.

108
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,865
Him who?

109
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,900
The guy who cost you
your shield.

110
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:54,655
I'm on his team.
You are, too.

111
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:57,407
Anybody else
having serious deja vu?

112
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:02,646
That's all right,
we're letting him go.

113
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:05,883
Our mistake.

114
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:13,006
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

115
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:15,843
Ok, uh, let's just
get out of here

116
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:18,962
before anyone
changes their mind.

117
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,286
The potentially
catastrophic risk

118
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,971
of turning on this machine

119
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:30,473
far outweigh any scientific gain
that might come from it.

120
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,809
The people need to understand
just how dangerous

121
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,745
technology like this is.

122
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:38,665
And the very real possibility
of a cataclysmic event.

123
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,487
Where'd you go?
Is everything ok?

124
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:48,041
Yeah. Just need
a few personal days.

125
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:50,661
What's going on?
Have to help a friend.

126
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:53,180
Who?

127
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:54,831
Lyla Michaels.

128
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,950
It's his spy girlfriend
that works for A.R.G.U.S.

129
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:59,770
She went to Russia
looking for Deadshot,

130
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:02,956
for me. Now she's missing.

131
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,625
Felicity...

132
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:07,594
I think it's time we visited our
Queen Consolidated

133
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,697
subsidiary in Moscow.
Yeah.

134
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,783
Oliver, what are you doing?

135
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,117
Just need
to help a friend.

136
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,369
I can't ask you to do that.

137
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:17,321
You didn't.

138
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,335
Sara...

139
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,904
My name's Ivo.

140
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,807
What's your name?

141
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,559
Tommy.

142
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,929
So.

143
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,014
How did you come
to be on this island, Tommy?

144
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,400
I assume it wasn't
by choice.

145
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:50,153
My, uh...

146
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:53,040
Boat was shipwrecked here.

147
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,993
And I was the only survivor.

148
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,662
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

149
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:02,099
Did you explore
the island much?

150
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,034
Some of it.

151
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:06,119
Why?

152
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,405
You didn't happen
to run across

153
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:12,209
a Japanese Imperial Navy
submarine, did you?

154
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,880
During World War II,

155
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:20,634
every country was trying to develop
the ultimate weapon.

156
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,270
The United States had the
Manhattan Project, of course;

157
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,522
the Nazis had das Uranverein.

158
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:28,091
And the Japanese, well,

159
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,560
they had Mirakuru.

160
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:32,079
Stem cell
and genetic therapies,

161
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:34,764
decades ahead
of their time.

162
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,400
Every war

163
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:39,152
advances the cause
of science.

164
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:42,906
And the Japanese,
they had developed a serum

165
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,208
that caused
increased strength.

166
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,661
Rapid cell regeneration.

167
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:50,613
They called it Mirakuru.
"Miracle."

168
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:56,219
Thought they could
create an army of super soldiers.

169
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,588
They were transporting
their only supply

170
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,590
via submarine

171
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:05,228
when that sub came under
heavy fire by the allied forces.

172
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,265
And it ran aground in
this chain of islands.

173
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:11,301
Thanks to you...

174
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:15,305
We now know
it's this island.

175
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:21,912
You killed my friends.

176
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,898
Which means
it's up to you...

177
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,851
To help us
find that sub.

178
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:52,442
Are you forgetting
something?

179
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,318
Where do you think you're going?

180
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,036
Tahiti.

181
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,988
That's funny.

182
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,290
The flight manifest
says you're going to Moscow.

183
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,292
Well, we're going
to stop by there,

184
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:11,027
you know, after Tahiti.

185
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,246
What kind of partner
decides to interact

186
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,465
with our overseas holdings behind
the other one's back?

187
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,217
It was an oversight.

188
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,952
Oh.

189
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,703
Well, lucky
for our partnership,

190
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,973
I'm a fast packer.

191
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:27,644
Oliver, her tagging along
does not help matters any.

192
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,230
I will take care of her. John.

193
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:33,383
We're going to bring Lyla back.

194
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:36,403
Wherever she is.

195
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,020
I've arranged a meeting
with the chief operating officer

196
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,940
of our Moscow subsidiary
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

197
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:04,025
Try your hardest
not to miss this one.

198
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,027
You know, I'm not this person
that you seem to think I am.

199
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,946
That depends.
On what?

200
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,647
On if I think you use
the corporate jet

201
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,449
for a weekend of fun
with your assistant.

202
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,168
Excuse me?

203
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,120
A blonde I.T. girl
all of a sudden  gets promoted

204
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,921
to be assistant
to the C.E.O.?

205
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:19,457
There are only two ways that happens.
One is nepotism,

206
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,875
and she doesn't look
like your cousin.

207
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:23,795
That...is...
absolutely not happening.

208
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,030
What were her
qualifications?

209
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,382
Aside from an abundance
of short skirts.

210
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:30,335
Her skirts aren't
that...short.

211
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,805
What was that about?
Nothing.

212
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,106
Everything
with Knyazev is set.

213
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,507
You have friends
in the Russian mafia?

214
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,109
Color me at not
at all surprised.

215
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,811
You're going straight
to the hotel in a cab.

216
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,012
No, you're leaving me
with her?!

217
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,815
Dig and I need
to get a drink.

218
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:47,152
Well...I...wouldn't
mind a drink.

219
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:52,824
Ms. Loring.
Didn't take you

220
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,409
for the club-hopping type.

221
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,378
Well, I'm here
on business.

222
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,746
Is everything ok with my mom?

223
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,998
We need to discuss
something about this case.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
Your boyfriend Roy
was arrested last night.

225
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,135
I know, but it was actually
a misunderstanding.

226
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,503
He got released.

227
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,439
Well, a few reporters
got hold of the story

228
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,008
and they now know you're
dating a known felon.

229
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,427
Thea, your mother is on
trial for her life.

230
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,562
Her whole defense pivots
on being seen as a loving mother

231
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,848
who did what she had to do
to protect her children,

232
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,017
what kind of parent
she was.

233
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,155
We need the people
to know that she raised you

234
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,855
to make good decisions.

235
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,323
So if you care
about your mom,

236
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,910
you're going to have to end
this relationship immediately.

237
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:44,926
Oliver Queen? Ha!

238
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:48,096
My favorite American!

239
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,549
Dabro pazhalavat.

240
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:52,851
It has been too long.

241
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,586
John Diggle, this is
Anatoly Knyazev.

242
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,188
Thank you for meeting us.

243
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,891
If Oliver vouches for you,

244
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:03,111
you're my second favorite
American.

245
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:06,781
First, a toast.

246
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,735
None for me, thanks.

247
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,042
Prochnost.

248
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,444
To strength.

249
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:25,884
Now. Business.

250
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,470
This is woman
you look for, yes?

251
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:31,622
Picture is from two days ago,
from gulag--

252
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:34,058
prison.
Lyla was arrested?

253
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,912
Not quite. From what I hear,
she was trying to break in.

254
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:41,015
Why?
I do not know.

255
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,818
But clearly she had issues
breaking back out.

256
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,272
Gulag, worst in Russia.

257
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:49,941
It's called Koshmar.

258
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,409
The nightmare.

259
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,145
It's full
of violent psychopaths

260
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,997
and killers.

261
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,565
And that's just the guards.

262
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,535
Anatoly, we need a way
into the gulag to extract her.

263
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,488
You get in, you get shot
before you get out.

264
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Or end up like your friend.

265
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:07,392
Mmm, it's impossible.

266
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:08,843
The only thing
that's impossible

267
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,161
is us leaving this country
without this woman.

268
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,499
I like this guy.

269
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,937
We have no word
for "optimist" in Russian.

270
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,607
The only way in to Koshmar

271
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,842
is as prisoner.

272
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,529
Now, I have guard there,
owes me favor.

273
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:31,349
It could work.
I'll give you one shot in twenty.

274
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,451
Set it up. I'll go.
No.

275
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,936
It has to be me.

276
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,155
No.

277
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:39,157
Oliver, what if something
happens to you in there?

278
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,260
What happens to me,
Felicity, or Isabel, for that matter?

279
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:45,530
You have to be on the outside
making the moves.

280
00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:47,632
I'll go inside.

281
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,667
I've got this.

282
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,882
Now that is a lot of drugs.

283
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,718
Courtesy of Knyazev.

284
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,521
About enough weight to
land me in the Koshmar.

285
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,892
You need to be wearing this
when they process you.

286
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:19,030
Guards will take it,
but that's the point.

287
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:20,731
This...

288
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,418
Is Knyazev's man
inside the prison.

289
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,286
A guard.

290
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:28,039
He'll know where in the gulag
Lyla is being held.

291
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,091
When all hell
breaks loose,

292
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,961
you need to meet us at the
rendezvous point with Lyla, or...

293
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,346
Or I am
a permanent Russian.

294
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,434
Just thinking out loud...

295
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:42,971
But, are we sure this is the best plan
we can come up with?

296
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,639
I know Lyla's
your friend, but...

297
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:48,359
Felicity, Lyla
isn't my friend.

298
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,094
She was my wife.

299
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,896
Explain that sentence.

300
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:55,216
Lyla and I met in the army back
in Afghanistan.

301
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:59,103
But we didn't stay married long
once we got stateside.

302
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,043
Couldn't figure out a way to
stay married without a war to fight.

303
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:08,379
So she joined
A.R.G.U.S.,

304
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:12,200
and I circled back
for my third tour.

305
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:15,670
I can't leave here
without her, Felicity.

306
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,756
Just can't.

307
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,728
Two minute warning.

308
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:33,804
Good luck, John.

309
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,345
They have him.

310
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:21,853
Clock's running.

311
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,398
Zhivey, zhivey.

312
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,601
Hurry up.

313
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,616
Khoroshaya kurtka.

314
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:27,846
What, uh, crime
fits your punishment?

315
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,116
Drugs. And you?

316
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:33,686
I gave speech.
About government corruption.

317
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,122
Right.

318
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:40,493
It is rare to see one
of your people in Koshmar.

319
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,861
What, American?
Chernokozhiy.

320
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,480
Ehh...

321
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,650
Chernokozhiy
not popular here.

322
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:50,670
Shocker.

323
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,429
You think Dig's ok?

324
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,715
I think he's doing
the same as he was

325
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,717
when you asked me
five minutes ago.

326
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,385
They're coming.

327
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,522
They sell us Russian
police truck for cheap.

328
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,856
Vot mashina,
kotoraya vam nuzhna.

329
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:30,710
Sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.

330
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,431
Na koleni.

331
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,393
Yesli vy sde syete eto,

332
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,595
moi lyudi vas,

333
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:54,533
I vashi deti
osanutsya sirotami.

334
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:07,246
What'd you say?

335
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,751
Please.

336
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:19,325
You know, in Russia,
there is gulag.

337
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,944
Almost as bad as this.

338
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:32,521
Sara--
Don't say my name.

339
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,741
If they find out we know each other,
they'll kill us both.

340
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,315
I thought you drowned.

341
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:46,485
When I came up,
the boat was gone.

342
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,220
And I thought you were, too.

343
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:52,274
And I was floating out there
for days when this ship...

344
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:56,212
They found me.
And they saved me.

345
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,330
Is that why
you're helping them?

346
00:20:58,332 --> 00:21:00,883
I don't have a choice.

347
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,703
I need to warn
my friends.

348
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,604
You said they were dead.

349
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:08,474
They're not
that easy to kill.

350
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,536
Try not to move.

351
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:25,491
It smells like puke!

352
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,127
It'll heal your wounds.

353
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:30,629
You have to go.

354
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,531
Get out of here.

355
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,834
Get to higher ground.

356
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,368
I'm not leaving you.

357
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,805
I will not
be the reason

358
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,974
something
happens to you.

359
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:43,976
Then we're in agreement.

360
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:46,245
Because I make
my own choices.

361
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:49,982
You are a strong woman.

362
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:53,352
When I care about someone,
there's nothing I won't do for them.

363
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,856
Another thing...

364
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,492
we have in common.

365
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:07,666
The burns, they're lowering
your body temperature.

366
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:10,920
Here.

367
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:17,209
Where you been all night?

368
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,211
Working.
Oh.

369
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:23,248
Well,
you deserve a break.

370
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,719
Um, actually,
I've been thinking.

371
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,087
Maybe we should
take some space.

372
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:32,090
I mean, we work together
and live together.

373
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:34,560
It's kind of getting hard
to breathe.

374
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,946
Since when?

375
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,431
Oh, wait, does this have to with
that lawyer lady dropping by?

376
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,066
No, this has
to do with the fact

377
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,868
that you've been
arrested twice in the last month.

378
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,137
Come on. I've been
trying to stay out of trouble.

379
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:47,323
My body hasn't
had a scratch on it in weeks.

380
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,942
Well, I mean, excluding the ones
that you put there.

381
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:51,944
And the other night?

382
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:54,063
Was a misunderstanding.

383
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,966
Roy...

384
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:00,586
This just isn't working, ok?

385
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,955
Not for me.

386
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:05,257
Thea,
you can't mean that.

387
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,092
I do.

388
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,245
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,128
Those men...

390
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,132
They are Vory.
They are in charge.

391
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,802
It's best
to stay away.

392
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,187
Got it.

393
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:56,174
Listen, I'm looking for a
guard named Sergei Pavelski.

394
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:08,621
American...
You are suka now.

395
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,542
Are we seriously
going to do this?

396
00:24:13,544 --> 00:24:15,127
Guess so.

397
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:29,808
Fighting strictly prohibited.

398
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,552
Vodki, pozhaluysta.

399
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:43,322
You missed the tour.

400
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,107
What happened
to you?

401
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,911
I saw a Russian vehicle
that I simply had to have.

402
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:51,330
Is that why you came to Russia?
Car shopping?

403
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:54,566
Oh, I just ordered one.

404
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:58,837
One's for me.

405
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:04,226
This cold room.

406
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,553
Six hours for you.

407
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,889
Six hours? You can't
keep me in here that long.

408
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,875
Now seven hours.

409
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:26,565
Well, that was
pretty stupid...

410
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,287
Then again,
you never really were

411
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,056
one of the brightest guys.

412
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:36,875
Deadshot.

413
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,220
Your spine
frozen through yet?

414
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:47,770
Trust me.

415
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,991
My problem here
isn't with the cold.

416
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:54,011
What, you still haven't forgiven
me for shooting your brother?

417
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,963
Man, you really
hold a grudge.

418
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:00,234
I know why you're here.

419
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:04,105
That girl.
From A.R.G.U.S.

420
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,907
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.

421
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,444
She found you.

422
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:13,347
Does everyone
really think

423
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:15,149
that Felicity and I are...
No.

424
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:17,151
Just everyone who works
at Queen Consolidated.

425
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,288
She's just a friend.

426
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,958
You don't seem like the kind of man
who has female friends.

427
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,626
Can I ask you
a personal question?

428
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:28,662
With some vodka in me,
I just might answer.

429
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:32,499
Why does saving
my family's company

430
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,368
mean so much to you?

431
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:38,973
Despite what Sheryl Sandberg
might say...

432
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,095
It still isn't that easy to make it
as a woman in business.

433
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:47,298
I've...given up a lot.

434
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,983
Which means if I don't
succeed at everything,

435
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:51,285
then what was the point?

436
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:52,953
Hmm.

437
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:55,522
May I ask you
a personal question?

438
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:57,708
Others have tried
and failed.

439
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,394
Why do you try so hard to make me
think that you're a lazy idiot?

440
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:02,413
I know you're not.

441
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:06,133
Underneath that swagger,
I see you pretty clearly.

442
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:08,252
Really?

443
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,337
And what do you see?

444
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,523
You're intelligent.

445
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:15,893
Driven.

446
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:18,479
And lonely.

447
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:21,482
How do you see that?

448
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:25,219
Because it's what I see
when I look in the mirror.

449
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:37,364
We don't have much time.

450
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,567
There you go.

451
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:42,402
Let's go, let's go.

452
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:46,090
Nice seeing you,
John.

453
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,214
You speak Russian.

454
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,518
I was raised in Moscow
until I was nine.

455
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,554
And then adopted by a family
that took me to America.

456
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,140
Took me years
to get rid of my accent.

457
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:04,619
It isn't easy making friends

458
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,907
in grade school when
you sound like Natasha.

459
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:25,379
I...Don't have
a lot of time.

460
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:27,781
I'll be quick.

461
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:29,800
Five minutes.
Must hurry.

462
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:31,919
Remind me to get you a pack
of cigarettes when this is all over.

463
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,922
I don't smoke.

464
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:45,399
You weren't going
to leave without me, were you?

465
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,984
I should kill you
right now!

466
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,403
You won't.

467
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:51,605
Why?
Because.

468
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,808
I'm the only one who knows
where your little girlfriend is.

469
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,411
You're not stupid.

470
00:28:57,413 --> 00:29:00,981
You wouldn't put yourself
in here without an exit strategy.

471
00:29:00,983 --> 00:29:02,666
I take you to the girl...

472
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:05,920
You take me out.

473
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,092
Isabel,
I have to go.

474
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:14,295
Sorry.

475
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:17,181
Do I strike you as someone
who needs to cuddle?

476
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,470
Hi.

477
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,504
Hi.

478
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,106
It's time. Ready?

479
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,525
Yeah, I--

480
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:31,178
I think she can take
the night off. Don't you?

481
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,732
Ohh.
Felicity...

482
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:39,620
It--what happens in Russia
stays in Russia.

483
00:29:39,622 --> 00:29:43,023
Even when it makes
no sense whatsoever.

484
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,708
Guessin', uh, you want
to hold on to that.

485
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,894
This way.

486
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,398
What
were you thinking?

487
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,816
What?

488
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:10,284
Over 64 million women
over the age of consent

489
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:13,270
in Russia
and you sleep with her.

490
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,891
So we're not doing
the "What happens in Russia

491
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:20,194
stays in Russia?"
We're still in Russia.

492
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:27,201
There is nothing money cannot buy
in this country.

493
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:30,004
Diggle should be heading out
Lyla in two minutes.

494
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:33,073
Well, breaking out
of prison is harder than it looks.

495
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,676
You of all people
should know that.

496
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:55,279
Stay quiet.

497
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,731
Follow me.

498
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,737
You'll remember
the rest of us...

499
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,773
Yes?

500
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:08,475
I promise.

501
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:11,378
I'll come back.

502
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,416
Come on.

503
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,640
Are we making a swim for it?

504
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:27,061
No. They'd shoot us
the second we hit the water.

505
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:30,064
You said your friends,
they have one

506
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,066
of the radios
from the ship, right?

507
00:31:32,068 --> 00:31:34,268
Yeah.

508
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,154
You look like you know
what you're doing there.

509
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:39,556
In the past year, I've learned a lot of
things I never expected to.

510
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:41,325
You and me both.

511
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:48,082
They won't respond
unless they hear your voice.

512
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,926
Shado.

513
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:01,595
Ni néng tingdào wo ma?

514
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,668
Slade.

515
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,803
Can you hear me?

516
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:14,841
Thank God you're alive.

517
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:17,695
Yeah, I'm on the freighter--

518
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:20,280
Sara, what are you doing?

519
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:22,116
There's only
two of them.

520
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:25,869
They haven't moved
from the location of the mortar attack.

521
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:27,538
What the hell is going on here?

522
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,023
You just confirmed
that your friends are alive.

523
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:32,526
Which means
they're still a threat.

524
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:34,461
You know, until
we kill them.

525
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:37,998
You son of a bitch--oh!

526
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,862
If I say she's in there,

527
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:54,379
what's keeping you
from shooting me?

528
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,700
Honor.

529
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:01,770
You should
try it some time.

530
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:07,609
Lyla!

531
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:11,296
Johnny?

532
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:12,748
Ready to go home?

533
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,250
You came for me.

534
00:33:15,252 --> 00:33:18,303
I always have. Always will.

535
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:19,638
Deadshot's here.

536
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,807
In the prison.

537
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:24,226
I know.

538
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:26,678
What's your extraction plan?

539
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,314
Depends.
What time is it?

540
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,246
Let's go, go, go,
move, move, move!

541
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,345
This way.

542
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,932
Got it.

543
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,468
I shut down the phones.
The guards can't call for help.

544
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,104
Your friend and that woman
are not here by now,

545
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,772
they will not
be here at all.

546
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,314
Much better.

547
00:34:34,497 --> 00:34:36,548
Oliver, get down!

548
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:43,204
Follow me! Move!

549
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:03,525
We're clear.

550
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,813
Stop the truck.

551
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,364
Get out.

552
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:12,167
Get out!

553
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:17,673
Move.

554
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,728
That's the thing
about honor, John.

555
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,447
You can't
turn it on and off.

556
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:48,537
I'm just curious.

557
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:51,740
How is it you think your brother
ended up dead?

558
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:55,276
You shot a client
that Andy was protecting,

559
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,895
and you missed.

560
00:35:56,897 --> 00:36:01,049
I don't miss.

561
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:03,251
Your brother
was the contract.

562
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:05,921
Who would want to kill Andy?

563
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:09,474
I don't know the names,
just an alias.

564
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,728
Hive.

565
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:17,632
Food for thought, John.

566
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,318
Food for thought.

567
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:56,337
Are we going to discuss what
happened last night?

568
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,672
Why would we?

569
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,174
No reason.

570
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,510
I'll see you
in the office tomorrow.

571
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:18,476
Thank you.

572
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,644
You had my back.

573
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:23,814
And now you know
what it feels like.

574
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:33,874
Wh--what are you--
what are you doing here?

575
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,759
Good question.

576
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:37,945
I've gotten a lot of calls
from prison,

577
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:39,413
but never from my
girlfriend's mother.

578
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:41,465
It occurred to me
that I've never been given

579
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,201
the opportunity
to meet the man in your life.

580
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:46,253
I don't know
if she told you,

581
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:48,005
but your daughter
kind of dumped me.

582
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:50,424
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

583
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:53,511
Jean told me
she came to see you.

584
00:37:53,513 --> 00:37:55,262
I told her
she shouldn't have.

585
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,982
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

586
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,467
Us being together...

587
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,570
It can hurt her case.

588
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,655
Thea...

589
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,578
Your social life is not

590
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:08,127
going to be the determining
factor in my trial.

591
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,829
Sweetheart, what you've
had to endure this last year

592
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,399
is more than most people
go through in two lifetimes.

593
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:18,569
But you've not only survived,
you've flourished.

594
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:20,737
I think a lot of that
has to do with Roy.

595
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:25,509
So, as your mother,
I forbid you not to see him.

596
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,712
Thank you.

597
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:35,519
I have to admit,

598
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,556
this is not how I anticipated
my trip to Russia ending.

599
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:42,092
I just feel lucky
we made it out of there alive.

600
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,761
Thank you.

601
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,814
Not just for coming for me.

602
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:49,516
For doing what
you had to once you did.

603
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:52,403
You mean working
with Deadshot.

604
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,908
You know, me and Carly
broke up because I couldn't love her

605
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,444
and hate him
at the same time.

606
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:03,547
I'm honored
to be the exception.

607
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,034
Lyla, you're always
the exception.

608

00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:19,129

611
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,465
No, no,

612
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:24,852

617
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,110
Why her?

618
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,846
I mean, besides the...

619
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,682
obvious leggy model reason.

620
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,984
It just
kind of happened.

621
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:16,820
It didn't mean
anything.

622
00:40:16,822 --> 00:40:19,540
Hey.

623
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,245
Because of the life
that I lead...

624
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:30,250
I just think that
it's better to not...

625
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:33,870
Be with someone
that I could really care about.

626
00:40:45,883 --> 00:40:48,485
Well, I think...

627
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:56,243
I think you deserve
better than her.

628
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,669
We have their location.

629
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,621
This one's no longer
of use to us.

630
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:09,873
Let's see
how good you are...

631
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,710
At removing a bullet
from your head.

632
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:15,078
Wait!

633
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,699
He could
still be useful.

634
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:21,835
She's right.

635
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:24,154
Once we get rid
of his friends,

636
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,890
we'll need him to lead
us to the graves.

637
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:32,563
Sometimes I wonder
who gives the orders here.

638
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:34,281
You...

639
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,533
or your little bouzin.

640
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:53,467
You're going back
to the island.

641
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,703
