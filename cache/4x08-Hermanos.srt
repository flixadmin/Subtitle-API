1
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,152
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

2
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,275
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

3
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,198
Everything is going to be okay.

4
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,913
Are you crazy?

5
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,391
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

6
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,671
What, you gonna tell?

7
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,794
And you?

8
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,236
They ain't gonna say nothing.

9
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,596
They like what they see.

10
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,755
You're not going to offer
our guests anything?

11
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,230
Who says they're guests?

12
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,030
If the boss wants them to drink...

13
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,552
...they drink.

14
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,553
So... the Chicken Brothers.

15
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,072
I like your restaurant.

16
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,999
Dark meat and white meat?

17
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,630
Don't look like no brothers to me.

18
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,155
At last!

19
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,873
The master chefs!

20
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,559
You two...

21
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,435
That chicken you cook...

22
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,157
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest
chicken in all of Mexico.

23
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,795
Thank you, Don Eladio.

24
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,469
It's a great honour.

25
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,835
Max is the chef.

26
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,632
The compliments are all his.

27
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,269
Gustavo is too modest.

28
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,317
There'd be no restaurant without him.

29
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,633
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

30
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,953
Your chicken, it's so... zesty.

31
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,199
Piquant.

32
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,233
But it does not taste
like a Mexican style.

33
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,437
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

34
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,313
...which I've modified a bit
for the Mexican palate.

35
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,037
I bet we like a little more chilli
than you Chileans.

36
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,838
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

37
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,877
So... if your partner is the chef...

38
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,279
...then who are you?

39
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,678
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

40
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,116
I handle the business operations.

41
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,914
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

42
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,589
Good, good.

43
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,792
But tell me something.

44
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,515
That chicken, so fabulous...

45
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,351
...so excellent...

46
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,069
Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

47
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,479
We have several side dishes.

48
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,672
Rice. Beans.

49
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,350
Sometimes we prepare
a carnitas entrée...

50
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,240
...if we come across fresh beef
in the market.

51
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,475
Anything else?

52
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,033
Come on, be honest.

53
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,799
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

54
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,639
Something on the side?

55
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,433
Because when I send my men
to your restaurant...

56
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,552
...they come back
with more than just chicken.

57
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,236
They come back with drugs.

58
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,194
You are selling them narcotics.

59
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,074
Methamphetamine.

60
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,191
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

61
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,833
I didn't sell it to them.

62
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,758
I gave them samples.

63
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,073
Samples.

64
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,309
Some businessman.

65
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,912
I gave them samples to give to you.

66
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,992
To introduce you to our product.

67
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,236
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offence.

68
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
But he... that is to say we...

69
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,473
...could think of no other way
to get your attention.

70
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,596
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

71
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,156
I know all about methamphetamine.

72
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,677
That's poor man's cocaine.

73
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,274
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

74
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,153
There's no money in it.

75
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,953
May I, Don Eladio...

76
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,271
I am a biochemist by training.

77
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,909
The methamphetamine we make
is much superior...

78
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,272
...to the so-called biker crank
you know of.

79
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,153
It is crystallised, like glass.

80
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,675
Purer.

81
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,916
And the chirality of the molecule...

82
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,350
...its very structure, is different.

83
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,391
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

84
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,592
This product is the drug of the future.

85
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,432
It'll triple your profits.

86
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,629
Perhaps quadruple.

87
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,357
They're not only good cooks...

88
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,437
...they're great at shovelling manure.

89
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,390
Right now, you deal almost exclusively
with cocaine.

90
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,591
But the coca plant can't grow
in Mexico.

91
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,709
You are no more than middlemen...

92
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,797
...for the Colombians.

93
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,353
They cut you a percentage for
smuggling across the border.

94
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,230
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

95
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,029
...despite your assumption
of all the risk.

96
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,677
This new crystal methamphetamine...

97
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,556
It's stronger,
more addictive than cocaine...

98
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,998
...which means
it will move in higher volume.

99
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,033
But most importantly,
it's completely artificial.

100
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,431
We can show you
how to manufacture it...

101
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,709
...right here in Mexico.

102
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,000
And you keep all the profits.

103
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,518
My men do like your product.

104
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,872
Hector, what is wrong with you?

105
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,356
Why did you not get glasses
for our guests?

106
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,317
Go on.

107
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,238
You are quite the talent.

108
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,073
I bet you learned cooking
from your mama. Isn't that true?

109
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,836
But... what about the chemistry?

110
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,994
I studied at the University of Santiago.

111
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,310
Gustavo paid for my education.

112
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,509
Oh, really?

113
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,155
I have degrees in both biochemistry
and chemical engineering.

114
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,715
With minimal capital investment...

115
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,235
...we can set up
a factory-grade laboratory for you.

116
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,512
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

117
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,472
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

118
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,835
Fantastic!

119
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,988
Tell me one thing, though.

120
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,556
If you're the cook...

121
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,796
Why do I need him?

122
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,949
You.

123
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,516
Why should I negotiate with someone
who doesn't respect me?

124
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,871
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

125
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,758
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

126
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,197
...in front of my own men?

127
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,475
What do I need you for?

128
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,038
Don Eladio. Please.

129
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,798
I didn't sell anything.

130
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,071
I apologise if you are offended...

131
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,317
...by my method
of obtaining this meeting.

132
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,752
I merely took the initiative.

133
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,548
I meant no insult.

134
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,831
Don Eladio,
Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

135
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,639
I know Gustavo like a brother.

136
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,068
He's an honourable man.

137
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,874
The most loyal man I have ever known.

138
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,231
He rescued me
from the Santiago slums.

139
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,953
He made me the man I am today!

140
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,790
Gustavo is a genius.
He will make you millions!

141
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,357
Just find it in your heart to forgive him
this one small mistake.

142
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,155
Please...

143
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,835
He's my partner.

144
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,674
I need him! I swear to God!

145
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,635
Look at him.

146
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,273
You did this to him.

147
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,157
Now, look at him.

148
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,839
Listen to me.

149
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,911
The only reason you are alive
and he is not...

150
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,237
...is because I know who you are.

151
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,035
But understand...

152
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,597
You are not in Chile anymore.

153
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,634
My advice...

154
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,797
Stick to chicken.
