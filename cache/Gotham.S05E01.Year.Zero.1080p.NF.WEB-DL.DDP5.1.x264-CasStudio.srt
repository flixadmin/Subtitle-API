1
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,568
Fire on my command.

2
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,115
For Gotham.

3
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,807
<i>Mr. Gordon, your people
decided to ignore evacuation orders.</i>

4
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,518
No, no, no.
It is clear you don't understand.

5
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>What's to understand, Mr. Gordon?</i>

6
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,439
<i>I'm afraid
you are not making yourself...</i>

7
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,565
For the last time.

8
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,859
After the bridges blew

9
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,777
and the government
declared Gotham off-limits,

10
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,280
the city was up for grabs.

11
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,450
Given over
to criminals and murderers.

12
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,163
Now, territory is controlled by
whoever has enough power to hold it.

13
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,250
We have Penguin in City Hall,
for God sakes.

14
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,088
<i>He raided the armory
and stockpiled weapons,</i>

15
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,925
<i>then re-purposed a factory
to manufacture ammunition.</i>

16
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,147
<i>It's made him unassailable.</i>

17
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,610
<i>Barbara and The Sirens
control an area around their club.</i>

18
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>It's the only place in Gotham
not suffering for food, or booze.</i>

19
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>Barbara trades mainly in information.</i>

20
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,078
Just be gone by midnight.

21
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>It's women only.
Men can buy windows of time.</i>

22
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,213
It's two minutes
past pumpkin time, sweetheart.

23
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:20,385
<i>Word is, she enforces her rule
with an iron hand.</i>

24
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,222
The west is Jonathan Crane,

25
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,516
the Scarecrow.

26
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,104
I won't do it again.

27
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,408
Victor Fries is further north
and warring with Firefly.

28
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,120
And to date, there have been
no confirmed sightings

29
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,538
of Jeremiah Valeska.

30
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,376
And then there's us.

31
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,131
GCPD controls a 10-block area
around the precinct,

32
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,050
<i>where we feed and protect
150 civilians.</i>

33
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>That number could grow,
as who knows how many others</i>

34
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,263
<i>are trapped around the city.</i>

35
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,599
<i>These are people who couldn't get out
when the city was abandoned.</i>

36
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,893
<i>The poor, the sick, whole families.</i>

37
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,645
<i>The government has a duty.</i>

38
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,857
You have a duty to help them.

39
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,568
- <i>Mr. Gordon.</i>
- Captain Gordon.

40
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,362
<i>We've been over this
time and time again.</i>

41
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>No one is allowed in
or out of Gotham.</i>

42
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,533
The people we are protecting
are not criminals.

43
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,036
<i>And anyone who stayed
after the evacuation order</i>

44
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,038
<i>is no longer the government's responsibility.</i>
We are surrounded by hostile forces.

45
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,167
We are running out
of food, ammunition.

46
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,544
There are children here.
You have to evacuate them.

47
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:40,465
<i>A committee is being formed
regarding the situation in Gotham.</i>

48
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
Committee?

49
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,220
At least let us re-supply ourselves.

50
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>We understand the situation.</i>

51
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,809
You don't understand. If you did,
you would do something.

52
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,977
Just say we're on our own.

53
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,538
Paralysis aside,
we need to operate

54
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,499
before her spine collapses on itself.

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,751
In truth,
she should have been evacuated.

56
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,129
Yeah, well, we tried to get her
out the night everything went to hell.

57
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,423
- And then they blew the bloody bridges.
- Can you operate here?

58
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,554
I don't think we have a choice.

59
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,729
Selina.

60
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,234
- The doctor wants to operate.
- Fine.

61
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,781
Whatever.

62
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,086
I'm going to be here the whole time.

63
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,805
Enough!

64
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,974
The cops are getting fat
while the rest of us are starving.

65
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,225
Damn right!

66
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,977
While the rest of us are starving!

67
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,186
You hungry, yeah?

68
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,024
Harvey, lay off, lay off. Everyone.

69
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,236
Sir, everyone gets the same share.

70
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,779
Police and civilians alike.

71
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,907
If we start handing out more,
the supplies will not last.

72
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,618
You're lying. He's lying!

73
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,162
The cops get more!

74
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,788
That's enough!

75
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,713
You don't like the rules, leave.

76
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,383
I'm just saying...

77
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,385
Say it walking, putz.

78
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,556
Come on! You look well-fed.

79
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,849
Let's go.

80
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,644
Hey, come on, that's enough.
Move it out of here.

81
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,235
So, how are we doing?

82
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,945
Well, we got a month of food left.

83
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,031
Less if refugees keep coming.

84
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,075
What did
the department of douchbag-ery say?

85
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,328
Same as always. Not sending any help.

86
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,580
Not letting anyone leave.
I had to try.

87
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,166
Swear to God,
I am never paying taxes again.

88
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,667
And if people ask?

89
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,546
Well, sooner or later, the government
will do the right thing.

90
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,216
Rebuild the bridges,
take back the city.

91
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,342
Just have to be patient.

92
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,968
And the truth?

93
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,261
We're on our own.

94
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,805
Truth is, we have no idea
what might happen.

95
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,808
And our job is to keep ourselves,

96
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,561
and everyone else, alive.

97
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,647
We're down
to our last rounds of ammo.

98
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,483
What if Penguin or someone else
decides to make a move?

99
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,984
We're sitting ducks here, man.

100
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,826
Okay. Where was I?

101
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,869
Happened again.

102
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,746
This time, woke up on a rooftop.

103
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,665
Same thing. No idea how I got there

104
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,919
or what happened
during the preceding hours.

105
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,928
Show yourself.

106
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,140
I know it's you inside there, Ed.

107
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,770
Show yourself.

108
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,234
Idiot Ed still won't appear.

109
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,862
Coward.

110
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,781
But I know it's him controlling me
when I'm sleeping.

111
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,495
Why?

112
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,123
What is he doing?

113
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,053
You know, you could get someone else
to turn on the spotlight.

114
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,265
I like doing it.

115
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,353
I guess it reminds people
that even in darkness there is light.

116
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,938
And it reminds me.

117
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,109
We're low on supplies.

118
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,946
Government won't evac,
won't send in help.

119
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,908
It doesn't make sense.

120
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,079
I imagine from where they sit,

121
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,997
it's pretty easy
to ignore people's suffering.

122
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,588
I gave Lucius permission to raid
the Wayne Enterprise's R&amp;D lab

123
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,756
for whatever he could scavenge.

124
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,385
He's working on night-vision goggles
for your men. It's not much.

125
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,594
Everything helps.

126
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,100
Bruce, we stayed because people here
still need protection.

127
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,267
That hasn't changed.

128
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,566
I should go.

129
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,529
The doctor is worried
Selina's condition is getting worse.

130
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,198
They're going to operate.

131
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,618
Let me know how it goes.

132
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,544
Are you sorry you stayed?

133
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,382
No. You?

134
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,178
Hell, no.

135
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,909
Mr. Cobblepot offers 1,000 rounds

136
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,745
of freshly-minted 9mm stock

137
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,748
for 1,000 pounds of grade-A steak.

138
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,958
Hmm.

139
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,585
So, what we're hearing is true.

140
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,212
Cupboard's a bit bare in Penguinland.

141
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,673
Absolutely not.

142
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,260
Mr. Cobblepot just had
a hankering for red meat.

143
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,221
Please! Ozzie wants to get fat
on rib-eye

144
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,723
while his minions starve.

145
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,641
- Shocker.
- I have a question.

146
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,228
Why hasn't your boss left his citadel
since the bridges blew?

147
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,148
He's scared I'm going to
stick him in the throat?

148
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,152
Tabby's still raw from when Penguin
murdered Butch right in front of her,

149
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,946
so it will have to be 2,000 rounds.

150
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,740
Barbara, we're not giving
that bastard anything.

151
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,783
Exactly.

152
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
We're trading for something we need.

153
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,120
No.

154
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,248
Honey,

155
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,418
no one is asking you
to forget what happened.

156
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,796
But how do we protect the women
who come in here every day

157
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,881
looking for safety?

158
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,799
We need this.

159
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,427
Penguin's time will come.

160
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,387
I promise.

161
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,486
He's going to regret giving me this.

162
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,700
Better make it 3,000 rounds.

163
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,669
Something's out there.

164
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,255
There.

165
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,714
See? The shadow moved.

166
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,884
It's just a shadow, man.

167
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,470
No. Something's out there.

168
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,435
There, see?

169
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,943
Hey, you okay?

170
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,612
You okay?

171
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,614
Don't you want me to make it stop?

172
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,200
Yes!

173
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,952
Open this door.

174
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,539
No, no, no! Don't open the gate!

175
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,007
Split up. Take what we came for.

176
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,802
Kill whoever stands in your way.

177
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,056
Show these fools the face of fear.

178
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,518
These here are the weak points.

179
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
Reinforce all barriers
that front Penguin's territory.

180
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,856
I want to be ready.

181
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,448
What the hell?

182
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,998
Find Lucius.

183
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,583
Tell him to meet me at the generator.

184
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,564
Lights are out everywhere.

185
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,316
Don't you worry, Master Bruce.

186
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,026
The clinic has got
its own backup generator.

187
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,033
You see? Everything's ship-shape
and Bristol fashion.

188
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,576
No.

189
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,954
Something's wrong.

190
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,247
Men in the basement.

191
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,041
They're stealing all the medicine.

192
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,752
Alfred, stay with Selina.

193
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,712
Of course,
but you can't go down there.

194
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,673
It's going to be pitch black.
Gonna need a torch or something.

195
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,591
Lucius gave me something better.

196
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,262
Careful.

197
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,215
I know
what you're thinking, Captain.

198
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,010
"I have so few bullets,

199
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,178
"do I spend one on him?

200
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,097
"Is it worth it?"

201
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,891
I already know it's not.

202
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,062
Now the question is,
why are you here?

203
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,605
It's not to steal the generator.

204
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,441
Why would I want light?

205
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,485
Fear lives in darkness.

206
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,697
So what then? Came for our supplies?

207
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,781
Exactly so.

208
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,784
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

209
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,633
It's been a while
since you tasted my toxin, Captain.

210
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,677
What are you scared of now?

211
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,554
Not you.

212
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,445
Hey! Hey!

213
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,827
They got the beans.

214
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,166
Go, the lights are back up.

215
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,375
Go, go, go.

216
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,132
Did you hear that?

217
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,776
Hello?

218
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,029
Scared?

219
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,864
Hey, guys?

220
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,075
Scared?

221
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,038
Look, guys, this isn't funny.

222
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,968
Go back!

223
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,606
First their government abandons them,

224
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,859
and then some freak
dressed like a scarecrow

225
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,319
steals their grub.
I'd be pissed, too.

226
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,488
So, where are we?

227
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,408
At current consumption,
we've got a week of food.

228
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,911
- Go to half rations.
- We're already at half rations.

229
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,705
Cut them again.

230
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,331
The people won't be happy.

231
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,000
I haven't been happy in 10 years.

232
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,501
At least they'll be alive.

233
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,795
All right, that buys us two weeks.
Then what?

234
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,840
Jim, at this point,
the bastards across the river

235
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,425
are going to have to
step up and help.

236
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,135
Why start now? They haven't before.

237
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,261
For the love of God!

238
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,472
Because we stayed
to do the job they wouldn't. Huh?

239
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
And now they're just going to
sit back and watch while we starve,

240
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,059
or tear ourselves apart,

241
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,144
because that's what's
going to happen.

242
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,395
I know, Harv,

243
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,689
but right now, we have to
tell these people something.

244
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,815
Tell them help is coming.

245
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
I'll fly in supplies.

246
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,988
We tried that.

247
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,865
We couldn't even get permission
to take off.

248
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,742
Zero tolerance. Nothing in or out.

249
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,118
Well, I'm not asking for permission.

250
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,287
It's ready.

251
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,122
Alfred has already radioed
to have it delivered

252
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,290
from our East Bay hangar.

253
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,417
We can have a supply truck here
within hours.

254
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,505
Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

255
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,008
Even if it succeeds,
the government's going to find out.

256
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,426
It's a one-time solution.

257
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,553
Scarecrow's men
didn't just take food.

258
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,641
They stole medicine from the clinic.

259
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,811
There are people in pain.

260
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,903
Harvey, tell the people
help is on the way.

261
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,279
You got it.

262
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,493
How's Selina?

263
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,331
She's strong. She'll pull through.

264
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,224
Doc says the surgery was a success.

265
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,103
My spine
is not going to turn to jelly.

266
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,856
I'll still
never be able to walk again,

267
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,942
so, that's a bummer.

268
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,488
There's limited resources here.

269
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,950
But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

270
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,494
Gee...

271
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,330
For a second there, I was worried.

272
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,959
Selina, I know you're in pain.

273
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,546
Some medicine is on its way.

274
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,257
You know what's funny?

275
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,887
Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

276
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,436
After all the things I've done,

277
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,566
what did me in was being your friend.

278
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,824
I just wish Jeremiah had killed me.

279
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,178
Doctors can't help her.

280
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,142
She needs the witch.

281
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,277
How's the mood?

282
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,653
They're hanging in there.

283
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,573
They love their Jim Gordon.

284
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,076
But if that chopper doesn't come,

285
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,827
it'll be bad.

286
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,501
It'll come.

287
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,848
Feels good.

288
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,851
Missing something, no?

289
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,647
Put a knife on it.

290
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,196
Another shutdown at the factory.

291
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,741
A worker fell into a hydraulic press.

292
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,410
It appears he passed out from hunger.

293
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,831
Sir, I worry, if we don't increase
the food allowance...

294
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,543
Mr. Penn, I feel
for all of our workers.

295
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,712
But I cannot give what I do not have.

296
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,929
Overcooked!

297
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,268
Edward.

298
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,859
Such a good boy!

299
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,780
Quality at the factory
is also suffering.

300
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,449
- More misfires.
- Nonsense!

301
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,911
Our rounds are fine.

302
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,247
And now you've upset Edward.

303
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,498
Ow!

304
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,210
As you see, more misfires.

305
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,462
Sir, if we don't
give better quality...

306
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,882
- Stop.
- Sir?

307
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,510
- Sir?
- Shut up!

308
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,928
Shut up.

309
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,014
Do you hear that?

310
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,644
You said yourself, Penguin has
locked himself in City Hall

311
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,854
with a small army.

312
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,064
- I know that.
- And I know you miss Butch.

313
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,400
Do you? Because he only did it
to hurt me.

314
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,445
That's why I have to make it right.

315
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,864
And how are you going to do that
and not get killed?

316
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,327
I need you, too.

317
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,500
Tabby, you hear me?

318
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,920
Is that a chopper?

319
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,764
There it is.

320
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,062
This is Bruce Wayne. I'm at the GCPD.
We can see you.

321
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,481
<i>Copy that, Mr. Wayne.</i>

322
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,441
<i>Moving toward the rendezvous point.</i>

323
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,079
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

324
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,872
<i>We've been hit.
We're going down hard.</i>

325
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,750
Harvey, chopper went down.
Get a team together now.

326
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,712
Oh, my God.

327
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,387
Chopper went down
in Low Boyz territory.

328
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,639
I expect we'll have to
fight our way in and out.

329
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,848
I know it's a lot to ask,

330
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,475
but without those supplies,
we're done.

331
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,519
Can we get some more ammo?
We're running dry down here.

332
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,354
Be happy you got what you got
and get in.

333
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,607
Alfred, I expected to see Bruce here,
wanting to come along.

334
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,775
Well, you'd think, wouldn't you?

335
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,987
It's his chopper, his pilots.
Maybe thought you wouldn't allow it.

336
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,905
Just keep
an eye on things while I'm gone.

337
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,816
Hello.

338
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,571
The Low Boyz, is it?

339
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,574
I suspect you know who I am.

340
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,868
This ain't your turf, bird man.

341
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,494
Be that as it may,

342
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,747
I'm here to claim that.

343
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,208
Like hell.

344
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,219
Get it in the truck.

345
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,146
Oswald!

346
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,939
Jim!

347
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,650
I thought you might show up.

348
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,196
It is so good to see you, old friend.

349
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,449
How are you faring
in these troubled times?

350
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,285
Tell your men to step away
from the chopper.

351
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,997
Sorry. Mouths to feed.

352
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,958
And you know all about that,
don't you?

353
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,921
I hear you are
up to your ears in refugees.

354
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,464
We're protecting children,

355
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,758
families. We need those supplies. You
shouldn't have shot it down, Oswald.

356
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,179
You think I did this?

357
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,598
No, no, no.

358
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,060
That would mean that I knew
a chopper was coming,

359
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,437
which I did not.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

360
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,897
We're still taking everything,

361
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,483
but I did not fire the shot.

362
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,444
It was an RPG. Who else has
that kind of firepower?

363
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,571
Fair point.

364
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,782
But if it was me,

365
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,992
wouldn't I just admit it?

366
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,372
I mean, it's not like
I'm going to be arrested.

367
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,708
Then who was it?

368
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,168
No idea.

369
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,754
Now, nice as it was catching up,

370
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,091
it's time you skedaddle
while you can.

371
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,511
We are kind of
outgunned here, partner.

372
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,804
Listen to Harvey.

373
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,265
After all we have been through,

374
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,225
do not make me kill you.

375
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,602
Not like this.

376
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,757
You should have stayed home.

377
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,841
Listen to me.

378
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,719
I know you're upset about Butch.

379
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,389
- He thought you were his friend.
- I was his friend!

380
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,640
Liar!

381
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,517
You put a knife in my mother's back.

382
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,145
His blood is on your hands!

383
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,856
You really think that
I expected to come here

384
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,982
and walk away?

385
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,029
Jim, are you just going to
let her kill me like this

386
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,155
in cold blood?

387
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,865
Jim, listen to me.

388
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,992
You are not the only one
keeping Gotham from the abyss.

389
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,660
I am, I provide stability.

390
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,500
I may have pulled the trigger,

391
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,211
but you killed Butch.

392
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,715
Shut up and die.

393
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,606
If that was one of my bullets,

394
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,193
I will certainly be having a word
with my foreman.

395
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,111
Unacceptable!

396
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,366
Say hello to Butch.

397
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,026
Barbara.

398
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,611
Don't.

399
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,810
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

400
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,147
Oh, Jim, sounding a little quiet
over there.

401
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,942
What the hell do we do now?

402
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,808
I know I shouldn't be here.

403
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,144
But look,
Penguin had a truck out back.

404
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,396
I took these, and there's more.

405
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,273
I could kiss you, kid.

406
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,069
For the record, this is not
how I wanted things to go.

407
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,528
You son of a bitch.

408
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,198
I will rip out your heart!

409
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,076
Quiet! Now that is exactly
the kind of talk

410
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,410
that's going to force my hand.

411
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,747
But for old times' sake,
I will give you a chance.

412
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,458
Can we move past this?

413
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,671
Say the whole Tabitha-Butch chapter
is over.

414
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,217
I am going to feed your guts

415
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,052
to the rats,

416
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,388
you beaky-nosed freak!

417
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
So, no.

418
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,603
What's the plan, boss? Cover me.

419
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,775
Oswald!

420
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,652
I want to make a deal.

421
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,279
A deal, Jim?

422
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,742
We split
whatever's in the chopper 50-50,

423
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,787
and you let Barbara go.

424
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,289
No.

425
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,292
He does not get to
limp out of here alive!

426
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,756
I got a deal for you, Jim.

427
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,260
She dies, I take everything,

428
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,805
and you go home
and reflect long and hard

429
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,557
on my generosity!

430
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,891
And if I say no?

431
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
What happens
when the government finds out

432
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,022
you murdered the only cops
left in Gotham?

433
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,442
Nothing.

434
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,946
Jim, as far as I can tell,
you have nothing to offer,

435
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,698
and you're out of ammo.

436
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,456
Not anymore.

437
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,710
Truth is, I was never going to
make that deal.

438
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,837
I need all those supplies. Load up!

439
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,352
We got it. Here we go, people.

440
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,479
Heads up!

441
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,941
You think Penguin is going to pull
through? Cockroaches are hard to kill.

442
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,612
At least he'll be
out of commission for a while.

443
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,863
You had him dead to rights.

444
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,281
You could have put him down for good.

445
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,450
Yeah, shot a man without warning.

446
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,202
Three months ago, I would have
lost my badge for that.

447
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,579
Three months ago, we weren't
fighting for our survival.

448
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,955
You think it didn't cross my mind? I
know what we're up against, Harvey.

449
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,709
No one is coming to help.

450
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,127
Why didn't you do us all a favor

451
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,338
and put that murdering son of a bitch
in a hole?

452
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,340
You want rules for this game?

453
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,217
I'll tell you.
I'll make it simple, okay?

454
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
You win, or you die.

455
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,803
The next time, shoot to kill.

456
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,225
- Are you all right?
- No.

457
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,143
But we're alive, so that's something.
What's up?

458
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,062
The medicine
has just been taken to the clinic.

459
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,188
I need to check on Selina.

460
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,648
Yeah, sure. I'll get you a ride.

461
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,817
Hey! Let me know how she is.

462
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,819
And, Bruce...

463
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,198
Next time you want to help, just ask.

464
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,950
You've earned a place here.

465
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,018
<i>Captain Gordon? Hello?</i>

466
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,354
<i>Captain Gordon, come in.</i>

467
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,111
<i>Captain Gordon, do you read me?</i>

468
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,698
<i>Hello?</i>

469
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>Come in.</i>

470
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,076
This is James Gordon.
Who am I speaking to?

471
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
<i>A friend.</i>

472
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,123
<i>We want you to know
you have allies across the river.</i>

473
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,791
<i>We will find a way to help you.</i>

474
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,917
And who are you?

475
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
Get out of here!

476
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,091
Really?

477
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,885
A dumpster?

478
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,278
What are you doing to me?

479
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,530
Show yourself!

480
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,617
What is happening to me?

481
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,408
I promise.

482
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,288
If it's the last thing I do,

483
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,501
I will kill him!

484
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,298
My leg!

485
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,717
He shot my leg!

486
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,260
I just fixed this.

487
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,804
Mr. Cobblepot,
if you could hold still.

488
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,972
Put out the word.

489
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,974
One hundred thousand rounds
of ammunition

490
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,851
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

491
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,894
I want his head!

492
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,812
Selina!

493
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,397
Let me go!

494
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,442
Let me go!

495
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,778
I can't use my legs.

496
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,532
I have no reason to... I can't...

497
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,753
You should have just let me do it.

498
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,966
Let her do what? What happened?

499
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,427
She was trying to kill herself.

500
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,390
I've got restraints
for when she wakes.

501
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,734
I told you.

502
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,487
You want to cure her?
You have to go to the witch.

503
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,742
And where do I find this witch?

504
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,208
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

505
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,503
- Thank you very much.
- Saint Jim of Gotham. All right.

506
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,674
Hey. Every new refugee who comes in,

507
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,758
I want questioned.

508
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,510
We need information
on Jeremiah Valeska.

509
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,303
I haven't heard that clown's name
in three months.

510
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,513
Why now?

511
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,140
Just call it a hunch.

512
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,183
Well, rather than a week of food,

513
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,685
we've got six weeks.

514
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,438
- It's not a lot.
- Yeah, but it's better than we were.

515
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,772
Don't give up hope.

516
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,858
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

517
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,028
What's going on?

518
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,240
I was on duty
at the Thompson Street barricade.

519
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,577
He just appeared.
He said he needed to see you.

520
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,662
What happened, son?

521
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,289
Where did you come from?

522
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,333
Past the train station.
That's on the other side of town.

523
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,629
This kid must have made it through
half a dozen sectors to get here.

524
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,798
My brothers and sisters...

525
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,801
They're killing us.

526
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,886
Who is?

527
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,054
You have to help us.

528
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,723
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

529
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,641
Get him to the clinic.

530
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,328
I know you're all asking,
"Why are we still here

531
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,038
"when our own government
won't help us?"

532
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,749
It's simple.

533
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,462
We're supposed to be
giving these people hope.

534
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,509
Hope that if they're in danger,
someone will come.

535
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,554
We will come.
