1
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:22,875
MADRID, D-DAY

2
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,958
<i>Remember Plan Chernobyl?</i>

3
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,666
<i>It was a desperate plan</i>
<i>from our last heist.</i>

4
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,083
<i>It involved raining money down on Madrid</i>

5
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,875
<i>so we could make our escape</i>
<i>if everything went wrong.</i>

6
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,500
<i>It was intended to create chaos.</i>

7
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,875
<i>And that was exactly</i>
<i>what we needed right now.</i>

8
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,750
<i>Chaos.</i>

9
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,250
- Do you wanna get that?
- Uh-huh.

10
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,416
Yeah?

11
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,000
What blimps?

12
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,291
I'll be there in eight minutes.

13
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,625
The blimps are programmed
to go to specific coordinates,

14
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:07,250
and once they get there,
their doors will open.

15
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,250
<i>After that,</i>
<i>they'll fly in a radius of 250 meters</i>

16
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,416
releasing bills at intervals of 40 seconds
for a 50-minute period.

17
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,666
Imagine

18
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,875
on that day the money raining down
will be like Manna from heaven.

19
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,250
<i>In total, we'll release 140 million euros.</i>

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,958
It ain't cheap
going into the lion's den, right?

21
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,083
They call you

22
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,958
and all of us Robin Hoods.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,541
It makes sense that some of the money
goes back to the people.

24
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,666
<i>This message…</i>

25
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,250
is for all of you who see this mask
as a symbol of resistance.

26
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,625
<i>We need you.</i>

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,875
<i>The state has declared war on us.</i>

28
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,375
<i>A filthy war.</i>

29
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,541
And we've decided to stand up to them.

30
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,416
<i>The police have arrested</i>
<i>one of us in a foreign country.</i>

31
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,583
Aníbal.

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,333
You can't sleep?

33
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,083
Aníbal Cortés.

34
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,208
Come on,

35
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,708
let's get some coffee.

36
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,250
<i>It's been more than two months</i>
<i>since his arrest.</i>

37
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,583
<i>And no formal charges have been made.</i>

38
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,291
<i>They haven't requested extradition.</i>

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
<i>They haven't provided a lawyer.</i>

40
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,375
<i>He's being held captive</i>

41
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,708
<i>in some unknown place.</i>

42
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,916
<i>And in all likelihood,</i>

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,916
they are torturing him.

44
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,166
So we are demanding

45
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,000
that his illegal detention
be brought to an end right now

46
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>and that he's brought to justice</i>
<i>while respecting legal standards.</i>

47
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,750
<i>The state began this war.</i>

48
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,916
We're not going to hide.

49
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,541
Whoa.

50
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,541
We're going to fight…

51
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,583
<i>blow</i>

52
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,750
by blow.

53
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,166
<i>And this time…</i>

54
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,500
{\an8}CALLAO MOVIE THEATER

55
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,416
{\an8}<i>…the heist will be even bigger.</i>

56
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,041
Furthermore…

57
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,291
what is really going on is a chess game.

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,250
We are moving pieces
that force central intelligence

59
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,291
to move other pieces.

60
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,333
And Prieto can only do one thing.

61
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,833
{\an8}I want the army in the streets!

62
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,916
{\an8}They're waiting for us
to go running after those balloons.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,083
{\an8}But they don't know it's the best
diversion we've seen in our fucking lives.

64
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,583
{\an8}Raise the alert to level 5.

65
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,083
{\an8}If they have the balls
to announce they're going to rob us,

66
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,000
{\an8}they're gonna find
everything fortified. Fuck!

67
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,666
{\an8}Whoever attacks first

68
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,083
{\an8}will have more time.

69
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,541
{\an8}But whoever's defending the attack
won't have any time to prepare.

70
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,958
{\an8}So, on the spot, Prieto will be forced
to improvise with his best defense.

71
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,916
{\an8}Yes, the president gave the green light.
I want Madrid filled with soldiers.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,041
{\an8}Bring out the LMV, the troop trucks
and armored cars--

73
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,125
{\an8}Armored cars, fuck!
There's nothing wrong with my mouth.

74
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,166
And this is how we'll lay our trap.

00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,458
And I'm glad that you're alive.

99
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,375
Thank you.

100
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,458
Of course, the rat that hides outside

101
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,958
always has a better chance
of surviving, right?

102
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,375
I was the most exposed during the heist.

103
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,083
No, don't give me that bullshit.

104
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,375
The ones who face the bullets
are the most exposed, my dear.

105
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,791
- How many times were you shot at?
- I'm not here to argue.

106
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,583
Look, if I'm being frank,

107
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,375
I couldn't care less
why the fuck you came here.

108
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,041
All I know is after more than three years,

109
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,125
here we are.

110
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,000
So I'm gonna tell you
why you didn't enter the Royal Mint.

111
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,375
Because you're a coward.

112
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,916
And because

113
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,583
you had him do the dirty work.

114
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,500
Your brother.

115
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,541
A heist like that
always has a contingency.

116
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,833
A contingency?

117
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,916
I'll be very clear.

118
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,166
You didn't go in

119
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,125
and a third of your crew died,
you son of a bitch.

120
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,250
A third of your crew died
and you did nothing, not a fucking thing.

121
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,375
I feel it just like you do.

122
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,875
How the fuck could you feel like me?

123
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,875
How the fuck could you feel like me?
You son of a bitch!

124
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,083
I wouldn't have let him die!

125
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,125
I'd have gone in and gotten him out!

126
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,625
I would have done
whatever the fuck it took!

127
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,666
Even if I had to blow the building up!

128
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,708
I'd blow the fucking building,
but I wouldn't have let him die.

129
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,708
You let him die.

130
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
Who do you think you're talking to,
you son of a bitch?

131
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,541
Some dumbass from your gang?

132
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,041
I know you, Sergio.

133
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,500
I know what kind of person you are.

134
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,708
He was my friend.

135
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,125
He was everything to me.

136
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,125
He was my other half.

137
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,625
Look me in the eyes

138
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,000
and tell me you never thought of it.

139
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,041
That he'd let himself get killed.

140
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,458
With all your calculations,
you son of a bitch,

141
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,250
tell me you didn't consider
your brother's death.

142
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,541
Hmm?

143
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,958
I didn't consider my brother's death.

144
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
Not even once.

145
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,250
I don't know how to live without him.

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,958
I'm sorry, it's not your fault either.
You know that, right?

147
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,708
It wasn't your fault,

148
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,041
okay?

149
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,375
Okay.

150
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,291
How are you?

151
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,208
I'm… I'm fine.

152
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,041
Hanging with Johnnie Walker…

153
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,250
…popping pills, eating from cans.

154
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,250
But I'm all right.

155
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,125
Because I found the key.

156
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,541
Music.

157
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,083
You've locked yourself in here
this whole time, listening to music?

158
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,875
I put on music from

Come on, don't be a pussy.

166
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,125

I'm going to steal the gold.

I could say
it's a homage to my brother but,

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,875
the truth is…

Mónica.

186
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,208
- Denver, not now.
- No, right now.

187
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,083
I can't go inside 'til we fix this.

188
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,708
- Grab your gun and do what you have to do.
- Mónica, let me explain.

189
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,875
It was 3:00 a.m. I didn't know
what I was saying. Forgive me.

190
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,208
So that's a good reason
not to talk to me for three days?

191
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,875
It's about to begin.

192
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,625
Can you hear me?

193
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,541
Affirmative.

194
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,125
- You hear me?
- Hold on.

195
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,333
Now. Try again.

196
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,416

197
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,666

Let's go, goddamn it.

00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,833
I'm the one who's not fine.

247
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,708
Mónica, I'll be honest with you.
I don't want you in that bank.

248
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,875
- I mean, fuck, sweetie, we have a son.
- Calm down before--

249
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,625
How am I gonna calm down? It's been
three weeks since I've had any sleep.

250
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,541
We're not Bonnie and Clyde, Mónica.

251
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,250
Fuck, you were a secretary
at the Mint, not Rambo.

252
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,750
Shit!

253
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,583
- Denver…
- What?

254
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,666
I'm ready to go in there
and no matter what, I'm gonna do it.

255
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,500
How are you ready? From hanging out here,
studying with the Professor at crime camp?

256
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,291
- Give me a fucking break.
- Listen.

257
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,833
No, you listen to me, Mónica!

258
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,500
I've been preparing for this
my whole life, since I was a kid.

259
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,000
I'd go out to play with a ball

260
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,708
and some assholes would take it away
to fuck with me, so I fight them.

261
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,458
The next day was the same,
they do it again and again…

262
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,833
By nine, not even God himself
would fuck with me.

263
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,875
You don't learn that overnight.
And you don't abandon a kid…

264
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,416
here with some monks.

265
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,875
I'm not abandoning him.

266
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,916
- It's three days, not his entire life.
- What about breastfeeding?

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,791
- Breastfeeding?
- Come on.

268
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,958
- Mother's milk.
- Helsi!

269
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,833
Helsi, are you awake?

270
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,416
Yeah, I'm awake.

271
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,333
You're his mother…

272
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,458
- I can't sleep with Jesus looking at me.
- Jesus? What about them?

273
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,166
Denver's unbelievable… I'm so over this.

274
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,250
Just shut up!

275
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,166
Listen to me.

276
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,000
I am a mother, but I'm also your wife.

277
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,666
- And now I'm a thief.
- No, you're not.

278
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,333
And having a child
doesn't mean I stop being other things.

279
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,541
You're a father
and you're not staying here.

280
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:37,333
All right, we're not Bonnie and Clyde,
but I learn fast and I'm not afraid.

281
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,000
I prepared for the entrance exam
for the Mint for only six weeks.

282
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,291
You can prepare for the Mint.
You can't prepare for something like this.

283
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,833
That secretary doesn't exist.

284
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,041
Mónica Gaztambide
no longer exists, Denver.

285
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,333
She stayed there in the Royal Mint

286
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,291
shooting at the police
to save your ass, Tokyo's and Rio's.

287
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,750
Don't tell me to stay
and warm baby bottles

288
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,416
'cause I'm as much of a thief
as you mother fuckers.

289
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,833
You sexist asshole.

290
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,375
- Nairobi.
- What?

291
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,125
- Don't leave me alone.
- Hey, girl.

292
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,916
Hey, hey, are you okay?

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,166
No. No, I'm not okay.

294
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,375
I'm not surprised. I heard everything.

295
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,000
- That ape pulled the breast…
- Mónica…

296
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,333
You are part of the gang.

297
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,583
Mónica, you didn't understand what I was--

298
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,916
She understood everything.
You're a caveman.

299
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,458
What does that mean? "A caveman."

300
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,833
- To your cave!
- What's wrong, girls? What's going on?

301
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,500
Oh, hey, buddy.
Just dealing with the patriarchy.

302
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,416
The patriarchy?

303
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,375
That old paradigm
and its chauvinistic tendencies.

304
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,625
Let's talk about it.

305
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,833
You know what the real patriarchy is?

306
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,291
- What?
- The meat between my legs.

307
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,750
What the fuck is going on?

308
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,000
- Take it easy.
- Go do the dishes!

309
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,458
You're not sexist.
You're an asshole! Fuck this!

310
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,583
Go to your room!

311
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,833
"Me and my dick."

312
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,250
Do you know the time?

313
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,291
It's 3:00 a.m.

314
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,916
In the morning,
you're practicing with thermal lances.

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,625
They're 3,000 degrees Celsius.

316
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,541
I think

317
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,500
you should all be well-rested.

318
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
To your beds.

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,375
Mónica, come back to bed, please.

320
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,416
Forgive us, Professor.
We just had an argument tonight.

321
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,708
I'm going to sleep with Tokyo.

322
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:52,041
{\an8}FORTY-TWO MINUTES SINCE D-DAY

323
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,083
Are you okay?

324
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,166
I'm nervous.

325
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,333
Well, relax. After all, it's just like…

326
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,791
like a game of chess.

327
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,125
Only it's the Chess World Championship
and so…

328
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,250
It'll be a long match.

329
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,125
There will be an opening

330
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,166
a battle and

331
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,083
two opposing strategies.

332
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,791
And then finally checkmate.

333
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,625
Oh!

334
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,083
Look, on this side.

335
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,750
Can you feel it?

336
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,000
Another.

337
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,750
Yeah.

338
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,708
They're little kicks.

339
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,833
When I drink coffee,
the baby throws a party in there.

340
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,708
Tell me what you know about the carrier.

341
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,583
I don't know anything about a carrier.

342
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,500
No?

343
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,541
Yes.

344
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:21,958
Put the mask on.

345
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,666
I don't want to.

346
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,125
You put it on or Osman puts it on.

347
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,250
That's it, come on.

348
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,291
Another little horsey ride.

349
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,041
Let's see if we can remember.

350
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,208
My ankles are killing me.

351
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,458
There they are.

352
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,166
<i>I wasn't prepared</i>
<i>for the crowds of people protesting us.</i>

353
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,208
<i>♪ When you walk ♪</i>

354
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,958
<i>I just wanted to lean</i>
<i>out the window and scream at them,</i>

355
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,541
<i>"I'm Tokyo, I'm one of you.</i>"

356
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:35,875
<i>"We are Dalí."</i>

357
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,916
This mask has become a symbol

358
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,208
throughout the world

359
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,958
of resistance,

360
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,666
of indignation, of skepticism… whatever.

361
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,083
What is important
is it's inspired a lot of people.

362
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:54,458
Take a look.

363
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,916
This is a demonstration
against corruption in Rio de Janeiro.

364
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,000
Buenos Aires, Argentina,

365
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,000
several protests for women's rights.

366
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,541
Colombia.

367
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:14,375
Rome.

368
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,875
Paris.

369
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,250
The G20 Summit in Hamburg.

370
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,583
They filled entire stadiums.

371
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,083
This is in France.

372
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,208
Saudi Arabia.

373
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:38,291
What I'm trying to tell you is
we inspired a lot of people to fight.

374
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,666
And now these people are one of us.

375
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,541
<i>♪ Walk on ♪</i>

376
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,333
<i>♪ We'll all… ♪</i>

377
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,041
Don't forget that.

378
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,625
<i>There they were.</i>

379
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,291
<i>The Professor had put on the mask,</i>

380
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,916
<i>called out the Dalís</i>

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,916
<i>and the Dalís had answered.</i>

382
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,208
<i>They organized over social networks,</i>
<i>WhatsApp groups</i>

383
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,083
<i>and began shouting in the streets.</i>

384
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,958
<i>They were telling us</i>

385
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>"You will never walk alone."</i>

386
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,291

<i>♪ And you'll never… ♪</i>

388
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,875
<i>But all that was just poetry.</i>

389
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,875
<i>The real action started now.</i>

390
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,083
{\an8}TRAITORS

391
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,166
BANK OF SPAIN, 47 MINUTES SINCE D-DAY

392
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,083
Come on! Move it, move it!

393
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,500
Make sure they stay where they are!

394
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,958
Everybody, calm down.
I said calm down!

395
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,041
Everyone, move back!

396
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,583
The real BRIPAC convoy's on the way.

397
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,375
Eight kilometers out.

398
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,583
8 kilometers takes 6 minutes.

399
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,166
They only have six minutes to do it.

400
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,250
Hail Mary, full of grace…

401
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,333
Quit fucking around.

402
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,416
Hey, you have to say
"The Lord is with thee."

403
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,000
We're in a sacred place.
Have some fucking respect.

404
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,541
Good afternoon. May I?

405
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,333
Of course, Sergio. Here.

406
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,541
Thank you.

407
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,791
I've been studying the two plans in depth.

408
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,458
I've compared them and I have to say
that the plan for the Mint is difficult,

409
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,083
very difficult,
but it's possible and thorough.

410
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,083
But the Bank of Spain…

411
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,083
It's just crazy

412
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,750
and, above all, it's impossible.

413
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,291
- It seems impossible…
- It is.

414
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,250
The fact that it seems impossible
is what makes it so beautiful.

415
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,375
It looks impossible, but…

416
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,083
Palermo, the details.

417
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,708
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Bank of Spain.

418
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,333
We're going down ten meters,

419
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,291
twenty,

420
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:32,708
thirty,

421
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,041
forty…

422
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:35,875
Until we reach her.

423
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,125
The vault,

424
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,000
which is exactly 48 meters underground.

425
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,750
The chamber is completely airtight.

426
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,666
Why?

427
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,083
Because it floods, ladies and gentlemen.

428
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,708
Those ingenious Galician bastards.

429
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,958
You have to be a sadistic
son of a bitch to invent this.

430
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,625
- Show a little respect.
- It's a compliment, maestro.

431
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,625
It's a genius piece of engineering.
It's a marvel. One of a kind.

432
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,166
They channeled two streams
to run directly to the gold vault.

433
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,958
Forty-five kilometers
of reinforced underground piping.

434
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,291
Why?

435
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,916
If anyone dares
to knock on this tiny door…

436
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,875
the vault will flood
in less than 20 minutes, my friends.

437
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:24,291
You might touch the gold, but you'll
get squished like a toad and drown.

438
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,583
It's incredible.

439
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,666
Everything is so difficult that
nobody expects anyone to try to break in.

440
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,791
And that's why it'll work.

441
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,250
In fact, it's very simple.

442
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,833
If you apply a bit of talent

443
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,208
and science.

444
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,083
The best minds in engineering,

445
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,208
in physics,

446
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,916
in fluid mechanics…
Just picture them planning a heist.

447
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,375
Excellence in robbery.

448
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,833
But how the fuck will you get in?

449
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,666
Let's see.

450
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,791
There's Civil Guard officers, security men
and the governor's personal escort.

451
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,333
It's a strategic location.
The army will arrive in minutes.

452
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:07,166
It is impossible to get in
dressed as a thief, of course.

453
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,375
Now Sergio,

454
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:12,166
imagine that you're the hero
the whole world is waiting for

455
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,708
to save them from the chaos.

456
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,666
It's very easy
to create chaos, little brother.

457
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,583
I'm telling you,

458
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,250
they will receive us with open arms.

459
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,708
CIVIL GUARD

460
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,625
I'm Captain Garrido,

461
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,083
first platoon, sixth BRIPAC company.

462
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,291
Lieutenant Alcázar.

463
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,750
My orders are to assume control
over security of the building.

464
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:35,750
Remove these people.

465
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,791
Enlarge the perimeter to 150 meters
from the front of the bank.

466
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,875
And open the back door.
Convoy is on its way.

467
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Girls, we're pulling up.

468
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:54,958
We have orders to coordinate
with you… but not to let a convoy inside.

469
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,875
Sir, the convoy's arrived.

470
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,375
I will not give that order to my men.

471
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:11,958
Stop the truck.

472
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,041
<i>They're stopping us.</i>

473
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,250
Sir.

474
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,875
They require immediate access.

475
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,750
Jiménez.

476
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:30,958
Give me a radio.

477
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,625
<i>Defense staff headquarters.</i>

478
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,458
This is Lieutenant Alcázar,
Civil Guard detachment.

479
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,416
I need confirmation for access
of the BRIPAC platoon

480
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,750
to enter the Bank of Spain.

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,375
What the fuck is happening?

482
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,291
<i>This is Colonel Castro.</i>

483
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,083
<i>We just declared alert level 5.</i>
<i>I repeat, alert level 5.</i>

484
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:02,041
<i>From this moment on, the defense</i>
<i>of the interior of the Bank of Spain</i>

485
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,250
and its perimeter is assigned to the army.

486
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,833
You're to put all your men
under Captain Garrido's command

487
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:09,208
until the arrival
of Colonel Cerceda, understand?

488
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,750
Understood. Right away, Colonel.

489
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,416
Push back the security perimeter!

490
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,666
I want all that riffraff
on the other side of the street.

491
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,000
Clear the area
until the full company arrives.

492
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,375
Prepare the smoke canisters.

493
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,416
Prepare the smoke canisters!

494
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,291
<i>♪ All right, good ♪</i>

495
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,458
Authorization confirmed.

496
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,333
<i>♪ You move it to the left ♪</i>

497

499

<i>♪ Oh, come on baby ♪</i>

500
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:25,625

501
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,500
<i>♪ So you move to the left all night ♪</i>

502
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,791

503
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,333
- Have you ever heard of aikido?
- I have, it's an air conditioner.

504
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,291
It's those chocolate-covered sticks
that taste like cardboard

505
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,833
that everybody eats but nobody likes.

506
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,333
Aikido.

507
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,916
Using the strength of your enemy
in your favor.

508
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,250
For instance, the ten of us cannot take
the Bank of Spain.

509
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,708
The strength of our enemy is
far greater than our own. That's why…

510
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,083
we will apply aikido.

511
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,708
What do you mean, Professor?

512
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,958
Whatever we can't do ourselves

513
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,208
will be done by the Civil Guard,

514
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,583
the Spanish Army
and even the bank's own security.

515
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,583
<i>They will make sure</i>
<i>no one gets within 150 meters.</i>

516
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:26,000
We will find out the exact number
of hostages in the building.

517
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,916
How many people are in this building?

518
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,333
The bank security guards
will give us the number.

519
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,083
Three hundred sixty-seven.

520
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,458
Aikido.

521
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,541
I want all 367 down here in three minutes.

522
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,208
We'll place charges
on the facade and windows

523
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,000
in broad daylight without being seen.

524
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,000
And how?

525
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:46,458
The smoke bombs the Civil Guard
will set off to disperse the crowd.

526
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,166
Aikido.

527
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,458
<i>Evacuation protocol…</i>

528
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,625
I want everyone down here
in three minutes. Come on!

529
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,000
- <i>This is not a drill.</i>
- Let's go.

530
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,541
<i>Evacuation protocol.</i>

531
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,625
We'll get the staff and customers
out by using perfectly-rehearsed protocol.

532
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,541
And how?

533
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:40,125
You heard it, we are evacuating.

534
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,791
Everyone, gather in the hall right now!

535
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,125
Come on, come on.

536
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,625
Evacuation protocol.

537
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,875
I want you to head out
in an orderly manner.

538
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,500
<i>Civil Guard and security</i>
<i>will sweep the building, office by office,</i>

539
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,875
and evacuate everyone
in less than three minutes.

540
00:36:58,958 --> 00:36:59,958
Aikido!

541
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,791
Hurry up! Hurry up!

542
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,708
Hurry! Let's go, quickly!

543
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,125
Come on, come on.

544
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,541
That's it, keep going.

545
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,750
They will help load in all the materials
we need for the heist.

546
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm going to ask you all
to please keep calm.

547
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,166
We're going to evacuate the building
in two phases. Group one and group two.

548
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,916
They will escort
all the extra hostages out of the building

549
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,958
and will have taken a problem
off our hands.

550
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,250
Aikido!

551
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,666
Group one, let's go!

552
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,875
Let's go!

553
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,291
Let's go. All the way down,
all the way down! Go!

554
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,583
Do not stop. Let's go!

555
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,458
I said do not stop!

556
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,833
All the way! Go!

557
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,125
Go, go!

558
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,166
Move, move!

559
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,875
And then,
when everyone is where they should be…

560
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,125
we just have to press a button.

561
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:40,958
And this button…

562
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,041
<i>I'm the one who's gonna press it.</i>

563
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,958
No turning back now.
