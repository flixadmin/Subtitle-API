1
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,907
[young man] Before Rome, before Babylon,

2
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,077
before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.

3
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,453
The first self-governing people on Earth,

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,456
Kahndaq was a center of power and enlightenment.

5
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,458
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,766
-But then... -[people screaming]

7
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,672
...came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,576
Using the army to seize power, Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,545
But he had even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,521
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,225
Ahk-Ton's real goal was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,598
If infused with the powers of the six demons

13
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,834
-of the ancient world... -[thunder crashing]

14
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,770
...it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

15
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,805
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

16
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,507
A rare mineral of magic properties,

17
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,210
-found only in Kahndaq. -[miners grunting]

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,212
So he enslaved his own people...

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,848
and forced them to dig.

20
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,651
[grunting with effort]

21

[miners yelling in Kahndaqi]

23
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,281
[young man] Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

24
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,183
[men shouting in Kahndaqi]

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,784
[young man] What they needed...

26
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,852
[boy in Kahndaqi]

27
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,457
[shouting subsides]

28
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,424
[young man] ...was a hero.

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,226
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

30
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,441
-[tools clattering] -[birds calling in distance]

31
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:05,952
Hmm.

32

-[miner grunts] -[boy gasps]

33
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,398
[miner screaming]

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,971
[panting]

35
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,071
[miners grunting]

36
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,506
[young man] Someone to hold the hopes of the people,

37
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,612
even when all hope seems lost.

38
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,982

[miners yelling, cheering]

42
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,248
[young man] King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark

43
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,916
could quickly ignite a fire.

44
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,886
And so, he ordered that it be snuffed out.

45
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,590
[crowd chanting]

46
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,492
They thought they were getting a martyr.

47
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,895
Instead...

48
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,930
-[murmurs in Kahndaqi] -...they got a miracle.

49
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,039
[low voices chanting]

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,509
[young man] The Council of Wizards,

51
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,911
the magical guardians of the earth...

52
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,513
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

53
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,615
[young man] ...sought to restore the balance.

54
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,418
They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods.

55
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,719
And turned a boy...

56
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,954
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

57
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,423
...into a champion.

58
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,524
[all] Shazam!

59
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,926
[thunder crashing]

60
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,961
[King Ahk-Ton speaking Kahndaqi]

61
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,930
[young man] But the crown had already been completed.

62
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,500
[people chattering excitedly]

63
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,668
[young man] And when the Champion arrived at the palace

64
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,770
to challenge him...

65
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,972
King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power.

66
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,448
In the ensuing battle, the palace was destroyed,

67
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,150
but the Champion was victorious.

68
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,119
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,122
so that it would never again fall into the hands of man.

70
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,325
And the Champion was never heard from again.

71
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,994
["Bullet With Butterfly Wings" playing]

72
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,300
Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries,

73
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,837
the Intergang, the latest in a series of foreign invaders.

74
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,042
But legend says, whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

75
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,079
the Champion will return to restore freedom to the people.

76
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,548
It has been a long, long wait.

77

[vendors shouting indistinctly]

80
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,730
Show me your papers.

81
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,768
[horn blaring]

82
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,302
[checkpoint soldier 1] Move it along!

83
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,104
[checkpoint leader] Have your documentation ready.

84

[indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,475
[driver] It's all our three documents, yeah?

86
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,743
Don't judge the picture,

87
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,111
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

88

-[indistinct chatter] -[faint radio chatter]

00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,558
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

91
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,796
It's just a bunch of old TVs. I'm an electrician.

92
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,571
-Hey! -[young man grunting]

93
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,473
Watch where you're going.

94
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,141
You know the drill, back of the line.

95
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,477
Come on, man, you see me every day.

96
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,778
[checkpoint leader] And every day I tell ya,

97
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,747
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

98
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,415
Back of the line, mate.

99
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,617
You're not my mate.

100
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,654
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,957
No, what you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

102
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,792
from halfway around the world,

103
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,261
sent here to steal my country's natural resources,

104
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,831
strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our water,

105
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,365
oppress our heritage,

106
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,167
and make us wait in lines all day.

-[bangs van door] -Hey, boss man. Can I go?

00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,147
Go on, get out of here.

110
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,015
-Yeah, yeah. -[thumps door twice]

111
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,192
[driver] Adrianna, we're clear.

112
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,002
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

113
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,403
Let's just move the crown first,

114
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,805
and then we can worry about safe.

115
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,440
I got Intergang watching my house.

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,309
I gave up my job at the university and moved four times.

117
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,211
It doesn't mean I'm gonna abandon my country.

118
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,947
I'm just saying, no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

119
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,083
We can't wait for things to cool down this time.

120
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,386
If I'm right, they're days away from finding it.

[thudding]

122

What are you doing?

123
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,527
I want to come with you.

124
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,828
You know it's too dangerous.

125
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,329
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

126
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,199
Come on, I want to help you beat those bastards.

127
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,001
Adrianna, keep your head down, please.

128
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,869
-You want to be a hero, huh? -I do, yeah.

129
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,971
Go home, do your homework.

130
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,708
Your time will come one day, but not today, son.

131
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,644
Go!

132
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,145
Go, little man. You did good.

133
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,811
That would get you a fortune on the black market.

134
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,247
Is that real Eternium?

135
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,250
Show us a little magic.

136
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,185
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

137
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,853
You guys should get some rest.

138
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,222
I thought Intergang seized all the old relics.

139
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,190
Hey, come on. Stop it.

140
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,858
I'm just curious how she got it.

141
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,527
My grandmother gave it to me.

142
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,494
How did she get it?

143
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,064
It's not a museum piece.

144
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,032
It's a family heirloom, going all the way back

145
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,168
to the days when Kahndaq was free.

146
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,470
You happy now?

147
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,771
Cool story.

And all I inherited was a sweater.

149
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,180
That's not true. Baba left you his van and his bald spot.

150
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,148
You know, some women like a bald spot.

151
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,218
Curly on the outside, smooth on the inside. You know?

152
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,244
[man] Are you sure about this?

153
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,279
[Adrianna] The inscriptions we found are clear.

154
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,016
And I'm positive about that translation.

155
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,951
There is something inside that mountain.

158
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,226
It's a source of great power. Who gets to keep it?

159
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,195
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

160
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,997
Get it out of the country if we have to.

161
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,266
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

162
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,269
This is it?

163
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,971
Not yet.

Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

And don't let anything happen to you, either.

Don't do anything crazy. You listen to Carter.

I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al. I promise.

That's why I called in Kent.

[Carter] Kent's been out of action for a little while,

nearly God-level powers.

00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,854
It might take a lot more than that.

391

Are you sure they can take him?

392

[Atom Smasher] I didn't bring a passport.

We don't need passports. We're the Justice Society.

[Cyclone] Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

[Hawkman] Everything down to the screws.

Completely indestructible.

412

I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

414

I know you have a lot to catch up on.

You're Teth Adam, right?

437
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,058
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

438
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,660
-I said move. -My mom said you took out

a bunch of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,130
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

I'm sure you're fast, but how fast? Like Flash fast?

Wait, did you really not have mirrors back then?

Wow, I guess a lot does change in 5,000 years.

Five thousand years?

Yeah, that's how long you were in the tomb.

00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,986
Intergang have guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets.

496
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,321
We have my mom.

497
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,124
Prove your strength.

498
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,859
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

499
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,160
Make him beg for mercy,

500
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,596
but deny it until his final breath.

501
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,031
Interesting, okay?

502
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,532
I appreciate what you did for me,

503
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,102
but I do not want you teaching my son violence.

504
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,406
I understand. You want his father

505
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,840
-to teach him violence. -[coughs]

506
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,675
-Gross, that's my brother. -That's my sister.

507
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,811
-His father's dead. -I'm sorry.

508
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,248
Who do you want to teach him violence then?

509
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,950
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want to teach me violence?

510
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,485
No one.

511
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,656
I want a champion to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

512
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,392
Please, help us.

513
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,601
[panting]

514
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,845
[Amon] Wait! Wait.

515
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,149
-Where are you going? -I shouldn't be here.

516
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,318
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

517
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,719
Not really, no.

518
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,354
You're not seeing the full possibilities here.

519
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,156
I don't know what it was like in ancient times,

520
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,459
but having superpowers is kind of a big deal in our world.

521
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,127
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,

522
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,395
get a cape, change your name.

523
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,230
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

524
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,565
It's a little outdated.

525
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,166
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

526
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,634
Something blackout bad-ass to say

527
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,104
right before you absolutely cook some dude.

528
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,505
I don't waste words on the dead.

529
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,373
Well, yeah, kind of like that, but more catchy.

530
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,708
I was thinking, like,

531
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,010
"Tell them the Man in Black sent you."

532
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,479
-Them? -You know, gods, demons...

533
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,380
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

534
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,416
And you wear a lot of black, so we should really lean into that.

535
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,185
My point is, you could be famous.

536
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,020
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

537
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,224
And the superhero industrial complex is worth a lot of money.

538
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,259
I don't need a box for my lunch.

539
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,294
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

540
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,565
What else are you gonna do?

541
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,436
[people exclaiming]

542
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,506
Wait! Where are you going?

543
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,209
[people chattering excitedly]

544
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,690
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

545
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,559
Most of this was considered a myth

546
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,461
until yesterday afternoon.

547
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,731
He's a bad man, Kent. What else do you need to know?

548
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,833
When you've seen as many different futures as I have,

549
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,302
you cease to believe in absolutes.

550
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,171
[wry chuckle]

551
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,072
What are you laughing at?

552
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,742
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

553
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,244
I know. That's how you laugh.

554
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,579
I've missed having you around

555
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,582
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

556
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,617
Almost as much as I've missed having you around

557
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,320
to ignore all my advice. Carter...

558
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,557
This is not a very good plan.

559
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,563
Yeah, well...

560
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,932
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

561
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,902
If only there were a third option.

562
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,741
[Cyclone] I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

563
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,743
Why not?

564
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,412
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

565
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,713
It's millions of years old.

566
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,715
It chooses who it lets touch it.

567
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,484
-Like Kent? -Yeah.

568
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,188
Like, Kent is literally possessed when he puts it on.

569
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,623
What happens if I touch it anyway?

570
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,826
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

571
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,963
So we should probably put a towel on it, right?

572
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,331
[Hawkman] Coming up on it.

573
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,499
Ready stations in five.

574
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,102
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

575
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,370
[Carter] He's not some dude.

576
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,473
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

577
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,342
You don't have to raise your hand.

578
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,011
Question, if he's so powerful, how are we supposed to stop him?

579
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,181
If we can get him to say the word, "Shazam,"

580
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,350
Teth Adam will lose his power.

581
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,718
And we're hoping since he's had

582
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,053
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

583
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,390
we can peacefully negotiate the terms of his existence.

584
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,592
From the footage you showed us, he doesn't really seem like

585
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,828
a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

586
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,129
Correct.

587
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,464
Look alive.

588
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,900
We're here.

-for all Intergang soldiers. -Hey! Stop!

597
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,729
Kahndaq has its own official superhero now.

The statue?

606
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,044
[Adrianna] That's my son.

607

He's just a boy. He doesn't know what he's doing.

What are you doing?

No.

We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

And we will use force if necessary.

There's no place for you in the world of man.

You have two choices.

Kneel or die.

I was a slave until I died.

Then I was reborn a God.

He's been spotted entering the palace.

It's safe to say he's not going there to surrender.

Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

He's the Champion of Kahndaq. Who are you?

We have been living under military occupation

Thank you, but... we're covered.

Go and protect international stability someplace else.

Let me spell it out for you.

Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion,

788

I...

799
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,332
Can we please just see the crown?

800
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,167

Teth Adam first, then the crown.

805
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,458
You don't have any authority here.

806
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,692
Teth Adam has done nothing--

807
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,529
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

808
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,164
And how would you know?

809
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,632
We have access to ancient texts

810
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:50,700
that have been kept secret for centuries.

811
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,436
And what exactly do these supposed ancient texts say?

812
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,606
They say that his rage nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

813
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,176
And we flew all the way over here

814
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,411
to stop it from happening again.

815
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,082
[Hawkman] You want to go in there alone?

816
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,784
Are you sure?

817
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,487
You want to go in and fight Teth Adam again, be my guest.

818
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,889
But if you actually want to resolve things peacefully,

819
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:15,225
without destroying the rest of my city,

820
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,593
I'm your only shot.

821
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,251
[Teth Adam] You brought the invaders with you.

822
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,453
They only want to talk.

823
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,823
They can talk. I won't listen.

824
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,261
When I was a little girl, my grandmother told me the story

825
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,297
of how the Champion came to this exact spot

But according to the Justice Society,

829

that's not really what happened.

830

It was your prison.

And, now, there's a statue of you.

Out of the hope that someday Kahndaq's champion would return.

848
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,539
But it's built on a lie, isn't it?

You may not have been a hero.

We should go bail her out right now.

You're right.

1316
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,526
Only you can.

1317
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,429
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

1318
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,568
Who's Hurut?

1319
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,109
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

1320
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,683
And he was also my son.

1321
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,688
[Teth Adam speaking in Kahndaqi]

1322
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:49,237
[people yelling, shouting in distance]

1323
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,705
[soldiers shouting, grunting]

1324
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,774
[Teth Adam in English] I tried to protect him.

1325
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,309
[grunting fiercely]

1326
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,181
[inhales softly]

1327
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,017
[Teth Adam] But I wasn't strong enough.

1328
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,658
[wizards] Shazam!

1329
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:13,528
[Teth Adam] The wizards decided that he would be their champion.

1330
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,830
But after the Champion's many victories,

1331
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,633
the king went after what Hurut loved the most.

1332
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,069
[yelling]

1333
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,204
-[Teth Adam] Our family. -[screaming]

1334
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,606
[woman screams]

-[Teth Adam coughs] -[speaking in Kahndaqi]

01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,166
[coughing weakly]

[Hurut speaking in Kahndaqi]

1339
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,645
-Shazam. -Shazam.

1340
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,647
[thunder crashing]

1341
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:19,494
[Teth Adam] Instead of battling the king...

1342
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:21,696
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

1343
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:27,168
Hurut chose to save... me.

1344
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,578
[arrows clattering]

1345
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,049
[bow string creaking]

1346
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,221
[Teth Adam] But he couldn't save himself

1347
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:48,656
from the king's assassins.

1348
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:50,959
[yelling in Kahndaqi]

1349
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,895
[Teth Adam in English] The powers were not a gift from the wizards...

1350
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,230
[whispering in Kahndaqi]

1351
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,064
[Teth Adam in English] ...but a curse.

1352
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:59,100
[powerful yell]

1353
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,676
Born... out of rage.

1354
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,715
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

1355
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,253
It's Hurut.

1356
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:23,258
My son dreamt of a better world.

1357
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,094
That's why he saved me.

1358
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:33,168
But the world was only a better place with him in it.

1359
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,752
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1360
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,189
Instead, it got me.

1361
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,627
All this power...

1362
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,163
And the only thing I can do with it is hurt people.

1363
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:05,967
I will speak the word my son gave me,

1364
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,602
and I will give up my power.

1365
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:14,175
And when I do, you must ensure I never speak it again.

1366
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:20,849
Shazam.

1367
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,584
[thunder echoing]

1368
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,558
[speaking in Kahndaqi]

1369
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,940
Hey!

1370
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,360
[chuckling] So beautiful.

1371
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,155
Surprised to see us?

1372
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,291
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1373
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:11,926
Are you sure you can handle him?

1374
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:14,662
You're the one who can see the future,

1375
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,130
you'll tell me if we can't.

1376
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,533
Just be careful with this one.

1377
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,035
You know, they say the gods created us,

1378
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:23,771
but we're the ones who always wind up burying them.

1379
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,275
Waller sends her regards.

1380
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:35,683
[Dr. Fate] They'll know how to deal with him.

1381
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,653
To keep him from regaining his powers,

1382
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,922
they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1383
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:51,799
As long as he's submerged, he won't be able to speak.

1384
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:58,506
He'll never say another word again.

1385
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,061
Hey! There he is.

1386
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,898
Not all heroes wear capes, but I think you earned this.

1387
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,633
-[laughs] -Well, statistically,

1388
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,935
most heroes don't wear capes. But yeah, try it on.

1389
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,441
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1390
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:36,244
[light wind blowing]

1391
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,012
That's a nice touch.

[Dr. Fate moans]

1399
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,520
Kent.

1400
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:22,557
-Kent! -[gasps]

1401
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,728
Mission accomplished?

1402
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,863
My vision hasn't changed.

1403
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:31,065
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1404
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,968
Kent, if this isn't over, I need to know what's coming.

1405
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,870
What is the helmet telling you?

1406
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:40,575
My vision has always shown me a great calamity.

1407
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,877
The world in flames.

1408
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:44,112
We can stop it...

1409
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,448
but you die.

1410
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,885
You should've told me sooner.

1411
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:55,857
I have no fear of death.

1412
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,059
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1413
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,428
The world needs the Justice Society.

1414
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,196
The world needs you.

1415
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,732
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1416
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,667
That's Fate, right?

1417
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:09,670
[rueful chuckle]

1418
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,539
That sounds familiar.

1419
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,144
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1420
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:22,717
It was an RAF deployment, headed to the Western Front.

1421
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,186
Everyone on my street came out to see them off.

1422
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,422
Mm.

1423
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,890
But I didn't cheer.

1424
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:33,094
Even though I was only a boy.

1425
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:37,799
I knew where they were headed, and what awaited them.

1426
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:39,467
Thanks to this, I've lived longer

1427
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,636
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1428
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,404
I've seen the world change

1429
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,573
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1430
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:50,578
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1431
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,915
And I don't want my friend to die.

1432
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,019
[sighs]

1433
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:06,761
Ishmael said, "Death is the only path to life."

1434
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:09,096
But that's not what the inscription says.

1435
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,799
Right. "Life is the only path to death."

1436
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,001
Maybe he got it backwards,

1437
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:16,471
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1438
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:17,939
That's it.

1439
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,408
In Kahndaqi mythology, the souls of the damned

1440
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,510
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1441
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:24,612
The underworld is a mirror to our own.

1442
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,714
Here, turn the crown around.

1443
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,550
Now mirror the letters.

1444
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:32,653
See? That's what I missed.

1445
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:36,524
"Death is the only path to life."

1446
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,328
[gasping]

1447
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,930
[Adrianna] He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1448
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,533
because he knew that Teth Adam would kill him.

1449
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,602
And he believed the Champion's magic

1450
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,537
would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1451
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:53,241
As life is the path to death.

1452
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:56,978
[demon 1] Now your death is a path to life.

1453
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:59,247
[demon 2] The wizards have their champion,

1454
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,249
now we have ours.

1455
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:04,318
[demon 3] You will take the throne of Kahndaq

1456
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:08,389
and unleash hell on Earth!

1457
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:10,558
[demons] Speak our name.

1458
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:12,560
"Sabbac."

[screaming]

1460
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,349
[Dr. Fate] What the bloody hell is that?

1461
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,518
[Hawkman] Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1462
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,353
Get me closer. Now, right now!

1463
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,289
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds!

1464

[speaking in Kahndaqi]

1465
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:58,372
