- Did you remember your revolver?
- Knew I forgot something.

- I thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,017
- I think that's quite enough.
- You are a doctor, after all.

Always nice to see you, Watson.

Tell me, Doctor, as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

Watson! Don't!

25
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,912
Observe.

26
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,483
How did you see that?

27
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,085
Because I was looking for it.

Lord Blackwood.

29
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,128
You seem surprised.

30
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,431
I'd say the girl deserves
your attention more than he.

31
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,833
Indeed.

32
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,342
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

33
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,044
Good lad.

00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,147
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,184
We've one for the doctor
and one for the rope.

36
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,820
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

37
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,956
This woman
needs a hospital immediately!

38
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,357
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

39
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,026
- All right, lads. That's it.
- Come on.

40
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,364
- Pick him up, lads!
- Yes, sir.

41
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,132
If you don't mind.

42
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,203
Get him out of my sight.

43
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,711
And you were supposed to wait
for my orders.

44
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,482
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumour.

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,353
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

46
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,356
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

47
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,225
Well, London will breathe
a sigh of relief.

48
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,527
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

49
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,529
Bravo, Inspector. Have a cigar.

My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

57
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,878
Tell me something.

58
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,780
Your new premises...

59
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,882
when are you moving in?

60
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,949
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,621
And there'll be a woman's touch, too.

63
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,323
- Well, that's marvellous.
- Indeed.

65
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,064

- No. No, no.

Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,768
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,737
I'll go and check.

69
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,173
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,275
won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,777
No, he won't.

00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,649
Mrs Hudson.

73
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,518
I won't go in there by myself,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,320
You don't have to go in there at all.
Give me the paper.

75
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,690
What will I do when you leave, Doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,926
He just needs another case. That's all.

77

Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,663

not in a domestic environment.

Thank you, Cpt. Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

- Same time next week.
- Come along, Captain.

82
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,541
It's quieter downstairs.

83
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,177
Mrs Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.

84
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,557
- Permission to enter the armoury?
- Granted.

85
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,864
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,999
that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.

87
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,472
It's not working. Can I see that?

88
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:12,185
You know, it's been three months
since your last case.

89
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,258
Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me.

90
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,029
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

I can't but agree.

Give me problems, give me work.

- The sooner the better.
- Paper.

94
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:41,614
Let's see then, there's a letter here
from Mrs Ramsey of Queen's Park.

95
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,016
Her husband's disappeared.

96
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,751
He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

97
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,719
Is it November?

98
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,088
Yes, Holmes.

99
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:55,462
All right. Lady Radford reports
her emerald bracelet has disappeared.

100

Insurance swindle.

Lord Radford likes fast women
and slow ponies.

I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

103
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,038
Yes.

104
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,239
It was our last case together...

105
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,774
and I wanted to see it
through to the end.

A Mr Lewis is seeking--

107
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,253
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present.

108
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,290
The curious case of Mrs Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

109
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,593
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

110
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,162
They appear most sinister.

111
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,065
- Tea, Mr Holmes?
- Is it poisoned, Nanny?

112
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,601
There's enough of that in you already.

113
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't touch! Everything is in its proper
place as per usual, Nanny.

114
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,443
Oh, he's killed the dog. Again.

115
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,778
What have you done to Gladstone now?

116
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,849
I was simply testing a new anaesthetic.
He doesn't mind.

117
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,988
Holmes. As your doctor...

118
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,623
He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.

119
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,957
As your friend...

120
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,294
you've been in this room for two weeks.

121
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,863
I insist, you have to get out.

122
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,767
There's nothing of interest
for me out there, on earth, at all.

123
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,604
- So, you're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

124
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,672
- Dinner?
- Wonderful.

125
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,374
- The Royale?
- My favourite.

126
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,275
Mary's coming.

127
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,145
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes!

128
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,482
Have you proposed yet?

129
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,151
No, I haven't found the right ring.

130
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,352
Well, then it's not official.

131
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,690
It's happening, whether you like it
or not. 8:30, the Royale.

132
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,559
- Wear a jacket.
- You wear a jacket.

133
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,876
A man? Outside my house?

134
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,050
Straighten your tie.

135
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,929
Holmes!

136
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:12,565
You're early.

137
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,268
Fashionably.

138
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,939
- Ms Mary Morstan.
- Oh, my goodness. What a pleasure.

139
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,675
For the life of me, I don't know
why it's taken him so long...

140
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,843
to introduce us properly.

141
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,012
Pleasure is mine.

142
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,354
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr Holmes.

143
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,755
I've heard so much about you.

144
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,625
I have a pile of detective novels
at home.

145
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,860
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

146
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,197
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

147
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,733
making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details.

148
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,101
That's not quite right, is it?

149
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,971
In fact, the little details are
by far the most important.

150
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,977
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

151
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:01,714
See his walking stick?

152
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,119
A rare African snakewood
hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

153
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,389
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

154
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,958
so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

155
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,394
Strong, brave, born to be
a man of action.

156
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,497
And neat, like all military men.

157
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,999
Now, I check his pockets.

158
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,970
A stub from a boxing match.

159
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,639
Now, I can infer that
he's a bit of a gambler.

160
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,341
I'd keep an eye on that
dowry if I were you.

161
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,243
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

162
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,246
He's cost us the rent more than once.

163
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,983
Well, with all due respect, Mr Holmes,
you know John very well.

164
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,685
What about a complete stranger?

165
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,587
What can you tell about me?

166
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,122
- You?
- I don't think that's....

167
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,457
- I don't know that that's....
- Not at dinner.

168
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,458
Perhaps some other time.

169
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,592
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,928
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,837
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,605
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

173
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,042
- Waiter?
- Your student is a boy of eight.

174
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,379
- Charlie's seven, actually.
- Charlie, huh.

175
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,715
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

176
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,553
- Is there ink on my face?
- There's nothing wrong with your face.

177
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,621
There are two drops on your ear,
in fact.

178
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,390
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

179
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,959
Anyway, a very impetuous act
by the boy.

180
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,161
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

181
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,331
which is why the lady for whom
you work lent you that necklace.

182
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,300
Oriental pearls, diamonds,
a flawless ruby...

183
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,736
hardly the gems of a governess.

184
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,575
However, the jewels you are not
wearing tell us rather more.

185
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,176
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

186
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,013
The ring is gone, but the lighter skin
where it once sat suggests...

187
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,683
that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly.

188
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,384
That is until you were informed
of its true...

189
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,186
and rather modest worth
at which point you broke off...

190
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,022
the engagement and returned
to England for better prospects.

191
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,825
A doctor, perhaps.

192
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,602
Right on all counts, Mr Holmes,
apart from one.

193
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,374
I didn't leave him. He died.

194
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,219
Well done, old boy.

195
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,335
Come on!

196
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,944
Get up and fight! Come on!
Come on!

197
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,381
Get up!

198
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,660
That's it, big man, we're done.

199
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,129
You won, congratulations.

200
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,899
Oi, we ain't done yet!

201
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,906
"This mustn't register
on an emotional level."

202
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,312
"First, distract target.
Then block his blind jab."

203
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,682
"Counter with cross to left cheek."

204
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,987
"Discombobulate.
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker."

205
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:39,158
"Employ elbow block, and body shot."

206
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,061
"Block feral left.
Weaken right jaw."

207
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,864
"Now fracture."

208
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,000
"Break cracked ribs."

209
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,072
"Traumatize solar plexus.
Dislocate jaw entirely."

210
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,610
"Heel kick to diaphragm."

211
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,515
"In summary, ears ringing,
jaw fractured...

212
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,417
"three ribs cracked, four broken...

213
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,219
"diaphragm haemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...

214
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,356
"Full psychological recovery,
six months."

215
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,426
"Capacity to spit at back of head,
neutralized."

216
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,422
Where did that come from?

217
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,931
What the hell's going here, Charlie?

218
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,367
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

219
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,336
It's like he's burning
from the inside out.

220
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,674
You lot! Shut up!

221
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,180
Charlie. Charlie!
Take this man to the infirmary, now!

222
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,461
What's this all about then,
Blackwood?

223
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,567
There's someone I want to see.

224
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,258
- Watson?
- Right. Let's go.

225
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,528
What started merely as an experiment...

226
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,665
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

227
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:37,937
Now, if I play a chromatic scale,
there's no measurable response.

228
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,107
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

229
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,842
But, now...

230
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,946
and this is remarkable,
if I change to atonal clusters...

231
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,684
VoilÃ , they fly in counter clockwise...

232
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,054
synchronised concentric circles
as though a regimented flock.

233
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,689
Watson, this is exceptional.

234
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,759
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

235
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,965
- How did you lure them in?
- Excellent question.

236
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,401
Individually.
I've been at it for six hours.

237
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,271
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

238
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,775
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

239
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,411
You are Blackwood's last request.

240
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,592
Look at those towering structures.

241
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,731
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

242
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,832
Most innovative.

243
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,137
What an industrious empire.

244
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,308
Oh, I have your winnings
from last night.

245
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,412
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

246
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,448
You're right.

247
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,018
I'll keep it with your cheque book,
locked safely away in my drawer.

248
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,757
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

249
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,425
I could easily procure
a couple of tickets

250
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,361
if you had any cultural inclinations
this evening.

251
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,100
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

252
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,036
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

253
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,676
I knew she'd been engaged.
She had told me.

254
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,644
So, that's no to the opera then?

255
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,385
That was my waistcoat.

256
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,487
I thought we agreed
it's too small for you.

257
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,323
- I'd like it back.
- I thought we agreed.

258
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:38,490
I want it back.

259
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,658
This way, Mr Holmes.

260
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,162
Blackwood certainly seems
to have got the crowd...

261
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,764
into something of a fear frenzy.

262
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,600
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

263
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,604
- Care to come along?
- No, you're on your own, old cock.

264
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,606
I've no business with him
whilst he's alive.

265
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,941
Suit yourself, mother hen.

266
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,224
It seems you have a lot of rooms to let.

267
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,126
We had to move the prisoners, sir.

268
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,094
Otherwise we were gonna have
a riot on our hands.

269
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,598
He has a peculiar effect
on the inmates.

270
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,599
As though...

271
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,869
he can get inside their heads.

272
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm sure I can find my own way,
if you have other duties to perform.

273
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,944
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you, sir.

274
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,150
"If any man have an ear, let him hear."

275
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,618
"And I stood upon the sand
of the sea...

276
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,788
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
having seven heads and ten horns.

277
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,956
And upon his arms were 10 crowns
and upon his heads...

278
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,991
were the name of blasphemy."

279
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,293
"And they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast...

280
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,996
"and they worshipped the beast saying,
Who is like unto the beast?"

281
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,798
"The beast which I saw was
like unto a leopard...

282
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,399
"and his feet were
at the feet of a bear."

283
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,967
"And his mouth was the mouth
of a lion."

284
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,805
"And the dragon gave him his power,
and his seat, and great authority."

285
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,173
I love what you've done with the place.

286
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,510
So glad you could accept my invitation.

287
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,347
I just have a small point of concern.

288
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,116
How can I help?

289
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,617
I'd already followed the murders
with some interest...

290
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,454
and while my heart went out primarily
to the families of the victims

291
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,957
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

292
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,326
You're too kind.

293
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,627
However, by comparison...

294
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,464
your work in the crypt was more
akin to a finger painting.

295
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,304
So now you're curious as
to whether there's a larger game afoot.

296
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,873
Either that or...

297
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,110
shortly my friend
will pronounce you dead...

298
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,544
and I thought I might keep him company.

299
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,015
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

300
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,152
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

301
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,354
I'm merely the channel.

302
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,723
Well, my only wish is
that I could have caught you sooner.

303
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,626
You see, five lives
might have been spared.

304
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,529
Those lives were a necessity.

305
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,332
Sacrifice.

306
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,469
Five otherwise meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

307
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,305
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

308
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,540
After you're hanged, of course.

309
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,212
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

310
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,015
Then you, too
could serve a greater purpose.

311
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,553
Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

312
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,158
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

313
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,594
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

314
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,763
that will twist the very fabric
of nature.

315
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,401
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

316
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,770
That worries me.

317
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,073
Steel your mind, Holmes.

318
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,210
I need you.

319
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,546
I say, you've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

320
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,080
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.

321
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,081
Pay attention.

322
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,586
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

323
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,688
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

324
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,559
Or, by the time you realise
you made all of this possible...

325
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,795
it will be the last sane thought
in your head.

326
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,940
- What did he want?
- Not sure.

327
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,542
But I don't think you're needed,
Father.

328
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,610
Not for this one.

329
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,947
Lord Henry Blackwood...

330
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,918
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

331
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,722
the unholy murder
of five innocent young women...

332
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,491
and the attempted murder of a sixth.

333
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,827
Do you have any final words?

334
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:10,963
Death...

335
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:13,999
is only the beginning.

336
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,514
Forever and ever. Amen.

337
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,870
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

338
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,061
London's so bleak this time of year.

339
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,832
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

340
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,868
I would much prefer
to travel in the winter.

341
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,373
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

342
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:33,545
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan
and your favourite...

343
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,048
olives from the Cyclades.

344
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,251
Thought we might have
a little tea party.

345
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:42,254
And while I was setting the table,
I found this.

346
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,523
A file with my name on it.

347
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,027
Theft of Velazquez portrait
from King of Spain.

348
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,330
Missing naval documents lead
to resignation...

349
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,231
of Bulgarian Prime Minister.

350
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,403
Scandalous affair ends
engagement of...

351
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,109
Hapsburg Prince to Romanov Princess.

352
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,447
I was simply studying your methods...

353
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,682
should the authorities ask me
to hunt you down.

354
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,386
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

355
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,355
But your signature was clear.

356
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,858
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

357
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,263
- Or just another souvenir?
- Let's not dwell on the past.

358
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,300
Shall we?

359
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,572
Now, by the looks of things,
I'd say you're between jobs.

360
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,806
And you, between husbands.

361
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,376
How much did you get for the ring?

362
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,945
He was boring and jealous
and he snored.

363
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,584
I'm Irene Adler again.

364
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,925
Thank you.

365
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:04,169
I need your help.
I need you to find someone.

366
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,974
Why are you always so suspicious?

367
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,144
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

368
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,946
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

369
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,353
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

370
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,189
Who are you working for?

371
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,193
So, I'll have to find out the hard way?

372
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,363
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

373
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,699
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

374
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:39,304
Do you remember The Grand?
They gave me our old room.

375
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,821
Hold the door.
Thanks, Doctor.

376
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,581
Ma'am.

377
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,152
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Ms Adler.

378
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,922
That's precisely why I hired you.

379
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,526
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

380
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:35,527
He'd better.

381
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,930
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

382
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:43,168
- He's essential to my plan.
- Oi, get off out of it!

383
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,504
What are you doing?

384
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,706
Can't you see where you're going?
You scalp driver!

385
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,908
Get off out of it,
you walked straight into the carriage.

386
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,611
A little rifle range will go
a long way, sir.

387
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,380
Rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

388
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,619
God save the queen.
God save the queen, sir.

389
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:01,887
Get off out of it.

390
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,092
Look at you.

391
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,427
Why is the only woman
you've ever cared about...

392
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,929
a world-class criminal?

393
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,097
Are you a masochist?

394
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,299
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

395
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,602
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice!

396
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,406
- Made a proper idiot out of you.
- Right, you've had your fun.

397
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,975
- What's she after, anyway?
- It's time to press on.

398
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,045
- What could she possibly need?
- It doesn't matter.

399
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,382
An alibi? A beard?
A human canoe.

400
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,251
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

401
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,554
Well, that's of no consequence to you,
really, is it, Watson?

402
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,590
- We've done our last case together.
- I've already read it.

403
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:45,463
Missing person. Luke Reordan,
4'10", red hair, no front teeth.

404
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,498
Case solved!

405
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,135
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

406
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,169
Midget.

407
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,637
- So, you agree?
- No, I don't agree.

408
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,273
It's more than technicality, you see.

409
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,411
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

410
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,912
I've said too much,
I can tell I've upset you.

411
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,415
No, I am simply stating that one has--

412
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,251
- What were you doing?
- Will you allow me to explain?

413
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,285
I wish you would.

414
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,645
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

415
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,448
- Are you wearing a fals-....
- False nose? No.

416
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,617
- Tell me that that wasn't....
- That wasn't.

417
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,687
Holmes! Where are you going?

418
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,659
Watson!

419
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,229
Watson!

420
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,817
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.

421
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,653
Cut you a deal because
you're so pretty.

422
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,856
My lucky day.

423
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,226
Hello, gorgeous,
you got something for me?

424
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:26,998
Don't move!

425
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,771
Now, what have we got here?

426
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,210
Thank you.

427
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,047
That's the Irene I know.

428
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,569
This man intrigues me, Watson,
he's got Adler on edge.

429
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,670
Which is no mean feat.

430
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,473
She's intimidated.
She's scared of him.

431
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,008
Yet she works for him.

432
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,110
Right.

433
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,280
It's nothing to do with me
but I advise you leave the case alone.

434
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,949
Well, I may not have a choice?

435
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,653
After all, I may be paying the rent
my own soon, thanks to you.

436
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,688
Get that out of my face.

437
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,123
It's not in your face, it's in my hand.

438
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,858
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

439
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,960
- Mr Holmes?
- Clarkie!

440
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,362
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

441
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,464
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

442
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,467
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

443
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,504
- No, "you" means "you."
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.

444
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:18,176
He, well, it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

445
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,653
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

446
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,523
I pronounced the man dead myself.

447
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,993
What are the facts?

448
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,195
Groundskeeper claims he saw him
walking through the graveyard...

449
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,229
just this morning, sir.

450
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,799
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

451
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,401
I have an appointment with Mary.

452
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,204
It's not my reputation
that's at stake here.

453
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,238
Don't try that.

454
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,407
Have the newspapers
caught wind of it yet?

455
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,176
Well, that's what we're trying
to avoid, sir.

456
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,143
Certainly.

457
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,512
What's the major concern?

458
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,849
- Panic. Shear, bloody panic, sir.
- Indeed.

459
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,085
You're not taking this seriously,
are you, Holmes?

460
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,986
Yes, as you should.

461
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,990
It's a matter of professional integrity.

462
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,394
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

463
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,446
Who do you think
won the match, Clarkie?

464
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,448
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

465
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,253
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

466
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,591
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

467
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,098
- You took your time, Holmes.
- "And on the third day."

468
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,537
These slabs of sandstone are
half a ton each if they're a pound...

469
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,939
and they're smashed open
from the inside.

470
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,875
Lestrade. What of the coffin?

471
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,611
We are in the process
of bringing it up now.

472
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,478
I see.

473
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,082
Right.

474
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,551
At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

475
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,054
Anyhow, where's our witness?

476
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:11,789
He's over there.

477
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,725
And apparently, he is cata....

478
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,628
- Cat...
- Catatonic, sir.

479
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,398
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

480
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,170
Now, if you lot don't stop behaving
like a bunch of quivering milkmaids...

481
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,638
you're on double-time.

482
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,741
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up, now.

483
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,776
Good day, sir.

484
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,646
Hello.

485
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,448
It's all right.

486
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,284
I'm a doctor.

487
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:53,298
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

488
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,467
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

489
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,004
- Well?
- Well?

490
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,339
You pronounced him dead.

491
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,209
He had no pulse.

492
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,698
Good Lord.

493
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,001
That's not Blackwood.

494
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:35,373
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

495
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,012
Time of death?

496
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:48,019
Diptera is approximately...

497
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,589
two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

498
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,158
between 10 and 12 hours ago.

499
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,361
May I borrow your pen?

500
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,401
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

501
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,446
I know what I saw.

502
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,516
It was Blackwood.

503
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,419
As clear as I see you.

504
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,890
And when the dead walk...

505
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,061
the living will fill these coffins.

506
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,464
Well....

507
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,272
Right. Put the lid on it
and clean this lot up.

508
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,408
You really believe he was resurrected?

509
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:46,544
The question is not if, but how.
The game's afoot.

510
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,545
Follow your spirit.

511
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:52,250
And upon this charge, cry God
for Harry, England, and St George.

512
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,487
There you are.

513
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,724
Why that certain fish and chips store,
I don't understand.

514
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,793
Well, there's a particular beer
they use in their batter...

515
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,261
a Northern Stout, to be exact.

516
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,096
You know, Holmes...

517
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,999
I've seen things in war
I don't understand.

518
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,300
In India, I once met a man...

519
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,136
who predicted his own death
right down to the number...

520
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,439
and the placement of the bullets
that killed him.

521
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,407
You have to admit, Holmes...

522
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:22,280
that a supernatural explanation
to this case is theoretically possible.

523
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,652
Well, agreed but it's a huge mistake
to theorise before one has data.

524
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,455
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

525
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,023
instead of theories to suit facts.

526
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:35,760
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

527
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,632
Right. Scratches around the keyhole
where the watch was wound.

528
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,335
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

529
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,372
Every time he wound the watch his hand
would slip, hence the scratches.

530
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,006
Yes. Very good, Watson.

531
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,876
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

532
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,880
Let's see now, there are several sets
of initials scored--

533
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,615
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

534
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:02,120
Most recent of which are "MH." MH.
M H is for?

535
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,122
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

536
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,128
They should be able to give us
an address.

537
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,000
What a coincidence.

538
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,204
There's one thing you've failed
to deduce from the watch, Holmes.

539
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,707
- Really? I think not.
- The time.

540
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:27,345
I have to get back, Holmes.
I'm taking tea with the in-laws.

541
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,881
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

542
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,982
No, thank you, Ma'am.

543
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,183
You need to hear
what I have to tell you.

544
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,852
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

545
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,421
Even if it's to do with Mary?

546
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:49,200
I see two men, brothers.
Not in blood, but in bond.

547
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,105
What of Mary?

548
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:59,177
M for Mary, for marriage,
oh, you will be married.

549
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:04,048
- Go on.
- I see patterned table clothes...

550
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:09,253
and, oh, china figurines
and lace doilies.

551
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,024
- Doilies.
- Lace doilies? Holmes.

552
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:18,095
- Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.

553
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,365
Oh, she turns to fat
and, oh, she a beard and....

554
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,701
- What of the warts?
- Oh, she's covered in warts.

555
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,436
- Enough! Enough!
- Are they extensive?

556
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,804
Please, enough!

557
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,076
It's the most apt prediction Flora
has made in years.

558
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,246
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

559
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,781
Do you have my money?

560
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,217
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

561
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,285
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it. Admit it!

562
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,553
- Give me my money!
- Admit it!

563
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,421
Holmes.

564
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,291
I see.

565
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,632
Thank you.

566
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,769
Well, you've got your ring...

567
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,138
and I've got my address
for the ginger midget.

568
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,574
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

569
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,678
And I have some change in my pocket.

570
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,286
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

571
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,590
- Don't give it away here.
- No. I have to go see Mary.

572
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:21,626
Give her my best.

573
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,495
And her family, as well.

574
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,872
It does make a considerable difference
to me having someone...

575
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,641
with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.

576
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,177
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

577
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,716
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

578
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,917
Yes. Something did.

579
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,487
Irene Adler was here.

580
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,058
Either that or the ginger midget
wear the same Parisian perfume.

581
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,064
Putrefaction.

582
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:40,771
Ammonium sulphate,
among other aromas.

583
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,444
Phosphorous.

584
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,413
Formaldehyde.

585
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,760
It looks like...

586
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,964
he was attempting to combine...

587
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,234
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

588
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,243
More importantly...

589
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,413
let's see what he was trying
to dispose of.

590
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:27,318
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

591
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,821
It will suck the iron right out of
the ink as long as it's not too burnt.

592
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,937
Peculiar.

593
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,409
Hydrated rhododendron.

594
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,169
Holmes.

595
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,638
Look at the crest.

596
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,375
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

597
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,646
Of course he was.
The question is, to what end.

598
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,853
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

599
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,690
- How so?
- Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

600
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,460
Which is why Ms Adler
is so desperate to find him.

601
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,394
Yes.

602
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:47,231
There's one odour
I can't quite put my finger on.

603
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,900
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

604
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,637
- Maple syrup? Barley sugar.
- Toffee apple.

605
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,878
Let me guess.

606
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,380
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

607
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,418
you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

608
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,487
Just one minute, boys.

609
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,323
Oh, Dredger!

610
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
(Foreign language)

611
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,779
Meat or potatoes?

612
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,214
My 10 minutes are up.

613
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,050
- One moment, please.
- I'm in no hurry.

614
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,735
You all right?

615
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,225
One moment, please.

616
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:53,751
- Holmes. What is that?
- I don't know.

617
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,586
Come along, my brother.

618
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,581
Who sent you?

619
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,650
You know very well.

620
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:08,292
Strange that you should still be doing
a dead man's dirty work.

621
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,627
He's back from the dead.

622
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:14,431
Resurrected or not,
tell me where he is?

623
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:20,437
There are far greater things to fear
than you and your little toy.

624
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,981
Run little rabbit, run.

625
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,017
With pleasure.

626
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,691
Holmes.

627
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,648
Watson, what have you done?

628
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:30,761
I haven't slept all night.

629
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:32,796
Not a wink.

630
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:41,138
Why I ever believed that I would get
to have tea with Mary's parents...

631
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:44,441
is beyond me having been talked
into going with you.

632
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,976
We were set upon, man,
it was self-defence.

633
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,612
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits...

634
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,480
over the last seven months.

635
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,018
Would you like to know my conclusion?
I am psychologically disturbed.

636
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:55,986
How so?

637
00:55:55,986 --> 00:56:00,290
Why else would I continually be led
into situations...

638
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,328
where you deliberately
withhold your plans from me?

639
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:05,195
Why else?

640
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:09,233
You've never complained
about my methods before.

641
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:12,202
- I'm not complaining.
- You're not? What do you call this?

642
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,971
How am I complaining?
I never complain.

643
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,840
When do I complain about you practicing
the violin at 3 in the morning...

644
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,309
or your mess,
your general lack of hygiene...

645
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,311
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

646
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,312
We have a barter system.

647
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,881
When do I complain about
you setting fire to my rooms?

648
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,149
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

649
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,986
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

650
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,354
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

651
00:56:30,354 --> 00:56:32,022
Gladstone is our dog.

652
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:37,027
What I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

653
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,503
- I understand.
- Do you?

654
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,337
I do.

655
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:51,041
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

656
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,044
- Yes.
- You're feeling a bit sensitive.

657
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,379
I'm not sensitive.

658
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,713
What you need is a rest.

659
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,417
My brother Mycroft has a small estate
near Chichester.

660
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,386
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.

661
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,422
- We can throw a lamb on the spit.
- We?

662
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,759
Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

663
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,960
Well, certainly, if we must,
we can have her along.

664
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,196
No, not you. Mary and I.
You are not--

665
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,364
What, invited?

666
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,967
Why would I not be invited
to my own brother's country home?

667
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,468
Watson, now you're not making
any sense.

668
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,936
You're not human.

669
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,240
- John Watson?
- Yes.

670
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,776
Your bail has been posted.

671
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:32,649
Mary.

672
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:37,754
Just Watson.

673
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,933
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

674
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,505
Step lively.

675
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,478
Back off. Back off.

676
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:05,015
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

677
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,520
Right, you, you're out.

678
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,424
- Until next time, Big Joe.
- Always a pleasure, Mr Holmes.

679
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,995
Thank heaven you're here, Lestrade,
I'd almost ran out of jokes.

680
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,098
You know, in another life
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

681
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,666
Yes, and you, sir, an excellent
policeman.

682
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,800
Tomski, thank you.

683
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:30,307
- Now, please tell me you have answers.
- All in good time, Lestrade.

684
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,441
All in good time?

685
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,009
What is this some parlour game
where we have to guess...

686
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,144
what you're thinking?

687
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,012
I've got a public in frenzy out there.

688
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,714
Now, if you don't fill me in
I'll have you in there...

689
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:40,050
playing Victoria and Albert quicker
than a bookie's runner.

690
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,620
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

691
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,657
- For whom?
- Friends in high places.

692
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,393
They're the ones who bailed you out.

693
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,306
I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience
you, sir...

694
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,976
but I'm gonna have
to put this on you.

695
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,917
Mr Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

696
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,155
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

697
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,592
As to where I am,
I was admittedly lost for a moment...

698
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,594
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

699
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:28,031
But I was saved
by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...

700
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:33,036
the only baker to use a certain French
glaze on their loaves, a Brittany sage.

701
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,438
After that, the carriage forked left...

702
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:37,707
then right a telltale bump
over the Fleet conduit.

703
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:38,909
And as to who you are...

704
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,245
that took every ounce of my
not inconsiderable experience.

705
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,848
The letters on your desk
are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

706
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,218
Lord Chief Justice,
that would be your official title.

707
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:52,556
Who you really are
is, of course, another matter entirely.

708
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,759
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring,
you're also the secret head...

709
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,062
of the Temple of the Four Orders
in whose headquarters we now sit...

710
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,965
on the northwest corner
of St James Square, I think.

711
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:05,268
As to the mystery, the only mystery
is why you bothered...

712
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,703
to blindfold me at all.

713
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,210
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

714
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,814
I dare say we have
the right man, gentlemen.

715
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,617
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

716
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,219
and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary.

717
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:27,791
I suppose you already have some
notion as to the practices of our order.

718
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,658
Yes.

719
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,796
They're practically interesting.

720
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:35,065
Be as sceptical as you like
but our secret systems...

721
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:37,801
have steered the world towards
the greater good for centuries.

722
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,271
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

723
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,508
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

724
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:48,245
We know you don't believe in magic,
Mr Holmes.

725
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:52,415
We don't expect you to share
our faith merely our fears.

726
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,284
Fear is the more infectious condition.

727
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,453
In this instance...

728
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,157
fear of your own child.

729
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,929
Blackwood is your son.

730
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:10,133
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

731
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,202
with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

732
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,371
together with identical outer
ears or pinna...

733
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,339
which are only passed
down through direct bloodline...

734
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:20,010
which makes you by necessity
either brothers or, in this case...

735
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,678
more likely, father and son.

736
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:29,219
Very few people are privy
to that information...

737
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,788
and we want to keep it that way.

738
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,962
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

739
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,063
His mother wasn't my wife...

740
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,999
but she shared our beliefs.

741
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,467
She was a powerful practitioner...

742
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,138
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

743
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,208
Death followed him wherever he went.

744
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,811
Those five girls
were not the first to be butchered.

745
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,847
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

746
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:01,251
No one could prove anything, of course,
but we all knew.

747
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,054
The boy was a curse.

748
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,524
We've done our best to stop him
ourselves but it's not enough.

749
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:08,825
His power grows daily.

750
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,895
His resurrection is evidence of that.

751
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,830
But what he does next
will be far more dangerous.

752
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:18,234
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

753
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,405
He's gonna raise a force that
will alter the very course of the world.

754
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,708
We want you to find him and stop him
before he does.

755
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,078
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

756
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,850
As Home Secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

757
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:34,784
Yes.

758
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:37,887
So...

759
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,224
name your price.

760
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:44,094
Well, the great benefit
of being a consulting detective...

761
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,363
is that I can pick
and choose my clients.

762
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,965
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

763
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:51,534
But not for you.

764
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:53,970
And certainly not for a price.

765
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:01,711
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

766
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,980
If the rest of his family's dead...

767
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,448
how long do you expect to survive?

768
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,084
Food for thought.

769
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,478
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

770
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,616
Margaux '58.
A comet vintage.

771
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:44,421
How fascinating that an astronomical
event can affect the quality.

772
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,090
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

773
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:48,692
Of the wine.

774
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,029
I've hit a dead end, literally.

775
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,432
I found your man.

776
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:57,534
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

777
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,336
If you still need him.

778
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,673
Oh, dear.

779
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,145
Hope my client doesn't come looking
for a refund.

780
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,448
He's a professor, isn't he?

781
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,818
Couldn't see his face but I spotted
a bit of chalk on his lapel.

782
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:17,120
I've never known
a professor to carry a gun...

783
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,822
and on such a clever contraption.

784
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:25,328
Eye patch, nice touch.

785
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:31,568
So case closed
which makes this a social visit.

786
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:35,171
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

787
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,240
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

788
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,243
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

789
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,413
Let it breathe.

790
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:49,018
- I've never been in over my head.
- Leave now. Disappear.

791
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,019
You're good at that.

792
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:54,157
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

793
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:00,730
If I'm in danger, so are you.

794
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,069
Come with me.

795
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,874
What if we trusted each other?

796
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,377
You're not listening.

797
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:18,448
I'm taking you to either the railway
station or the police station.

798
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:31,561
So...

799
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,733
which is it to be?

800
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:40,069
- Careful.
- You decide.

801
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,472
- Which will it be?
- What--

802
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:45,809
I told you to let it breathe.

803
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:48,044
Can you taste the comet?

804
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:57,453
Why couldn't you
just come away with me?

805
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,454
Never.

806
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:52,402
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

807
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,405
But beneath this pillow lies
the key to my release.

808
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,708
Of course, she misinterpreted
my intention entirely.

809
01:07:58,708 --> 01:07:59,842
Naturally, sir.

810
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,378
That's why I find this modern religious
fervour so troubling.

811
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,280
There's no latitude
for misunderstanding.

812
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,115
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.
- Indeed.

813
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:09,052
And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

814
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,520
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

815
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:15,892
Anyhow, it's a good thing
she was offended, sir...

816
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,694
or we may never have found you.

817
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:19,529
The inspector's been over
to Baker Street himself...

818
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,630
this morning, sir.

819
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,636
Just joking about the wife, sir.

820
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:33,142
We've checked everything, sir.

821
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:36,412
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

822
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:40,249
So body in the bathtub,
his eyes were wide open...

823
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:45,755
and the only thing missing
was his ring, sir.

824
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,108
- Why did you drain the water?
- Out of common decency.

825
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,276
Crime is common, logic is rare.

826
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:09,579
The decent thing to do
is to catch the killer...

827
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,280
not provide comfort for the corpse.

828
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,764
What is that?

829
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,769
Jasmine bath salts, sir.

830
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:35,872
Superb. Probably comes
from a larger container.

831
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:39,142
It will either be in the pantry
high up where it's warm and dry...

832
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,511
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

833
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,781
And constable, you could do worse
than to check the ground...

834
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,350
under the rear windows for
any signs of footprints not your own.

835
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,353
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

836
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,446
Mr Holmes?

837
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:03,126
- Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
- It was in a pantry, sir.

838
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:09,098
I don't know what to make of this.
Excellent work. Adieu.

839
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:51,574
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

840
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:53,943
Sir Thomas is dead.

841
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:59,148
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the Order.

842
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:03,452
Have you lost your mind?

843
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,355
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

844
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,690
Of course, he does.

845
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,294
That's why we're here.

846
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,997
That's why we're all here.

847
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,106
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

848
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,711
A magnificent, but simple purpose.

849
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,948
To create a new future.

850
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:37,987
A future ruled by us.

851
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,292
Tomorrow at noon,
we take the first step...

852
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,027
towards a new chapter in our history.

853
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,065
Magic will lead the way.

854
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:50,032
Once the people of England see...

855
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,702
our newfound power
they'll bow down in fear.

856
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:01,844
Across the Atlantic lies a colony
that was once ours.

857
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,713
It will be again.

858
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,182
The civil war has made them weak.

859
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:12,255
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

860
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,556
so we'll take it back.

861
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,493
We will remake the world...

862
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:21,230
create the future.

863
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:29,505
These men are with me, Standish
but are you?

864
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,409
No, sir. I am not.

865
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:39,682
These powers that you're playing
with no man can control.

866
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,119
Well, gentlemen...

867
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,291
someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

868
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,428
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

869
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,035
Save me!

870
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:18,888
Gentlemen, don't be afraid.

871
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:21,924
As you can see...

872
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:24,927
we are protected.

873
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,931
Come, drink your allegiance here.

874
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,808
You control the police, now use them.

875
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,955
I didn't know you were here.

876
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:56,325
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilise it?

877
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:58,427
Be my guest.

878
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,931
In here, chaps.

879
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:04,133
- Where'd you like me to put him, sir?
- Anywhere's fine.

880
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,512
Who is he?

881
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,115
He's the man who tried to kill you
at Reordan's lodgings.

882
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:21,650
I suppose his neck didn't survive
the impact of Dredger landing on him.

883
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,185
Yes.

884
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,721
Thanks for that, by the way.

885
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,859
But there is some consolation
in the knowledge...

886
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,027
that he could still be of service
to his fellow man.

887
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,503
Elbows and arms stained with blood
but it's older than his own injuries.

888
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,711
None of it human.

889
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:51,914
He's not a butcher, let me see.

890
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:06,095
Yellow flame, green bursts.
An industrial worker.

891
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,102
Coal. River silt.

892
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,272
And the slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in--

893
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:17,406
Nine Elms.

894
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,208
Sorry, what?

895
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,744
The area you're looking
for is Nine Elms.

896
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:22,611
I wondered.

897
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,413
Do you remember where I put...

898
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,282
the Lords Register
of members' interests?

899
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,284
It's on the step ladder.

900
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,363
Well, Blackwood's had his hand
in just about everything...

901
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,798
that's corrosive to the spirit.

902
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,136
"Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works."

903
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:49,572
It will probably be a factory
by the river.

904
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:50,406
What's that?

905
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:52,608
Never mind.

906
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,412
You don't know
where my rugby ball went, do you?

907
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:58,214
No, not a clue.

908
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:02,651
"Queenshithe Slaughterhouse."
Nine Elms.

909
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,455
A factory by the river.
Well done, Watson.

910
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,291
That should lead us right to Blackwood,
dead or alive.

911
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,259
Not us.

912
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:15,097
- You.
- Yes.

913
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,968
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

914
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,613
He's left it there on purpose.

915
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,801
More coal, Doctor!

916
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,042
That's a good one.
Oh, God. Yeah.

917
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,013
Glad to see you two
are working hard, then.

918
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,049
Well, and I thought we were trying
to be discreet.

919
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,352
You would not last one day in the navy.

920
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,857
Holmes, are you sure
there isn't an alternative...

921
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,192
means of water transportation
than that?

922
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,029
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

923
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,533
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

924
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,969
Oh, you found a sense of humour,
Doctor.

925
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:28,504
If only just a sense.

926
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,641
I better take over there.
Bit tricky down here.

927
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,031
Come on, come on.

928
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,716
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

929
01:19:13,716 --> 01:19:15,618
All that's missing
is a ginger midget.

930
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,433
They cleared something away
from here, not minutes ago.

931
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,301
Like what?

932
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,571
Not sure. Something mechanical.

933
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:37,706
Holmes.

934
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,775
Look at this.

935
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:07,936
1:18. Chapter and verse.
Revelations 1:18.

936
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,572
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

937
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,642
And behold, I'm alive forevermore.

938
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,847
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

939
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,617
beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

940
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:27,756
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

941
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:32,628
Tomorrow at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

942
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,963
Show me your face and it will be
the end of your world right now.

943
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:38,967
- Save your bullets, Watson.
- A gift for you.

944
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:45,641
What was that about saving bullets?

945
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,550
She followed you here, Holmes.

946
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,288
You led your lamb to slaughter.

947
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:03,859
Holmes.

948
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:07,396
This game was designed to hurt.

949
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:20,342
Watson!

950
01:21:24,747 --> 01:21:26,415
It's warm in here, Watson.

951
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:34,990
In over your head yet, darling?

952
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:44,666
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

953
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:45,868
Let me take your weight.

954
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,771
Give us a leg up, old boy.

955
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,909
These German locks
always give me trouble.

956
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,415
It's a bandsaw.

957
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:05,854
No matter, we have plenty of time.

958
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,024
Holmes.

959
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,901
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

960
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,778
Holmes, hurry up.

961
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,955
Don't get excited.
Turn off that valve.

962
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:08,684
And we'll bounce in three, two one.

963
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,632
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

964
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:37,679
- Thank you.
- We should help the doctor.

965
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,859
Holmes!

966
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:27,723
Mr Holmes.

967
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,228
Mr Holmes.

968
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:45,307
Mr Holmes,
we have an order for your arrest, sir.

969
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,513
Sir!

970
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:54,416
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

971
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,622
Watson's alive.
Just get out of here, sir, go, sir, go.

972
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:21,676
- Will the train be departing on time?
- The train's been delayed, madam.

973
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,211
Shouldn't be long now though.

974
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,731
The train will depart
when I tell it to.

975
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,237
And you will leave my employment
when I gave you permission.

976
01:26:53,075 --> 01:26:56,978
I fulfilled my contract.
I found Reordan.

977
01:26:56,978 --> 01:27:01,516
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
So that's me, finished.

978
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,486
Your job was to manipulate
Holmes's feelings for you.

979
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,822
Not succumb to them.

980
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:12,094
You have fulfilled nothing.

981
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:15,163
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

982
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:20,435
Finish the job, or the next dead body
will be Sherlock Holmes.

983
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:50,031
The surgeon should be along shortly.

984
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,438
He should be able to rest now.

985
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:01,610
Excuse me.

986
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,984
- Is that the best you can do?
- Yes, for now.

987
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:11,753
I must attend to my other patients.

988
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:14,556
Doctor.

989
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,758
Doctor.

990
01:28:17,826 --> 01:28:18,927
Please.

991
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:25,634
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

992
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:29,271
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

993
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,008
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

994
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:41,683
Solve this.

995
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,586
Whatever it takes.

996
01:28:55,597 --> 01:28:58,200
"This is beyond your control."

997
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,367
Bloody panic, sir.

998
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:02,270
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.

999
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:06,508
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you, leave the case alone.

1000
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,676
Solve this.

1001
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,146
Accept that this was
beyond your control.

1002
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:13,848
- At midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public frenzy out there.

1003
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,050
Holmes!

1004
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,708
Widen your gaze.

1005
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,209
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1006
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,144
You and I are bound together
on a journey that will twist...

1007
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:44,846
the very fabric of nature.

1008
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,149
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1009
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,385
He's gonna raise a force that
will alter the very course of the world.

1010
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,255
- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.

1011
01:29:53,255 --> 01:29:55,824
- I need you.
- His secret lies in the book of spells.

1012
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:26,554
Three more will die.

1013
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,724
And there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1014
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,128
We know you don't believe in magic.

1015
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:38,066
- Reordan was working with Blackwood.
- Is that better?

1016
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:39,901
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1017
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:45,407
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1018
01:30:52,414 --> 01:30:53,648
Give up, Holmes.

1019
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:58,553
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1020
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:06,394
Good morning.

1021
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:12,634
Now, you need to work.

1022
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:15,403
Familiar artwork.

1023
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,774
You look gorgeous.

1024
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,612
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1025
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:36,758
- You made the front page.
- Only a name and no picture.

1026
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:42,030
So it looks like you'll be needing
to work outside the law now...

1027
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,432
and that's my area of expertise.

1028
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:45,667
I feel safer already.

1029
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,772
You seem to be making
a rapid recovery.

1030
01:31:52,307 --> 01:31:53,375
Yes.

1031
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:55,977
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1032
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,147
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1033
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:09,724
Well, I'm just so very glad
that you're...

1034
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:12,727
Well, with us.

1035
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:21,336
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1036
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,807
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1037
01:32:25,807 --> 01:32:27,675
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1038
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,544
he suggested I widen my gaze.

1039
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,046
And, at minimum,
I have done just that.

1040
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:34,983
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years...

1041
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,218
of theological disparity.

1042
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,022
But that's for another time.

1043
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:44,225
Blackwood's method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system...

1044
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,395
that's been employed by the Temple
of the Four Orders for centuries.

1045
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:50,932
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1046
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:54,402
I re-enacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1047
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,671
with a few enhancements of my own.

1048
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:00,175
My journey took me somewhat
further down the rabbit hole...

1049
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:04,012
than I had intended and, though
I dirtied my fluffy white tail...

1050
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:06,381
I have emerged enlightened.

1051
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,385
The fraternity
who silently control the Empire...

1052
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:13,555
share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs, and emperors of old...

1053
01:33:13,555 --> 01:33:16,524
that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1054
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,860
a gateway to immeasurable power.

1055
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,396
It's made up of four parts,
the foot of a lion...

1056
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:24,132
the tail of an ox,
the wings of an eagle...

1057
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:25,233
and the head of a man.

1058
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:28,937
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1059
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,540
the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and the hair of a man.

1060
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,475
Map.

1061
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:40,415
The points of the star represent
the five murdered girls...

1062
01:33:40,415 --> 01:33:42,283
but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1063
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:47,589
It's a widely held belief
that within the architecture...

1064
01:33:47,589 --> 01:33:50,725
of the great cities are coded
references to this system.

1065
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:54,395
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men.

1066
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,164
Each murder was committed
at a location...

1067
01:33:56,164 --> 01:33:59,567
that has a direct connection with
the Temple, therefore the system.

1068
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,838
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1069
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,240
We found his body here.

1070
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:09,844
Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple,
wore the ox ring.

1071
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:11,946
He died here.

1072
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:15,817
Standish, the Ambassador
to America where the eagle...

1073
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:18,186
has been the national emblem
for over 100 years.

1074
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:23,424
The headquarters of the Temple of
the Four Orders where he died is here.

1075
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:29,163
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1076
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:34,602
So we have man, the ox, eagle.
Only the lion remaining.

1077
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:35,470
Right here.

1078
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:38,873
Parliament.

1079
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:44,812
Right.

1080
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,284
You four stay here.
And the rest of you come with me.

1081
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:51,653
- Get out of our way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1082
01:34:55,557 --> 01:34:56,691
Ladies first.

1083
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,729
- Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you--

1084
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:02,664
Go.

1085
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:07,835
Hello, hello, hello.

1086
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,705
Did the devil turn up?

1087
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:18,046
Well, never mind,
you got the next best thing.

1088
01:35:41,703 --> 01:35:45,840
Beg your pardon, my Lord,
I know that it's unorthodox.

1089
01:35:47,008 --> 01:35:51,779
But Mr Holmes here, he's been making
some serious accusations about you...

1090
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:54,716
and the Order.

1091
01:35:57,385 --> 01:35:58,853
I see.

1092
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:01,522
Well, at least that solves
the great mystery...

1093
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,924
as to how you became inspector.

1094
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:09,030
Excuse me, my Lord...

1095
01:36:10,732 --> 01:36:12,867
but I've been wanting to do
that for a long time.

1096
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:17,572
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement.

1097
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:20,475
So why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1098
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:26,648
- Thank you, Lestrade.
- My Lord.

1099
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:34,922
I'm curious, Coward.

1100
01:36:34,922 --> 01:36:36,758
Did you assist Blackwood
in all the murders...

1101
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:38,326
or just the one I prevented?

1102
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,896
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1103
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:48,770
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1104
01:36:50,438 --> 01:36:53,341
Nonetheless, I confess
to being completely outmatched.

1105
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,778
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1106
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:00,348
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1107
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:02,150
than a case
where everything goes against you.

1108
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:06,754
How many members of parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1109
01:37:07,689 --> 01:37:09,524
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1110
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:12,326
The lion is parliament, isn't it?

1111
01:37:14,796 --> 01:37:15,830
Very clever.

1112
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,633
But it's not murder, Mr Holmes.

1113
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:20,702
It's mercy.

1114
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:24,272
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1115
01:37:24,272 --> 01:37:26,307
Don't you see that it's for their own--

1116
01:37:29,444 --> 01:37:32,346
No. But I don't care
much what you think.

1117
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:35,450
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's final ceremony...

1118
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,884
and now you've given it to me.

1119
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:38,052
I've told you nothing.

1120
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:42,156
But your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope.

1121
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:45,626
The mud smeared on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1122
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:49,130
A touch of red brick dust on your knee,
from where you've been kneeling.

1123
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,867
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1124
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:57,004
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1125
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:02,143
You and Blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony...

1126
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:04,912
in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1127
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,483
Both houses meet today.

1128
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,385
The whole government will be present.

1129
01:38:20,928 --> 01:38:23,564
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1130
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:26,567
You would have made a valuable ally.

1131
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:38,346
How terrible is wisdom
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1132
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:41,415
We take power at noon.

1133
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:45,019
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1134
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,815
I told you he'd be coming out
the top window, soldier boy.

1135
01:39:13,815 --> 01:39:16,150
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1136
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:19,387
Well, technically that isn't
the top window, is it, sailor boy?

1137
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:22,089
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1138
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:23,057
Anyway.

1139
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:27,562
You'll be pleased to know that
Lestrade performed his role perfectly.

1140
01:39:27,562 --> 01:39:29,163
In fact, I think he rather enjoyed it.

1141
01:39:29,163 --> 01:39:31,465
I hope you know
what you're doing, Holmes.

1142
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,567
Here's the key.

1143
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,002
You got all you needed from Coward?

1144
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,271
Yes, I smoked him out
with relative ease.

1145
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:39,607
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1146
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:42,343
If you would, captain,
take us under the bridge...

1147
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,011
port side, approximately 100 yards.

1148
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:47,348
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1149
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:48,583
Right away, sir.

1150
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:57,124
The end is nigh.

1151
01:39:57,859 --> 01:40:02,363
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1152
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:06,367
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1153
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,579
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1154
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:54,048
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1155
01:40:54,682 --> 01:40:55,850
The first of its kind.

1156
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:59,153
- You deduced that how?
- From my pocket.

1157
01:40:59,854 --> 01:41:03,024
I snipped this off a rather recumbent
rat at the slaughterhouse.

1158
01:41:03,024 --> 01:41:06,227
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1159
01:41:06,227 --> 01:41:08,996
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1160
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,536
Now we know what
the ginger midget was working on.

1161
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,605
It will revolutionise warfare.

1162
01:41:17,605 --> 01:41:19,240
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1163
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,742
Now it's seven minutes to noon,
what are we gonna do?

1164
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,513
Right. How many men
did you count on--

1165
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:30,584
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1166
01:42:01,816 --> 01:42:02,783
Woman.

1167
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:06,487
Shoot him. Now, please.

1168
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:22,503
My Lords. Me Lords. Me Lords.

1169
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:27,842
The time has come for
only those who believe to remain.

1170
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,113
Behold Lord Blackwood.

1171
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:47,795
You seem surprised.

1172
01:42:50,331 --> 01:42:53,768
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfil England's destiny...

1173
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,838
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1174
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:03,277
Listen to the rabble outside.

1175
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:06,814
Listen to the fear.

1176
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:13,020
I will use that as a weapon
to control them and then the world.

1177
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,827
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1178
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:26,333
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1179
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:32,039
These components appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1180
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,874
Electromagnetic waves?

1181
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:36,343
When triggered,
the electrodes will send a charge...

1182
01:43:36,343 --> 01:43:38,245
converting the chemical into gas.

1183
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:40,247
The gas will travel up that shaft...

1184
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,083
and filter through
the ventilation system...

1185
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:43,717
that leads directly to parliament.

1186
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,386
Within seconds of its administration...

1187
01:43:45,386 --> 01:43:48,389
the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.

1188
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:49,924
Blackwood must have
some kind of transmitter...

1189
01:43:49,924 --> 01:43:51,559
that he can activate remotely.

1190
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,360
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1191
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:57,898
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1192
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:01,402
indestructible and eternal.

1193
01:44:02,269 --> 01:44:04,171
Move it. Move it.

1194
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:07,408
We don't actually have
to disarm the device...

1195
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:11,011
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1196
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,681
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1197
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:17,351
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1198
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:19,120
We'll need a container
to direct the blast.

1199
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:21,088
My clay pipe should service
that ambition.

1200
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:41,075
Did you miss me?

1201
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:44,245
I rather wish
you hadn't done that, Irene.

1202
01:44:50,718 --> 01:44:54,622
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1203
01:44:56,257 --> 01:44:59,727
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1204
01:45:00,728 --> 01:45:03,264
All others will perish.

1205
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:11,839
I need your pipe.

1206
01:45:15,743 --> 01:45:16,777
Nut him.

1207
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,471
- Right. What?
- Coat.

1208
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:45,439
Got it.

1209
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:27,982
The New Order begins now.

1210
01:46:34,355 --> 01:46:37,191
- Woman!
- What are you waiting for?

1211
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,362
That.

1212
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,175
Apprehend Coward!

1213
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:59,280
- Can you manage?
- Of course I can.

1214
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:28,876
Relax. I'm a doctor.

1215
01:48:40,948 --> 01:48:42,649
Did you take
a wrong turning somewhere?

1216
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:46,520
We're safe now.

1217
01:48:47,621 --> 01:48:48,989
Interesting assessment.

1218
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:52,493
Run off.

1219
01:48:55,329 --> 01:48:56,663
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1220
01:48:58,665 --> 01:48:59,733
Fare thee well.

1221
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:07,674
I don't want to run anymore.

1222
01:49:10,577 --> 01:49:13,380
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1223
01:49:30,597 --> 01:49:31,532
No!

1224
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,772
There was never any magic.

1225
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,576
Only conjuring tricks.

1226
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:56,250
The simplest involves
paying people off.

1227
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:59,786
Like the prison guard who pretended
to be obsessed outside your cell.

1228
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:02,189
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1229
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,659
Others required
more elaborate preparations.

1230
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:10,497
Like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1231
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:11,965
You had it broken before your burial...

1232
01:51:11,965 --> 01:51:14,501
and then put back together
using a mild adhesive.

1233
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:18,038
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.

1234
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,007
A mixture of egg and honey...

1235
01:51:21,475 --> 01:51:23,610
besides, it'd be washed away
by the rain.

1236
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:29,516
Holmes!

1237
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:32,286
Arranging for your father to drown
in his own bathtub...

1238
01:51:32,286 --> 01:51:34,955
required more modern science.

1239
01:51:34,955 --> 01:51:38,959
Very clever of Reordan to find
a paralytic that was activated...

1240
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:41,228
by the combination of copper
and water.

1241
01:51:41,228 --> 01:51:44,998
And was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1242
01:51:45,732 --> 01:51:47,401
It might have been quite
a challenge for me...

1243
01:51:47,401 --> 01:51:51,071
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibian.

1244
01:51:56,043 --> 01:51:58,412
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1245
01:51:58,412 --> 01:52:02,516
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1246
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,653
An odourless, tasteless,
flammable liquid...

1247
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:08,889
gives it a burn
with an unusual pink issue.

1248
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:13,827
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1249
01:52:15,596 --> 01:52:17,064
All it took was a spark.

1250
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:23,370
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1251
01:52:25,072 --> 01:52:26,506
Ingenious.

1252
01:52:26,506 --> 01:52:30,510
Like all great performers, you saved
your piÃƒÂ¨ce de resistance for the end.

1253
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:33,113
A chemical weapon
distilled from cyanide...

1254
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:35,282
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1255
01:52:35,282 --> 01:52:37,517
Had it worked,
your followers in Parliament...

1256
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:39,419
would have watched unharmed...

1257
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:42,022
as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1258
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:44,925
They didn't know that
you had given them the antidote.

1259
01:52:44,925 --> 01:52:47,294
Instead they would have believed
it was magic...

1260
01:52:47,294 --> 01:52:50,364
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1261
01:52:50,364 --> 01:52:52,099
And the world would have followed.

1262
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,534
Fear being the most powerful weapon
of all.

1263
01:52:55,902 --> 01:52:58,972
You'd better hope that
it's nothing more than superstition...

1264
01:52:58,972 --> 01:53:01,241
as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1265
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:04,077
The devil's due a soul, I'd say.

1266
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:08,715
For God's sake, Holmes Cut me loose!

1267
01:53:19,426 --> 01:53:22,396
First, the world will see you
for what you are.

1268
01:53:22,396 --> 01:53:23,230
A fraud.

1269
01:53:24,431 --> 01:53:27,067
Then you will be hanged
properly this time.

1270
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:30,103
It's a long journey
from here to the rope.

1271
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:24,124
I've never woken up
in handcuffs before.

1272
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:26,159
I have.

1273
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:29,029
Naked.

1274
01:54:33,633 --> 01:54:38,805
- A storm is coming.
- Well, we've still got a moment.

1275
01:54:43,677 --> 01:54:45,846
- Moriarty...
- What?

1276
01:54:46,747 --> 01:54:47,914
That's his name.

1277
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:50,584
And he is a professor.

1278
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,055
Everyone has a weak spot.

1279
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:57,491
And he found mine.

1280
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,361
Where was it, precisely?

1281
01:55:12,706 --> 01:55:14,541
Please don't underestimate him.

1282
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:17,611
He's just as brilliant as you are.

1283
01:55:18,612 --> 01:55:21,114
And infinitely more in devious.

1284
01:55:21,114 --> 01:55:22,382
We'll see about that.

1285
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,268
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1286
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:47,073
Sadly, yes.

1287
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:18,338
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1288
01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:20,674
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1289
01:56:20,674 --> 01:56:22,742
- Scribbles.
- Scribbles?

1290
01:56:22,742 --> 01:56:24,978
- Notes.
- They're your adventures?

1291
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:26,313
I'd like to read them.

1292
01:56:32,853 --> 01:56:34,421
Hold on. What's wrong?

1293
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:37,123
Think he's finally come to terms
with you leaving?

1294
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:39,593
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1295
01:56:41,127 --> 01:56:43,463
Now, five minutes here,
and we'll go home.

1296
01:56:43,463 --> 01:56:46,299
- Our home.
- Get up those stairs.

1297
01:56:54,641 --> 01:56:55,475
Don't worry, dear.

1298
01:56:56,343 --> 01:56:58,511
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1299
01:56:58,511 --> 01:57:00,513
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1300
01:57:01,615 --> 01:57:02,716
Holmes!

1301
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:06,953
Good afternoon.

1302
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:08,688
I was trying to deduce
the manner...

1303
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:11,491
in which Blackwood survived
his execution.

1304
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:12,859
Clearing our good names as well.

1305
01:57:13,793 --> 01:57:15,996
But it had
a surprising soporific effect on me...

1306
01:57:15,996 --> 01:57:18,698
and I was carried off
in the arms of Morpheus.

1307
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:21,868
Like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.

1308
01:57:21,868 --> 01:57:23,169
Get on with it, Holmes.

1309
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:26,573
Cleverly concealed
in the hangman's knot was a hook.

1310
01:57:27,641 --> 01:57:29,309
Oh, dear,
I think my legs have fallen asleep.

1311
01:57:29,309 --> 01:57:30,677
I should probably come down.

1312
01:57:30,677 --> 01:57:31,978
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1313
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,248
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1314
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:36,182
Carry on.

1315
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:40,921
Well, the executioner attached it to
a harness thus allowing the weight...

1316
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:44,724
to be distributed around the waist
and the neck to remain intact.

1317
01:57:45,325 --> 01:57:48,828
Oh, my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1318
01:57:48,828 --> 01:57:50,530
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1319
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:54,601
I have managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1320
01:57:55,769 --> 01:57:58,338
Please, Watson, my tongue is going
and I'll be no use to you at all.

1321
01:57:58,338 --> 01:58:00,073
- Worse things could happened.
- John.

1322
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:06,012
None of this
explains Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1323
01:58:06,012 --> 01:58:07,247
Right.

1324
01:58:07,847 --> 01:58:09,916
Now, the medical mystery.

1325
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:12,352
We must restore your reputation,
Watson.

1326
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:17,290
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1327
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:19,526
It is quite infamous
in the region of Turkey...

1328
01:58:19,526 --> 01:58:20,961
bordering the Black Sea
for its ability...

1329
01:58:20,961 --> 01:58:23,229
to induce an apparently
mortal paralysis.

1330
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,066
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as tenacious...

1331
01:58:26,066 --> 01:58:27,567
and well-trained as your own.

1332
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:30,203
- It's known locally as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1333
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:31,471
Mad honey disease.

1334
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:35,241
He's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1335
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:37,210
He doesn't mind.

1336
01:58:40,146 --> 01:58:42,615
Mary, don't worry.
He's seen far worse.

1337
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:44,384
Mr Holmes?

1338
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:48,888
Doctor, Ms Mary...

1339
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:51,291
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me right away.

1340
01:58:52,592 --> 01:58:55,895
- What is it this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1341
01:58:55,895 --> 01:58:58,932
He went missing in the sewers
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1342
01:58:58,932 --> 01:59:01,968
I'm afraid sewage workers found
his body just this morning, sir.

1343
01:59:03,003 --> 01:59:05,772
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1344
01:59:06,406 --> 01:59:07,841
Can I help you, sir?

1345
01:59:08,775 --> 01:59:09,943
Shot in the head.

1346
01:59:11,578 --> 01:59:14,447
- Was it a small calibre bullet?
- Yes.

1347
01:59:17,117 --> 01:59:18,685
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1348
01:59:19,419 --> 01:59:20,353
Indeed, sir.

1349
01:59:23,323 --> 01:59:25,925
- Point blank range.
- Moriarty.

1350
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,129
Prof Moriarty.

1351
01:59:32,098 --> 01:59:35,702
There's a good boy!
Everything's gonna be fine.

1352
01:59:37,037 --> 01:59:40,040
- Where is Blackwood's device now?
- Secret Service have it, sir.

1353
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,341
They've taken over the case.

1354
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:44,110
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1355
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:48,882
So Moriarty was after a piece
of the machine.

1356
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:51,184
Not the poison.

1357
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:54,020
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1358
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:56,956
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1359
01:59:56,956 --> 01:59:58,892
And Adler was just a diversion.

1360
01:59:58,892 --> 02:00:02,495
He knew I'd chase after her thereby
leaving the machine accessible.

1361
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:06,466
The technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1362
02:00:06,466 --> 02:00:08,501
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1363
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:11,304
simply by sending a command
by radio waves.

1364
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:14,574
It's the future, Watson.

1365
02:00:17,644 --> 02:00:19,579
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1366
02:00:23,316 --> 02:00:24,751
- Well...
- Well.

1367
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:26,886
Gladstone!

1368
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,688
Stop him before he gets
to the front door.

1369
02:00:29,756 --> 02:00:30,590
Clarkie?

1370
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:34,527
Case reopened.
