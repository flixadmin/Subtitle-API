ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:03,264
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,874
Are you okay?

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,834
Come on. It's dangerous.

5
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,224
Why?

6
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,184
Wanna kill him?

7
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,644
He's doing what he's told.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,437
Over there. Now.

9
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,304
You're Lee Eun-yu?

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,306
How do you know that?

11
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,058
They're all gone because of you.

12
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,103
Harmless as they were.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,230
Wait...

14
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,409
Don't.

15
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,035
Let it go.

16
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,620
We're going now.

17
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,778
Sir.

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,913
Won't be long
before the monsters are here.

19
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,915
Sound the alarm inside.

20
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,998
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,250
What about her?

22
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,377
Help her walk.

23
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,174
Quarantine her.

24
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,883
Understood, sir.

25
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,678
Let's go this way.

26
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,742
- What now?
- Oh, God.

27
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,165
Let's go, let's go.

28
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,603
We won't be able to contact the stadium.
Communications are missing.

29
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,355
That was pretty loud.

30
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,482
A mine at the outer wall, I guess.

31
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,734
From the sound, sir?

32
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,569
I mean, what else could blow up like that?

33
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>Any available unit,
please respond.</i>

34
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,544
I'm here.

35
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,464
Sir, we're getting monsters
in range of that beacon.

36
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,716
<i>Heading where?</i>

37
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,175
Towards the stadium, it seems.

38
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,728
Seok-chan.

39
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,271
How far are we from there right now?

40
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,897
About 15 minutes, sir.

41
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,190
SPORTS COMPLEX, JAMSIL STATION

42
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,608
Turn around.

43
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,277
Away from the stadium. Move quickly.

44
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,486
Are we gonna bail?

45
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,060
On my go.

46
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,745
Without power, it's not gonna pump, sir.

47
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,290
Yeah, but that's not why we came here.

48
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,586
Jin-ho!

49
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,669
What is it, sir?

50
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,630
It's time we get to work.

51
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,824
SAMJEON GAS STATION

52
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,994
Update on the monsters.

53
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,378
They're swarming in already, sir.

54
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,088
Just like that.

55
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,881
All right!

56
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,086
Let's move.

57
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,757
Jin-ho, do it.

58
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,854
Hey, man, what the hell?

59
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,397
<i>Where's the firework?</i>

60
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,482
<i>I think they're disrupting
the signal, sir.</i>

61
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,694
Stop here.

62
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,453
- Should we go back?
- Stay here, open the roof.

63
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,962
Take that, you bastard!

64
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,635
I'll blow your faces on order!

65
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,219
Can't you just stay quiet for once?

66
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,930
Kim's getting crazier and crazier
by the day.

67
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,282
Stop the engine.

68
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,729
Lift the emergency.

69
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,555
So what's the move from here?

70
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,306
Meaning?

71
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,517
We used up all our C4 today.

72
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,353
I mean, how are we gonna blow them up now?

73
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,522
We kept the stadium safe.

74
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,648
Yeah, but still.

75
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,276
I mean, we're short on ordnance as it is.

76
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,281
Let's play it by ear.

77
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,609
I've put you through so much today.

78
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,818
It's not a bother.

79
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,704
About my son, Jun-il...

80
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,997
I'll find him, ma'am.

81
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
You should be able to see him soon.

82
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,775
Sir, look.

83
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,425
Sir, I want to apologize.

84
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,594
About what?

85
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,763
For acting on my own, I mean.

86
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,058
And even after the mine was disarmed.

87
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,184
Why did you do it?

88
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
You could've gotten yourself killed.

89
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
So I wouldn't have regrets.

90
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,527
That's my reason.

91
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,030
When you can't act,
then you're just stuck.

92
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
Powerless.

93
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,037
I know how that feels.
I know what it means.

94
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,586
Sir, I mean...

95
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,966
Was there anything else?

96
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,156
Ten hut!

97
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,785
Sir, what was the explosion I heard?

98
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,538
A woman tried to run
and triggered a mine earlier.

99
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,291
It exploded before we could
properly defuse it.

100
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,170
Which platoon member was overseeing them?

101
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,719
I was in charge, sir.

102
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,262
I'm Private Park.

103
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,682
It's behind us now.
We've prevented the worst.

104
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,767
And the runner?

105
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,727
Removed, I assume, huh?

106
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,522
Park Chan-yeong.

107
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,650
She was showing monster symptoms

108
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,652
so we isolated her.

109
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,236
Isolated?

110
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,864
I insisted we keep her here.

111
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,663
Kim Yeong-hu.

112
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,128
Remember what you swore?
You said that you'd take care of our men.

113
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,007
I really placed my faith in you
and look where it's gotten us now.

114
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,260
More than half of our men are gone
in less than a year!

115
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,727
Stick to protecting the stadium, please.

116
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,479
I'll take care of our men now.

117
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,368
Good work out there.

118
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,452
Go on in.

119
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,036
Sir, a moment.

120
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,456
Has Sergeant Choi come back yet?

121
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,833
What are you talking about?

122
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,127
We had an incident during the mission.

123
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,504
And he hasn't returned it seems.

124
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,925
Also, the one who missed roll call,
I found him by the entrance.

125
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
{\an8}RUBBING ALCOHOL

126
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,853
I'm not here. Please leave.

127
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,355
What's gotten into you, huh?

128
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,776
You're gonna get shot
barging in like that.

129
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
I'll chance it.

130
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
I think I'll enjoy heaven more.

131
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,448
Hell can't be that much worse
than here, either.

132
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,203
What's this? Day drinking?

133
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,121
What's there to drink?

134
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,790
That sure sounds nice, huh?

135
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,709
I got something
that would pair great with that.

136
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,793
And what's that?

137
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,462
A fun little story.

138
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,298
Oh, I'm good. I'm not interested.

139
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,633
Forget I asked.

140
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,346
I heard they were cleaning the house.

141
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,434
You know how they shot
that whole zone with missiles, yeah?

142
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,645
It wasn't a mistake. It was...

143
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,688
The powers that be
were cleaning the house.

144
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,652
I heard there was monsterization
getting out of control and all.

145
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,613
They thought it'd be better to, uh...

146
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,324
start with a clean slate.

147
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,661
Why does that matter now?

148
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,081
Hey. Oh, come on.
Still playing cool even now?

149
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,919
Oh, I'm not trying to get
under your skin, Doctor.

150
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,797
It's like I said, it's just a bit of fun.

151
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,549
I'm not amused.

152
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,968
'Cause you're still here.

153
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,140
They wanted to clean the house,
start fresh, well, they failed.

154
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
Isn't that why you're still alive
right now?

155
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
The same reason you're living
the good life here as well, Doctor.

156
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,189
No, that's not the reason I came here.

157
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,403
I mean, I have a really fun story.
Wanna hear it?

158
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,571
Are you kidding?

159
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,615
This, I've got to hear.

160
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,744
I'm not sure you could handle it.

161
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,871
Seriously?

162
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,040
What's with all the secrets?

163
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm sure if you rack
that genius brain of yours,

164
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,919
you'll get there eventually.

165
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh, come on.

166
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,215
Come on, Doctor.

167
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,844
Look, I'm not asking for free, okay?

168
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,055
I got these earlier today. Gambling.

169
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,974
Get out. I need to rest.

170
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,436
Sleep well, Doctor.

171
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,612
This... Why is this place such a mess?

172
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,947
Someone's gonna slip and fall.

173
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,409
Mom.

174
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,662
Mom, where are you?

175
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,166
I have to go to her.

176
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,168
She said so.

177
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,672
I have to go find my mom.

178
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,157
Let's see what we got.

179
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
Boss, shouldn't you be keeping watch?

180
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,496
Don't pocket anything.

181
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
What the hell?

182
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,976
Practice.

183
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,227
Bang!

184
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,108
Aren't you gonna go, "Bleh"?

185
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,153
What? Hey!

186
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,656
God, you're such a buzzkill, I swear.

187
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,120
Hmm?

188
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,623
Holy shit!

189
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,500
Oh, snacks.

190
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,043
Oh, my god. Spam?

191
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,337
Sausage.

192
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,424
Let's get going. Eat when we're back.

193
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,051
Wait, just one bite.

194
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,977
Shouldn't we take this too?

195
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
We're all out, you know.

196
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,363
Is he still out of it?

197
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,698
Yes.

198
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,492
Pry his eyes open.

199
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,499
Are his eyes out of focus?

200
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,669
- No.
- Check for any cuts or scars.

201
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,547
Look everywhere. Every nook and cranny.

202
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,217
If he's got any scrapes,
give him a shot of antibiotics.

203
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,644
Hey.

204
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,862
What the?

205
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,408
Um, there's a scar here, but it's weird.

206
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,201
Jesus.

207
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,915
Jesus.

208
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,334
Your face is the real emergency here,
Private Park.

209
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,295
It looks worse than it feels.

210
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,636
What the hell?

211
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,140
It's not a burn and it's not a bruise.

212
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,060
- Does he have any chronic conditions?
- I'm not...

213
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
I'm not sure. Sorry.

214
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,688
Does he have family here?

215
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,523
That's...

216
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Ah.

217
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,737
He's the son of the isolated infectee.

218
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,988
Should we step out?

219
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,781
What for? He's gonna find out.

220
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,909
Still, um...

221
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,495
Whatever it is,
it doesn't seem to be fatal, at least.

222
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,413
- Oh, Mom.
- But just to be safe,

223
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,749
I wanna keep him here.

224
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,463
Well, don't wait up now.

225
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,340
Being here isn't gonna help him
heal faster.

226
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,887
Oh, Dr. Lim.

227
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,891
Can monsters choose to attack
certain humans?

228
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,435
If you're talking about Type Greens,

229
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,856
they're not responding
to a certain individual.

230
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,068
It only seems like that
'cause they're more passive.

231
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,486
What if there were two people

232
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,614
and the monster chose to pick one
of them to attack?

233
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
Did you see something or...

234
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,787
is this just a thought you have?

235
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,491
- What difference would that make?
- Monsterization...

236
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,877
affects your mind.

237
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,130
It's a mental disease in a sense.

238
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,217
I mean, if we're not splitting hairs.
You get it, though, yeah?

239
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,428
I think, personally,
it's a mental disease,

240
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,390
capable of capturing
the minds of individuals

241
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,350
and bending them to its own will,

242
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,602
going so far
as to make their bodies change.

243
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,186
You think...

244
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,942
these puppets have anything
resembling love left in them?

245
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,361
You're right, Doctor.

246
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,363
Private Park, whatever it was,

247
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,949
it was chance.

248
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
Yeah. Take good care of him, please.

249
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,331
Private Park.

250
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,628
This monster of yours, keep me posted.

251
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,463
If you happen to see it once more.

252
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,633
Could it really have been
trying to protect?

253
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,094
I'm talking about this monster
who picks whom to attack.

254
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
I'd love it if you can bring it in.

255
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,514
Who knows?

256
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,519
This oddball of yours
might end up being the key we need.

257
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,254
I think I'm losing it.

258
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,883
A monster that protects us?

259
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,596
Aren't you gonna say
that you're sorry?

260
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,931
I'm still waiting for your apology!

261
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,558
What's this about, huh?

262
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,561
I told you to come back safe.

263
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,481
I told you that it's dangerous,

264
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,484
and I told you not to go. I told you.

265
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,278
And what the hell happened to your face?

266
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,572
Who was it? How did you get like this?

267
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,782
A monster?

268
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,367
I'm fine, really.

269
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,827
Do you see my hair?

270
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,580
I didn't get the dye out in time
'cause I was so worried about you,

271
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,831
and now it's a wreck.

272
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,334
Ugh! If you keep that up and something...

273
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,171
something happens,
what am I supposed to do then, huh?

274
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,381
- How...
- Hmm?

275
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,717
I don't really get
where you're going with this.

276
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,221
It's...

277
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,434
No, never mind.

278
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:12,649
Hey. Once I get my hair looking perfect,
then I'll see you again.

279
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,069
And put ointment on those.

280
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,995
And what brings you here?

281
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
ELECTRICAL ROOM

282
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,460
The infectee.

283
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,004
Get rid of her immediately.

284
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,090
What's the rush?

285
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,469
I'm sure you have more important things
you need to deal with.

286
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,638
Just 'cause she's the first in a month,

287
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,141
and she's one patient out of 100,

288
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,684
do you really think it's all fine?

289
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
I'm telling you, it's not.

290
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
The others will fear the worst.

291
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,816
Monsterization isn't contagious?

292
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,652
Wrong. Monsterization sows panic

293
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,736
and fear.

294
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,030
It'll spread.

295
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,368
So then cut out the cyst.

296
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
Isn't that why you're here?

297
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,289
This cyst...

298
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,500
anyone in here could be that.

299
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,960
Including you and me, Chief.

300
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,712
Can you please get to your point?

301
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,216
This worst-case scenario in their heads,

302
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,344
are they worried they'll get attacked
by monsters,

303
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,181
or are they worried
they're going to turn into monsters?

304
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,225
Ever since we got here,

305
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,936
we haven't had a single death
due to a monster outbreak.

306
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,731
Though it seems
people are trying to leave here.

307
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,026
It's not about showing compassion
for infectees.

308
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,737
I think we could give hope
to the survivors here.

309
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,655
That you still have a choice,

310
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,200
even if you start turning
into one of them.

311
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,869
What use is something like that
in a world like ours?

312
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,665
We all need that thing, you know.

313
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,838
But I'm sure I'm not teaching you
anything new.

314
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,135
That silver lining
is what keeps you here, hmm?

315
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,597
If this turns into a problem...

316
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,894
Sergeant, I hope you'll take
full responsibility.

317
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,478
Of course.

318
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,402
Hey, sit down.

319
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,739
No visitors again. Whatever shall we do?

320
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,701
And whose fault is that?

321
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,289
Well, I heard smiling brings customers in,
wonder if frowning works.

322
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,665
Business was never that good.

323
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,337
I might've picked the wrong line of work.

324
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,844
Or maybe the wrong employee.

325
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,100
You have to start earning these, okay?

326
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,853
Don't act high and mighty.

327
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,229
This can't fix me.

328
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,148
You can't find these meds in here.

329
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,192
At least take
the antibiotics here, though.

330
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,361
Hiring someone new is a pain.

331
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,071
Father?

332
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,660
Uh, we have a testimony
meeting today, right?

333
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,870
- We do.
- Oh.

334
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,040
I heard confessing here
makes all of the symptoms go away.

335
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
- Right.
- She was the one who told us to come.

336
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,127
All right.

337
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,879
Wow,
and you all came right on time.

338
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,445
Oh, God! Hey! Have you gone crazy?

339
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,113
Let go! Damn it.

340
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,866
I was saving this
for when I was gonna ask him out.

341
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,995
Oh, seriously! Damn it.

342
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,126
Guess things aren't so bad.
You can spend your time

343
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,836
- drawing little doodles.
- Give it back.

344
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,634
- Isn't that Father Peter?
- It's not.

345
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,928
What do you mean it's not?

346
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,514
Long hair, all black,
except for the white thingy here.

347
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,890
That's totally him, isn't it?

348
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,392
No way.

349
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,978
For real?

350
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,687
Please.

351
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,858
Huh? Where are we going?

352
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,779
Even still, I should be grateful.

353
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,741
If it weren't for this place,
I probably would've died a long time ago.

354
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,661
Here, we have a floor to lay down on,

355
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,205
and there's a roof over our heads.

356
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,583
I even have my boy with me.

357
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,377
It's the best of a bad situation.

358
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,713
Right. Imagine
not being grateful for this.

359
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,256
- Brother.
- Jesus!

360
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
Give it here.

361
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,802
Hey.

362
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,762
You said we should be honest here.

363
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,806
Was that honest, or was it bullshit?

364
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,309
If you just keep bottling up everything,
you'll end up like...

365
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,562
just like Jun-il's mother
over there, you know?

366
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,023
Well, how about you start us off today?

367
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,859
Jesus.

368
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,738
You can't just hold it all in, right?

369
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,905
Let out that steam.

370
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,826
The people that are gathered here,
look what's happened.

371
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,828
Not a single monster.

372
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,205
You see what I mean?

373
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,499
Uh, I'd like to confess.

374
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,504
Uh, I've kept this from everyone,

375
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,089
but I'm actually happy now.

376
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
I wake up, I find something to eat.

377
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,636
Next thing you know, it's bedtime.

378
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,097
This rhythm suits me.
No one's better or worse off...

379
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,849
Why don't we call it for today here?

380
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,913
I want to confess. I think
I might be in love with you, Father.

381
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,313
That's not it.

382
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,733
I'm sure, actually.

383
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,089
I wasn't saying
you should just blurt it out like that.

384
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,698
Hope things work out for you two.

385
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
Jesus tap-dancing Christ, sheesh.

386
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,453
You all staying or what?

387
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
Nothing more to hear here.

388
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,499
Well, it's not like
it's the Father's fault.

389
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,542
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my...

390
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,423
Uh, Father?

391
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,592
May I ask a favor?

392
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,928
Yeah, of course, you can.

393
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,263
It's about Jun-il's mother.

394
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,141
I'm wondering if you could visit her.

395
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,478
Since you can leave the premises
with permission.

396
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,897
That's an expensive favor, actually.

397
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,566
Oh.

398
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,195
I'll just say it's pro bono.

399
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,241
Come in.

400
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,131
I'll go search for Sergeant Choi
as soon as light breaks.

401
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,394
Is that what you think
Yong-seok would want?

402
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,305
Let's hear it.
How are you liking soldiering here?

403
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,851
Are you suggesting that Yong-seok
abandoned his post?

404
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,520
We can't be certain he didn't.

405
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,662
That doesn't change a damn thing for me.

406
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,649
I'll find him, bring him back.

407
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,484
- Request denied.
- Master Sergeant.

408
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,320
I can't in good conscience
put everyone else's lives at risk.

409
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,365
You went through all that trouble
for that infectee.

410
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,451
But you're quick to abandon
one of your own men.

411
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,535
No.

412
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,955
I'm doing this for you guys.

413
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
I'm not so sure anymore.

414
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,923
What do you think of Crow Platoon, sir?

415
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,934
These men risk their lives
every day for this place.

416
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,730
Crow Platoon's honor and dignity?

417
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,651
So, what use is honor when you're buried?

418
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,111
That's what I'm trying to say.

419
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,781
You want to go find Yong-seok.

420
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,158
And everyone else?

421
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,495
Are the rest of the Crows
on board with this mission?

422
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,042
How many men have you lost

423
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,169
thanks to making bull-headed mistakes?

424
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,923
Don't be like me.

425
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,883
Look, Sergeant.

426
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,677
I want you to learn from my failures.

427
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,018
You sure have become
a big coward, I must say.

428
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,922
Man, is this stuff even edible?

429
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,715
Take it or leave it, bud.

430
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,342
It's the best we got here.

431
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,427
This is what I risk my life for? Jesus.

432
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,222
And here I joined up 'cause I heard
soldiers get regular meals.

433
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,390
The hell is this?

434
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,394
Hey, Jin-ho.

435
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,062
Any signals yet?

436
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,856
No signals yet, sir.

437
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,609
Think being underground is affecting it?

438
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,070
You think I should...
I should take it upstairs for a bit?

439
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,446
I installed a repeater,

440
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,532
so the signal
should come through just fine.

441
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,582
Taste good?

442
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,003
How can you eat right now?

443
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Man...

444
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,968
The way I see it, Yong-seok is a deserter.

445
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,181
Watch your fucking mouth.

446
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,435
A Marine has dignity.

447
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,812
Hey, I didn't say anything
about what Marines had.

448
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,273
You might've been too busy
pulling pranks or whatever,

449
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,025
but have you seen Yong-seok recently?

450
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,236
Like a dead man walking around,
with his awful face.

451
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,155
The face of a deserter, for sure.

452
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,781
Even so, Yong-seok wouldn't...

453
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,493
I don't think he'd do that.

454
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,912
He knows better than anyone
how dangerous it is out there.

455
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,541
Oh, maybe he...

456
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,627
Maybe he's showing symptoms
and he wouldn't want others to...

457
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,340
God, you sure
love to talk, don't you?

458
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,063
I told you to watch your mouth, didn't I?

459
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,135
Did you fucking hit me?

460
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,428
Want to throw down?

461
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,430
Huh?

462
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,367
- You're not gonna pull rank, are you? Huh?
- I think that's enough, guys.

463
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,894
Hey, back off, motherfucker.

464
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,397
That's enough.

465
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,528
You'll stop right there.

466
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,311
ANTIBIOTICS
CEPHALOSPORIN

467
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,475
That baseball you took was my brother's.

468
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,936
Why would I take his
when there's balls everywhere?

469
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,312
You see the tear on it?

470
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,940
Well, he wants that one, so give it back.

471
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,650
Hand it over now.

472
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,026
This one's mine.

473
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,736
They say nothing here belongs to you.

474
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,864
- Who said that?
- My dad did.

475
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,031
Hey.

476
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,827
Your sister's a bitch. She's evil.
Does that mean you're an evil bastard?

477
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,246
Yeah, that's why
you don't deserve anything.

478
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,835
He's a monster.

479
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,837
A thieving little monster.

480
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,804
Hey, stop it!

481
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,973
Don't! I said stop it!

482
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,142
Get off him!

483
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,603
- Come here.
- Let go!

484
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,686
Come here.

485
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,063
You two get out of here.

486
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,107
I mean it!

487
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
Hey, watch your back.

488
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,195
Hey!

489
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,116
What are you doing?

490
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,368
You're a bully?

491
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,662
Well, it's better than being
a doormat, isn't it?

492
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,540
- Kim Yeong-su.
- If someone takes from you,

493
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,334
and you let them, you're a punk, see?

494
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,628
And that's how things are here.

495
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,756
You should just kill them all too.

496
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,132
That's what I'm going to do.

497
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,092
- Kim Yeong-su.
- 'Cause that's how it is.

498
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,597
Hurting other people...

499
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,643
you'll always end up paying for it.

500
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,436
Oh, yeah? You mean it?

501
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,647
- Yeah.
- So why am I paying?

502
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,024
I was good. Did what my dad told me.

503
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,152
And I made sure to always listen
and do the right thing.

504
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,529
So why am I alone?

505
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,990
I'm done listening to grown-ups.

506
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,284
So you should just live
how you want to now.

507
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,662
'Cause I know I will.

508
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,274
Shit.

509
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,951
What the hell?

510
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,165
Oh Jun-il.

511
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,587
What... What are you...

512
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,383
Where is he?

513
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,974
You're not lying, are you?

514
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,685
Are you deaf?

515
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,312
She just said it wasn't.

516
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,731
Are you crazy?

517
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,482
You realize how serious this is?

518
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,484
It's not a cut, it's a nosebleed.

519
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,236
Yeah, listen, you little...

520
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,196
Goodness. What have you done?

521
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,283
Are we good?

522
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,494
Look, look, look.
Does that settle it, huh?

523
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,413
You didn't have to take it that far.

524
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,956
Freaky little bastards.

525
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,792
Sheesh.

526
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,377
Ma.

527
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
Ma. Ma, I'm... I'm home.

528
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,052
I... I got some stuff from outside. Uh...

529
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,561
Ma? My mom.

530
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,106
Yeong-su, hey.

531
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,359
Have you seen my mother?

532
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,611
Yeah, your mom turned into a monster.

533
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,694
Huh?

534
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,239
I said she turned into a monster!
Her nose bled.

535
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,867
Then she will die.

536
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,287
Die? She will.

537
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,290
'Cause humans will kill her now.

538
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,148
Oh, Father.
What brings you all the way here?

539
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,651
I thought I should
pull my weight for once.

540
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,653
If you wanna confess, please go ahead.

541
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,915
I thought when I saw you coming here

542
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,917
that this was the end
of the line for good.

543
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,670
I mean, if we're gonna split hairs, then,

544
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,380
it's gonna get even harder to die now.

545
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
Humans are much more fragile.

546
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,801
I understand.

547
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,762
But there's nothing to spill.

548
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,140
I've been meaning to ask you
something, though.

549
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,268
I've got no answers. I can only listen.

550
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,187
Do I deserve this fate here now?

551
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,189
It's not like anyone deserves it.

552
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,024
You just got dealt a crappy hand,
is all.

553
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,070
Why is God so cruel?
I never asked for anything.

554
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,990
But he's punishing me
like I had lived a simple life.

555
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,161
How can he... How can he just
take and take from me? How?

556
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,662
Please be sure to ask.

557
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,791
Ask why he lets it all
fall apart like this.

558
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,419
Please, I'd love to know.

559
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:01,175
That's why I made do
and asked the monster.

560
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,555
"Monster, say something, please.
Please, tell me."

561
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,639
What did it say?

562
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,643
I, uh, I didn't hear it say anything.

563
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,980
Now the monster didn't say anything.

564
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,191
Everyone else says they hear the monster,

565
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,943
so why am I the only one
who doesn't hear anything?

566
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,572
Whether monster or God,
in the end, it's all the same torment.

567
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,908
I believe the thing that torments us...

568
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,453
isn't monsters or God, it's actually...

569
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,414
It's actually always that one person.

570
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,624
And they're...

571
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,627
They're your god and your monster.

572
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,796
As a mother, for you, that's your son.

573
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,340
To you, he's God,

574
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,967
and monster as well.

575
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,094
Even still, though...

576
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,640
I just wanna be with Jun-il.

577
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,650
<i>M-my mom...</i>

578
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,653
My mom is over there. I need her.

579
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,696
It was you this morning, huh?

580
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,116
The reason I'm losing sleep
on night watch is you?

581
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,868
I'm warning you. Get lost.

582
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,165
Ma! Ma! Let me see my mom!

583
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,210
I wanna see her! No!
I want to go out there!

584
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,628
- Hey!
- Oh.

585
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,671
Hey!

586
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,383
- This is your fault.
- Whoa, what are you doing?

587
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,509
What the hell?

588
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,594
- Uh, I...
- I just...

589
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,012
I can't stand this.

590
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,097
Stand what, sir?

591
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,557
Your barbaric ways.

592
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,309
Your violent barbaric ways.

593
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,393
He's my patient.

594
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,271
Didn't you know that?

595
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,689
And how could I know about that?

596
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,775
Being ignorant isn't a crime,
so I'll let you off just this once.

597
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,861
- No...
- From now on,

598
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,946
go easy on him.

599
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,867
He could be more important
than you ever could, huh?

600
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,034
Stop. Let go.

601
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,952
Let him go.

602
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,347
- I want to go outside.
- Come here. Come on. You all right?

603
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,831
- What?
- All right, let's go.

604
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,933
- Ma. I have to...
- Come on, let's go.

605
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,601
- She's not here. Your mother's not here.
- My mom.

606
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,086
- Where's my mom?
- Okay? This way. What's this?

607
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,922
How are you feeling?

608
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,885
Do you hear any strange sounds
or anything?

609
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,720
When you were outside, what happened?

610
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,888
Did you see anyone?

611
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,391
Did you touch anything
or did anything bite you, maybe?

612
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,684
Forget it. It's not that.

613
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,853
Uh, what exactly happened out there?

614
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,689
My... my mom now, she's a monster?

615
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,772
Huh?

616
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,359
I... I have to go find Ma.

617
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,083
- Hey, get a grip.
- I have to get to her.

618
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,654
- What? Mom?
- Where is she?

619
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,991
Your ma? Oh, you wanna see
your mom. Mom, right?

620
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,786
Then how about I take you to her?

621
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,832
Really? You'll take me to Ma?

622
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,792
First, we should talk, though.

623
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,753
Uh, about what?

624
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,880
How did you get this?

625
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,257
Do you know?

626
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,895
<i>Uh... a kid.</i>

627
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,188
A kid?

628
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,398
Fl-flowers. Uh...

629
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,316
And...

630
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,027
trees.

631
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,905
There was a... a kid.

632
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,032
A girl. She was a girl.

633
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,077
Uh, she... she pushed me.

634
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,537
Say that one more time. A child?

635
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,665
- Child? Flowers?
- I'm not sure.

636
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,833
I need to go. Ma's waiting.

637
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,543
- Ma's waiting.
- Say it again.

638
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,294
Say it again.

639
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,700
I guess, what's the point?

640
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,417
Chief Ji.

641
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,711
Life is truly funny.

642
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,008
I only started recovering
after I started turning into a monster.

643
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,301
Here, look. Look.

644
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,970
See? Look. Look.

645
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,140
They're all there, aren't they?

646
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,478
About what I said earlier.

647
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,773
Have you

648
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,025
made your decision?

649
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,108
Uh...

650
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,488
I agree with you.

651
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,408
You're doing the right thing.

652
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,287
I'll help you tomorrow on your way out.

653
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,623
Huh? How's that?

654
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,085
Will you...
Will you let me see Jun-il then?

655
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,168
Of course.

656
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,508
B2 SURVIVOR COUNT
TOTAL: 432, DEAD: 31, ALIVE: 401

657
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,554
B2 SURVIVORS

658
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:44,893

659
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,651
CHOI YONG-SEOK, STAFF SERGEANT

660
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,583
You're still up, sir?

661
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,213
I can't get any sleep.

662
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,218
So? What's up?

663
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,345
I found something out.

664
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,598
Yong-seok was seeing a woman here.

665
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,019
And she's rather sick, apparently.

666
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,690
Yong-seok said that
he would make sure that...

667
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:34,984
that she lives.

668
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,072
The hospital, the pharmacy.

669
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,119
That's where he'd be.

670
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,997
And who is this girl?

671
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,930
What makes you think you could...

672
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,681
Look at it from my point of view.

673
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,808
I'm always getting misunderstood.

674
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,812
If I'm here, and you're dead,
what do you think people will say?

675
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,898
You can't stop me.

676
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,984
Right. So why don't you go
make your scene somewhere else at least?

677
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,249
So you won't die hungry.

678
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,605
REST IN PEACE

679
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
Do Sang-jin.

680
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,291
Seems like they all end up dying.

681
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,919
If you mean that, then stop sending them.

682
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,754
Am I next then?

683
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,425
I feel like you'd know.

684
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,345
I'll be gone for a little while.

685
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,556
What about your debt from my husband?

686
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,266
I didn't kill him, so what's my debt?

687
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,854
None of that really matters.

688
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,441
I wanted to kill you, you know?

689
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,276
You were supposed to pretend

690
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,528
or beg for making a terrible mistake.

691
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,031
Then I'd get a choice.
Do I forgive or revenge?

692
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,324
Instead, it's neither.

693
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,908
You make your choice yet?

694
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,327
Uh-huh.

695
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,872
I'll wait it out.

696
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,624
I'll wait until...

697
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,169
you become a monster.

698
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,466
Forgiving you is not really an option and...

699
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,634
And murder is...

700
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,095
Well, I don't wanna turn how you did.

701
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,348
So I'll wait just to kill you.

702
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,058
As soon as you turn.

703
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,185
So don't get killed out there

704
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,687
and leave me hanging.

705
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,710
You must be on patrol duty.

706
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,420
Thank you for your service.

707
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,259
Do you know why Jun-il
acted like that earlier today?

708
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,969
Is he all right?

709
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,846
Yeah, it's nothing.

710
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,349
Oh, that's a relief.

711
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,267
This morning,

712
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,020
he followed Lee Eun-yu outside.

713
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,234
<i>Along with Do Sang-jin
and An Dong-gi.</i>

714
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,443
<i>The three of them.</i>

715
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,071
You mean it?

716
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,411
What if I swear to God?

717
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,039
I haven't seen the other two since.

718
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,162
That'll have to do for today.

719
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,664
Someone else took the cans.

720
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,051
Going out again?

721
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,138
You're a stalker now?

722
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,848
You get a kick out of it?

723
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,644
And what about you?

724
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,771
Looking like you got your ass kicked.

725
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,441
How can you say that with a straight face?

726
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,818
Mind your own business.

727
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,446
Don't act alone, okay?

728
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,075
You're putting the whole center at risk.

729
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,787
Did you know these guys
risked their lives to be here?

730
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,248
Even cats know that to get what you want,

731
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,250
you bet with your life.

732
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,264
That ribbon there.

733
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,432
I've seen it.

734
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,395
Enough with your curiosity
and stop following me...

735
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,481
'cause you'll wind up dead.

736
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,066
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi,

737
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,109
is that why they're dead?

738
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,361
Wanna know what killed them?

739
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,029
It's that person, isn't it?

740
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,864
The one you're looking for.

741
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,784
Or is it a monster?

742
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,745
<i>On that day,</i>

743
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,874
<i>even though her husband died,
you were alive.</i>

744
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,753
<i>Monsters kill only whoever they want to?</i>

745
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,965
<i>There's no way that's possible.</i>

746
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,841
<i>And...</i>

747
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,345
<i>that red ribbon that you have...</i>

748
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,306
What the hell are you talking about?

749
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,517
That monster has protected you.

750
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,519
And now you're looking for it.

751
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,228
Right?

752
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,416
You... You're that kid.

753
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,794
Did you find your brother?

754
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,297
Who the hell are you?

755
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,465
How do you know me?

756
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,804
Did he mention me to you?

757
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,887
This man...

758
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,058
This man, where is he?

759
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,019
Wanna find out?

760
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,317
Take my hand then.

761
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,656
Data number 23.

762
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,993
The blood sample extracted from Oh Jun-il

763
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,871
was very similar to that of a monster.

764
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,958
However, Oh Jun-il hasn't developed
any symptoms yet.

765
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,637
Despite having the possibility
of monsterization,

766
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,597
he shows no symptoms.

767
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,772
He was exposed to something out there.

768
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,318
First, I must uncover what transpired
in that two-hour missing window of time.

769
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,447
As of right now,

770
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,410
I'm planning on provoking
the subject to enable

771
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,829
monsterization.

772
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,793
Oh Jun-il.

773
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,961
Oh Jun-il.

774
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,302
Your mom is waiting.

775
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:38,985
Back up.

776
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,905
Someone's out there.

777
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,678
I'm not going to shoot.

778
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,684
I just need to take that child and go.

779
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,859
So you're alive.
