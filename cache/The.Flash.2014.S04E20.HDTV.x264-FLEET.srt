1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,493
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:04,590
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

3
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:05,903
You wanna be the new Breacher?

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,705
Your Thinking Cap and the dark matter

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,149
- is what caused this.
- I know!

6
00:00:09,152 --> 00:00:11,313
How long before
everything I know is gone?

7
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:13,594
DeVoe has taken out everyone
who's gotten in his way.

8
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,446
He created 12 meta-humans,
just so he could

9
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,625
steal their powers.

10
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,361
Why does he need their powers?

11
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:21,946
The fire that burns down Team Flash

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,578
will also light the path
to the Enlightenment.

13
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,943
Since the age of Enlightenment,

14
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:31,388
when reason, debate, and the
search for truth flourished,

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,957
the world has improved
by nearly every measure

16
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,226
in human advancement,
and continues to do so.

17
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,052
There is no doubt in my mind

18
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,964
that as technology continues to bloom,

19
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,732
so will all of humanity.

20
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,000
Professor DeVoe?

21
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,289
You disagree?

22
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,872
Well, uh, yes, I guess.

23
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,776
Just, I have a more realistic view

24
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:55,492
of humanity whenever
technology is concerned.

25
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:56,555
What do you mean?

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,014
Well, you spoke of the Enlightenment.

27
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,184
One only has to look at
history to find the answers.

28
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,586
Okay, let's.

29
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:05,155
Life expectancy over
the past two centuries

30
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:08,492
has increased from 30
years to nearly 70 years.

31
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:11,161
And-and we should assume
that's a good thing?

32
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:12,829
Each new day, we have to share

33
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,098
very limited resources
with anything up to

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,958
200,000 newborn babies,

35
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:18,813
most of whom will end up living

36
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,836
in abject poverty and famine.

37
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,907
Well, thank you very much,
Professor Doom and Gloom.

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,510
Remind me never to take
one of your history classes.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,413
Perhaps you should. There's
much I could teach you.

40
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:36,696
The Taoists, in pursuit of immortality,

41
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:37,998
discovered gunpowder.

42
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,689
Alfred Nobel created the Nobel Prize

43
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:42,029
so he wouldn't be remembered

44
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,794
as the man who invented dynamite.

45
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,763
History has shown us time and time again

46
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,833
that whenever a
technological advancement

47
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:52,702
can be used to hurt
humanity, it will be.

48
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:54,271
You can't blame technology for the way

49
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:55,839
men choose to use it, Professor.

50
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,841
You can't ignore that the best of ideas

51
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:00,450
by the smartest of men often have a way

52
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,045
of becoming corrupted.

53
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:12,289
You've located everything we need.

54
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,391
And now the time has come to retrieve it

55
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:16,860
so we can finally...

56
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,795
enlighten the world.

57

58
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,677
Uh-oh.

59
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,688
Hey, babe.

60
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,023
Uh, it's me. Just checking in.

61
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,491
For my dad.

62
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:51,061
He... really wants to know your answer

63
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,495
about taking the Breacher job.

64
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,396
I think his exact words were:

65
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,132
"That little son of a
Breach better tell me,

66
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,968
or they will never find the body."

67
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,336
Yeah. But you know what?

68
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,937
He's retired. He can wait.

69
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,805
So just take as much time as you need.

70
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,813
- Okay? It's, um...
- Don't say it's fine.

71
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:06,476
- You know.
- Don't say it's fine.

72
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,685
- It's fine.
- Oh, God.

73
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,008
- It's fine.
- Okay.

74
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,914
So, just five me. Whenever.

75
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,249
Okay. Bye.

76
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,919
Ramon, speed lab. Now.

77
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,513
Good! Good, good, good.

78
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:19,856
Good, good, good good, good.

79
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,458
Thing we're gonna do
to get Killer Frost

80
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,393
to appear, get that massive spike

81
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,495
in your adrenaline
production that we need,

82
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,352
is, Ramon is gonna use his vibes

83
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,008
to shake you up on the cellular level,

84
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,280
and let's see if we
can't get your old friend

85
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:32,302
Killer Frost to come out to play.

86
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,937
Are you sure this is gonna work?

87
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,405
Well, I mean, like any hypothesis,

88
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:36,740
you have to test it to get an answer.

89
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:37,974
It's what we've all done since

90
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,010
the fourth grade, known as the...

91
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,177
Scientific method?

92
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,867
Right you are, Allen!

93
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,739
Of course. Ah, here he is.

94
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:47,250
Okay, good. So get in position.

95
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:49,719
Don't worry, I lowered
the amps on this thing.

96
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,354
Ramon, you set?

97
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,622
Yeah.

98
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:53,857
Snow, you ready?

99
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,358
I'm ready.

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,061
Three, two, one, and...

101
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,344
Nothing.

102
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:03,867
All right. Ramon, more power.

103
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,971
Set? Three, two, one...

104
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:11,574
All right, this isn't working.

105
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,203
You know what, Ramon? Full power.

106
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:14,954
Wait, hold on, hold
on. What do you mean,

107
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,358
full power? We don't
want to blast Caitlin

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,289
across the speed lab.

109
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,915
Well, you need to get a
spike in her adrenaline.

110
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,595
- Harry, she could get injured.
- Yeah.

111
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,150
God, this is... Look, this is

112
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:23,786
gonna work, okay? Nothing has changed.

113
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,023
All right? Snow's DNA tests,

114
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:28,425
they confirm it. Her meta-DNA

115
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:30,026
was not spliced by Noah's powers.

116
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:31,695
You mean Melting Point's powers.

117
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,730
Right, that's what I said.
Melting Point's powers.

118
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,302
- No, you didn't.
- I did say that.

119
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:36,308
But, Harry,

120
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,993
there's no dark matter
in her system anyway.

121
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,314
We're just trying to
spike her heart rate.

122
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:41,485
What do you mean,
there's no dark matter?

123
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,173
Harry, you knew that.

124
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,407
We all did.

125
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,043
We did? We did. No, I know.

126
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:49,646
I just, I think I
just, you know, forget.

127
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:50,714
I forgot.

128
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:51,836
You forgot?

129
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,206
Harry, are you okay?

130
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,113
No. He's not.

131
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,693
Harry, you're...

132
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:06,313
Losing my intelligence? Yes.

133
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,505
The injection of dark
matter from the Thinking Cap

134
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,467
apparently overwhelmed my synapses.

135
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:14,604
Instead of making my
brain faster, it's...

136
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,106
slowing it down.

137
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,477
Why didn't you tell us this sooner?

138
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:23,880
How long until...

139
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,477
No way of knowing.

140
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,235
I mean, there are days
I can think clearly

141
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:29,004
and other days...

142
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,020
I... I can't.

143
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:36,559
The good news is, um,
from what I can see,

144
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,622
the regression seems to be reversible.

145
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,914
Okay, great.

146
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,354
I'll start working on it full-time.

147
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:42,500
No, you won't.

148
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:43,688
I did this to myself,

149
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,391
and I-I thought "Oh, you know what?

150
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:46,936
"Use that Thinking Cap, and then I can

151
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:50,373
outthink Devoe and then stop DeVoe."

152
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,675
I was wrong. Now here we are.

153
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:54,410
Okay, well, we're gonna fix this.

154
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:59,282
You and I both know
there's a ticking clock...

155
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,997
and I can't help anyone like this.

156
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,452
Yes, you can.

157
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:03,620
How?

158
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,161
Look, guys.

159
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,462
Ralph...

160
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,964
Caitlyn's powers, now this.

161
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,134
DeVoe knew how to break us apart, but...

162
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,003
I mean, we're all still here.

163
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,905
We're a family.

164
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:24,741
That's how we're gonna beat DeVoe.

165
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:27,844
All right, Allen.

166
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,045
All right.

167
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,352
Vandermeer Steel.

168
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,021
Smaller than I expected.

169
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,992
The first step to our Enlightenment

170
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,961
is as simple...

171
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,233
As opening a door.

172
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,797
Alloy 1771.

173
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,419
Now, the gallium antimonide
substrates within these

174
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:13,723
can harness power at 400% efficiency.

175
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:18,821
The precise amount, I calculated.

176
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:26,035
You can pick 'em up.

177
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,838
Freeze!

178
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,041
You should let us leave.

179
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,910
I can't do that.

180
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,178
Yes, you can.

181
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:39,048
How are you...

182
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,056
We have what we need.

183
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,160
I suppose we do.

184
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:55,765
Code Red! Code Red!

185
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:01,304
Clifford. This is unnecessary.

186
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,206
You knew there were gonna be casualties

187
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,108
when we began.

188
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,310
This is his own doing.

189
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,511
Yes, my love.

190
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:20,564
What are we dealing with?

191
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,402
First of all, we're trying to determine

192
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,423
what was in that vault.

193
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,092
Watch your step right here.

194
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,264
There was no drilling,
there was no lock picked.

195
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,510
And the only thing anybody would tell us

196
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:30,978
about what was in the vault was that

197
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,147
it was some sort of
secretive technology.

198
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,944
Also, security guard here

199
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,984
was a 24-year-old,
apparently shot himself.

200
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,843
Wait, a robbery and a suicide?

201
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:40,045
He was newly married.

202
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,369
Has an infant at home.

203
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,467
This is smelling like
some meta madness to me.

204
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,819
Who else can "Kilgore" a retinal scan

205
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:48,562
and "Dibny" a vault lock?

206
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:50,531
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go interview some people,

207
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,540
see what I can find out.

208
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,087
All right, Cisco and I will try
to figure out what DeVoe stole.

209
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,735
All right. I'll be over here.

210
00:08:55,738 --> 00:08:58,201
Okay, so. Where should we start?

211
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,931
I'm thinking: if we can gain acc...

212
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,545
to their files...

213
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:07,548
Alloy 1771?

214
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,741
It's the only item missing
from the inventory files.

215
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:12,451
Or I can just... stand
here and look pretty.

216
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,921
Hey, know what you can do, actually?

217
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:15,017
You could vibe the gun.

218
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,319
The file didn't say what Alloy 1771 was.

219
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,522
So we need another way to learn

220
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,564
why DeVoe would want it.

221
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,287
Uh, vibing and DeVoe
do not mix, remember?

222
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,263
Yeah, I know, man. But I mean,

223
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,631
what are we supposed to
do? It's the only way.

224
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,866
Barry, I don't really feel like

225
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,601
getting blasted into a wall right now.

226
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,903
I'm sure there's another way we can

227
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,205
find out what this is that doesn't

228
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:32,473
require me getting a migraine.

229
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,575
It is a solar panel.

230
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,276
Constructed of metal that absorbs

231
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,644
and multiplies the sun's energy

232
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,662
at 400% efficiency.

233
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,382
What would DeVoe be
doing with a solar panel?

234
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,595
Nothing, on its own.

235
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,040
He's gotta be building something.

236
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,653
Look, I-I need you to vibe the gun.

237
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,866
Maybe I should put this
in movie terms for you.

238
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,693
Everything in DeVoe's wake is
like the "Home Alone" house.

239
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,428
Okay? It's booby-trapped.

240
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,263
I would need to double my powers

241
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,326
just to even attempt to vibe the gun.

242
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,833
Well, hold on. I mean, could...

243
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,405
Could Gypsy double your powers?

244
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,397
- That's a good idea.
- No, not.

245
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,872
Not what?

246
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,139
Gypsy's busy.

247
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,574
Her dad just retired.

248
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:08,994
She's having to do double the work.

249
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,326
Earth 19 is a mess
right now. She's swamped.

250
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:12,346
Cisco.

251
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,081
Combining your powers could make it

252
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,983
so we know DeVoe's next move.

253
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,459
Thanks for meeting me.

254
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:22,256
- I need a favor.
- Okay.

255
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:26,126
I need you to distract
Cecile for a while.

256
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:27,361
What for?

257
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,529
Well, that's the thing.

258
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,197
I can't tell you, because if I do,

259
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:32,272
she'll read your mind and find out.

260
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,467
Why can't Iris do it?

261
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,868
Because Iris knows exactly why

262
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm trying to distract Cecile.

263
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,350
- Ah.
- And therefore Barry knows.

264
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,307
Which means that Cisco knows, Kid knows.

265
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,967
- Whatever you need.
- Really?

266
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,241
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

267
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:45,112
You're welcome. All right.

268
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:47,842
Lose my mind, become a babysitter.

269
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,449
Oh, come on.

270
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:53,387
Listen, if anybody's gonna
reverse what's happening,

271
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:55,255
it's gonna be those
kids at S.T.A.R. Labs.

272
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,139
I mean, they love you, Harry.

273
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,993
And they will never
stop trying to help you.

274
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:02,296
- So don't lose hope.
- Right.

275
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:08,819
And that is how I aced
my intro to heat transfer

276
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:10,737
my first year at university.

277
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,005
Bravo.

278
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,307
Ducked and run.

279
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:16,376
I miss those days.

280
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:19,413
I was young and foolish and brave.

281
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:20,701
And now you're just foolish.

282
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,282
To agree to a date with someone

283
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:24,885
I first met as they were so rudely

284
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,855
disagreeing with my
professional opinion.

285
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,623
Foolish, maybe.

286
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,287
Yeah, no one's ever
challenged me like that.

287
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:36,634
It was refreshing.

288
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:41,735
Ah, maybe you are right

289
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:44,004
about technology's distracting us.

290
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,772
It certainly can destroy moments.

291
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:48,909
Although, sometimes...

292
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,477
technology...

293
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,512
can create them as well.

294
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,710
Thanks for coming to help us, Gypsy.

295
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,078
You two are up.

296
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,714
So, how do we do this?

297
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:31,345
Okay, so to co-vibe, we
have to be totally in sync.

298
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:32,800
All right? Our minds have to be on

299
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,069
exactly the same page.

300
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:35,455
Just like always.

301
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,890
Yeah.

302
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,725
Oh. So that was weird.

303
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:47,991
Why? What did you see?

304
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,403
I don't know, a-a dock?

305
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:51,471
Um, looked like a shipping container.

306
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:52,587
Number 16.

307
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,841
That must be what DeVoe
is gonna steal next.

308
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:56,777
He's gonna have to steal it from us.

309
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,283
All right.

310
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:04,986
It looks like we made it in time.

311
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:07,853
Whatever's in this container,
we can't let DeVoe have it.

312
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,656
Actually...

313
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:12,686
it's what's in... this container

314
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,962
you can't let me have.

315
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:16,964
Well...

316
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,665
what was in this container.

317
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:28,508
Hit him!

318
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,414
Gratitude...

319
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,535
for the workout, brief as it was.

320
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:39,152
Later.

321
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,994
Damn it. Damn it!

322
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:50,063
Why didn't we see the
right container number?

323
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:53,367
Someone's vibe wasn't
clear enough, Cisco.

324
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,736
Are you blaming me?

325
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,917
You lost your focus, what can I say?

326
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,010
Yeah, getting hit against
a metal container wall

327
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,178
sort of does that.

328
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,329
You know, I hit that wall too.
I'm perfectly focused.

329
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:04,579
Oh, well, if you're so focused,

330
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,760
then why'd you let him get away?

331
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,057
Don't even try and put that on me.

332
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:08,517
I'm sorry, I didn't put that on you.

333
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,494
You put that on you.

334
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:11,048
I'm gonna put my fist in your face,

335
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,815
- is what I'm gonna...
- Is that how we'd work together

336
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:13,915
if I took the job?

337
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:16,415
Guys. What job?

338
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,504
I brought that metal piece
from the shipping container,

339
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:25,621
in case we want to try
co-vibing later, but...

340
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,992
think we both saw
where that led us, so...

341
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:32,997
So you said... Breacher retired.

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,043
He offered you a job on Earth
19 to replace him, didn't he?

343
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,152
Mm-hmm.

344
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,688
You know, another shot in the dark,

345
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,572
but you haven't actually given Breacher

346
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,108
or Gypsy an answer yet.

347
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,310
Mm-mm.

348
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:45,035
Which way you leaning?

349
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,372
I wanna be with Gypsy
more than anything.

350
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,216
It's just complicated.

351
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,218
Hey, no, man, I get it.

352
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,725
But look, I mean...

353
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,534
maybe...

354
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,670
you guys working together to end this

355
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,373
will make the decision
easier, for both of you.

356
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,004
What if she doesn't want
the same thing as me?

357
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:07,044
I mean, you're never
gonna know unless you ask.

358
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,881
And listen, Cisco, I mean...

359
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,324
we can't beat DeVoe without you.

360
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,084
You're our secret weapon.

361
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,520
You and Gypsy just need to be

362
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:18,222
on the same page for
that weapon to work.

363
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,758
Yeah, and I don't know that we can be.

364
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,893
All right, well...

365
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:25,295
let me help you.

366
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,066
- Barry.
- No, I... hold on.

367
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,135
So that's gonna end well.

368
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:34,238
Last one.

369
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,042
Okay, we, uh, need food.

370
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,843
We need wine.

371
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:41,285
Lots of both. Go.

372
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,554
I'll unpack.

373
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,597
Clifford!

374
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,852
Go. Hurry home.

375
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,320
I can stay, if... You're sure?

376
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:51,955
- Yeah.
- I really should.

377
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,390
Last chance.

378
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:21,851
_

379
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,327
Me, hunter!

380
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,674
Me hunted feast for my queen!

381
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,167
You don't believe these things you wrote

382
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:36,236
in this journal, do you?

383
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,444
This reads like some
radical's manifesto, Clifford.

384
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:48,445
It is a realist's awakening.

385
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:52,516
You declare war against every
technological philanthropist.

386
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:55,085
Men, men, men.

387
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:57,121
Pushing us to the brink of Armageddon

388
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:58,589
with their "inventions."

389
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,225
No, they want a better mankind.

390
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:03,761
Don't be naive, Marlize.

391
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,332
The severity of our society's failings

392
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,336
require extreme ideas if ever we were to

393
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:15,705
restore some semblance of balance.

394
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,641
"Technology has become a cancerous cell

395
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,310
in our social biology.

396
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:22,580
Exercising it... would
require a total purge,

397
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,338
not only of the material world,

398
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,984
but also human consciousness"?

399
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,753
This is not balance! This
is lobotomizing people!

400
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:32,856
It is rebooting the masses' brains,

401
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:35,421
to let them forget their
technological crutches!

402
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:37,294
They are babies with pacifiers!

403
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,862
Oh, and who will teach them?

404
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,197
You, Professor?

405
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:42,966
How does any of this help humankind?

406
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:45,151
Don't you see? Marlize...

407
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:50,040
Our technology is killing us.

408
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:52,244
You and I, we can fix this.

409
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,748
Together.

410
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,480
As partners.

411
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,850
We can lead them, all
of society, humanity,

412
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:03,987
on the true path to Enlightenment.

413
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:11,361
Hey, Harry.

414
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:13,530
DA Cecile Horton.

415
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:17,334
Joe said you needed to adjust
my mental activity dampener.

416
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,916
Yes. Joe... yes.

417
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,071
I have to do that. It's,
uh, it's not a big deal.

418
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,721
It's a standard procedure.

419
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:29,263
That's, yeah. Okay.

420
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,565
All right. I'm in.

421
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,617
Well, it's installing, so...

422
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,655
now you just... you just sit.

423
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:39,756
And wait.

424
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,725
For a long time.

425
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:46,805
Okay. What is happening

426
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:49,342
with your thoughts right now?

427
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,869
With my... okay.

428
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:54,640
So... there was an
incident with dark matter...

429
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,471
Yeah, I know, I know,
Joe told me about that.

430
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:58,519
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What do you mean?

431
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,424
Your thoughts are screaming at me.

432
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:03,460
It's like they start to form,

433
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:05,148
and then, it's like,

434
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,471
the more the ideas appear...

435
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:09,653
- The more they disappear.
- Exactly.

436
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:12,122
Well, that explains my "can't" days.

437
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:14,291
What does that mean, Harry?

438
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:18,262
It means, DA Cecile Horton,

439
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:21,465
that the more I try to use my brain...

440
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,700
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

441
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,238
Barista. Another one, please.

442
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,873
Uh, make it a double.

443
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,708
Thank you.

444
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,677
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

445
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,046
I've been looking everywhere for you.

446
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:38,330
Can't a woman caffeinate in peace

447
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,766
around here?

448
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:41,836
Hey. Look. Hey!

449
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,220
I know why you're upset,
but it's all right.

450
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,385
- Really?
- Yeah.

451
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,796
Look, Cisco just thinks
if he takes the job,

452
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,593
he'll be letting us down. But, I mean,

453
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:51,261
he just needs to follow his own heart,

454
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,829
do what he needs to
do, not worry about us.

455
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,731
He knows that.

456
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:58,168
Wow. That's actually really great.

457
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,007
So now... all you guys have to do

458
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,221
is talk to each other.

459
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:05,158
Yeah. Well, that part's
not so easy, so...

460
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:07,283
Yes... it is.

461
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,387
- What are you doing?
- What?

462
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:10,156
Don't even think about. No!

463
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,572
Okay.

464
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,275
Don't ever "whoosh" me again, all right?

465
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,010
Totally, I'm sorry. Um, Cisco.

466
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,549
What is going on?

467
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:18,761
Just getting 'em back
on the same page, okay?

468
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,800
Cisco, Gypsy is upset, because, frankly?

469
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,247
I mean, it's taking
you too long to accept

470
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,474
Breacher's job offer. Duh. And Gypsy.

471
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:27,598
Cisco, he's-he's just worried
about abandoning his team.

472
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,489
I mean, it's not that
he doesn't want the job.

473
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:32,226
Right? Okay, so...

474
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,728
Now you both know, right?

475
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,906
And you can dive in and...

476
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:38,909
work this out... Let's talk about this.

477
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:46,817
CCPD is reporting two more break-ins

478
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,652
at tech manufacturers... Boeing Lab

479
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:49,753
and the Jamison Institute.

480
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:50,954
More hardware was stolen.

481
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,512
- DeVoe.
- Was anybody hurt?

482
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,367
Three fatalities, all
of them security guards

483
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,558
in high-level clearance
areas, just like at Vandermeer.

484
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,918
He's taking whatever he wants,
killing anybody that gets in the way.

485
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,254
Guys, I-I'm sorry, but
we have to figure out

486
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:05,769
what kind of machine
he's building, right now.

487
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,404
Look, we have to try.

488
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,814
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

489
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:21,525
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- I saw that one coming.

490
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:24,106
- You okay?
- I'm good. Thank you.

491
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,773
They okay?

492
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:36,030
Tests show, physically, they're fine.

493
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,534
As a couple, not so much.

494
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,353
Where are you going?

495
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,856
I need to get these two back in sync.

496
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,574
I mean, we gotta get
ahead of this somehow.

497
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, cowboy.

498
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:48,470
What do you mean? Why?

499
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,240
Maybe you've done enough already, okay?

500
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,781
Cisco and Gypsy are
clearly going through

501
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:56,652
something, and, you
know, it's not up to us

502
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:57,886
to counsel them through it.

503
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,971
Well, then who is it up to, Iris?

504
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,056
- Just stop for a second...
- We can't stop.

505
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,058
The second we do,
everyone could fall apart.

506
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,827
The team's hanging on by a thread.

507
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,895
- But we are hanging on, Barry.
- For how long?

508
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:08,397
I mean, look at what's happening.

509
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:10,199
DeVoe is killing innocent people.

510
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:13,936
He's stealing pieces of
tech, for God knows why.

511
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,338
Just trying to keep up with
him is tearing us apart.

512
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,807
Babe... you can't put it on yourself

513
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,176
to hold everyone together.

514
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:29,885
Cisco is family.

515
00:22:29,887 --> 00:22:31,436
And when family hurts, we all hurt.

516
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,756
I get that.

517
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:36,311
But sometimes you can't answer
their questions for them.

518
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,626
Sometimes, you just have to support them

519
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,093
while they find them on their own,

520
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,829
whether they're together
or they're apart.

521
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,201
What?

522
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:48,103
That's it.

523
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:50,906
The pieces of tech don't fit together...

524
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,309
because they're not supposed to.

525
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,944
He's not building one thing,
he's building multiple.

526
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:04,153
Harry, I know this is hard.

527
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:06,555
Well...

528
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:10,115
it is hard, DA Cecile
Horton, because my brain,

529
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:11,234
the one thing that has defined me

530
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:12,628
for, well, pretty much my entire life,

531
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,829
is about to...

532
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:18,100
vanish, and then who will I be?

533
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,701
You'll be the exact same
man you've always been.

534
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,638
Yeah, but dumb.

535
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,774
Same man. Way less intelligent.

536
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,309
Harry.

537
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,912
There are lots of
ways to be intelligent.

538
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,847
Not just using your head.

539
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,750
Right.

540
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,792
Wait.

541
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,961
Do that again. Harry!

542
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:47,930
- Do what?
- Do it again! Do it again!

543
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:54,717
Right?

544
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,186
- How did you do that?
- I saw it!

545
00:23:56,189 --> 00:23:58,373
Inside your mind, before it vanished.

546
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:01,353
In... wait. So you can...

547
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,755
Write down what you're thinking.

548
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,391
- Before it...
- Disappears.

549
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,013
- Wow.
- Yeah.

550
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:09,651
Marlize? I brought the sample.

551
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:13,055
- Hey.
- Hey!

552
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:14,757
Okay.

553
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,793
All right.

554
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,964
- Fingers crossed.
- Yep.

555
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:23,259
Here we go.

556
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:31,473
Cheers.

557
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:35,911
- Yes!
- Yeah?

558
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:38,180
- Show the others.
- Got it.

559
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,889
Hello?

560
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:48,290
Marlize.

561
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:49,658
It's me.

562
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,529
Clifford.

563
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:55,898
I need you to come home.

564
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,833
I can't.

565
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,998
I'm making a difference
here... I'm changing lives

566
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,137
for the better. These people need me.

567
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,472
I need you.

568
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,709
I'm sorry.

569
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,365
I can't be with someone that thinks

570
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,779
that society is a disease, that believes

571
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:15,184
that our world is being
plagued by technology.

572
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:17,352
I am nothing without you.

573
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:18,864
You're a brilliant man

574
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,467
with a great future ahead of you.

575
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,191
What kind of future do I have

576
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:24,126
if you are not by my side?

577
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:26,686
I just wish that you could show

578
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,831
the same compassion
for the rest of humanity

579
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,699
as you do for me.

580
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:34,570
Listen to me, Marlize, I...

581
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,889
my thoughts, I cannot...

582
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:40,267
I-I just... I just don't think that...

583
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,316
Marlize?

584
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,615
Marlize?

585
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:52,165
Marlize!

586
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:00,829
So... what were you gonna say?

587
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,632
Before we were so
alarmingly interrupted.

588
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:09,271
Look, I just...

589
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:13,936
Cisco, I...

590
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,211
Don't want you to take the job.

591
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:18,247
Oh.

592
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:22,448
That is such a relief.

593
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:25,319
Because I don't want anything to change.

594
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:36,932
Not only have we not
been on the same page,

595
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,167
we haven't even been on the same planet.

596
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,003
Literally.

597
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:43,171
We've been doing this
back-and-forth thing

598
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:44,400
for almost a year,

599
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,475
negotiating who gets
to go to whose Earth

600
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:47,900
and when, just to see each other,

601
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:50,045
and on the off-chance we
do get to see each other,

602
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:52,881
there's, like, a countdown
until one of us has to leave,

603
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:54,486
and I'm tired of it!

604
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,236
I don't want to have to
Breach to see the woman I love.

605
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,654
I want to wake up next to her.

606
00:26:59,657 --> 00:27:01,890
Every morning.

607
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,233
So what are you saying?

608
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:07,496
I'm saying I want more.

609
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,682
I'm saying I don't want Breacher's job,

610
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:10,983
but I do want you.

611
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,634
I want you too.

612
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:14,303
What am I supposed to do?

613
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,438
Pack up my entire life, everything?

614
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,233
Forget about my job,
my responsibilities...

615
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,564
- No, no, no...
- Move here?

616
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,376
No, no, that's not what
I'm asking you to do.

617
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,162
I would never ask you
to leave the Agency.

618
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,948
I know how important that is to you.

619
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,249
But tell me,

620
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:29,585
and tell me honestly...

621
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:31,553
this, what we have...

622
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,556
Is this enough for you?

623
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,995
Yes.

624
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:42,598
It is.

625
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,170
Well, it isn't for me.

626
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,337
Hey, guys? I need you both in the Cortex.

627
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,711
- Why?
- I know what DeVoe's doing.

628
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:57,145
It's not one machine.

629
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:59,081
They're machines. Machines
that work together,

630
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,298
but they're still separate.

631
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:01,834
Satellites.

632
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,784
Separate satellites working together

633
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:05,721
for a single purpose?

634
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,545
So this guy really is a Bond villain.

635
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:08,890
DeVoe would need a massive amount

636
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:10,525
of computational power
for them to be able

637
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,657
to talk to each other.

638
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,294
Something to triangulate navigation

639
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:14,463
between each satellite.

640
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:17,265
So, like, a quantum computer?

641
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,506
Mercury Labs just put a whole system

642
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:21,451
of quantum computers
online, at their home base.

643
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:22,595
That's where he's going.

644
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,972
Okay, great. This time,
we catch DeVoe by surprise.

645
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:32,314
Behold.

646
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:33,782
The key to communicating

647
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:36,051
our message of the Enlightenment.

648
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:40,088
Polynomial time computing.

649
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,526
And a dream shall
soon become... reality.

650
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:13,558
Clifford!

651
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,661
Uh-uh. Don't move.

652
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:18,263
Barry! Knock him out, and then cuff him!

653
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:19,431
On it!

654
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:28,661
Gypsy, now!

655
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,790
Stop it, you're killing him!

656
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,313
Cisco, look out!

657
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:44,994
Barry, hit him again!

658
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,861
Enough!

659
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,424
Caitlin.

660
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,841
Caitlin, what the hell are you doing?

661
00:29:57,844 --> 00:30:00,244
Bringing her back.

662
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,543
DeVoe is creating a sonic pulse.

663
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,400
You need to get out of there before...

664
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:17,822
Oh, I get it. You'd
like me to frighten you

665
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,111
into becoming your better half.

666
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:21,575
Gladly.

667
00:30:23,397 --> 00:30:25,369
- DeVoe!
- Ugh.

668
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:29,300
Children should be seen, not heard.

669
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,670
I'm very sure seeing your bestie die

670
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:32,845
would be frightening enough,

671
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:34,982
but I can't kill the Flash.

672
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:36,556
Well, not just yet.

673
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,876
My plan for the Enlightenment

674
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,912
requires his further participation.

675
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:44,783
You, however... are
a lot less fortunate.

676
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,151
Barry, he's gonna kill Gypsy!

677
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,123
Now, do you feel that?

678
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,625
Around your throat?

679
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,994
That is the gravitational equivalent

680
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:59,064
of my boot busting your windpipe.

681
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,500
She's innocent. Leave her alone!

682
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:03,802
Clifford...

683
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:08,106
This isn't part of our plan.

684
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:09,941
Cisco, wake up! Wake up!

685
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,445
Our plan is to save them.

686
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,541
Well, you can't save everyone, my love.

687
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:17,782
DeVoe!

688
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,618
Perhaps.

689
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,624
But I won't watch you kill
an innocent life again.

690
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,267
Yes, you will.

691
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,537
Please. Clifford.

692
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:42,807
Remember who you are.

693
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:47,011
Is this truly the lesson
you wish to bestow today?

694
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:04,896
Get the case.

695
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:19,744
Cynthia!

696
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:22,799
What happened? Come on, it's okay.

697
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,082
What did he do to her?

698
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:27,674
Hey, talk to me. Come on, it's okay.

699
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:40,220
You're okay. You're okay.

700
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,316
No thefts have been reported
in the last 12 hours.

701
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:52,003
So DeVoe managed to get
everything he needed.

702
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:55,273
And we still don't know
what his next step is.

703
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,711
You know, he said something
about the Enlightenment.

704
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:01,652
The hell's that supposed to mean?

705
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,381
I know what he's thinking.

706
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:04,804
I know what he's planning.

707
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,074
We know what he's planning.

708
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:07,660
- Harry, wait.
- What?

709
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,304
I can give them the CliffsNotes version.

710
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:10,179
No, no.

711
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:13,316
The component parts stolen
to create each satellite

712
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,566
will possess a 30...
cubit quantum system, okay,

713
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:19,330
and each system... is c-capable of...

714
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:21,933
Each system is capable of redirecting

715
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,601
concentrated dark matter back to Earth

716
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,418
in 10-million-megawatt bursts.

717
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,904
Which... Level of which

718
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,172
is toxic enough to affect

719
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:30,975
each and every human brain on the planet

720
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,027
and reboot them back to a...

721
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,545
Reboot them.

722
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,748
Back to a simplified state.

723
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,517
Just like mine.

724
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,400
DeVoe wants to remove the intelligence

725
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,535
of everyone on Earth?

726
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:43,888
Yes.

727
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,724
Exactly, Barry. Exactly right.

728
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:16,521
I'm really gonna do this.

729
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,157
You treat me...

730
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,426
like I am the only
woman in the multiverse,

731
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,828
and I want more.

732
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,296
What is wrong with me?

733
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,666
I don't know what's wrong with me.

734
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:34,005
I'm sorry.

735
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:35,106
Nothing's wrong.

736
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,443
Nothing at all.

737
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,004
I guess mayby sometimes,

738
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:50,388
one plus one just equals two, you know?

739
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,390
What are you gonna do?

740
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:14,779
Wait.

741
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,638
Good-bye, Cynthia.

742
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,373
Bye, Cisco.

743
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,558
Surprise!

744
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,910
What is this?

745
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,824
It's your baby shower, baby!

746
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:06,015
This is why you were singing

747
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:08,070
"The Girl From Ipanema"
in your head all day.

748
00:36:08,073 --> 00:36:09,616
He has been planning this for days.

749
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,935
Oh, this is so sweet!

750
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,879
I feel really guilty
pulling everybody away

751
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:14,991
at a time like this, but...

752
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:16,012
It's the perfect time to celebrate.

753
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:17,319
Surrounded by family.

754
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:18,632
You guys!

755
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,569
This baby is gonna be so loved.

756
00:36:21,572 --> 00:36:23,372
Aww.

757
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:27,485
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

758
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:35,259
Why don't you go talk to him?

759
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,802
Hey, man. Are you okay?

760
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,073
Not really, no.

761
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,877
Do you want some space, or...

762
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,413
Actually, I got plenty
of that right now.

763
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,555
I'm sorry for pushing the two of you.

764
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:09,393
I think you both did
the right thing, though.

765
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:15,366
Then why does it hurt so much?

766
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,467
Caitlin.

767
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,880
Look, I don't think you
should do that again.

768
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,715
You could have gotten yourself killed.

769
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:33,818
- I have to get her back.
- We will.

770
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,754
No. I will.

771
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:41,748
Clifford.

772
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:43,160
Clifford.

773
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:46,163
Ow! It's fine.

774
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:48,466
It's fine.

775
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,840
When the line cut out, I came.

776
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,408
Immediately.

777
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:03,014
I thought I'd lost you.

778
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:06,217
You'll never lose me, Clifford.

779
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,419
You were right.

780
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:10,448
Technology has become a cancer.

781
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:14,992
Driving civilization to consume itself.

782
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:17,128
A militia group found out
about the water purifier

783
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:19,730
that I created.

784
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:25,469
And they just killed dozens
of-of people to take it.

785
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:29,273
Women and children slaughtered.

786
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,976
For a simple piece of technology.

787
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,949
Your journal.

788
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,584
Wrote of a world where humanity forgot

789
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:45,189
that this technological
menace was capable.

790
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,878
But what I didn't tell you...

791
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:52,296
was that I saw the
truth in it even then.

792
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:53,898
And it frightened me.

793
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:58,903
And that's why I ran.

794
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,241
And I'm not frightened anymore.

795
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,576
You believe.

796
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:07,478
I believe in you.

797
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:11,649
Enlighten them, Clifford.

798
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:14,352
You're the only one who can.

799
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,493
I'm nothing without you.

800
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:41,112
The chair will rejuvenate
your fractured scaphoid.

801
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:43,347
Prepare the satellites for assembly.

802
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:50,821
I said, prepare the...

803
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,556
No!

804
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:58,029
Initially, we set out
to enlighten the world.

805
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,564
Now you want to rule it.

806
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:04,035
I am leaving you, Clifford.

807
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:13,110
Nothing can get in or out.

808
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,846
You dare orchestrate an exodus

809
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,983
on the eve of humanity's
greatest reckoning?

810
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:20,885
You made a vow.

811
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:22,219
To my husband!

812
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:26,924
But my husband is dead.

813
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,760
The Thinker's first victim.

814
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:34,231
The Enlightenment will
come for you too, Marlize.

815
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:36,734
I will be all that remains.

816
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:40,271
Oh, Clifford.

817
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:42,440
You are nothing without me.

818
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,588
Special delivery!

819
00:40:58,591 --> 00:41:00,873
Wow! You're super pregnant!

820
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,760
Looks like you're due about
21 days from tonight, I'd say.

821
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:05,129
I-I mean, if I were guessing.

822
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,248
Sweetheart, who is it?

823
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,896
Uh, someone sent us a diaper bag.

824
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,367
It looks like it's a gift from someone

825
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,409
who wanted you both to
know how special you are.

826
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:15,846
Someone who understands
that time is precious

827
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,242
and right now is all we've got.

828
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:20,845
- Aww.
- Relatively speaking.

829
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:22,924
- Dad?
- Hey, look what we got.

830
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,555
Oh! Who sent that? Wally?

831
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:27,424
Wally already sent us a bassinet,

832
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:31,021
which apparently was owned by Moses.

833
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:32,423
Was there a note?

834
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,793
Who was it?

835
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:37,495
Some delivery girl.

836
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:49,761
