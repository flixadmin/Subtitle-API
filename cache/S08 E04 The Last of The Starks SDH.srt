1
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,145
(Sobbing softly)

2
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,628
(Whispers indistinctly)

3
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,011
(Sansa sobbing)

4
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,469
Jon: We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

5
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,555
To our fathers and mothers.

6
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,516
To our friends.

7
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,647
Our fellow men and women
who set aside their differences...

8
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,442
To fight together...

9
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,862
And die together

10
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,782
so that others might live.

11
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,077
Everyone in this world

12
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,498
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

13
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,835
It is our duty and our honor

14
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,505
to keep them alive in memory...

15
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,050
For those who come after us

16
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,178
and those who come after them,

17
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,557
for as long as men draw breath.

18
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,355
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

19
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,526
And we shall never see
their like again.

20
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,332
(Sobs)

21
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,091
(People chattering indistinctly)

22
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,498
Have you seen Arya?

23
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,086
You can still smell
the burning bodies,

24
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,438
and that's where your head is at?

25
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,132
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

26
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,552
- Look, it's not about that.
- Of course it's about that, you twat.

27
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,720
Why shouldn't it be?

28
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,431
The dead are dead. You're not.

29
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,237
Daenerys: Gendry.

30
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,322
(Chattering stops)

31
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,575
That's right, isn't it?

32
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,207
Yes, your grace.

33
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,501
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

34
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,843
You are aware
he took my family's throne

35
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,636
and tried to have me murdered?

36
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,432
I didn't even know he was my father
until after he was dead.

37
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,518
Yes, he's dead.

38
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,562
His brothers are, too.

39
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,858
So who's lord of storm's end now?

40
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,903
I don't know, your grace.

41
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,821
Does anyone?

42
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,626
I think you should be
lord of storm's end.

43
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,129
(People murmuring quietly)

44
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,591
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

45
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,678
No, you are lord gendry Baratheon
of storm's end,

46
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,640
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

47
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,851
Because that is what I have made you.

48
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,531
To lord gendry Baratheon
of storm's end.

49
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,408
To gendry!

50
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,868
People: Lord gendry!

51
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,787
(All cheering)

52
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,705
Man: Gendry!

53
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,791
Man 2: Gendry! Man 3: Gendry!

54
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,210
Man 4: Lord gendry!

55
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,087
(All cheering)

56
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,213
Man 5: Gendry!

57
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,174
(Cheering and chattering continue)

58
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,843
Man 6: That's easy, isn't it?

59
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,765
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Samwell: Uh, hold on.

60
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,060
Tyrion: And a lord of storm's end
who will be forever onal to you.

61
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,937
- Come, my lord.
- See?

62
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,356
You're not the only one who's clever.

63
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,785
Woman: I have to go down
and get another barrel.

64
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,413
(Men laughing)

65
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,792
Jaime: We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

66
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,004
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

67
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:26,311
The last time I saw her, I told her
I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

68
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,980
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

69
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,608
- I do.
- So did you?

70
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,819
Never got the chance.

71
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,238
She did it to herself.

72
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,534
Or her god did it to her.

73
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,330
The lord of light.

74
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,751
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

75
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,877
and then

76
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
he fucks off.

77
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,841
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

78
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,011
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

79
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,138
will leave you
any happier than before.

80
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,742
And what if
I'm not trying to be happy?

81
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,727
Then you're in luck.

82
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,940
We may have defeated them,

83
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,276
but we still have us to contend with.

84
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,742
Thank you. I feel much better.

85
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,709
(Men laughing boisterously)

86
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,340
Man: More ale!

87
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,802
This is clever.

88
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,181
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

89
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,768
It's the same as the one
daeron Targaryen built

90
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,771
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

91
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,773
I liked that one.

92
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,859
Tyrion: You know our history
better than anyone.

93
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,488
That will be useful
as lord of winterfell.

94
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,032
I'm not lord of winterfell.

95
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,994
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of ned stark.

96
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,083
You don't want it.

97
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,295
I don't really want anymore.

98
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,381
I envy you.

99
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,094
You shouldn't envy me.

100
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,597
Mostly I live in the past.

101
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,730
Tormund: All of it. Man: Go on.

102
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,733
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

103
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,335
Tormund: We have to
celebrate our victory.

104
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,320
Vomiting is not celebrating.

105
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,654
Yes, it is.

106
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,865
- (People laughing)
- Ah!

107
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,450
To the dragon queen!

108
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,869
(All cheer)

109
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,788
To Arya stark, the hero of winterfell!

110
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,790
(All cheering)

111
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,711
- (Men grunting in unison)
- Woman: Drink!

112
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,629
(Grunting continues)

113
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,466
- (Growls)
- (All laughing)

114
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
(Tormund grunts)

115
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,059
Tormund: I'm fine!

116
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,019
(Tormund cackles)

117
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,817
(Lively chatter and laughter)

118
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,614
(Snorts)

119
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,782
Your turn.

120
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,371
- You are an only child.
- Oh.

121
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,165
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

122
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
- I did.
- I surmised it.

123
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,461
Mm-hm. Drink.

124
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,338
Go again.

125
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,423
Why does he get to go again?

126
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,425
Because it's my game.

127
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,054
You have danced with renly Baratheon.

128
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,058
- Uh...
- Tyrion: Drink.

129
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,395
- Man: The other way around!
- (Laughter)

130
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,522
I saw him riding that thing.

131
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,400
- We all did.
- No. No.

132
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,820
I saw him riding that thing.

133
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,905
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

134
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,325
That's why we all agreed
to follow him.

135
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,828
That's the kind of man he is.

136
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,454
(Crowd cheers)

137
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,580
He's little...

138
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,082
(Laughter)

139
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,458
But he's strong.

140
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,670
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

141
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,046
and get murdered for it!

142
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,551
Most people get bloody murdered,
they stay that way.

143
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,386
Not this one.

144
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,054
(Crowd laughing)

145
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,419
- Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.
- (Tormund scoffs)

146
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,560
He comes back and keeps fighting.

147
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,021
Here, north of the wall,
and then back here again.

148
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,400
He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.

149
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,027
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

150
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,072
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

151
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,367
- A madman or a king!
- (Crowd exclaims and laughs)

152
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,718
- Tyrion: Drink.
- Drink.

153
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,678
- Drink.
- (Both laughing)

154
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,355
(Indistinct chatter)

155
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,985
(Men exclaiming and laughing)

156
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,542
Brienne: Wrong!

157
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,711
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

158
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
(All laughing)

159
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,089
Tyrion: Mmm!

160
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,343
You were married. Before sansa.

161
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,929
- Drink.
- (Tyrion groans)

162
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,727
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

163
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,687
- No!
- (Both laughing)

164
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,701
You're a virgin.

165
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,998
(Podrick gulping)

166
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,167
That's a statement about the present.

167
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,045
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

168
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,922
have you slept with a man.

169
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,716
Or a woman.

170
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,266
I have to piss.

171
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,020
We did it! We faced those icy fucks.

172
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,941
Looked right into their blue eyes,
and here we are.

173
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,192
(Sighs)

174
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,612
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

175
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,073
(Guffawing)

176
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,119
Please pardon me for a moment.

177
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,054
(Drink pouring)

178
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,348
- Man: Drink it!
- (Crowd exclaims)

179
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,746
(Emotionally) And after all that,

180
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,541
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

181
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
Just takes her, like that.

182
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,672
I mean it, clegane.

183
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,424
My heart is broken.

184
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,842
Don't touch me.

185
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,427
Willa: You can touch me.

186
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

187
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,307
Maybe you should be.

188
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,477
(Tormund chuckling)

189
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,146
Well, clegane...

190
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,566
It's time to drown our sorrows.

191
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,443
I'm not done with my drink.

192
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,363
Man 1: You saved the day.

193
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,007
- Man 2: You owe me one.
- (Man 1 laughs)

194
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,368
- Don't forget that.
- Man 1: For the rest of my days.

195
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,953
Are you ready now?

196
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,331
This is my drink.

197
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,171
(Grunts exasperatedly)

198
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,265
Sansa: She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

199
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,771
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

200
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,025
- And what's that?
- That's my fucking business.

201
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,824
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

202
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,284
That was a long time ago.

203
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,496
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

204
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
Yes, I've heard.

205
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,667
Heard you were broken in.

206
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,253
Heard you were broken in rough.

207
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,174
And he got what he deserved.
I gave it to him.

208
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,552
How?

209
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,929
Hounds.

210
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,556
(Chuckles)

211
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,685
You've changed, little bird.

212
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,313
(Hound gulping)

213
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,236
None of it would have happened
if you'd left king's landing with me.

214
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,281
No littlefinger, no ramsay...

215
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,200
None of it.

216
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,253
Without littlefinger,
and ramsay and the rest,

217
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,756
I would have stayed
a little bird all my life.

218
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,816
(All laughing)

219
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,904
Man 1: Hey!
Man 2: Pour another one.

220
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,409
Man 3: Hey!

221
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,666
(Gasps)

222
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,335
Don't shoot.

223
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,883
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

224
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,510
You should be celebrating with them.

225
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,845
I am celebrating.

226
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,224
Yeah, I am, too.

227
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,145
I'm not gendry rivers anymore.

228
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,315
I'm gendry Baratheon,
lord of storm's end.

229
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,359
By order of the queen.

230
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,654
Congratulations.

231
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,034
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

232
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,661
I hardly know how to use a fork.

233
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,872
All I know is that you're beautiful,
and I love you,

234
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,959
and none of it will be worth anything
if you're not with me.

235
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
So be with me.

236
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,344
Be my wife.
Be the lady of storm's end.

237
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,201
You'll be a wonderful lord,

238
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,163
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

239
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,000
But I'm not a lady.

240
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,794
I never have been.

241
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,256
That's not me.

242
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,140
(Bowstring creaks)

243
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,224
(Wooo thuds)

244
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,648
(Soft thumping on door)

245
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,068
(Wind whistling softly)

246
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,658
You didn't drink.

247
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,288
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

248
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,834
- I drank.
- In the game. This is dornish.

249
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,215
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

250
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,343
Suit yourself.

251
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,272
Well, you keep it warm enough in here.

252
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,445
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the north.

253
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,447
Keep your fire going.

254
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,078
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

255
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,744
Well, that's very diligent.
Very responsible.

256
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,621
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

257
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,830
I learned in the north?

258
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,667
I hate the fucking north.

259
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,169
It grows on you.

260
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,340
I don't want things growing on me.

261
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,927
How about tormund giantsbane?

262
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,554
Has he grown on you?

263
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,016
He was very sad when you left.

264
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,561
You sound quite jealous.

265
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,232
I do, dontl?

266
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
It's bloody hot in here.

267
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,326
(Grunts)

268
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,959
Oh, move aside.

269
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,674
What are you doing?

270
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,884
I'm taking your shirt off.

271
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,267
I've never slept with a knight before.

272
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,104
I've never slept with anyone before.

273
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,859
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

274
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,986
I told you...

275
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,287
(Wind whistling)

276
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,711
Are you drunk?

277
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,470
(Grunts softly)

278
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,681
Only a little.

279
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,977
(Jon sighs)

280
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,111
I didn't know ser jorah well...

281
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,696
But I know this.

282
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,910
If he could have chosen a way to die,
it would have been protecting you.

283
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,663
He loved me.

284
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,126
And I couldn't love him back.

285
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,171
Not the way he wanted.

286
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,593
Not the way I love you.

287
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,889
Is that all right?

288
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,592
(Sighs)

289
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,764
- I wish you'd never told me.
- (Sighs)

290
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,809
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

291
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,396
I try to forget.

292
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,357
Tonight I did for a while,

293
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,152
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

294
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,405
I saw the way they looked at you.

295
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,450
I know that look.

296
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,079
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

297
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,582
Never on this side of the sea.

298
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,043
I told you I don't want it.

299
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,920
It doesn't matter what you want.

300
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,215
You didn't want to be
king in the north.

301
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,109
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

302
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,801
and take what is mine?

303
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,514
I'll refuse.

304
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,726
You are my queen.
I don't know what else I can say.

305
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,895
You can say nothing.

306
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,605
To anyone, ever.

307
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,357
Never tell them who you really are.

308
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,026
Swear your brother
and samwell tarly to secrecy,

309
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,611
and tell no one else.

310
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,739
Or it will take on a life of its own
and you won't be able to control it

311
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,241
or what it does to people.

312
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,785
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

313
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,828
no matter what you swear.

314
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,962
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

315
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,640
I have to tell sansa and Arya.

316
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:32,896
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the iron throne.

317
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,064
She won't.

318
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,984
She's not the girl you grew up with.

319
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,695
Not after what she's seen,

320
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,239
not after what they've done to her.

321
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,536
I owe them the truth.

322
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,039
Even if the truth destroys us?

323
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,874
- It won't.
- It will.

324
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,212
I've never begged for anything...

325
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,798
But I'm begging you.

326
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,719
Don't do this. Please.

327
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,935
You are my queen.

328
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,105
Nothing will change that.

329
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,776
And they are my family.

330
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,363
We can live together.

331
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,495
We can.

332
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,207
I've just told you how.

333
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,029
(Sighs softly)

334
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,620
Half are gone.

335
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,958
The northmen as well.

336
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,427
And the golden company
has arrived in king's landing,

337
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,304
courtesy of the greyjoy eret.

338
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,516
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

339
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,435
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

340
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,396
that we saved them...

341
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,481
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

342
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,818
We will hit her hard.

343
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,487
We will rip her out root and stem.

344
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,616
The objective here is to remove Cersei

345
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,701
without destroying king's landing.

346
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,875
Varys: Thankfully,
she is losing allies by the day.

347
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,630
Yara greyjoy has retaken
the iron islands in her queen's name.

348
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,466
The new prince of dorne
pledges his support.

349
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,760
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

350
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,387
as long as she sits
on the iron throne,

351
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,223
she can call herself
queen of the seven kingdoms.

352
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,518
We need the capital.

353
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,354
I watched the people
of king's landing

354
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,398
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

355
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,483
and that was before winter began.

356
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,279
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

357
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,782
Jon: We'll surround the city.

358
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,785
If the iron fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

359
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,495
the dragons will destroy them.

360
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,540
If the lannisters
and the golden company attack,

361
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,208
we'll defeat them in the field.

362
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,128
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

363
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,422
her reign is over.

364
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,220
All right.

365
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,973
Sansa: The men we have left
are exhausted.

366
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,434
Many of them are wounded.

367
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,604
They'll fight better if they have
time to rest and recuperate.

368
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,106
How long do you suggest?

369
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,694
I can't say for certain,
not without talking to the officers.

370
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,034
I came north to fight alongside you

371
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,745
at great cost to my armies and myself.

372
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,209
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

373
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,212
It's not just our people. It's yours.

374
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,049
You want to throw them into a war
they're not ready to fight?

375
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,344
The longer I leave my enemies alone,
the stronger they become.

376
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,892
The northern forces
will honor their promises

377
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,313
and their allegiance
to the queen of the seven kingdoms.

378
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,570
What you command, we will obey.

379
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,368
Tyrion: So...

380
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,287
If all are in agreement...

381
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,166
Jon and ser davos
will ride down the kingsroad

382
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,292
with the northern troops

383
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,087
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and unsullied.

384
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,048
A smaller group of us
will ride to white harbor,

385
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,550
and sail from there to dragonstone

386
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,220
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

387
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,267
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
as a guest of the lady of winterfell.

388
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,230
We have won the great war.

389
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,941
Now we will win the last war.

390
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,278
In all seven kingdoms,

391
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,114
men will live without fear and cruelty

392
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,825
under their rightful queen.

393
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,256
We need a word.

394
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,096
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

395
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,849
We'd be corpses
marching down to king's landing.

396
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,451
Arya's the one
that killed the night king.

397
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,477
Her men gave their lives
defending winterfell...

398
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,812
And we will never forget them.

399
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,999
That doesn't mean
that I want to knee! To someone who...

400
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,692
I swore myself and the north
to her cause.

401
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,985
I respect that.

402
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,197
You respect it?

403
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,575
We needed her.

404
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,121
We needed her army, her dragons.

405
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,333
You did the right thing.

406
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,294
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

407
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,795
we don't trust your queen.

408
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,258
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

409
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,593
She's not one of us.

410
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,553
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

411
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,846
you won't make many allies.

412
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,014
That's all right.

413
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,141
I don't need many allies.

414
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,019
- Jon: (Sighs) Arya...
- We're family.

415
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,521
The four of us.

416
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,274
The last of the starks.

417
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,988
I've never been a stark.

418
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,948
Sansa: You are.

419
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,285
You're just as much ned stark's child
as any of us.

420
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,120
You're my brother.

421
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,207
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

422
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,334
My brother.

423
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,343
It's your choice.

424
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,560
I need to tell you something.

425
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,191
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

426
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,487
What is it?

427
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,825
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

428
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,453
How can I promise to keep a secret
if I don't even know what it is?

429
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,955
Because we're family.

430
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,378
Swear it.

431
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,630
I swear it.

432
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,761
I swear it.

433
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,020
Tell them.

434
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,575
So she's going to stay here with you?

435
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,289
She's sworn to protect
the stark girls, so...

436
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,753
Say something snide.

437
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm happy.

438
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,631
I'm happy that you're happy.

439
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,888
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

440
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,056
(Laughs)

441
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,226
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

442
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,979
To climbing mountains.

443
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,315
To climbing mountains.

444
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,153
- What's she like down there?
- What?

445
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,947
That's not your concern.

446
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,700
I haven't been with a woman for years.

447
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,243
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

448
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,412
I am the imp, and I demand to know.

449
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,623
- Bronn: I knew you were fucking her.
- (Door thuds)

450
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,001
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

451
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,795
Must be like looking in the mirror.

452
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,421
Tyrion: Ser bronn of the Blackwater.

453
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,299
Where's your drink?

454
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,153
What are you...
What are you doing up north?

455
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,512
What are you doing with that?

456
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,679
Oh, this?

457
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,890
This is for you.

458
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,017
For both of you.

459
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,228
Tyrion: You're supposed to be south.

460
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,522
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

461
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,874
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

462
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,025
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

463
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,235
and what do I have to show?

464
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,903
You're a knight, thanks to me.

465
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,780
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

466
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,740
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

467
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,534
Power resides where men believe...

468
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,244
Bronn: Shut your mouth.

469
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,972
- Tyrion: I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

470
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,123
but say another word
and I will belt you.

471
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,750
See, I don't believe you'd do that.

472
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,001
(Grunts softly)

473
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,230
You couldn't do it on your best day,
you one-handed fuck.

474
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,630
And your best days are long gone.

475
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,924
(Groans) You broke my nose!

476
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,902
- Bronn: I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

477
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,178
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

478
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,305
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

479
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,600
Your sister offered me riverrun.

480
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,811
Nice big castle, good lands,

481
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,372
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

482
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,772
And you trust Cersei...

483
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,483
I knew your sister was dead
the second I saw those dragons.

484
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,111
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

485
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,113
but I'd still bet
on your dragon queen to win.

486
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,574
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

487
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,703
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

488
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,374
And that's good.
Of course, the odds change

489
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,543
if the dragon queen's hand
turns up dead.

490
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,588
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

491
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,381
- All of a sudden...
- Tyrion: May I speak?

492
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,009
Why not? Only death will shut you up.

493
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,052
(Breathing heavily)

494
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,223
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

495
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:55,435
If anyone offered me money
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

496
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,353
What's double riverrun?

497
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,606
Highgarden.

498
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,276
You could be lord of the reach.

499
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,029
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

500
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,907
He's not going to kill us.
He wouldn't be talking to us if...

501
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,366
(Crossbow cocking)

502
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,536
The way I see it,

503
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,580
I only need
one of the Lannister brothers alive.

504
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,416
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

505
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,627
Bronn: No? Who were your ancestors,

506
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,837
the ones who made your family rich?

507
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,505
Fancy lads in silk?

508
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,174
They were fucking cutthroats.

509
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,885
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

510
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,387
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

511
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,514
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

512
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,767
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

513
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,313
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

514
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,814
with their cocksucking ways.

515
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,653
Highgarden.

516
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,530
Give me your word.

517
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,242
You have my word.

518
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,456
None of this means a thing
until we take king's landing.

519
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,417
We ride south in the morning.

520
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,588
We could use an officer with
knowledge of the city's defenses.

521
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,965
Oh, no.

522
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,008
No, my fighting days are done.

523
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,595
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

524
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,473
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

525
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,809
Till then, don't die.

526
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,357
(Door closes)

527
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,711
For fuck's sake.

528
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,338
On your own?

529
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,091
Hound: Not anymore.

530
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,177
I don't like crowds.

531
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,930
Arya: Me neither.

532
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,267
Why not? They all love you now.

533
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,977
You're the big hero.

534
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,312
Don't like heroes.

535
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,110
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

536
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,946
Felt better than dying.

537
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,285
You're heading to king's landing?

538
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,496
I have some unfinished business.

539
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,291
Me too.

540
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,924
I don't plan on coming back.

541
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,511
Neither do I.

542
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,974
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

543
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,311
Probably.

544
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,229
(Chuckles)

545
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,070
(Growling softly)

546
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,952
(Roaring)

547
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,809
(Screeching)

548
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,439
My lady.

549
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,446
"My lord" is the standard response.

550
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,950
Why her?

551
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,997
Tyrion: You know
she loves your brother.

552
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,750
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

553
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,379
You seem determined to dislike her.

554
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,716
A good relationship
between the iron throne and the north

555
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,761
has been the core of every peaceful,
prosperous reign we've ever known.

556
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,640
Jon will be warden of the north,
so a good relationship seems likely.

557
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,687
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going fonnard.

558
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,397
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

559
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,361
Sansa, look at me.

560
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,580
With Jon in the capital,
you'll be the true power in the north.

561
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,167
I'd feel much better about the future
if I left here today

562
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,210
believing that you and Daenerys
were allies.

563
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,922
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

564
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,800
- Your queen still has her dragons...
- She's your queen, too.

565
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,427
(Soldiers marching)

566
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,684
You don't have to be her friend.

567
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,644
But why provoke her?

568
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,480
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

569
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,566
- or the north, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

570
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,281
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

571
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,786
I don't want Jon to go down there.

572
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,748
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

573
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:13,085
No, but as your brother once told me,
he's not a stark.

574
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,172
(Sighs)

575
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,509
Are you all right?

576
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,141
(Tyrion sighs)

577
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,810
Her people love her, you've seen that.

578
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,230
You've seen how they fight for her.

579
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,650
She wants to make the world
a better place.

580
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,070
I believe in her.

581
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,628
Tyrion.

582
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,384
What if there's someone else?

583
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,677
Someone better?

584
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,479
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

585
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,317
Jon: Just a horse.

586
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,945
Rhaegal needs to heal.

587
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,072
- He doesn't need me weighing him down.
- (Scoffs)

588
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,992
You weigh as much
as two eras fucking.

589
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,285
(Chuckles)

590
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,203
I'm taking the free folk home.

591
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,123
We've had enough of the south.

592
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,875
The women down here don't like me.

593
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,754
This is the north, you know.

594
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,758
And the free folk are welcome to stay.

595
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,386
It isn't home.

596
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,680
We need room to wander.

597
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,949
I'll take them back
through castle black

598
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,767
as soon as the winter storms pass.

599
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,853
Back where we belong.

600
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,817
It's where he belongs, too.

601
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,570
A dire wolf has no place in the south.

602
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,740
Will you take him with you?

603
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,410
He'll be happier up there.

604
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,288
So would you.

605
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,125
I wish I was going with you.

606
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,298
This is farewell, then.

607
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,301
You never know.

608
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,018
You've got the north in you.

609
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,979
The real north.

610
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,640
Yes, we”, um,
the nights have been getting longer

611
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,851
and there wasn't that much
to do in oldtown.

612
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,104
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

613
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,940
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

614
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,737
If it's a boy,
we want to name him "Jon."

615
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,534
I hope it's a girl.

616
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,832
(Jon sniffles)

617
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,005
(Both sniffle)

618
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,555
You're the best friend I ever had.

619
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,267
You too, Sam.

620
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,065
(Ghost whines)

621
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,015
(Men shouting indistinctly)

622
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,914
Tyrion: Think of the past 20 years.

623
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,375
The war, the murder, the misery.

624
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,337
All of it because Robert Baratheon
loved someone

625
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,297
who didn't love him back.

626
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,592
How many others know?

627
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,138
Including us? Eight.

628
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,182
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

629
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,683
It's information.

630
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,479
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

631
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,855
Then what happens?

632
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,690
She loses the north.

633
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,485
She loses the vale,
sansa will make sure of that.

634
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,111
No, it's worse than that.

635
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,780
He has the better claim to the throne.

636
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,699
He doesn't want the throne.

637
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,244
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

638
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,748
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

639
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,833
Wildlings, northmen.

640
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,170
He's a war hero.

641
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,051
He loves our queen.

642
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,555
And she loves him.

643
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,434
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

644
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,562
She's his aunt.

645
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,039
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

646
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,731
No, but Jon grew up in winterfell.

647
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,900
Is marrying your aunt
common in the north?

648
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,363
You know our queen better than I do.

649
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,126
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

650
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,035
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

651
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,788
Something she has in common
with every monarch who ever lived.

652
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,708
I worry about her state of mind.

653
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,960
We are advisors to the queen.

654
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,255
Worrying about her state of mind
is ourjob.

655
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,432
We still have to take king's landing.

656
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,643
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

657
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,854
That would solve our problems.

658
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,525
(Men shouting indistinctly)

659
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,408
(Dragons screeching)

660
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,469
(Yelps, screeching)

661
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,394
(Gurgung)

662
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,315
(Shrieking)

663
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,400
(Men shouting indistinctly)

664
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,993
- (Drogon roaring)
- (Gasping)

665
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,381
(Grunts)

666
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,843
(Men grunt)

667
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,262
(Grunts)

668
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,519
(Yelling)

669
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,024
(Grunting)

670
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,609
(Screeches)

671
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,085
(Men shouting indistinctly)

672
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,424
(Breathing heavily)

673
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,467
(Sighs)

674
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,221
(Grunts softly)

675
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,142
- (Men grunting)
- (Wood creaking)

676
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,439
Get to the skiff. Now!

677
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,441
(Soldiers shouting)

678
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:56,567
Soldier 1: Spears!

679
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,569
Soldier 2: They're coming round again!

680
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,364
(Grunts)

681
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,121
Soldier 3: Go!

682
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,456
Soldier 4: Clear!

683
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:12,958
(Grunts)

684
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,126
Woman: No!

685
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,172
(Soldiers yelling)

686
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,715
(Tyrion panting)

687
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,765
(Grunts)

688
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:33,747
Soldier 4: Go! Soldier 5: Clear!

689
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,022
(Wood creaking)

690
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,243
(All coughing and groaning)

691
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,795
(Tyrion panting)

692
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,515
(Panting)

693
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,475
Missandei?

694
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,353
Missandei!

695
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,735
Missandei!

696
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,949
(People clamoring)

697
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,826
Cersei: Our message
was well-received, then?

698
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:32,120
Qyburn: Your people have heard
the usurper is coming.

699
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:37,084
They are grateful for your protection
within the walls of the red keep.

700
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,754
You're certain about the dragon?

701
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,632
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

702
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,801
That must have been glorious.

703
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,389
The glory is yours, my queen.

704
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,142
When the war is won,
the lion shall rule the land,

705
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,978
the kraken shall rule the sea...

706
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,566
And our child
shall one day rule them all.

707
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,201
(Euron sighs)

708
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,084
She's coming for you.

709
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,461
Of course she is.

710
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,924
Keep the gates open.

711
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,653
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

712
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,888
thousands of innocent people first.

713
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,438
So much for the "breaker of chains."

714
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,940
(Panting)

715
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:44,943
(Door opens)

716
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,945
(Continues panting)

717
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,030
(Door closes)

718
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,829
Grey worm: We will storm the city,
my queen.

719
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,665
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

720
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,417
Varys: Your grace.

721
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,756
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

722
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,925
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

723
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,931
This is a mistake.

724
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,353
You saw my child fall from the sky.

725
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,439
They took missandei.

726
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,233
Varys: Cersei needs to be destroyed,

727
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:29,321
but if we attack king's landing
with drogon and the unsullied

728
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:33,033
and the Dothraki, tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

729
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:36,620
That is why Cersei
is bringing them into the red keep.

730
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:41,083
These are the people
you came here to protect.

731
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,126
I beg you, your grace.

732
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,546
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

733
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,801
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

734
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,016
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, lord varys?

735
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,273
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

736
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,110
That is my destiny...

737
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,947
And I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

738
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,915
It could be a fortnight
before Jon and the allied armies

739
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,208
make it to king's landing.

740
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,087
In the meantime,
demand Cersei's surrender.

741
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,340
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

742
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,469
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

743
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,304
we should make the effort.

744
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,349
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

745
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,021
But perhaps it's good the people see

746
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,816
that Daenerys stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

747
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,193
and Cersei Lannister refused.

748
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,198
They should know whom to blame
when the sky falls down upon them.

749
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,340
I've served tyrants most of my life.

750
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,761
They all talk about destiny.

751
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,931
She's a girl who walked into a fire
with three stones

752
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,642
and walked out with three dragons.

753
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,479
How could she not believe in destiny?

754
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,564
Perhaps that's the problem.

755
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,650
Her life has convinced her that
she was sent here to save us all.

756
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,569
And how do you know she wasn't?

757
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,698
Then there's the problem of Jon snow.

758
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,083
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

759
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,086
You know them both.

760
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:52,214
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

761
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,434
- He doesn't want the throne.
- (Drink pouring)

762
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,932
That's why he bent the knee.

763
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,142
Have you considered the best ruler

764
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,936
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

765
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,022
We're discussing treason.

766
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,828
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

767
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,694
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

768
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,658
He's temperate and measured.

769
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,912
He's a man, which makes him more
appealing to the lords of Westeros,

770
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,455
whose support we are going to need.

771
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,208
Joffrey was a man.

772
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,252
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

773
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,419
as I'm sure you'd agree.

774
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,588
And he's the heir to the throne.

775
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:37,467
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

776
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,639
What about my earlier proposal?

777
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,725
They could rule together
as king and queen.

778
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,062
She's too strong for him.

779
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,400
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

780
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,069
He could temper her worst impulses.

781
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,946
As you have?

782
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,201
You're drinking quite a lot.

783
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:09,207
A Targaryen father and a stark mother.

784
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,751
Jon's the one man alive

785
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,880
who might actually be able to keep
the north in the seven kingdoms.

786
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,440
How many kings and queens
have you served?

787
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,757
Five? Six? I've lost count.

788
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,010
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

789
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,693
you choose a person you believe in,
and you fight for that person.

790
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,182
Even if you know it's a mistake?

791
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,810
I believe in our queen.

792
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,856
She'll make the right choice.

793
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,944
With the help of her onal advisors.

794
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,075
You know where my onalty stands.

795
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,494
You know I will never
betray the realm.

796
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,079
What is the realm?

797
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,998
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

798
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,209
most of whom don't care
who sits on the iron throne.

799
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,127
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

800
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,421
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

801
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,133
We don't know their names,
but they're just as real as you and I.

802
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,509
They deserve to live.

803
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,428
They deserve food for their children.

804
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,144
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

805
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,857
So, what happens to her?

806
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,824
Please.

807
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,669
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

808
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,673
Each of us has a choice to make.

809
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,260
I pray we choose wisely.

810
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,105
(Grunts)

811
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,274
(People chattering indistinctly)

812
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,911
Man 1: All right,
I'll put another one on it.

813
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,589
Man 2: He's headed down to the cellar.

814
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,825
Man 3: I'll need a cart over here.
Man 4: That's it, thanks.

815
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,743
Thank you.

816
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,630
As are the rest of her advisors.

817
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:24,217
What happened?

818
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,892
Euron greyjoy ambushed
queen Daenerys and her eret.

819
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,397
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

820
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,898
missandei captured.

821
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,738
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

822
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,615
Seems like I won't get the chance.

823
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,823
(Door closes)

824
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,584
(Grunting softly)

825
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,060
They're going to destroy that city.

826
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,938
You know they will.

827
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,607
Jaime: Have you ever
run away from a fight?

828
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,028
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

829
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,280
You're better than she is.

830
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,866
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

831
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,785
You don't need to die with her.

832
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,578
Stay here.

833
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,748
(Voice breaking) Stay with me.

834
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,626
Please.

835
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,462
Stay.

836
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,762
You think I'm a good man?

837
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:41,896
I pushed a boy out a tower window,
crippled him for life

838
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:43,773
for Cersei.

839
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,696
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

840
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,782
just to get back to Cersei.

841
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,245
I would have murdered

842
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,707
every man, woman and child in riverrun

843
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:02,709
for Cersei.

844
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,378
(Inhales sharply)

845
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,969
She's hateful.

846
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,431
And so am I.

847
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,184
(Sobbing)

848
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,565
- (Horse neighs)
- (Hooves thumping)

849
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,109
(Breathing shakily)

850
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,218
(Soldier shouts indistinctly)

851
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,735
(Gate rattling)

852
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,670
My lord.

853
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,052
Queen Daenerys demands
Cersei's unconditional surrender

854
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,679
and the immediate release
of missandei of naath.

855
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,560
Queen Cersei demands
Daenerys's unconditional surrender.

856
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,522
If she refuses, missandei of naath
will die here and now.

857
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:14,567
Beurn...

858
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,820
You're a rational man.

859
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:20,406
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

860
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,367
We have a chance here,

861
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,579
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

862
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,289
Yes.

863
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,000
Help me.

864
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,379
I don't want to see this city burn.

865
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,341
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

866
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,304
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

867
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,767
I... I don't want to hear it.

868
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,186
Help me save this city.

869
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,816
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

870
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,109
Tyrion: Your queen.

871
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,820
Cersei is queen of the seven kingdoms.

872
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,029
You are her subject.

873
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,739
Her reign is over.

874
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,867
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

875
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,370
We understand nothing of the sort.

876
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,040
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

877
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,293
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

878
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,797
while ours have been reinforced
with the golden compan...

879
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,882
(Tyrion breathing heavily)

880
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,524
Captain: Ready!

881
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,818
Nock!

882
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:42,780
Draw!

883
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,143
(Inhales deeply)

884
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,783
(Exhales)

885
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:52,099
I know you don't care
about your people.

886
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,311
Why should you?

887
01:11:57,355 --> 01:12:00,191
They hate you and you hate them.

888
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,407
But you're not a monster.

889
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,078
I know this.

890
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,499
I know this because I've seen it.

891
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,339
You've always loved your children.

892
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,802
- More than yourself...
- (Breathes shakily)

893
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,262
More than Jaime...

894
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,558
More than anything.

895
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,728
I beg you.

896
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,484
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

897
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,990
Your reign is over,

898
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,577
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

899
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,499
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

900
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,046
(Exhales shakily)

901
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,926
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

902
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,316
(Panting)

903
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,531
(Breathing shakily)

904
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,410
Dracarys.

905
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,043
(Missandei breathing sharply)

906
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,129
(Softly) No.

907
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,862
(Breath trembling)

908
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,281
(Exhales shakily)

909
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,833
(Seething)

910
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,986
(Drogon screeches)
