1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,520
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,000
- I'm Charlie.
- We're The Smell. We're a band.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,080
<i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,200
<i>Remember when we dented history?</i>

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,440
I have encountered a glitch
during the Heyworld event.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,440
<i>- Find me.</i>
- Your sister is the dent.

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,840
<i>Maybe her being here,
she'll remember who she was.</i>

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,840
Hope The Smell plays
Assassination Nation, tonight.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
Could give a rat's ass
what they play,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,400
long as Charlie isn't AWOL
two nights in a row.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,640
Six quid. Don't be cheeky.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
Ian's dead, Dec.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
We've got to get out of here
before that psycho finds us.

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,320
What do you want?

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Clotho.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
Who the bloody hell is a Clotho?

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,880
The lead singer of your band.

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
You mean Charlie? She left days ago.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
Don't hurt me.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,720
My sister should know by now
she can't outrun fate.

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,440
{\an5}Wait. Are we screaming because this
is weird, or because it's awesome?

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
This is...

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,680
a nightmare.

24
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,640
How did I even get in your room?

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,360
{\an5}<i>You slept walked into Dr. Heywood's
room at approximately 2.30am.</i>

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>I tried to wake you,</i>

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,440
{\an5}<i>but you assaulted my mainframe,
repeating, snooze.</i>

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
All right,
let's just be cool about this, okay?

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
I still have my pajamas on,
which means we didn't...

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,800
- Oh, my God.
- Like, take it easy.

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,280
{\an5}You slept walked into my room,

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
{\an5}which means something
must have brought you in here,

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,840
{\an5}and let's not forget,
in another timeline, you and I...

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Wait, don't start with
the dream girl crap.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm still trying to process
how I spent the last five hours on...

36
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,080
{\an5}- What is this, 200-thread count?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,240
I got to go.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,520
You're up early.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
What are you doing?

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,240
{\an5}Looks like somebody was playing
Operation with Gideon's mainframe.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,920
{\an5}Or maybe it was something.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
{\an5}You think they have raccoons
in the temporal zone?

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,040
- <i>Actually, Mr. Tarazi, it was...</i>
- Snooze, Gidget!

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,440
{\an5}Hey. You left this in my bedroom.

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,480
- Oh, wow!
- Well, looky, looky.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,480
- We didn't hook up.
- We did not hook up.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,400
{\an5}It doesn't have to be a walk of shame
if you enjoyed it.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,000
{\an5}But if you're walking at all,
you didn't enjoy it enough.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Gross, Charlie.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
{\an5}Hey, B, me and Z did not do,
you know...

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
- No.
- The nasty.

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,400
This is a judgment free zone.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,320
I'm not one to shame the sexual
activity of two consenting adults.

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Shame's a good thing.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
Keeps you from hooking up
with someone and...

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,240
{\an5}ending up the parent
of a 16-year-old daughter.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,120
Oh, ooh! Well, what naughty business
have I stumbled across, then?

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
{\an5}Nothing, we just...

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,280
{\an5}We like hanging out
in the hallways, now...

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Goodbye.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,160
{\an5}Well, then, Charlie,

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,440
{\an5}we have some business to attend to,
love.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,640
We do, but first whiskey.

64
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
All right, then.

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
{\an5}<i>A stiff drink may indeed be in order.</i>

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,120
{\an5}<i>I have some rather unfortunate news
for you, Charlie.</i>

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Charlie.

68
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
We came as soon as we heard.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,680
Look, the Prognosticator's scanning
the timeline for Encore activity.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,160
Trust me, we're going to figure out
who's responsible for this.

71
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,360
{\an5}This wasn't the work of an Encore.

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,480
This was my sister. Atropos.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
How can you tell?

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
{\an5}<i>The victim was burned
from the inside.</i>

75
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,000
{\an5}She's a God.
That's her signature move.

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, I'm sorry about your friends,
Charlie,

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,200
but your sister just fired one hell
of a warning shot.

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,360
Now we need to get back out there

79
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,920
and find that Loom piece
before she does.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,880
God. Will you just piss off, John?

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
Hey, Charlie...

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
{\an5}Look, I'm sorry,
I've... I've lost friends, too.

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
I know what you're going through.

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
{\an5}Look, I respect your condolences,

85
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,200
{\an5}but you don't have a bloody clue
what I'm going through.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
{\an5}Well, she's right.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
We're putting the hunt
for the Loom on hold.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
And it's probably for the best.

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,120
{\an5}With Ray gone,
we're still trying to find our feet.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,440
{\an5}It gives us time to make a game plan.

91
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
But we do have a game plan.

92
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
We need to get the next piece.

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,720
{\an5}Look, John, if you want to help,
then look into what we're up against.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
She's a God.

95
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,720
I don't want to take the team
into a situation we can't get out of.

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,640
Yeah, yeah, all right. All right.

97
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,840
I overstepped the mark, didn't I?
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
{\an5}I am sorry, Charlie.

99
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,520
{\an5}But my promise to Astra and her mum
cannot wait for your tears to dry.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,520
<i>Ostende mihi viam.</i>

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
Welcome back... sis.

102
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
Lachesis.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
You smell of that slowly dying world
filled with apathy.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,400
Any luck?

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,760
Clotho has taken on a vulgar
mortal name.

106
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,440
Charlie.

107
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,640
Oh, this is too good to be true.

108
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
Elaborate.

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,800
My protege, Astra, happens to know
of a time-traveler

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,040
who's looking for our Loom.

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
One of his companions is a woman
who goes by Charlie.

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
A time-traveler.

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,040
That's how Clotho has eluded me.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,880
Fortunately,
I can track John Constantine.

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,840
<i>Without Fate, the mortals are making
a mess of their lives.</i>

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,240
<i>With our Loom,
order can be restored.</i>

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,560
Find John Constantine,
and you'll find our sister.

118
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
And when you do...

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,160
make it a hell of a family reunion.

120
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Gideon, the next time
John steals the Jumpship,

121
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,000
a little heads-up would be nice.

122
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,880
<i>Thanks to Ms. Tarazi,
I'm still stuck on snooze mode.</i>

123
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,120
Is your sister just looking for you,
or is she looking for the Loom?

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
Both, I reckon.

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,520
We have to go after him.

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
"We"?

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,720
That bastard is the reason
I'm mortal, I don't owe him squat.

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
He's going after the ring.

129
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,200
You're the only one who knows
where he's headed.

130
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,200
Look, we'll be in and out.

131
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,320
Okay, fine.

132
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,240
The sooner we get going, the sooner
I can get back to drinking in peace.

133
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,520
Great, let's portal.

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,240
Parenting sucks!

135
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,800
Maybe I should stay, huh?

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,160
Are you volunteering for Rory duty?

137
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,280
Ava Sharpe,
you are a better woman than I.

138
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,400
Okay, babe,
catch you on the flip side.

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Stay safe.

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
The ring's that way.

141
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,360
He couldn't have gotten too far.
Let's gear up in the Jumpship.

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,880
Kid's not into bears, huh?

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
- She ripped its head off.
- Yeah, I see that.

144
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, like father, like daughter.

145
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,960
I mean, hey, you should be proud.
At least she's tough like you.

146
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,760
She said I ruined her life.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,680
Now I got to portal back
to that stupid reunion party

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,600
and stop myself from sleeping
with Ali.

149
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are so many
reasons why that's a bad idea.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
- Don't care.
- Stop!

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,840
You can't just erase
your daughter's existence, Mick.

152
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,720
There... there has to be
another option.

153
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,720
What?

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
What if we go back through
the last 15 years and we...

155
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,400
And we place you into all
of her key memories?

156
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Like a highlight reel?

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,040
Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of what Rip did with me,

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
programmed me with a bunch
of memories

159
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,480
that added up to be a childhood.

160
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
It wasn't perfect,
but I turned out okay.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
She's not a clone.

162
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,360
Ouch. Yeah, she's not a...

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,320
But she is programmable, in a sense.

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,640
- Won't work.
- Why?

165
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
I spent the first ten years
of her life in prison.

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Right.

167
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,280
I have an idea.

168
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
You sure hid this one well.

169
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Didn't think I'd ever be coming
back here, did I?

170
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,920
Huh. That's cool!

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,960
It looks like<i>Supernatural's</i>
filming here.

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,280
Super what?

173
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,400
You've never seen it?

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,240
It's this show about these
two hot brothers who fight demons.

175
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
I wonder if the Winchester brothers
are here.

176
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,480
- Seriously?
- Dean is my hall pass.

177
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,160
I bet you used to wild out
back in the day.

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,880
There was no drinking on the job.

179
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,240
It's kind of the occupational hazard

180
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,400
of having the fate of humanity
in your hands.

181
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,640
So you guys literally
used to weave fate?

182
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,760
I mean, it's not like it is
in the storybooks, but... yeah.

183
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
I spun up the threads of each life.

184
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,040
Old Lachesis, she measured out
how long each life got to be.

185
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,920
And then Atropos, she...

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,200
- So she killed...
- Everyone.

187
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,080
And she bloody loved it.

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Hello?

189
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,840
Greetings, sibling of mine.

190
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Meow?

191
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
You okay, Z?

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
Is this about the Nate thing?

193
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,160
I hope not, because then I'm going to
be wondering why you just said meow,

194
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,640
and I definitely don't want to know.

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,680
I think I may be losing it.

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,600
And not like when I saw Tupac's
hologram at the 2044 Grammys...

197
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,520
but, like, mentally losing it.

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,280
Something is wrong with me.

199
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,560
Hey, hey! Deep breaths.

200
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,720
This is like a form of therapy where
you get to beat up your problems.

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
Trust me.

202
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,040
Whoa. Did you just beat me?

203
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
Behrad, I don't know how
to play video games.

204
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,800
But it's like I'm being haunted
by someone who does.

205
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
Someone who dresses like
a teenage boy

206
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,360
and makes me do awful things like
eat donuts and cuddle with Nate.

207
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
Whoa.

208
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,080
- How did you do that?
- How did I do that?

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,560
Well, what have we got here?

210
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, what the bloody hell is that?

211
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,160
It's a prop.

212
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
Now, what did I tell you
about Loom patrol?

213
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,400
Yeah well, we're out here, aren't we?
So let's just find the damn thing.

214
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,600
Oh, yeah, have you scanned
the woods for activity?

215
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
Huh? You have a plan
if Atropos shows up?

216
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,560
Well, I clipped Charlie's
shapeshifter wings.

217
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,680
So no offense, love,
I think I can handle her sister.

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,640
Have you not heard anything
Charlie said?

219
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Because it's not gonna be that easy.

220
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840
<i>- Clotho!</i>
- As long as you're crashing

221
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,760
on my ship, you're my responsibility,

222
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,800
and I say we are going back to figure
out a secure way to do this.

223
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah, well, that Loom is your ticket
to stopping the Encores.

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,760
- I'm helping you out.
<i>- You can't hide from your family.</i>

225
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,880
Guys!

226
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,040
The Jumpship.

227
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,400
<i>I'm coming for you, Clotho.</i>

228
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
My sister...

229
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
She's here.

230
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,680
Ava, we need backup.

231
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Ava!

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,440
Damn it. With the Jumpship gone,
the comms are down.

233
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
What, so we're stuck here?

234
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,040
The team will come
looking for us eventually.

235
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,880
We need these more than Sam and Dean.

236
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,400
You've walked us right
into a bloody death trap.

237
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,040
And that was my only option,
all right?

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,640
If she gets a hand on one piece
of the Loom,

239
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
then she can get the next,

240
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
and then she's that much closer
to controlling us all.

241
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,200
And I'd bet my bottom dollar
she's out there now looking for it,

242
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,280
not standing around having a row
in the middle of the bloody forest.

243
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
Damn it, John.

244
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,280
The stupid thing is that way.

245
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,480
By building Heyworld,
we changed the future,

246
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,920
which caused a bifurcation
in the timeline

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,960
radiating from that one moment.

248
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,120
Think of it as a historical traffic
accident, and you're the dent.

249
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,760
Yeah, I'm not thinking of myself
as a dent.

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,600
Okay, so what you think
of as a haunting is a temporal echo.

251
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
She is the you before...

252
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
well, you.

253
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Okay, let's just get
something straight,

254
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,680
there is only one Zari Tarazi.

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,840
I filed a trademark.

256
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,640
Do you know what this means?
You were a Legend.

257
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,800
From what you said about the hacking,

258
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,600
you were probably our computer
expert.

259
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,920
And the Air Totem responded to you.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,520
You two probably shared it.

261
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
- Wonder Twins!
- Wonder Twins!

262
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,720
And we probably had a really
super cute couple name,

263
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,160
just off the top of my head,
probably something like SteelHacker.

264
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,320
The three of us probably hung out
all the time, getting stoned.

265
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,720
- Oh, man.
- Playing ring-toss with donuts.

266
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
She probably helped you save
the world.

267
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,840
- More than once.
- Yeah.

268
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,400
She sounds pretty cool, huh?

269
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Yeah.

270
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Yeah, she does.

271
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,560
We got to move faster.
She could be anywhere.

272
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,600
<i>Clotho, you can't escape.</i>

273
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

274
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,080
We need to keep moving, love.

275
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>Where are you now?</i>

276
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
<i>Come to me...</i>

277
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,400
<i>or your friends will die.</i>

278
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Charlie?

279
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,560
- Mick?
- What?

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,960
I think Ali was discharged
from the hospital early

281
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,200
because a taxi cab
just pulled up outside.

282
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
- Wait, this was supposed to be a...
- Yeah.

283
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
surprise.

284
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,120
Is that what they're gonna say
at Iron Heights

285
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,560
when they find your empty cell?

286
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
What the hell are you doing here,
Mick?

287
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, hi, I'm Ava Sharpe.

288
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm Mr. Rory's CO.

289
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,360
Yeah, I arranged for some visitation
in exchange for some information.

290
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

291
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,120
Mr. Rory's helped us bring in some
of history's most dangerous...

292
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,320
- criminals.
- What? I...

293
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Okay, well, visiting hours are over.
Me and my baby are tired.

294
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
Right.

295
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Wow.

296
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,080
- From the Victorian England time...
- Collection.

297
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,520
Collection at... at Pottery Barn.

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,320
I don't know much about
Victorian England, but...

299
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,360
it's really beautiful.

300
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
I bet she is, too.

301
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,240
Mick, meet your daughter.

302
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Lita.

303
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
Hey, how about we all get together

304
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,240
so that Lita can remember this moment
with her dad forever.

305
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah? Let's take a picture.

306
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,960
Mickey!

307
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
Smiles.

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Wait a minute.
Did you break into my house?

309
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,200
{\an5}<i>Garima lifted the king's
decapitated head.</i>

310
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
Dumb bastard.

311
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
You like that?

312
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Daddy?

313
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,880
Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy?

314
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,760
Yes!

315
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,640
Whoa!

316
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
Say, cheese.

317
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
Say, cheese.

318
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,960
Kirk, we can get you new pants.

319
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,200
How's that for a highlight reel?

320
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,520
Pretty good.

321
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,960
Hello, Clotho.

322
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,560
Look at you.

323
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,480
Alone, after destroying our family.

324
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,640
Look, I didn't do it to hurt you,
all right?

325
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,440
We took care of you,
and you took everything we had.

326
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,640
People deserve to be free.

327
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,600
And what have they done
with this freedom you gave them?

328
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,840
They got women the vote.

329
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,200
They invented punk rock.

330
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,160
Introduced mass genocide,

331
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,080
nuclear bombs, pollution,
systematic incarceration.

332
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,680
- No. I didn't...
- And after all you did to help them,

333
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
how did they thank you?

334
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,320
By locking you in prison.

335
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,360
We would never let anyone
hurt you like that, little sister.

336
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Now, lead me to our Loom.

337
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,480
And perhaps, in time,
we can forgive you.

338
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Hey!

339
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,240
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

340
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
John, I could use a little help!

341
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm on it. I'm on it.

342
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
Let's try...

343
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
Hemlock! All right, all right. Yes.

344
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,360
Toadstool.

345
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,920
Got it.

346
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,520
Now all I need is a little bit of...

347
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,440
Blood.

348
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,240
<i>Te vocare, veni in auxilium mihi.</i>

349
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Go. Grab Charlie,
get the hell out of here.

350
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll find you.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
You're gonna be okay. Come on.

352
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Hey, let's wait for John here.

353
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
John's dead, Sara.

354
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Atropos doesn't let people live.

355
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,080
Come on. We've got to keep going.

356
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,760
- It's okay.
- It's not.

357
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,160
I mean, you saw what happened
back there. I'm one of them.

358
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,640
No matter what I do, I'm never gonna
be able to escape them.

359
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,320
And now I've gone
and got John killed.

360
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,240
Hey, look, John always finds a way.

361
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,480
Always finds a way to do what?

362
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh, thank God.

363
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,120
Yeah. I'd rather not, love.

364
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
Hey, your sister,
she's a nasty piece of work,

365
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,880
but it takes more than
amateur knife tricks to do me in.

366
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
Now, let's get the hell out of here,
shall we,

367
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
before she realizes I'm not
bleeding out on the forest floor.

368
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
Who are you?

369
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,640
Talking to donuts now?

370
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,760
LOL.

371
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,680
This alternate timeline stuff's
got you really shaken up, huh?

372
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,920
Ever since Mithra came into my life,
I've been the center of attention.

373
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,840
It's weird to have to share
the spotlight.

374
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Says the older sister
to the younger brother.

375
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,960
Right. Sorry.

376
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,960
Back to me, it's a lot to take in.

377
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,960
I mean, this other Zari sounds so...

378
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,840
smart and substantive,

379
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
like a cool third-wave feminist
superhero that you and...

380
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,880
Nate seemed to like better than me.

381
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,880
First off, Nate is just a sucker
for doomed romances.

382
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,160
Secondly, of course
I don't like her better than you.

383
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,840
You're my favorite Zari of all time.

384
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,600
But...

385
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,760
But?

386
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,520
You said you wanted to leave
your whole Z-Nation life behind,

387
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,200
find out what else you're capable of.

388
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,880
This whole situation seems
like a giftwrapped opportunity

389
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
for self-exploration.

390
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
Self-exploration?

391
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, I propose...

392
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,680
a totem quest.

393
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,240
Go into the totem,
speak to our ancestors.

394
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,520
How do I go into the totem?

395
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,320
With a little psychotropic
assistance.

396
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
I knew this would lead to drugs.

397
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
It's totally safe.

398
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,680
I've done it in the past when
I've been wrestling with big problem.

399
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,360
It's no crazier than talking
to a donut.

400
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
I know that face.

401
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,040
That's the one where you don't want
to admit I'm right.

402
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,400
No, it isn't.

403
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
Totem-town, here we come.

404
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,200
She played me like a fiddle.

405
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,560
I almost gave her the Loom.

406
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,040
Our family knows all
of our weaknesses.

407
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,080
I don't know. Maybe she's right.

408
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,960
- I belong with them.
- Come on, Charlie.

409
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,160
Look, I'm a coward, Sara.

410
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,720
I can't even stand up
to my own sister.

411
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,120
Hey, listen to me.

412
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,960
No one is responsible
for the family they're born into.

413
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,480
All that matters
is who they decide to be,

414
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,640
and you've decided to be brave
and big-hearted.

415
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,760
Thanks, boss.

416
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
But I am what I am.

417
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
She's gonna love it.

418
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,400
- Surprise.
- What's this?

419
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,480
Nice. It's a keepsake album.

420
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,080
So I can never forget all the times
that you bailed on me.

421
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,360
Well, I was in prison.

422
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,840
Not since 2015.

423
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,560
You know, I never actually
went to homecoming.

424
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,320
I went back inside to get my purse,

425
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
and when I came back out,
you were gone.

426
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,600
And I kept telling Kirk to wait

427
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,320
because I wanted to say
goodbye to you.

428
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,120
But you had bailed like always.

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
So, keep it.

430
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Fine.

431
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,240
Oh, and there's that patented
Mick Rory fade.

432
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
You know, good old Dad.

433
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,280
Just run away like you always do,
yeah?

434
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I...

435
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm sorry.

436
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,600
Rory, it was a terrible idea,

437
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,480
and I never should have suggested it,
okay?

438
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,400
Rory. Listen to me, we can fix this.

439
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,160
- No, we can't.
- Yes, we can.

440
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,840
Look, I made a mistake
and I feel really bad,

441
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,320
but that doesn't give us the right
to keep hurting Lita

442
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,360
any more than we already have. Right?

443
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,440
Maybe it's not about the gifts

444
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,200
and the money, and the big birthday
parties, you know?

445
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,400
I think it's time that you go back
in there

446
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
and do what we should have done
from the beginning.

447
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,560
- Go back and kick myself in the
- No!

448
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,000
No.

449
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,200
Just go tell her you're sorry.

450
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,800
I guess you're right.

451
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,680
No shortcuts.

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
What happened to this place?

453
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
Whoa.

454
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,120
It's the crew.

455
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,080
Wait. If they're dead,
who's shooting Season 15?

456
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,120
You leave a piece of the Loom of Fate
somewhere long enough,

457
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
there's gonna be consequences.

458
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,200
Don't worry about it. I'll nab it.

459
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,720
No, John.

460
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,760
Look, this is my mess, all right?

461
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
I'll do it.

462
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,880
Look, all I got to do is run over
there,

463
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,120
put my hand in that hole,
grab the ring, Bob's your uncle.

464
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,880
All right, well, then let's go
before your sister shows up.

465
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,480
What's going on? Hey, girl.

466
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,680
Zari just took some Lyoga root.

467
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,080
She needs a little totem trip
to figure out her stuff.

468
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,080
Gideon, what's the status
with the away team?

469
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
<i>The Jumpship is not responding.</i>

470
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,840
Gideon, we talked about this.

471
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,080
Unsnooze, you need to tell me about
things before they happen, not after.

472
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,840
Okay, we should help them.

473
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,040
Ooh. Oh. I feel high already.

474
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
Is it too late to detox?

475
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,600
That's the fun of drugs.
You can't untake them.

476
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
Besides, this is important.

477
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,880
Everything is going to be fine, sis.

478
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Okay.

479
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
I surrender.

480
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,520
Hello?

481
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,920
Ancestors?

482
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,000
Where are all the old people at?

483
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,680
Who you calling old?

484
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,040
So, if you're here, does that mean...

485
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,240
Maman and Baba...

486
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Behrad?

487
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,840
No, B's back on the Waverider.

488
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Who do you think gave me the drugs?

489
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,120
He's alive?

490
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,400
Yeah, of course. Maman and Baba<i>,</i> too.

491
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
Are you okay?

492
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Yeah.

493
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Yeah.

494
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
So, why are you even asking me
about Behrad?

495
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,480
I thought this was about me and
the strange visions I've been having.

496
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,160
Wow. New me came out shockingly
self-absorbed.

497
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Who are you calling the new you?

498
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,240
Who even are you?

499
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,560
Well, you...

500
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
if the Legends hadn't saved
the world,

501
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,080
and you grew up in dystopian
Seattle.

502
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,880
Once the timeline crystallized,
you were out in the real world,

503
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,440
and I was thrown in here
with the rest of the totem bearers.

504
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,280
Wait, does that mean Nate was right?

505
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,040
Are you a cooler me?

506
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
We have a lot to talk about.

507
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,720
Hey, do carbs count
if you eat them in a totem?

508
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,280
- Nope.
- Oh.

509
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,840
Whoa, whoa.

510
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,880
Thanks.

511
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Okay.

512
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Yes.

513
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,840
I got it!

514
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,840
Charlie!

515
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,920
Sara, no.

516
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
No!

517
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,360
Sara, go!

518
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,200
You're bleeding.

519
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,160
You're mortal. Just like them.

520
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,440
Pathetic.

521
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,480
Apologize...

522
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,480
and we can heal you.

523
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,240
We can restore order to this madness.

524
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,240
I like the madness.

525
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,600
Sara was right.

526
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm no Fate...

527
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,960
I'm a Legend.

528
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,760
And now she's dead.
Which makes you nothing.

529
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
You'll never find the other pieces.

530
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,600
No.

531
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,880
Once again,
your humans have let you down.

532
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,920
Goodbye, little sister.

533
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,000
So...

534
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,520
how are things with Nate?

535
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,400
Good, you know. Yeah, super.
Super cool.

536
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,800
Weird to feel jealous of myself.

537
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Well, don't be too jealous.

538
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,520
Sorry. Are you not together?

539
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,680
He's my brother's best friend,
it would...

540
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,280
It would be weird.

541
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,600
Sorry, he and Behrad are friends?

542
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
They have this ridiculous handshake.

543
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
It's sweet.

544
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,400
Behrad a Legend?

545
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,600
I wish I could see that.

546
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,040
You must be disappointed?

547
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,960
Yeah, I was hoping Totem-town
would have a few video games.

548
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,680
No, I mean disappointed in me.

549
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,520
Why?

550
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,040
I mean, you were a superhero
who wielded a totem

551
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,160
and saved the world.

552
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,280
Twice.

553
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,440
I'm just a failed Cat-Chat celebrity.

554
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
My family's alive.

555
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
And you...
You actually seem like a lot of fun.

556
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm good with it.

557
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
They could be anywhere out here.

558
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,480
Sara?

559
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,800
Charlie?

560
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,920
I thought you were dead.

561
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,440
Me too.

562
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
My sister, she's...

563
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,080
She's heading for the ship.

564
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,520
Ava, we have a problem.

565
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,000
<i>There is a very slinky lady in a red
leather pantsuit on the ship.</i>

566
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
Which usually I would be into,

567
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,000
but she is giving off a super,

568
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,720
'I want to kill you in the worst
possible way' vibe.

569
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
Oh, my God,
that must be Charlie's sister.

570
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
Listen, you need to wake up Zari
and get off the ship.

571
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,600
Already on it.

572
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,840
Ava! Come quick!

573
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,640
- Oh, my God.
- I think he's dead.

574
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,000
Don't count me out so soon, handsome.

575
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,480
The forest is a natural apothecary.

576
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,000
Zari, Zari.

577
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,800
Wake up. Wake up!

578
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,440
Zari, wake up.

579
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,040
Zari. Zari!

580
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,200
Where's the ring?

581
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
Hey. Look, since you're Charlie's
sister,

582
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,040
can't we just be cool about all this?

583
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,840
You two share blood.

584
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,040
She's your sister.

585
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,360
Yeah.

586
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,480
Pretty.

587
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,360
I'm taking the ring.
Whether she dies is up to you.

588
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,720
You don't belong here.

589
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,520
No more defying fate.

590
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,680
No!

591
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
Behrad!

592
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,760
- Is he...
- Get the ship in the air.

593
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,560
- She's still on the ship.
- Just do it!

594
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
You're not getting off this ship
alive.

595
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,760
You saw my true form and survived.

596
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,640
What are you?

597
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,600
Your worst nightmare.

598
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,920
You can't kill me.

599
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm a God.

600
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,360
Yeah? I've faced worse.

601
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,720
Gideon, you'd better be awake because
I need you to open the doors, now.

602
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,560
Fate's a bitch, ain't it?

603
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,480
Not bad.

604
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Nice.

605
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
Come back soon.

606
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
Maybe next time bring Behrad.

607
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
I'd like that.

608
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
Oh, my God, guys.

609
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,800
I just had the most amazing
experience.

610
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,960
Where's Behrad?

611
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,240
Z...

612
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,480
What's going on?

613
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,280
Where is...

614
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,680
Oh, my God.

615
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
Behrad.

616
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,480
Behrad.

617
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Why?

618
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,400
Why? How did this happen?

619
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,560
He's dead.

620
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,080
Wait, who's dead?

621
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,200
Behrad.

622
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,840
You got us into this mess,
and now he's dead because of you.

623
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,360
Can that Loom bring him back?

624
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
If we get the last piece, yeah.

625
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,120
Great. Get up, let's go.

626
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,480
Hold on a second.
It's not that simple, all right?

627
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,280
We're being hunted by a pair
of bloody gods.

628
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,240
This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

629
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,600
I can handle dicey!

630
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,880
I can handle whatever it takes
to save my brother.

631
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,640
And until you bring him back,

632
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I am with you every minute
of every damn day.
