1
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:08,946
My brother gave his life
hunting Sauron.

2
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:10,821
His task is now mine.

3
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:13,779
Commander Galadriel.

4
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:17,363
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

5
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:19,988
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

6
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:24,446
This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

7
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:26,196
The question now is, where?

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,154
The evil is gone.

9
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:29,696
Then why is it not gone from in here?

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,363
These heroes shall be granted
a passage across the sea

11
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:35,154
to dwell for all eternity.

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,404
You have fought
long enough, Galadriel.

13
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:39,613
Put up your sword.

14
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:41,404
Without it, what am I to be?

15
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:48,821
Are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

16
00:00:48,904 --> 00:00:51,238
The greatest
of Elven-smiths, of course.

17
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,279
What's one of them doing here?

18
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,029
She's got some sort of a sickness.

19
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:01,446
-Where has she been grazing?
-She wandered east a few days ago.

20
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,363
How far east?

21
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:03,488
Hordern.

22
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:10,779
Haven't you ever wondered
what else is out there?

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,154
Beyond our wanderin'.

24
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,821
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

25
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,446
-The skies are strange.

26
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,446
-Nori!
-Poppy!

27
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,154
Have the wheels come off your cart?
Get away from there!

28
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:02,279
Shh!

29
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,654
You shouldn't sneak up on folk like that.

30
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:05,988
-Well, you shouldn't be here.
-Shh!

31
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:13,113
It's not hot.

32
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:14,571
Fine. It's not hot.

33
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,863
Doesn't change the fact
that there's a giant in there.

34
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,696
She's making that face.
Not that face, Nori...

35
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:24,446
Nori!

36
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:26,779
Nori, don't!

37
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:46,446
Nori, don't! He's dead! Come on!

38
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:53,571
-No! Don't! Don't! Please!

39
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:07,696
No!

40
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,071
What...

41
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,446
Your mam's gonna kill ya.

42
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:44,529
You're not telling her.
Neither am I. Quick sticks.

43
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,029
We can't leave him like this
or the wolves will get him.

44
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,904
-So?
-So, that's not who we are.

45
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:50,279
That's not who you are.

46
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:53,613
I can't carry him alone.
Are you gonna help me or not?

47
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,946
-Not.
-Poppy!

48
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:58,321
How exactly are we supposed
to carry a giant?

49
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,654
Must've been a star fall.

50
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,654
A big one.

51
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,154
How many signs do you need?

52
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,946
Ask me, we ought to break camp
this moment.

53
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,529
-What about the festival?

54
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,821
Let's not do anything rash just yet.

55
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:18,904
More'n likely we're safer in camp
than we are out.

56
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,529
But keep an eye out, the both of you.

57
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,321
-Malva's right.
-Yes.

58
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:26,113
This does not bode well.

59
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,029
Now, away with you. Go on.

60
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,321
Pssk!

61
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:32,321
-All right, all right, all right.
-Go on. Hurry up.

62
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,446
Look at him. He's bleeding massive.

63
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,821
-He's got to be...
-He's not a troll!

64
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:59,238
All right, smart-foot. Then what is he?

65
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,154
Uh, maybe he's big folk.

66
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,654
Human?

67
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,654
No way. He'd be squished.

68
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:06,988
Elf, maybe?

69
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:10,196
-Wrong ears. And he's not handsome.

70
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,904
Not to mention,
Elves don't fall from the sky.

71
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,779
Nobody does. As far as I know.

72
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:15,863
He did.

73
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,696
-Are you even pullin'?
-Yeah, of course I'm pullin'!

74
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,696
-Well, pull harder!
-Shh!

75
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,446
This is ludicrous.
He's never gonna fit in that old cart.

76
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,946
It's just for one night.

77
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,904
In the mornin', we'll pack him up
some food and send him on his way.

78
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,363
-What way?
-That's a tomorrow problem.

79
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:35,154
-This isn't an adventure.
-What's that supposed to mean?

80
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,946
-I didn't go looking for this.
-But you're not turning away.

81
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,529
-Because I can't.
-Because you won't.

82
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,446
This stranger isn't a Man, or an Elf,

83
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,488
or some baby eagle with a broken wing.

84
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:47,488
-That was one time.
-He's something else.

85
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:52,779
Maybe he's something dangerous.

86
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:55,071
Now you sound
just like Malva and the sisters.

87
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,279
Oh, it's not just them.

88
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,821
Anybody finds out
that we helped a stranger,

89
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:01,696
and anything bad that happens
the next three seasons

90
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,071
will be our fault.

91
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,446
If a fog lasts a little too long,
a wheel gets stuck in a rut...

92
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,404
Oh, great goats!

93
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,738
Faster, before it crashes!

94
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,363
Oh, so now you care about him.

95
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,946
No, no!
The wheelbarrow, it's not mine!

96
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,696
Why you doing this, Nori?

97
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:06,363
-I feel like he's my responsibility.
-You feel like everyone

98
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,279
-is your responsibility.
-No.

99
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,613
This is different.

100
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:18,738
He could've landed anywhere,
and he landed here.

101
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:25,863
I know it sounds strange,
but somehow I just know he's important.

102
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,821
It's like there's a reason this happened.

103
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,613
Like I was supposed to find him. Me.

104
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:37,613
I can't walk away from that.
Not till I know he's safe.

105
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,571
Can you?

106
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,238
Fine. I won't tell anyone.

107
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:49,863
Thank you.

108
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,738
What does a giant eat, anyway?

109
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,779
Hope it's not Harfoots.

110
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,363
Just the ones
that can't keep a secret.

111
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,404
The earth is riven with fissures.

112
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,154
Like in a ground-shake.

113
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,488
No bodies.

114
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,571
No wounded.

115
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:42,071
Perhaps they all fled.

116
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,238
Perhaps.

117
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,779
This was Ciaran's home.

118
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:05,488
And... Hana. His wife was Hana.

119
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:12,279
This was no ground-shake.
Someone dug this passage.

120
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:13,529
Something.

121
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:15,738
Men did not do this.

122
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,196
Go. Warn your people.

123
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,154
You're not coming with me?

124
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:21,904
I must follow the passage.
The other direction.

125
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:25,821
-You don't know what's down there.
-That is the reason I must go.

126
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,946
Fëanor's hammer.

127
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:11,654
The tool that wrought the Silmarils.

128
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:16,488
The jewels that contain
the very light of Valinor.

129
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,654
Strange, isn't it?

130
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,321
How one object could be responsible
for creating so much beauty...

131
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,654
And so much pain.

132
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:29,363
True creation requires sacrifice.

133
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:35,738
They say that Morgoth
found the Silmarils so beautiful

134
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:39,071
that after he'd stolen them, for weeks,

135
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,863
he could do nothing
but stare into their depths.

136
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:43,029
Hmm.

137
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:46,321
It was only after one of his tears
fell upon the jewels

138
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:49,279
and he was faced with the evil
of his own reflection,

139
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,529
that the reverie was finally broken.

140
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,154
From that moment, he...

141
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:57,404
He looked upon their light no more.

142
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,654
Fëanor's work nearly turned the heart
of the Great Foe himself.

143
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,696
What has mine ever accomplished?

144
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:12,113
I... It has turned my heart, my lord.

145
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,779
The heart of many an Elf.

146
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:17,779
But I aspire to do far more than that.

147
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,238
An Age ago, our kind brought war
to these shores.

148
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:22,946
I want to fill them with beauty.

149
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,696
To grow beyond petty works of jewel-craft,
and devise something of real power.

150
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,238
What is it you hope to craft?

151
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,738
"What" is but a glint on the far horizon.

152
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:39,238
You have come to Eregion
to help me achieve the "how."

153
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,488
A tower?

154
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:47,404
One that can host a forge
more powerful than any ever built.

155
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:50,571
Able to birth a flame as hot
as a dragon's tongue,

156
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,154
and as pure as starlight.

157
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:56,071
The things we could use it to create
could transform Middle-earth.

158
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,946
What seems to be the difficulty?

159
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,904
I need it completed by spring.

160
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,238
My lord, that would require a...

161
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,613
A workforce greater
than any ever assembled.

162
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,488
Yes. The High King cannot provide one.

163
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,988
So he has sent me you instead.

164
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,946
Have you considered seeking partners
outside the confines of our own race?

165
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:22,154
How far outside?

166
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:46,446
An alliance with the Dwarves would be

167
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,488
the diplomatic achievement of the age.

168
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:51,571
Their prince, Durin,
is an old and dear friend.

169
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,154
Almost like a brother to me.

170
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:57,321
I've heard the Dwarves
have greatly expanded their halls of late.

171
00:14:57,654 --> 00:15:00,238
They... They sculpt the rock

172
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,321
with the respect of one
who cares for an aged parent.

173
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,071
I've long wanted to see them work.

174
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,071
I had no idea you admired them so.

175
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,779
I admire all who can see
into the mystery of things,

176
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:15,529
who can divine
from the plainness of what is,

177
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,404
the beauty of what could be...

178
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:21,654
Might your friend be able to grant me
access to their workshops?

179
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:24,613
Oh, if I know Durin,
he'll do far more than that.

180
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:27,363
He'll welcome us with open arms,

181
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,279
rams' horns blaring,

182
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,238
tables filled with salted pork,

183
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,988
-and enough malt beer to fill the Anduin.

184
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,613
What do you want?

185
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,196
It is Elrond of Lindon,

186
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,863
accompanied by Celebrimbor,
Lord of Eregion.

187
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:43,571
We seek an audience with Prince Durin.

188
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,613
-No.

189
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:52,946
My apologies.

190
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,029
Inform Lord Durin
that his friend, Elrond...

191
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,696
His judgment
has already been rendered, Elf.

192
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,779
Rams' horns?

193
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,488
All right, then, my friend.

194
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,613
I invoke the Rite of Sigin-tarâg.

195
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,238
What is the Rite of...

196
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,571
I'll rejoin you in Eregion.

197
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,238
Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

198
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,446
Lord Celebrimbor, trust me.

199
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,321
You are master of your craft, my friend.

200
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:50,154
Allow me a few days to work mine.

201
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,613
Elmendéa...

202
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:34,446
-Khazad!
-Dûm!

203
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,529
My heart sings to see you, old...

204
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:44,821
The Elf Elrond has invoked
the Rite of Sigin-tarâg.

205
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,571
The Dwarven test of endurance,

206
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:52,238
fashioned by Aulë himself.

207
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,113
Once we lift our hammers,

208
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,321
we shall break the great stones
until one of us can break no more.

209
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,279
Should the Elf forfeit,

210
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:11,279
he will be banished
from all Dwarven lands.

211
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,113
Forever!

212
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:21,904
Does the Elf understand?

213
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:25,321
The Elf does.

214
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,529
In the unlikely event
the Elf should win...

215
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:36,196
We shall grant a single boon.
But should he lose...

216
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,154
Banished. Yes. Understood.

217
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:40,571
Mmm.

218
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,446
Begin!

219
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,613
Durin! Durin! Durin!

220
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:55,238
Durin! Durin! Durin!

221
00:19:55,321 --> 00:20:00,029
-Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin!

222
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:03,113
-Durin! Durin!

223
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,779
Here we go, Elf.

224
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,863
Mm.

225
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:03,821
Hello?

226
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,363
Wait! Wait, it's me!

227
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,196
It's me! Stop!

228
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,238
Wait!

229
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:18,738
I helped you last night.
You remember me, don't you?

230
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,154
Don't you?

231
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,404
Okay.

232
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:37,821
How 'bout this then...

233
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,946
I won't harm you.

234
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,904
You won't harm me. Deal?

235
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,863
Well, that's a start then, isn't it?

236
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,238
Now, proper things first.
Father always says,

237
00:21:56,321 --> 00:22:00,738
"A Harfoot without manners is as like to
get far in life as a square wheel." So...

238
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm Nori.

239
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:09,446
I'm Nori.

240
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,321
I...

241
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,571
No, I'm Nori.

242
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:17,404
No, I'm Nori.

243
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:20,029
What about your name? You?

244
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,071
You don't remember, do you?

245
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:28,654
Suppose you did fall quite a long way.

246
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,946
Anybody's head would be
a bit higgledy-piggledy.

247
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:32,363
I fell out of a tree once.

248
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:35,363
For a whole week,
I kept calling strawberries "pigberries."

249
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,529
Can you imagine? A pigberry?

250
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:41,821
It's food.

251
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,029
They do eat where you're from, don't they?

252
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:48,613
Of course they do, Nori,
what a silly question.

253
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,904
Mm.

254
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:19,863
Hmm.

255
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:25,571
No... That's not how you...

256
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,863
-Largo! Largo!

257
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:38,654
Leave him, Malva. Why don't you help?

258
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:41,321
I am helping by asking him to help.

259
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:44,613
Aw, stop your lounge-a-daising
and lend us a foot.

260
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:48,154
Well, I think Nori was looking forward
to helping out with that.

261
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:50,904
Nori? Nori?

262
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,571
Where is it you're from, anyway?

263
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:00,113
Where do you belong?
Where are all the others?

264
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,029
You know, of your kind? Like you?

265
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:06,154
Are there any others?

266
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,363
-And up she goes...

267
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,154
Come on, big fella.

268
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:31,904
-Put your back into it, lads!

269
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:40,529
What is it?

270
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,696
Mana...

271
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:44,904
Is it some sort of map?

272
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:46,363
Come on, lads!

273
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,488
It's got space.

274
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,863
Mana... Mana...

275
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:55,988
Úrë...

276
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:11,904
Mana... Mana...

277
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,654
Úrë... Úrë...

278
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:18,446
Úrë... Mana...

279
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,738
It just looks like a batch
of dots and loops.

280
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:22,988
-Úrë...
-I don't understand.

281
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,154
-Mana!
-I'm trying to help you, but I...

282
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:28,029
Úrë!

283
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,529
I'm just a Harfoot!

284
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:33,571
-Nori!

285
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:39,654
Friend!

286
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:43,321
Friend. Just a friend.

287
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:44,988
Nori.

288
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,696
It's your father.

289
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,696
Wow! Blueberry indeed.

290
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:59,279
Nori, I'm fine.

291
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,946
I... I slipped on wet grass is all.
It's just a twist.

292
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,321
There's nothing to worry...

293
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:05,946
-Mam...
-Never you mind.

294
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,196
I should've been here.

295
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,738
You're here now, all right?

296
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,946
Now, go on, fetch me
some cold water and some salt.

297
00:26:24,238 --> 00:26:27,238
How bad is it? Can he migrate?

298
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:33,696
You saw him.

299
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,154
Couldn't put the weight of a leaf
on that leg.

300
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:39,238
-Much less pull a cart.
-Mind your own fire, Malva.

301
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:40,279
Over here!

302
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:48,238
Come. Come closer.

303
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:51,613
-What do you think you're doing?
-I'm not leaving her adrift.

304
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:53,946
Suppose you'll be sharing
your rations?

305
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:55,946
The tides of fate are flowing.

306
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,029
If no one else will.

307
00:27:57,113 --> 00:27:59,363
Yours may be heading in, or out.

308
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:02,654
Refuse to bring her aboard,
and her death will be on our hands.

309
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:05,779
Didn't seem bothered
when we was debating Doble's death.

310
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:08,279
Cruelty will not be our deliverance.

311
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,071
Don't let her on.

312
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:11,613
Pull her up.

313
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:22,238
No.

314
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:24,988
Answers first.

315
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,029
Why are you out here?

316
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:34,863
I was separated from my ship.

317
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,154
Attacked?

318
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,238
Then you've not seen it?

319
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:41,904
Seen what?

320
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,071
The worm.

321
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,154
We set out two weeks ago, sailing...

322
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:55,696
-Need we tell her all our affairs?
-Why not?

323
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:57,488
Does she look dangerous to you?

324
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,988
Looks can be deceiving.

325
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:04,863
An Elf.

326
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:06,779
Remove your hand from me, sir.

327
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,946
You liar.

328
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,446
-We're saved. We're saved. Look!
-Hurry!

329
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,238
Look! Over here!

330
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:14,488
Help us!

331
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:17,196
Hurry, help me build a torch. Hurry!

332
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,488
Wait! Until we can see the sails.

333
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:22,446
Corsairs prowl these waters.
Do you want to be skinned alive?

334
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:29,654
That's no corsair ship.

335
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,029
That's our ship.

336
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,196
The worm!

337
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:44,571
Be still.

338
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:07,071
-The Elf led it right to us.

339
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:27,571
It's coming!

340
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:35,071
Help!

341
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,113
What are you called?

342
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,238
Galadriel.

343
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,321
I'm Halbrand.

344
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:16,446
What's our heading?

345
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:32,571
Yes!

346
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:35,946
Durin! Durin! Durin!

347
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:39,279
Durin! Durin! Durin!

348
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:44,988
Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin!

349
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,196
A dog may bark at the moon.

350
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,863
But he cannot bring it down.

351
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,738
Take your leave.

352
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:58,696
Perhaps His Lordship would be willing
to escort me to the exit?

353
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:03,113
Gladly.

354
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:18,946
Remarkable. I never dreamed
to find your city so changed.

355
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:22,029
Now, 20 years will do that.

356
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,613
Has it been only 20?

357
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:28,446
You must tell me your secret.

358
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,363
Our secrets are our own.

359
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,113
Durin, have I offended you?

360
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:36,238
To answer that, we'd need a longer lift.

361
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:38,529
If you wish to discharge me
without explanation,

362
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:41,029
-that is your choice.
-You bet your feathery shirts it is.

363
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:43,321
But before squandering
the best opportunity

364
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:45,488
any Dwarf-prince has had in a generation,

365
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:47,821
you might at least listen
to the proposal I bring.

366
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:48,988
Ah, there it is.

367
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:51,238
The true purpose of your visit.
You want something.

368
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:53,738
I journeyed here to see my friend,
whom I've greatly missed.

369
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:56,279
Missed? You missed my wedding.

370
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:59,363
The birth of my children, two of them!

371
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:05,571
You cannot barge into my mountain
and demand I welcome you with open arms.

372
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,904
You cannot claim that which you discarded.

373
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:10,279
Discarded? Durin, I...

374
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:13,446
Twenty years might be
the blink of an eye to an Elf.

375
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,821
But I've lived an entire life
in that time.

376
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:20,363
A life you missed.

377
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,446
So, what do you have to say to that...

378
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:38,613
"Friend?"

379
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,404
Congratulations.

380
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:50,321
On your wife, your children.

381
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:54,654
I hope you can come to forgive me.

382
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:01,071
And I would like very much
to apologize to your family as well.

383
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:05,904
Hmm.

384
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:08,571
One apology to Disa and you're off.

385
00:36:08,654 --> 00:36:10,654
No getting better acquainted.

386
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:15,446
No reminiscing about the past.
And absolutely no staying for dinner.

387
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:16,988
Understood.

388
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,488
Aulë's beard! No!

389
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,363
This cannot be Elrond, can it?

390
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,696
I fear so, fair lady.

391
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,571
Durin didn't tell me you were coming.

392
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:34,946
Durin didn't know.

393
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:38,279
I've been remiss in not visiting sooner.

394
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,654
An oversight, for which I am here
to humbly ask forgiveness.

395
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:44,029
-You're staying for dinner.
-He's leaving.

396
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:45,696
-He's staying.
-He's leaving!

397
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:46,696
He's staying.

398
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:53,488
Hey! I told you two
to stay out of my heads!

399
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:57,029
And I told you wee monsters
to stay in bed.

400
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:57,946
Oh, come on!

401
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:01,446
Gerda! Gamli! Come on, hurry along.

402
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:02,404
Ow!

403
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,779
Make yourself comfortable, please.

404
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:06,988
But not too comfortable.

405
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:09,196
Gamli, please.

406
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:12,071
It's off to the salt mines
the both of ya!

407
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:15,154
Cave-trolls and stalagmite spiders galore!

408
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,654
How did you two
first become acquainted?

409
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:31,238
I was resonating a freshly-opened chamber,

410
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:34,613
fairly confident we were
onto a sizable silver deposit...

411
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:37,196
"Resonating?"
I've not heard of resonating.

412
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:39,279
It's when we sing to the stone.

413
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:41,696
You see, a mountain's like a person.

414
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:46,196
It's a long and ever-changing story
made of countless small parts.

415
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,946
-Earth and ore, air and water.

416
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:53,738
Sing to it properly, each of those parts
will reflect your song back to you,

417
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:57,154
telling you its story,
showing you what might be hidden,

418
00:37:57,238 --> 00:37:59,696
where to mine, where to tunnel, and...

419
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:02,321
And where to leave the mountain untouched.

420
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:04,238
It is a beautiful tradition.

421
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:12,363
Anyway, we're unpacking our tools,
and my team suddenly grows quiet.

422
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:14,738
Then, I see our prince.

423
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:16,654
He's come to check on us.

424
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:18,779
Far below his purview, mind you.

425
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:21,071
First, I thought it merely curious.

426
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:24,071
That is, until he showed up
at our next survey.

427
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:29,446
And the one after that.
And the one after that.

428
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,404
Always did have a talent for lurking.

429
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:34,863
Took weeks before he worked up
the courage to court me proper.

430
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,821
Two weeks at most.

431
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:39,029
-It was five.
-You're lying.

432
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:40,321
She's lying.

433
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,613
She may play coy now,

434
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:46,571
but she was a moon-eyed girl in love
from the moment we met.

435
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:47,529
Oof!

436
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:49,488
-Mmm!

437
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,571
A very happy match, indeed.

438
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,446
Should've been at the wedding.

439
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:56,154
Enough.

440
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,779
-Your friend is here now.

441
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:02,029
Can we not take joy in that?

442
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,529
He's not here for us.

443
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:06,113
His king sent him here
to take what's ours.

444
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:09,029
To the contrary.
Coming to Khazad-dûm was my idea.

445
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,238
And I have asked for nothing but your ear.

446
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,154
Aye, and that's how it starts.

447
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:16,238
And soon enough,
we're left with our thumbs in our eyes.

448
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:19,154
-Elves for Elves, no?
-Has it ever been so between us?

449
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:21,863
-I don't know! Has it?
-Aulë's beard!

450
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,446
Can you not find a way to mend this?

451
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,696
I see you planted the sapling.

452
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:39,071
Planted it. Raised it up.

453
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:42,404
Tends it like it's our third child.

454
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:45,238
What sort of tree is it, exactly?

455
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:49,488
A seedling of our Great Tree in Lindon.

456
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,863
The very symbol
of our people's strength and vitality.

457
00:39:53,196 --> 00:39:54,904
Some called him a fool

458
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,571
for believing it would grow
in such darkness.

459
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:00,988
Where there is love,
it is never truly dark.

460
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:04,988
How could it not grow
in a home like yours?

461
00:40:14,154 --> 00:40:15,904
You're not leaving already?

462
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:18,488
I fear I've overstayed my welcome.

463
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:21,196
Thank you, Disa, for your hospitality.

464
00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:24,363
Durin.

465
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:33,446
Sod it, sit down.

466
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:37,404
-Please. I hardly wish to intrude.
-I said sit.

467
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:38,571
Are you certain?

468
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:42,404
No. And I'm still angry.
Tell me about your king's proposal

469
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:45,279
so I can decide whether
to present it to my father

470
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:47,696
or toss it in the nearest slag pit.

471
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:14,238
You needn't keep your distance.

472
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:20,321
I am simply wondering what manner of man

473
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:23,446
would so readily abandon
his companions to death.

474
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:25,863
The sort that knows how to survive.

475
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:28,571
Why be part of the larger target?

476
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,154
You are a target still.

477
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:34,488
I doubt we shall find safety
until we make landfall.

478
00:41:34,571 --> 00:41:36,988
I suspect finding safety
won't be that easy.

479
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:39,113
Leastways not for you.

480
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:42,363
"Separated" from your ship.

481
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:44,821
Really?

482
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:48,696
-You're a deserter, aren't you?
-Do I have the look of a deserter?

483
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:52,196
You don't have the look of someone
to whom things happen by accident.

484
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:55,071
Which means you were running.

485
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:58,446
Whether toward or from something,
I haven't yet decided.

486
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:00,863
Duty demanded I return to Middle-earth.

487
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:04,363
And that is all you need to know.

488
00:42:04,446 --> 00:42:08,238
-Important Elf business, no doubt.
-What have Elves ever done to you?

489
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,571
Do you blame us
for your being stranded here?

490
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,863
The way I see it, it wasn't Elves
that chased me from my homeland.

491
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:16,529
It was Orcs.

492
00:42:25,446 --> 00:42:28,488
Your home. Where was it?

493
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,696
What's it matter?

494
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:33,821
It's ashes now.

495
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:39,529
I know something of the pain you carry.

496
00:42:41,196 --> 00:42:42,279
I grieve for you.

497
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,529
For those you lost.

498
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:56,488
Around your neck.

499
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:00,238
Was that the mark of your people's king?

500
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,279
-My people have no king.
-But if they did,

501
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:04,988
-where might that kingdom be found?
-To what end?

502
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:07,404
What if I told you we might be able
to reclaim it?

503
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:10,071
-I'm afraid you're short an army.
-Leave the army to me.

504
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,738
Why're you dodging the question?

505
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,196
Why're you stranded at sea?

506
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,654
Because rather than rest in glory,
I chose to seek out

507
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:18,113
the very enemy responsible
for your suffering.

508
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:21,571
Look, Elf. You didn't cause my suffering
and you can't fix it.

509
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:25,071
No matter how strong your will.
Or your pride.

510
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:28,154
So let it lie.

511
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:32,821
I have pursued this foe since
before the first sunrise bloodied the sky.

512
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:36,071
It would take longer than your lifetime

513
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:39,488
even to speak the names
of those they have taken from me.

514
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:43,404
So letting it lie is not an option.

515
00:43:46,113 --> 00:43:49,779
At last, a little honesty.

516
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:53,113
If you want to murder Orcs
and settle a score, that's your affair.

517
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:54,863
Don't dress it up as heroism.

518
00:43:54,946 --> 00:43:57,279
Are you going to tell me
where the enemy is or not?

519
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:58,529
The Southlands.

520
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,196
I need to know how many the enemy were,

521
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:05,988
under whose banner they marched,

522
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:09,863
and then you are going to take me
to their last-known location.

523
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:12,529
I've got my own plans, Elf.

524
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,446
Prepare yourself.

525
00:44:45,488 --> 00:44:47,779
-Watch it!
-Easy now, love.

526
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,363
-What do you mean, "no bodies?"

527
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:55,363
I mean the entire village was empty.

528
00:44:55,446 --> 00:44:58,988
It was as if the ground has swallowed up
the people of Hordern like flies.

529
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,446
The ground here is tetchy.
Always has been.

530
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:04,321
And Crookfinger Lake's
always seepin' vapors.

531
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:05,988
-Mmm.
-I saw a tunnel.

532
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,529
Dug deep, and with care.

533
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:10,779
By what, I cannot say,
but they were digging towards us.

534
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:13,238
I tell you, we remain here at our peril.

535
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:14,738
We must spread the word.

536
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:17,488
-No! I will not have this gossip, Bronwyn.

537
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:20,946
I've seen landslides less dangerous
than a wayward tongue,

538
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:24,613
and without proof or puddin',
that's all it'd be.

539
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:27,113
Waldreg, we're all alone.

540
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:29,738
Ostirith is empty.
The watchtower abandoned.

541
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:31,779
Yes, I know,
and I'm not invitin' them Elves

542
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,696
back on account of some sinkhole.

543
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:37,779
Havin' them gone is a relief.
Well, for most of us, anyhow.

544
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:02,029
Bloody mice.

545
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:09,821
-Stupid, bastard mice!

546
00:49:16,196 --> 00:49:17,279
Theo?

547
00:49:19,863 --> 00:49:21,071
Theo?

548
00:49:35,529 --> 00:49:37,529
Theo, what's wrong?
What happened?

549
00:49:37,613 --> 00:49:39,238
Get help. Go.

550
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:31,654
-Theo, run!

551
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,279
Hey!

552
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:45,321
Stop!

553
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:29,613
If there are any of you here
who want to live,

554
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:32,196
we make for the Elven tower
at first light.

555
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:53,363
We need to tie the boat!
It's coming apart!

556
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:54,696
The wind is too strong.

557
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:56,113
Grab the ropes!

558
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,404
Come on! Give me your hand!

559
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:26,613
Bind yourself to me!

560
00:53:26,696 --> 00:53:28,738
Come on! Give me your hand!

561
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:29,946
Hello? It's me. It's me, Nori.

562
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:45,029
You see, the next migration is in just
a few days now, and everything's gone...

563
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:47,488
Three rabbits to the moon.

564
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:52,113
I wanted to help you.

565
00:55:53,863 --> 00:55:55,863
I thought I could, but I'm sorry.

566
00:56:08,946 --> 00:56:11,946
It's a lantern. We use fireflies.

567
00:56:59,654 --> 00:57:01,321
What's he saying to them?

568
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:05,321
I don't speak firefly.

569
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:37,113
They're stars.

570
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,113
A kind of constellation.

571
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:45,571
Okay? They're stars? What does that mean?

572
00:57:45,654 --> 00:57:47,071
This is how we help him.

573
00:57:47,154 --> 00:57:50,029
He wants us to help him find those stars.

574
00:57:51,863 --> 00:57:53,279
That's it, isn't it?

575
00:57:54,196 --> 00:57:55,404
Isn't it?

576
00:58:05,779 --> 00:58:07,571
I've never seen those stars before.

577
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:12,321
But I have a pretty good idea
where I can find them.

578
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:26,613
Nori?

579
00:58:41,946 --> 00:58:44,863
I'm certain of it. He doesn't know.

580
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:50,821
Perhaps.

581
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:53,821
Perhaps not.

582
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:59,613
You've always had sandstone
in your granite

583
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:01,696
as far as the Elves were concerned.

584
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:04,113
Tell me, do you not think
it's a coincidence

585
00:59:04,196 --> 00:59:07,363
that an Elf should just land
on our doorstep? Now?

586
00:59:07,446 --> 00:59:10,363
I've known Elrond
for half a century, Father.

587
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,738
I'd sense it if he were hiding something.

588
00:59:12,863 --> 00:59:16,488
Perhaps he sensed that it was you
who was hiding something.

589
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:18,363
You think too much of their kind.

590
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,404
We're the ones holding
the long end of the hammer here.

591
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:24,529
Aye. For now.

592
00:59:28,779 --> 00:59:30,738
Elrond is a friend. I trust him.

593
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:33,488
There can be no trust
between hammer and rock.

594
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:38,029
Eventually one or the other
must surely break.

595
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:55,071
Theo!

596
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:00,488
You ready?

597
01:01:00,904 --> 01:01:03,238
Yes, Mother. I'm ready.
