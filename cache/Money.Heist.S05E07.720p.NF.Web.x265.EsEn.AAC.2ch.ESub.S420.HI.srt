- No.
- Yeah.

163
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,291
It's just that, um,
I'm moved by this plan,

164
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,666
this marvelous plan for the gold.

165
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,875
But there's still
a couple of details that...

166
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
- That what?
- Well, um...

167
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,000
- Getting the gold out, for example.
- Little grains.

168
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,083
We're going to turn
90 tons of gold into rice.

169
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,791
And after that, propel it like a jet.

170
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah. We'll eject all of it
using a pressure pump.

171
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,500
- Using a pump?
- <font color="#87CEFA">(laughing)</font> Yeah.

172
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,750
- Through the pipelines?
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,335
Inside the Bank of Spain
is there a pressure pump?

174
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
- No, of course not.
- Of course not!

175
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,500
We had to go all the way up to Norway
to get it off an oil platform.

176
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,041
What do you think about that?

177
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,125
<font color="#87CEFA">(laughing)</font> I mean,
there was another one in Saudi Arabia.

178
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,250
- But I was too lazy to go so far away.
- Of course.

179
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,791
What matters, Sergio,

180
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,208
is that we're going to have a geyser
of golden light flowing through the pipes.

181
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
There's no margin of error.

182
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,416
Andrés, the whole plan, everything
you're saying is a margin of error.

183
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,750
How old are those pipes?
Fifty? Seventy years old?

184
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,250
How old are they?

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
<font color="#87CEFA">(sighs)</font>

186
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,291
A hundred.

187
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,833
And do you think
that they were built 100 years ago

188
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,291
to withstand pressurized gold?

189
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
No, but they're gonna hold!

190
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,750
Very well. Where does the gold arrive?
In a sewer?

191
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,666
No!

192
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,416
<font color="#87CEFA">(laughing)</font> I just love this.

193
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,291
In the biggest stormwater tank in Europe.

194
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
In a stormwater tank?
What happens if it rains?

195
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,583
What if it starts pouring rain that day?
It would collapse, right?

196
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,506
And then bye-bye plan,
bye-bye your whole life,

197
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,503
because of a simple fact
that it started raining.

198
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,875
Andrés, no, it's not science, it's...
It's voluntarism...

199
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
It's scientific optimism!

200
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,166
What are you talking about?

201
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,541
- It's hopeful science.
- Who's talking here?

202
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,083
The mind of someone planning a heist
or the mind of a child? Come on.

203
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,250
The mind of a child.

204
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,166
And proudly so.

205
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,541
- I'm just like Peter Pan.
- Yeah.

206
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,500
No one can take away my enthusiasm,
not you, nobody.

207
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,916
Because only then,

208
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
only when you're willfully immature,

209
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,583
can you achieve great things.

210
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,541
The sort... The sort of things that, uh,

211
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,666
uh, mature people, serious people,
could never achieve. No.

212
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,708
No, they can't even imagine it
because they're all too <font color="#00FF7F"><i>sensible!</i></font>

213
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:42,208
And for those of us
who have to think about what we do,

214
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,583
is there anything solid?

215
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,375
Anything?

216
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,625
Because I'd love to...
I'd love to examine it.

217
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,458
Look, Martín has
all that stuff completely...

218

Houndstooth? Scottish tartan?
Something that exudes intellectualism.

289

I'd say that's a little sophisticated

It's an enormous privilege to be here.

304
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,833
Now what exactly does your curiosity
and sharp intellect demand?

305
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:25,958
Tell me.

306
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,250
Okay. Let's say we've turned

the diver will make the key connection.

Connection that will allow us
to move the gold.

- We have the vault right here, right?

- Five inches.

A five-inch hose couldn't possibly handle

00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,750
He's gonna be a cripple.

578
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,833
Well, scars scare the shit out of people,

579
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,958
and if we're going to jail,
scaring people isn't all that bad.

580
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:50,041
To be honest, I... I can't even
really imagine what prison is like.

581
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,958
Being in a cell?
It's an awful experience. It's horrible.

582
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,083
Horrible.

583
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:00,208
But I think that the worst part
isn't losing your freedom.

584
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,125
It's losing all affection.

585
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,791
I don't know.
The lack of physical contact,

586
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,666
wanting to hug your daughter,

587
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,208
wanting your mother to hug you,

588
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,250
but they're not there.

589
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,083
And then there's Sergio.

590
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,958
I mean, now that
I've finally found a good guy...

591
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,375
My God. Twenty-five years in jail
would completely erase all that.

592
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:30,958
Because no relationship
can handle that solitude.

593
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:37,291
Either that, or, uh,
maybe you spend 25 years

594
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:41,000
thinking that everything
will be the same and suddenly,

595
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,958
when you finally have a chance
to be with that person and kiss them,

596
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,041
shit, you realize

597
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,916
that too much time has passed, right?

598
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
And that at the end of the day,

599
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,166
you've spent years and years
romanticizing something that's not...

600
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,125
That's not there, that doesn't exist.

601
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,833
I want you to know that I kissed Denver.

602
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,750
I'm telling you because, I swear,
because it really was nothing.

603
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,708
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't help it.

604
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,750
I was obsessed with him for years.

605
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,958
And I realized today
there's nothing there.

606
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,416
Hey.

607
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,375
Do you have anything for stress, Doctor?

608
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,625
An antipsychotic maybe.

609
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,125
I just passed the service corridors.
I'm at the junction.

610
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,291
Okay, now take a left.

611
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,291
In about 20 meters to your left,
you'll find a vent grate and you're there.

Lisbon. Is she seeing anyone?

Where the fuck did that come from?

628
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,583
It's just that I saw her
beating up on Rio, and...

629
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
Okay?

631
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,791
Hmm. Well, she went through
a really fucked-up relationship.

632
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,875
She needs someone
to restore her faith in men.

She's got standards,
so you've gotta go all the way.

00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,253
Don't just ask her for, like,

kiss her passionately on the mouth.

642
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,750
In the elevator, the bathroom, wherever.
Remember, she's just gotten out of prison.

643
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,958

00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,291
Uh...

647
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,791
I was, uh, unfaithful to my wife.

648
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,291
Oh.

649
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,125

650
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,791

652
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,333
And did you go all the way?

653
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,375
Well, not all the way, no,
but we definitely made out.

654
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:05,958

Hold on. How is it not important?

661
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,916
A few seconds later, I made out
with Stockholm in the same room.

662
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,916
One girl's spit
ended up in the other's mouth.

663
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,333
She's shooting up morphine
to overcome post-traumatic stress,

664
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:30,250
and I'm here acting like an asshole.
I don't know what to tell her.

665
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,541
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

666
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,666
You're looking at it wrong, okay?

667
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:39,458
You should never, ever,
in your fucking life

668
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,916
admit you've been with another woman.

669
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,750
Especially not half an hour
after the fact.

670
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,250
Hey.

671
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,416
If you're feeling guilty,
fucking deal with it.

672
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,125
Next time, don't think with your dick.

673
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,208
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

674
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,208
Even if she catches you
naked in bed with the other woman.

675
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,375
You just tell her
that she's hallucinating.

676
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,375
You keep quiet.

677
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,125
Hey, look at me.

678
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,083
Because once you've admitted it,

679
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,583
then it's written in stone,
like a signed confession to the police.

680
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,208
