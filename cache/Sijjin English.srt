A FILM BY HADRAH DAENG RATU

9
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:10,583
Sis.

10
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,500
Why are we here?

11
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,250
-Isn't this where you do black magic?
-Quiet!

12
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,167
Recite any prayer that you know.

13
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,404
Oh, you, the bearer of knowledge.

14
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:15,486
We summon you with blood
of the exalting soul.

15
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,750
Humans are weak in the eyes of spirits.
Women are weak in the eyes of spirits.

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,917
You, bearer of knowledge.
You, who were born of fire.

17
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,500
Answer our prayers,
we who are born of soil.

18
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,167
What's your name?

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,667
Irma.

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,792
Why did you come here?

21
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,667
I need guidance.

22
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,083
It's about a man.

23
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,458
I want to know if I can marry him or not.

24
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,667
I only want to be with him.

25
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,792
What is his name?

26
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,708
Galang.

27
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,208
Who is he?

28
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,417
This is Galang.

29
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,125
He is our cousin.

30
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,042
He is the son of my mother's sister.

31
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:39,958
To the jinn who holds power
over spirits...

32
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,000
...give the answer...

33
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,333
...to the empty souls.

34
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,500
She will answer your question.

35
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,792
Galang is your cousin.

36
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,000
He is not the right husband for you.

37
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,885
Women are weak in
the eyes of the spirits.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,906
Let it be between the
soul or life that melts.

39
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,417
Stay away from that man.

40
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,875
Or he will be the cause of your death.

41
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:23,917
12 YEARS LATER

42
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,833
-Peace be with you.
-And also with you.

43
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,666
Come, Irma. We're late.

44
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,625
Sis, come on.

45
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,500
Mom.

46
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,373
Peace be with you.

47
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,833
-And also with you.
-Auntie Irma.

48
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,458
-Peace be with you.
-Hi, sweetie.

49
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,875
-You smell so nice.
-Here's your gift.

50
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,125
It's big.

51
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,708
-Auntie.
-Nisa.

52
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,083
-Careful, it's heavy.
-Yes, thank you.

53
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,292
Nisa, what did the doctor say?

54
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,583
It's still the same Auntie.
There is no progress.

55
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,983
Yesterday, one of her friends came over...

56
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,542
...and said that this sickness
is not medical.

57
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,375
Should we look for alternative treatment?

58
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,583
Yeah, maybe someone
is deliberately trying to hurt her?

59
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,375
-Using black magic.
-Shush.

60
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,500
You two.

61
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,708
And you, Nisa.

62
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,250
You studied in nursing school.
Why would you believe in such things?

63
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,667
Excuse me, Auntie.

64
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:50,625
Galang, stop working. Aunt Farah is here.

65
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,958
Stop working.

66
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:03,417
Nisa, look. He's still working
on his daughter's birthday.

67
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,833
I know, just drag him Irma.

68
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,333
Listen to your wife.

69
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,413
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you 

70
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:31,873
Happy birthday dear Sofia 

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,333
Happy birthday to you 

72
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,125
-What is that?
-What is it?

73
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,792
It's a beautiful doll. It's gorgeous.

74
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,250
Cute.

75
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,500
Who is it from?

76
00:07:54,708 --> 00:08:00,125
From Auntie Irma, Auntie Wulan,
and Grandma Farah.

77
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,398
-Wow.
-What do you say Nisa?

78
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,833
-Be right back.
-Okay.

79
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:05,625
Thank God.

80
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,917
Please don't leave her alone.

81
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,042
Galang should look after her too.

82
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,917
-Poor thing.
-Don't worry, Auntie.

83
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,750
Thank you.

84
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,708
Auntie, look who has come.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,042
Hey.

86
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,333
Are you crazy?

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,042
This is my house.

88
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,625
So what? Cousins can't hug?

89
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,333
Stop messing around, Irma.

90
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,917
So all these years,
we've only been messing around?

91
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:54,958
I told you I need to speak
with you privately.

92
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,583
Typical.

93
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,167
Men only want one thing.

94
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,250
What's wrong?

95
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,750
Are you afraid your wife
will find out about us...

96
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,333
Watch your mouth.

97
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,458
We've agreed there's nothing
between us anymore.

98
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,500
We are related by blood.
You should have known that.

99
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:19,042
So what if we're related?
You married someone else...

100
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,792
...and your daughter is disabled.

101
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,292
This, we don't know yet.

102
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:25,958
This.

103
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,958
We're not certain
if our child would be disabled.

104
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,083
Dad?

105
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,250
I got a doll and a lipstick
from Auntie Irma.

106
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,417
She said I could be as pretty as her.
Am I pretty?

107
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,875
Auntie Irma?

108
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,000
Sofia.

109
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,458
Auntie Irma is not here.

110
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,875
Why do I smell her perfume?

111
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,625
Should we show it to Mom?

112
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,083
We've been dating for three years... 

113
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,375
...and then you suddenly
agreed to get married with Nisa. 

114
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,833
My mother arranged this marriage. 

115
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,875
I only love you, Irma. 

116
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,042
I promise I won't leave you. 

117
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,625
No matter how you hide it,
they will eventually find out.

118
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,458
Do you think Nisa doesn't know?

119
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,375
You won't understand.

120
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,792
Maybe to you, I've always been
just a little girl, right?

121
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,167
But let me remind you.

122
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,958
You are not a lovesick teenager anymore.

123
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,375
Just so you know.

124
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,833
This isn't just about love.

125
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,358
You'll never understand.

126
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,167
Pick up.

127
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,208
Dit.

128
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,333
-Yes?
-Please check the stock in the back.

129
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,208
-You mean the fresh meat?
-Yes, now.

130
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,792
We're not done talking.

131
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,250
Irma, not here.

132
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,083
If you really care about your child...

133
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,500
Sofia isn't the only one.

134
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,375
Irma, I understand.

135
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,500
-But can we please not discuss it here?
-No.

136
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,458
I don't want us to be over.

137
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,500
You need to take responsibility.

138
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,417
I'm really pregnant.

139
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,583
Galang.

140
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,083
Galang.

141
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,250
-Irma.
-Take responsibility.

142
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:14,833
Irma.

143
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,917
Take responsibility.

144
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,415
The child I am carrying in my womb is...

145
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,542
Irma!

146
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,958
Sir, are you alright?

147
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:44,958
I'm fine, Dit.

148
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,375
Do you need help?

149
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,833
No, no need. I just dropped some meat.

150
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,750
Please check the stock in the back again.

151
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,875
Yes, Sir.

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,250
Come, Irma.

153
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,917
We lost our baby.

154
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,042
And it's all because of you.

155
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,208
What is this?

156
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,500
Are you paying me off?

157
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,083
To cover the hospital bills.

158
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,833
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:48,917
What we did was wrong, Irma.

160
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,208
I'm asking you not to bother me again.

161
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,958
Our relationship ends here.

162
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,333
What?

163
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,833
Ends here?

164
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,958
It ends here?

165
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,958
What do you mean?

166
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,000
You're the one who said
that you'll always love me.

167
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,333
You told me you'll love me.

168
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,875
You promised to give me everything.

169
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,583
You lied to me, Galang.

170
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,492
You can't leave me like this.

171
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,792
Irma. I'm sorry.

172
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,750
I have a family, Irma.

173
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,500
Do you think I care?

174
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,998
Galang!

175
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,958
I don't need your money.

176
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,333
You promised me!

177
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,917
Galang?

178
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,022
-Hi.
-Peace be with you.

179
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,792
-And also with you.
-Yes.

180
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,326
I was just about to go to your house.

181
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,833
Happy birthday to Sofia.

182
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,167
This is for her.

183
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,667
A prayer set.

184
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:46,724
It's time Sofia learns how to pray.

185
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,625
Learns about worship.

186
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,167
Galang.

187
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,083
If you can...

188
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,417
...come pray at the mosque.

189
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:00,792
I've never seen your family
praying at the mosque lately.

190
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,292
If the world feels heavy
on your shoulders...

191
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,583
...ask for help from Allah.

192
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,042
Insha Allah, there will be a way.

193
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,417
Alright. I'll take my leave now.

194
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,917
Okay.

195
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,333
Thank you for the gift.

196
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,167
You're welcome, Galang.

197
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,958
-Peace be with you.
-And also with you.

198
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:36,708
Dad?

199
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,833
Galang.

200
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,917
What happened?

201
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,083
I was slaughtering a goat.

202
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,667
Dad?

203
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,292
Sofia.

204
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,417
Next year, I want these as a gift.

205
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,167
Please help me put it on,
Dad, I can't see.

206
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,167
Galang? 

207
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,708
-What's wrong, Nisa?
-Galang.

208
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:50,695
My stomach really hurts.
I think it's time.

209
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,886
It's only been 6.5 months.
It's not possible.

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,583
But it hurts so much.

211
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,375
It's probably just cramps.

212
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,382
Her optic nerves
were pinched during birth,

213
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,958
and thus severely damaged.

214
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,083
I'm sorry, we couldn't save
your daughter's eyes.

215
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,191
If your wife had come to
the hospital sooner,

216
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,434
it might have been different.

217
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,417
Dearest brothers,

218
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,833
in Surah Al-Mutaffifin

219
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:51,125
Allah says,

220
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:55,542
"and the deeds of all evil doers...

221
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,333
...are all recorded
in the book of the damned."

222
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,875
Imam Ibnu Kathir RA conveyed

223
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,625
that Allah SWT says

224
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,708
"Inna kitaabal fujjaari lafee Sijjeen."

225
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,500
And they shall return to Sijjin.

226
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:18,300
Because the evil deeds
are serious matters,

227
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:23,083
Allah says that they belong in prison.

228
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,250
A painful punishment awaits them.

229
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,083
Allah says, never be dishonest. 

230
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,625
For the deeds of all evil doers
is locked up in sijjin. 

231
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,292
Welcome back.

232
00:20:53,693 --> 00:20:55,901
It's been a while
since you lost your sandals, right?

233
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,500
What's wrong?

234
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,333
Is there a problem?

235
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,652
Sometimes, we forget Allah
when there are no problems, right?

236
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,000
Careful, He might give you more problems
just so you'll remember.

237
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,167
Leave me and my family alone.

238
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,375
Galang.

239
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,208
Mom.

240
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,708
Mom?

241
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,208
What's wrong, dear?

242
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,583
My stomach hurts.

243
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,875
How bad is it?

244
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,125
It hurts a lot.

245
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,625
Can I take a look?

246
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,000
Right here?

247
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,833
I wonder why...

248
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,750
I've lost so much.

249
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,417
I want to be the only woman
in Galang's life.

250
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,750
You have sacrificed too much.

251
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,083
Yet you are still not satisfied?

252
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,000
Here.

253
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,792
This is all I have. Take it all.

254
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,542
What matters is I...

255
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,667
...become the only woman in Galang's life.

256
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,083
I beg you.

257
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,667
What is his wife's name?

258
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,292
Nisa.

259
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,667
Who else lives with him at home?

260
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:18,917
There's Sofia,

261
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,542
their daughter.
And also Galang's mother who is sick.

262
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,042
Among the many evil jinns,

263
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,228
there is one clan of jinn, Anzar,

264
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,125
that is known for its hatred
towards Muslims.

265
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,917
I will communicate with them,

266
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,292
and convince them to possess Nisa.

267
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,667
Then what will happen?

268
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,833
The jinn will kill Nisa
within five nights.

269
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,792
All her blood relatives will die.

270
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,292
Die?

271
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,742
Only those related by blood.

272
00:23:57,042 --> 00:24:00,500
Within five nights, they will all die.

273
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,083
But their daughter is still very young.

274
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:06,505
-Is there no other way?
-You also had one.

275
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,458
The baby that died in your womb.

276
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,708
Do they care?

277
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,792
To convince jinn Anzar
to help with this black magic,

278
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,698
I will write
the incantation on the shinbone

279
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,801
of a freshly
deceased corpse.

280
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,458
Then wrap it with buffalo intestines.

281
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,720
But I need something from Nisa's body.

282
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:48,250
Hair, blood, or nails.

283
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,333
You also have to bring her photo.
Nisa's photo.

284
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,458
Alright.

285
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,042
Do what you have to do.

286
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,375
To the jinn who holds power over spirits.

287
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,000
Give the answer.

288
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,125
Give the answer.

289
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,958
To the empty spirit and soul.

290
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,333
To the jinn who holds power over spirits.

291
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,583
Irma, what brings you here?

292
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,250
Are you alone?

293
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,333
Yes, I had some errands to run near here.

294
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,417
But Galang is still at the market.

295
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,125
I'm not here to meet Galang.
I'm here for Sofia.

296
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,958
-Peace be with you.
-And also with you.

297
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,083
Did you like my gift?

298
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,667
I really like it, Auntie.

299
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,875
But my mom said
I'm not allowed to wear lipstick yet.

300
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,583
When I'm older, can you teach me?

301
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,708
Of course.
I'll teach you other things too.

302
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:32,000
Not just lipstick. So you can be pretty.

303
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,417
Your drink, Irma.

304
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:42,042
Why didn't you bring Aunt Farah
and Wulan with you?

305
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,000
She wasn't ready and I was in a rush.

306
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,047
Besides, if she finds out
I came here empty-handed,

307
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:51,167
she'll scold me.

308
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,833
Well, that's what parents do.

309
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,292
Be grateful you can still
hear her nagging.

310
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:01,500
Sometimes, I miss hearing
Galang's mother nagging.

311
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,750
You do?

312
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,083
You're right, Nisa.

313
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,958
I hope Auntie Tety can walk again soon.

314
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,875
And nag us like she used to.

315
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,610
Nisa, can I use the bathroom?

316
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,333
Oh, sure, of course.

317
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:06,958
Irma?

318
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:08,833
Yes?

319
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,500
Is the water running?

320
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,709
-Yes, it's running.
-Okay then.

321
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,333
Galang should be home soon.
Do you want to wait?

322
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,958
No need, Nis. I can't stay long either.

323
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:49,250
Alright, take care then.

324
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,292
Auntie, don't you wanna play
with me a bit longer?

325
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,833
Later...

326
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,583
We'll play again later, okay?

327
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,458
Alright, you promise that
we'll play again.

328
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,667
Auntie, why are you crying?

329
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,708
We'll meet again soon.

330
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:26,958
No.

331
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,625
I'm not crying.

332
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,000
I should go now.

333
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,167
-That hurts.
-What are you doing here?

334
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,917
It hurts!

335
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,458
I'm just visiting my aunt.

336
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,708
And my niece.

337
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,708
Leave my family alone.

338
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,458
Please don't drag Sofia and Nisa
into this.

339
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:22,708
Why would I...

340
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,042
...disturb my own family?

341
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,583
After all, we are family, right?

342
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,667
Don't you worry.

343
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,958
Blood will be more powerful.

344
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,833
More than hair.

345
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,667
From the male devils and female devils.

346
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,917
Truly you will not break promises.

347
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:20,208
For the bearers of knowledge,
bearers of glory.

348
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,472
We seek refuge in you
from all abominations.

349
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,917
We seek refuge in you
from all abominations.

350
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:32,292
Oh, receiver of spirits and empty souls.

351
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,208
Unite me

352
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:38,167
with Ifrit,

353
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Elzeri, and the Ruler of jinns.

354
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:47,958
Unite me with Ifrit, Elzeri,
and the Ruler of jinns.

355
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,542
The Ruler of jinns. the Ruler of jinns.

356
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,667
Put this in the dog food.

357
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,833
One portion for each day.

358
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,042
Feed them at night.

359
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,917
After five nights have passed...

360
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,583
...all your wishes will be fulfilled.

361
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,125
She will die.

362
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,333
Along with all her blood relatives.

363
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,958
Starting from tonight.

364
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,458
The first night.

365
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,042
May God forgive all our sins.

366
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:10,208
THE FIRST NIGHT

367
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,542
God is Great.

368
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,833
God hears whoever praises Him.

369
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,708
God is Great.

370
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,458
God is Great.

371
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,583
God is Great.

372
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,000
God is Great.

373
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,083
God's peace and blessings be upon you.

374
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,333
All praise belongs to God,
Lord of all that exists.

375
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,333
I seek forgiveness from God.

376
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:21,370
-Nisa. Nisa!
-I seek forgiveness from God.

377
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,092
What's wrong with you, Nis?

378
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,042
There's a buffalo head!

379
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,917
There's nothing, Nisa.

380
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,623
I'm not lying. There was a head...

381
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,167
Do you know what time it is?

382
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,833
It's three in the morning.

383
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,708
I don't have time to listen
to your nonsense.

384
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,042
THE SECOND NIGHT

385
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:59,833
Galang, where have you been?

386
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,792
The market. Where do you think?

387
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,000
Why did you come home so late?

388
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,083
I was working, Nisa. Working!

389
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,833
Enough with the questions.

390
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:18,833
I'm sorry, Nisa. I'm tired.

391
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,458
I was just saying.

392
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,250
There is something strange going on
in this house.

393
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,667
Can we talk about it later?

394
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:40,958
Galang. Wait for me.

395
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,833
Irma, what is wrong with you?

396
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,958
Why do you stay out so late?

397
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:59,128
The neighbors will talk.

398
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,417
-Leave me alone, Mom.
-Irma, listen to me.

399
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,583
Sis, what's going on?

400
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,958
My bracelet is missing.

401
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,042
I can't find your jewelry in the cupboard.

402
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,542
Where are they?

403
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,792
You used it to pay Ikhsan, right?
That shaman.

404
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,083
You really are a heartless woman.

405
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:20,750
What?

406
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,125
Heartless?

407
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,583
Yes.

408
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,250
My feelings are numb.

409
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,125
Are you happy?

410
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:38,167
You're just like mom.

411
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,375
You never supported me.

412
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,167
Enough.

413
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,708
-What's wrong with you?
-Just go!

414
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,000
Wulan?

415
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:54,500
Mom?

416
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:32,708
Wulan.

417
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,375
Are you alright?

418
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:08,000
Allah is Sufficient for us,
and He is the Best Guardian...

419
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:12,708
...He is the Excellent Protector
and the Excellent Helper.

420
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,708
Mom?

421
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,042
Mom?

422
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,458
What's wrong?

423
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,167
Mom, what's wrong?

424
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:33,375
Mother? Oh, God forgive me.

425
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,792
Mother. Mother.

426
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,833
God, forgive me. Mother.

427
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,417
I'm so sorry.

428
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,167
Please forgive me.

429
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,208
I...

430
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,167
Please forgive me, Mother.

431
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,833
Mother.

432
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:03,250
I...

433
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,667
I'm going to change the water mom.

434
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,958
Mother?

435
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:29,125
Mother!

436
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,375
Mother!

437
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,000
Mother!

438
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:41,750
Mother!

439
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,417
Mother...

440
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:58,875
THE THIRD NIGHT

441
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:21,250
Mrs. Tety is actually older
than all her siblings.

442
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,667
How do you know?

443
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:28,083
Mrs. Tety has been bedridden for years.

444
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:32,083
They say it's black magic.
Someone put a curse on her.

445
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,750
-Did you see the body?
-No, I'm scared.

446
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,167
Mom?

447
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,417
God is Great.

448
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,833
God is Great.

449
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,083
God is Great.

450
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,000
God is Great.

451
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:45,250
God is Great.

452
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,792
God is Great.

453
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:50,253
God is Great.

454
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,458
God is Great.

455
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,458
God's peace and blessings be upon you.

456
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,103
God's peace and blessings be upon you.

457
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,417
Peace be upon you and the mercy
and blessings of God.

458
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,250
God, forgive me!

459
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,000
Everybody calm down!

460
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,958
Bayu, help me. Hold Nisa.

461
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:19,000
The rest of you,
please help carry the body to the back.

462
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,645
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed,

463
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:34,500
with God's name, the
Beneficent and Merciful.

464
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:40,708
Leave this woman's body.

465
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,833
Who are you?

466
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,042
Telling me to leave?

467
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,625
I am a servant of Allah.

468
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,223
Leave.

469
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,625
Do I have to force you?

470
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,585
God, forgive me.

471
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:00,208
I want to stay here.

472
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:03,264
Don't interfere in my business!

473
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:04,586
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed...

474
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,375
...with God's name, the
Beneficent and Merciful.

475
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,208
God is Great!

476
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:23,708
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad...

477
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,125
...and upon the family of Muhammad.

478
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:35,083
Nisa.

479
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:40,167
Praise be to Allah,
the Lord of the Universe.

480
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:48,917
It's not your fault, Galang. 

481
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,973
I think Nisa is possessed by an evil jinn.

482
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:02,125
Nisa told me something strange
has been going on.

483
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,083
I didn't believe her.

484
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,458
I understand.

485
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:12,375
God willing,
I will help you find a way out.

486
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:17,458
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

487
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:24,542
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

488
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,958
Liar! You think I don't know
what you've been doing with Irma?

489
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,458
Dad?

490
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,750
Dad, what's wrong?

491
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:07,500
Nisa.

492
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,042
I'm sorry.

493
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:16,167
I should have believed you.

494
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,875
You were right.

495
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,917
Something strange is happening
in this house.

496
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:28,958
Don't worry.

497
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,875
I will ask for help from Aa' Syakir.

498
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,375
This time, it won't be easy.

499
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:43,375
The jinn that has possessed her
is terrifying.

500
00:58:43,917 --> 00:58:46,750
I often classify it as a hired jinn.

501
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:49,667
The type of jinn
that is frequently used...

502
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,875
...as a source of black magic
that instills pain...

503
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:56,292
...and destroys the people you hate.

504
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:02,125
Black magic has existed since the time
of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH.

505
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,750
Related to the many evil deeds,

506
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:08,458
narrow, and dark

507
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,667
recorded in the book of the damned.

508
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,875
So, what should I do?

509
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,375
You don't need to worry.

510
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:20,833
No matter how powerful the jinn is...

511
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:24,917
...God and His faith will always prevail.

512
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:29,500
You just need to have faith
and believe in His power.

513
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,750
God willing, I will help you
to the best of my ability.

514
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:45,417
Put some of this water
on Nisa's forehead before prayer time.

515
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,083
But make sure you perform ablution first.

516
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,042
Nisa?

517
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,708
Nisa!

518
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,417
Nisa?

519
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,125
This is from Aa' Syakir.

520
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:25,458
Nisa.

521
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:28,570
Mom is gone.

522
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:34,374
I only have you and Sofia now.

523
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,791
Please don't do this.

524
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,750
I don't know what to do.

525
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,375
Now you get some rest.

526
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,333
Careful.

527
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:17,167
THE FOURTH NIGHT

528
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:50,833
Peace be with you.

529
01:05:58,625 --> 01:05:59,708
Mom?

530
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,125
Mom?

531
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,375
Mom?

532
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,500
Forgive me God.

533
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:11,083
Oh my God, Mom!

534
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:24,500
Oh, God. Mom.

535
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:30,875
Oh, God.

536
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:34,042
Mom!

537
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:41,833
Oh, God.

538
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:47,208
MRS. FARAH DAUGHTER OF CAHYONO

539
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:48,583
We'll leave now.

540
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:51,625
We take our leave now.

541
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:18,750
Irma.

542
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,125
It's just the two of us now.

543
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,417
It's my fault.

544
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,542
I was wrong, Wulan.

545
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,496
I really am a heartless woman.

546
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,208
This is my fault.

547
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,917
What did you do?

548
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:11,250
I think Auntie Tety...

549
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,500
...and Mom died because of me.

550
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,833
I went to the shaman again.

551
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:25,000
Forgive me God.

552
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:28,583
Forgive me God.

553
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,250
Forgive me, Wulan.

554
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh, God.

555
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,250
What did you do?

556
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,292
Forgive me.

557
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:46,250
I'm scared.

558
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,042
Tell me.

559
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,750
This is all because of Galang, isn't it?

560
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,792
I had a miscarriage.

561
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,667
I lost Galang's baby.

562
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,500
I was angry.

563
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,958
I didn't think twice
and went to visit the shaman.

564
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:22,000
That shaman deceived you.
Oh, God, forgive us.

565
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,667
Wulan, the shaman
only asked for Nisa's blood.

566
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:34,375
He said...

567
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:37,194
...all of Nisa's blood relatives,

568
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,708
all of Nisa's blood relatives,
will die.

569
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:44,875
But Mom and Aunt Tety are not
blood relatives of Nisa.

570
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:48,415
It shouldn't have been like this, Wulan.
It shouldn't.

571
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,125
Then what do you want now?

572
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:53,083
You are cruel. Heartless.

573
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:57,833
What happens after this?

574
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,750
Mom died because of this.
That means we're next, right?

575
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,583
Do you want me to die?

576
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,790
What should we do now?

577
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,375
What now?

578
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,625
I'll make things right.

579
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,417
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

580
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:19,417
You will be fine, Wulan.

581
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:23,458
Please forgive me.

582
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,292
Mom.

583
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,249
Is Grandma Tety in heaven now?

584
01:10:36,792 --> 01:10:40,250
How do you know for sure
that people who die go to heaven?

585
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,458
It's possible that...

586
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,708
...Grandma Tety will meet
Grandma Farah in hell?

587
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:53,625
Mom?

588
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:58,500
Mom, what's wrong?

589
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:03,375
Mom?

590
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,542
Mom?

591
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,250
Nisa! Nisa!

592
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:34,875
Nisa.

593
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,042
Nisa?

594
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:47,750
Nisa.

595
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:15,833
Peace be with you.

596
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,875
I seek forgiveness from God.

597
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:24,292
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

598
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,583
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

599
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:37,667
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad,
and upon the Progeny of Muhammad.

600
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:45,583
There are preparations we need to make
before Nisa's healing.

601
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:51,000
Tonight, bring Nisa to the hall
behind the mosque.

602
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,375
What should I do?

603
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,708
I'm afraid of losing her again.

604
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:02,333
Even though we will face
a very evil and powerful jinn...

605
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,333
...we must not be afraid.

606
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:08,667
We must believe that we can defeat it.

607
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:11,417
We have Allah.

608
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:18,708
Wipe Nisa's face with the holy water
I gave you.

609
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:20,667
And put a veil over Nisa's head.

610
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,667
Galang.

611
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:27,333
There is a way to seek forgiveness
from Allah...

612
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,250
...for all the sins
that we have committed.

613
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,667
By doing prayer of repentance.

614
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:41,292
-Peace be with you.
-And also with you.

615
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,458
What are you doing here?

616
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,875
Aren't you satisfied yet?

617
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,792
Galang.

618
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:08,667
I am sorry.

619
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,042
This is my fault.

620
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:15,958
All these deaths...

621
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,125
My mother,

622
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,708
Auntie...

623
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:30,000
That Jinn...

624
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,667
It was you who've been sending it
all this time?

625
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,042
You're out of your mind.

626
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,667
You're crazy!

627
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:46,417
You think I'm the only one at fault?

628
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:48,667
Huh?

629
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,792
You're also at fault!

630
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,167
You're the one who drove me crazy!

631
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,958
You played with my feelings!

632
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:58,250
But I didn't kill my family!

633
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,917
Okay, fine.

634
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,042
I was wrong.

635
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:09,750
I was wrong to let a man
like you ruin my life!

636
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:19,208
I don't care about the consequences.

637
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,250
I just...

638
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,625
I just want to protect my family.

639
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:53,875
THE FIFTH NIGHT

640
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:06,875
Wulan.

641
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,500
This is the final night since the ritual.

642
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,625
We need to hurry back to that shaman.

643
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:19,083
Wulan.

644
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,458
I seek forgiveness from God.

645
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:45,833
Come here, Irma!

646
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:00,501
Wulan!

647
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,583
Wake up, Wulan!

648
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:24,708
It's me, Wulan!

649
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:27,167
Oh, God.

650
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,208
Sis?

651
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,042
Sister.

652
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,000
Wulan?

653
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:56,333
Wulan is going to die.

654
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,625
Oh, my God. Wulan! Wulan!

655
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,500
Wulan. Wulan!

656
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:06,292
Oh, God.

657
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,000
No, no, no!

658
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:12,333
No, please! Oh, God, no!

659
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,958
No! Wulan, no!

660
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:26,333
Wulan! Wulan, please no. Oh, God.

661
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,667
Please, don't. Wulan!

662
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,125
Wulan?

663
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,375
Wulan!

664
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,250
No!

665
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:08,625
God is great.

666
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,708
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

667
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:13,691
We address this
Al-Fatihah reading to Allah...

668
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:16,875
...and His reward for all
of them. Al Fatihah...

669
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:21,105
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

670
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,333
All praise is for Allah
Lord of all worlds...

671
01:21:23,417 --> 01:21:25,458
...the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,
Master of the Day of Judgment.

672
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,220
You (alone) we worship
and You (alone) we ask for help.

673
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,875
Guide us along the Straight Path...

674
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,132
...the Path of those You
have blessed—not those...

675
01:21:33,216 --> 01:21:35,625
...You are displeased with,
or those who are astray.

676
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:23,333
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

677
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:27,958
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

678
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:31,458
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

679
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:32,833
Peace be with you.

680
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,333
Peace be upon you and the mercy
and blessings of Allah.

681
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,875
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

682
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:06,000
Peace be upon you, Prophet of Allah.

683
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:09,792
Peace be upon you, my beloved,
Messenger of Allah.

684
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,708
Ikhsan!

685
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,083
Ikhsan!

686
01:23:19,125 --> 01:23:20,167
Ikhsan!

687
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,458
Where is Ikhsan?

688
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,625
He is not home.

689
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:28,292
No, wait. Wait, wait!

690
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,458
You have to help me.

691
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,625
You have to help me stop all of this.

692
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,250
It's too late.

693
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:38,833
A Jinn that has been summoned
cannot be controlled.

694
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:41,708
Then why did my mother and sister die?

695
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,833
Whose blood did you bring here?

696
01:23:52,542 --> 01:23:53,750
No.

697
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,292
Ikhsan must be inside.

698
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:56,875
Move.

699
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,333
Move. Get out of my way!

700
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,833
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

701
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,458
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

702
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,083
In the name of Allah,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

703
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:17,208
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

704
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,833
God is Great.

705
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,833
Hold her!

706
01:24:24,917 --> 01:24:26,083
Get a rope.

707
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:31,042
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

708
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,042
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

709
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,250
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

710
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,125
Ikhsan!

711
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:48,750
Ikhsan!

712
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,667
I don't care!

713
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,750
I don't care if I'm not with Galang!

714
01:24:55,583 --> 01:24:58,500
Save me. Please help me!

715
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:00,958
I was stupid!

716
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,333
I was wrong.

717
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,875
Ikhsan!

718
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:08,583
Stop everything. Please, I beg you.

719
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,333
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

720
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,917
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

721
01:25:17,417 --> 01:25:19,367
Allah, bestow Your favor
on Muhammad...

722
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:21,250
...and on the family of Muhammad...

723
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,151
...as You have
bestowed Your favor on Ibrahim...

724
01:25:24,235 --> 01:25:25,750
...and on the
family of Ibrahim.

725
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,792
Allah, bless Muhammad
and the family of Muhammad...

726
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,371
...as You have blessed Ibrahim
and the family of Ibrahim...

727
01:25:32,455 --> 01:25:35,941
...You are Praiseworthy,
Most Glorious.

728
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:37,875
God is Great!

729
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:52,625
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

730
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,208
I regret everything.

731
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,000
Nisa.

732
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,250
Nisa?

733
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:17,214
Oh, God.

734
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,748
Keep praying.

735
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:20,000
What's happening?

736
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,516
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

737
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:28,542
There is none worthy of worship
except Allah.

738
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:38,000
With Your permission, Allah.

739
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,375
No one else should die.

740
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:59,208
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

741
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,670
Allah, there is no
deity except Him...

742
01:27:11,754 --> 01:27:13,667
...the Ever-Living, the
Sustainer of (all) existence.

743
01:27:13,792 --> 01:27:16,333
Neither drowsiness overtakes Him
nor sleep.

744
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:18,917
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens
and whatever is on the earth.

745
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:21,987
Who is it that can intercede
with Him except by His permission?

746
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,583
He knows what is (presently) before them
and what will be after them...

747
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,505
...and they encompass
not a thing...

748
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,333
...of His knowledge except
for what He wills.

749
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:30,833
His Kursi extends over the heavens
and the earth...

750
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:35,500
..."and their preservation tires Him not.
And He is the Most High, the Most Great."

751
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,542
I seek forgiveness from God.

752
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:13,934
You son of a bitch.

753
01:28:14,542 --> 01:28:18,167
You will die just like
Irma's baby that you killed.

754
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,917
And your whole family...

755
01:28:21,167 --> 01:28:23,500
...will perish.

756
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:27,708
Oh, God. Faiz, get my staff.

757
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,833
-God is Great!
-A'! No, please!

758
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,612
Galang, what we're facing now
is not Nisa anymore...

759
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,917
...but an evil jinn!

760
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:47,458
-Nisa.
-God is Great!

761
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:17,583
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

762
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,333
Nisa?

763
01:30:50,042 --> 01:30:51,083
Nisa?

764
01:30:52,167 --> 01:30:53,208
Nisa?

765
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,667
Nisa, wake up.

766
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:58,458
Please.

767
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:04,167
Galang, if Nisa is indeed possessed
by a jinn...

768
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:08,833
...this staff should not harm her.

769
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,625
Nisa, please wake up.

770
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,250
I can't go on without you.

771
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,000
The jinn possessed Sofia.

772
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:42,042
She's the one controlling everything.

773
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:44,417
And has caused all those deaths
in your family.

774
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,167
-Galang.
-Sofia.

775
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,750
Do you know why your stomach hurts?

776
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:10,417
It's because you got your period.

777
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,917
My daughter is a teenager now.

778
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:21,458
Sofia gave me a fright.

779
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,917
Turns out she just got her period.

780
01:32:25,417 --> 01:32:28,250
It's her first day today.

781
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,417
Only those related by blood. 

782
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:49,125
Within five nights, they will all die. 

783
01:32:57,917 --> 01:33:00,958
Mother! Mother!

784
01:33:02,292 --> 01:33:03,417
Mother!

785
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,333
Mother!

786
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:28,708
Wulan, no! Oh, God!

787
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:31,833
Wulan.

788
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:36,042
Wulan! No! No!

789
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:07,250
Forgive me, Sofia.

790
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:12,125
Please forgive me.

791
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:31,708
I seek refuge in Allah
from Satan the accursed.

792
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,250
God is Great!

793
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:30,784
A FAMILY WAS FOUND
IN A HORRIFYING STATE

794
01:35:30,868 --> 01:35:33,208
IN THE BASEMENT OF A
MOSQUE IN PANDEGLANG.

795
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:35,948
THE HUSBAND WAS FOUND
DEAD WITH A BROKEN NECK

796
01:35:36,032 --> 01:35:38,333
WHILE HIS WIFE AND
DAUGHTER WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

797
01:35:38,417 --> 01:35:41,270
THE POLICE ALSO FOUND
THE HUSBAND'S TWO COUSINS DEAD

798
01:35:41,354 --> 01:35:44,120
IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

799
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:47,458
THE WIFE, WHO WAS IN
CRITICAL CONDITION

800
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:50,885
WAS RESCUED, NOW EXHIBITS
UNEXPLAINED MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

801
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,195
THE DAUGHTER HAS
FULLY RECOVERED

802
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:55,208
HAS NO SURVIVING RELATIVES
LEFT TO CARE FOR HER.
