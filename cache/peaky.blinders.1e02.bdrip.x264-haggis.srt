00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,125
He doesn't have a name.

320
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
Poor boy, deserves a name.

Do you have something to say to me?

The other night you came into the pub
when [was singing.

You said singing wasn't allowed.

324
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,928
I'd like there to be one night a week
when there's singing.

you strike when the enemy is weak.

hit me with that thing

Polly, Freddie'll come back.

418

In the end, I did it myself.

I did it to myself.

Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.

435
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,129
I chose this place because

436
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,082
it is outside both of our jurisdictions.

437
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,521

438
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,888
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation

439
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,644
because I want us
to understand each other.

440
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm a businessman.

441
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,082
I want to make my business successful.

And I want my city run peacefully.

443

Well, if the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

444
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,044
So we're on the same side.

445
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,286
I think perhaps we could be.

446

when I see things like this?

448
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,569
My men found this

449
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,481
in the bedroom

450
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,889
of a known communist.

451
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,884
It has your sister's name on it.

452
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,845
It was obvious she'd been
sleeping in his bed.

453
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,644
Are you also in bed
with the communists, Mr Shelby?

454
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,125
I do not share their fantasy.

455
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,209
And as for my sister,

456
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,084
I've already dealt with the situation.

457
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,687
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

458
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,000
Well, cross him off.

459
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,730
He won't be returning to the city.

460
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,002
I'll make him part of our deal.

461
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,925
What deal?

462
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,489
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

463
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,649
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing our pubs.

464
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,405
No more lifting my runners.

465
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,646
You will turn a blind eye
to all of my gambling operations. Also,

with Billy Kimber.

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,845
He runs most of the legal trackside
betting outside of London.

470
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,450
He has policemen on his payroll.

471
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,847
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector of Gloucestershire,

472
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,562
that his men should leave me alone

473
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,609
when I make my move.

474
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,283
Forgive me, I don't seem to have a pen

475
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,650
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

476
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,965
And what do I get in return?

477
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,531
I have what you're looking for.

478
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,085
I have the guns.

479
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,561
What guns?

480
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,883
- I'm not here to play games.
-Wait, wait...

481
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,571
Twenty five Lewis machine guns.
Fifty carbines.

482
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,962
Ten thousand rounds of ammunition.

483
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,162
All in a crate bound for Libya.

484
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,927
Stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

485
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,565
I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham
to get those guns back.

486
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,605
Well,

487
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,166
it's me that has them.

488
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,842
I have left word with men l trust,

489
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,605
that if I am taken into police custody
for whatever reason,

490
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,804
those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

491
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,687
From there, they will be sent
directly to Belfast.

492
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,765
And sold to the Irish Republican Army.

493
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,168
All your good work in Ireland
will be undone.

494
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,008
Each stolen weapon
is numbered and marked.

495
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,241
If I sell them to the IRA, it won't
be long before Mr Churchill finds out.

496
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,526
I imagine you got into enough trouble

497
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,409
over the burning
of the King's photographs.

498
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,046
That was just a taster.

499
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,689
If those guns reach Belfast,

500
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,128
your life in the force is over.

501
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
When I have achieved
what I have set out to achieve,

502
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,524
I will let you know where
to find the guns.

503
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,561
You'll be a hero.

504
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,883
You'll probably get a medal.

505
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,641
I'm a fair man.

506
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,961
It's a fair offer.

507
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,686
Do we have a deal?

508
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,920
I need an answer.

509
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,961
Right now.

510
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,961
Very well.

511
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,204
But I'd prefer if we don't
shake hands on it.

512
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,043
Now, why would I shake the hand of a man

513
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,684
who didn't even fight for his country?

Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,

520
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,921
So what shall I do?

521
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,529
It hurts me as much as it...

522
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,927
As it would a father sending
his own daughter into a whorehouse.

523
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,441
But no matter how repugnant it may be,

524
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,400
you must do everything you can

525
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,606

everything, I don't mean...

You underestimate me in every way.

00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,810

Tell me. Tell me, Curly.
What's wrong with 'the horse?

546
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,803
You bought at the fair in bad feeling.

547
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,687
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof
and got an old woman to put a spell.

548
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,802
So those Lee bastards cursed him.

549
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,005
Whatever it is, he says it

It's going to his heart
by tomorrow, I say!

552

I've seen curses like this twice.
Can't take them back, Tom.

No.

554
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,801
I told you, Tommy.

Where's Harry?

567
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,566
He took the night off.

568
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,210
Went to the pictures.

569
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,646
How's your beautiful horse?

570
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,684
I just put a bullet in his head.

571
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,281
Was he lame?

572
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,284
He looked at me the wrong way.

573
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,289
It's not a good idea
to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

574
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,524
- What a waste.
-Yeah.

575
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,128
A waste is what it is.

576
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,721
You know, in France...

577
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,087
In France, I got used to seeing men die.

578
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,089
Never got used to seeing horses die.

579
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,761
They die badly.

580
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,770
I dug out a dress like you asked.

581
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,766
Thanks.

582
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,889
It's Cheltenham you're talking about.

583
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,250
Cheltenham's a grand affair, is it not?

584
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,126
The King will be there.

585
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,290
- King George?
-No.

586

I won't be wearing a cheap dress.

And [ask you to let me sing.

593
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,241
It's part of the deal now, too.

594
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,281
Since when?

595
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,886
Since you nearly smiled.

Saturday nights. Open and easy.

597

Everyone gets to sing their song,
just like we did in Dublin.

You never worked in Dublin.

So don't lie to me.

600
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,202
I asked around about that pub
you said you used to work in.

601

I have friends over there.

No one has heard of you.

603
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,806
My guess is,

604
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,804
you're a girl from a good family

605
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,931
who got herself pregnant.

606
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,085
It's not something I want known.

607
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,126
And bringing a child into the
world alone ruined your life.

608
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,531
Right?

609
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,526
So I'm right.

610
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,520
And Polly is wrong.

611
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,645
Right about what?

612
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,004
Doesn't matter.

613
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,691
Looks like it matters to you.

614
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,689
Family business.

615
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,970
You won't tell anyone my secret?

616
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,648
Do you think I tell people things?

617
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,410
So what do you sing?

618
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,964
- Anything you want.
-Right.

Tommy got a message to me.

Said, "Get out of town.
Take her with you."

We're not going anywhere, Ada.
