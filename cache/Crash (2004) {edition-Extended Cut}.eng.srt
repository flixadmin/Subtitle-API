1
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,438
<i>It's the sense of touch.</i>

2
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,271
<i>What?</i>

3
00:02:56,563 --> 00:03:00,520
<i>Any real city, you walk, you know?</i>

4
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:03,479
<i>You brush past people.
People bump into you.</i>

5
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>In LA, nobody touches you.</i>

6
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:12,978
We're always behind this metal and glass.

7
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,102
I think we miss that touch so much

8
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:21,769
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:25,311
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,227
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,102
<i>You don't think that's true?</i>

12
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,101
<i>Stay in your car.</i>

13
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:35,934
<i>Graham, I think we got rear-ended.</i>

14
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:38,351
<i>I think we spun around twice.</i>

15
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:42,101
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:45,475
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,725
<i>-Calm down, ma'am.
-I am calm!</i>

18
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,808
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,100
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,933
-She do this!
-My fault?

21
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:59,099
Ma'am, you really need to wait
in your vehicle.

22
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,099
-My fault?
-Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,849
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,557
<i>-She Blake too fast.
-I "Blake" too fast? I "Blake" too fast.</i>

25
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:10,599
-I'm sorry you no see my "Blake" light.
-Ma'am.

26
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,389
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:17,264
Maybe you see over steering wheel,
you "Blake" too!

28
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,514
-Ma'am!
-Crazy Mexican.

29
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,598
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

30
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,556
<i>Officer, can you please write down
in your report</i>

31
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,431
<i>how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver.</i>

32
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,639
<i>-Ma'am!
-Ma'am, no. See, it's Detectiveâ€¦</i>

33
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:35,306
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,138
-Hey, Detective. Nice entrance.
-Fuck you.

35
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,761
-Hey, you okay?
-I'm freezing.

36
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:58,053
Shit. I heard it might snow.

37
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:00,428
-Get out of here.
-That's what I heard.

38
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,012
-You got a smoke?
-No. I quit.

39
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,137
Yeah, me, too.

40
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,969
-What do you got?
-Dead kid.

41
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,428
Hey, Bob.

42
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,190
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

43
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,630
Yo, Osama!

44
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,464
Plan a jihad on your own time.
What do you want?

45
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,713
-Are you making insult at me?
-Am I making insult "at" you?

46
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:31,213
Is that the closest
you can come to English?

47
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,254
Yes, I speak English!
I am American citizen.

48
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:35,421
-Oh, God, here we go.
-I have right like you.

49
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,629
-I have right to buy gun.
-Not in my store, you don't.

50
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,004
-Andy, get him out of here now!
-Dad, go wait in the car.

51
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,172
Now. Get out!

52
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,462
You're an ignorant man!

53
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,670
Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country

54
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:48,962
and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

55
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,003
-Get the fuck out of my store!
-No, you get the fuck!

56
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:52,253
-Now, come on.
-Get out!

57
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:53,920
No, don't touch me! He cheat me this man!

58
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,796
-Andy, now!
-Come on, let's go.

59
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,545
Okay.

60
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,711
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,336
And I am really hoping for the money.

62
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,251
-What kind of ammunition do you want?
-Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,335
Oh, we got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,918
We got long colts,
short colts, ball heads,

65
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,543
flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:23,959
and a dozen more
that'll fit any size hole.

67
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:28,626
Just depends upon
how much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:34,126
I'll take the ones in the red box.

69
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:39,167
-You know what those are?
-Can I have them?

70
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,374
Did you see any white people in there

71
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,248
waiting an hour and 32 minutes
for a plate of spaghetti, huh?

72
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:54,998
And how many cups of coffee did we get?

73
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,623
You don't drink coffee,
and I didn't want any.

74
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:59,957
Man, that woman in there
poured cup after cup

75
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,748
to every single white person around us,

76
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,373
but did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

77
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,956
We didn't get any coffee
that you didn't want and I didn't order,

78
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,414
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

79
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:11,372
Did you notice that
our waitress was black?

80
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,831
And black women
don't think in stereotypes?

81
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:14,914
You tell me something, man.

82
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:17,706
When was the last time you met one
who didn't think she knew everything

83
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,830
about your little, lazy ass
before you even opened your mouth, huh?

84
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,871
That waitress sized us up in two seconds.

85
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:26,746
We're black, and black people don't tip.
So she wasn't gonna waste her time.

86
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,038
Now, somebody like that,
nothing you can do to change their mind.

87
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,454
Yeah, well, how much did you leave?

88
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,954
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

89
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,496
What?

90
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:39,204
What the fuck is you laughing at, man?

91
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:42,162
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

92
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:44,537
Hardly. I'd just like to see you
get through a meal

93
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,411
without calling her
or anyone else for that matter.

94
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,244
Okay, look, no more phone calls tonight.

95
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,078
As a matter of fact,
here, you can hold the battery.

96
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,245
Okay?

97
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,994
$10 says she calls you in the car.

98
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,785
Wait, wait, wait.
You see what that woman just did?

99
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,827
-You see that?
-Why, she's cold.

100
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,702
She got colder
as soon as she saw us, dawg.

101
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,410
-Oh, man, come on, don't start.
-Man, look around you, man.

102
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:11,952
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

103
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,117
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

104
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,951
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

105
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,285
and her reaction is blind fear?

106
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:22,076
I mean, look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

107
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,534
Huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.

108
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:29,533
Fact. If anybody
should be scared around here, it's us.

109
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:33,616
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

110
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,116
patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.

111
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,950
So you tell me. Why aren't we scared?

112
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,908
'Cause we got guns?

113
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,949
You could be right.

114
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,240
-Get the fuck out of the car!
-Give me the keys!

115
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,282
-Come on. Hurry up!
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.

116
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,407
Get down!

117
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,239
-No, no! Please!
-Don't look at me!

118
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,906
Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.
Turn around!

119
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,282
Move. Let's go, come on.
We're good. We're fine. Just keep moving.

120
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:09,655
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing
off of there right now.

121
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,238
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

122
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:14,363
Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.

123
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,072
You had a conversation with God, huh?
What did God say?

124
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:18,363
"Go forth, my son,

125
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:21,987
"and leave big slobbery suction rings
on every dashboard you find?"

126
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,362
Why the hell do you do that?

127
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:26,196
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

128
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,070
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

129
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:38,903
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the
Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.

130
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,403
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

131
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,695
Wait a minute,
this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

132
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,445
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

133
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,112
I got the Mercedes.

134
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:52,569
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

135
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,803
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

136
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:59,610
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

137
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,319
He says he kept trying to drive away.

138
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,901
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

139
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,943
Shot back in self-defense.

140
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:10,277
-Anybody actually see who shot first?
-They just heard two bangs.

141
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,568
Find me a witness.

142
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,776
That is a nice gun.

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,150
Well, the car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

144
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,775
And that's not Cindy.

145
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:39,232
That is a William Lewis.

146
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,316
Found it under the front seat.
Hollywood division.

147
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:50,149
Looks like Detective Conklin shot himself
the wrong nigger.

148
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:05,022
-How much longer are you gonna be?
-This is the last one.

149
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:06,398
Thank you.

150
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,604
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

151
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,480
I need to talk to you for a second.

152
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:24,062
You just give me a minute, all right?

153
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,021
-And find Flanagan, will you? Now.
-Yes, sir.

154
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,103
Yes, honey?

155
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,062
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

156
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:33,145
You wantâ€¦

157
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,895
Look, why don't you just go lie down, huh?
Have you checked on James?

158
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,519
Well, of course I've checked on James.

159
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,436
I've checked on him every five minutes
since we've been home.

160
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,269
-Do not patronize me.
-I'mâ€¦

161
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,894
I want the locks changed again
in the morning.

162
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:46,769
It's okay. Just go to bed.

163
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:50,144
You know what, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

164
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,019
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

165
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:54,810
Is okay I go home now?

166
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,643
It's fine.
Thank you very much for staying, Maria.

167
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:57,810
You're welcome. No problem.

168
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,060
-Good night, Miss Jean.
-Good night.

169
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:00,935
We'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:05,225
I would like the locks changed again
in the morning.

171
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:07,975
And you know what?
You might mention that we'd appreciate it

172
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,809
if next time
they didn't send a gang member.

173
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,142
-A gang member?
-Yes, yes.

174
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:12,559
-What, you mean that kid in there?
-Yes.

175
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:15,892
The guy in there with the shaved head, the
pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

176
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,017
Those are not prison tattoos.

177
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,891
Oh, really?
And he's not gonna go sell our key

178
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,141
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

179
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,474
We've had a really tough night.

180
00:13:22,558 --> 00:13:24,683
I think it'd be best
if you just went upstairs right nowâ€¦

181
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,266
And, what? Wait for them to break in?

182
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,391
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

183
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,683
You lower your voice!

184
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,557
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

185
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,557
But if a white person
sees two black men walking towards her,

186
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:40,057
and she turns and walks in the
other direction, she's a racist, right?

187
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,473
Well, I got scared and
I didn't say anything.

188
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:45,390
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

189
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:46,556
Now, I am telling you.

190
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,472
Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key
to one of his homies.

191
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,644
And this time it'd be really fucking great

192
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,056
if you acted like you
actually gave a shit!

193
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,679
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

194
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,720
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

195
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:28,428
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

196
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:31,345
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

197
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,012
Fuck!

198
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:38,345
Why did these guys have to be black?
I mean, why?

199
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,677
No matter how we spin this thing,

200
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,760
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

201
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,343
You know, I think you're worrying
too much.

202
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,094
You have a lot of support
in the black community.

203
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:52,093
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

204
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:56,593
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

205
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:58,385
Bruce?

206
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:03,009
The firefighter.
The one who saved the camp or something.

207
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,676
Northridge. What's his name?

208
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,093
He's Iraqi.

209
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:08,300
He's Iraqi?

210
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,508
Well, he looks black.

211
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:13,841
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

212
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,508
Saddam? His name's Saddam?

213
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,175
Well, that's real good, Bruce.

214
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,549
Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

215
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,299
Give yourself a raise, will you?

216
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,258
It's been good doing business with you.

217
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:33,215
-How soon can I have them?
-I'm picking them up right now.

218
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,756
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

219
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,298
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

220
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:43,881
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to
the clinic three times in the last month.

221
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:46,881
He is being treated
for a urinary tract infection.

222
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,297
<i>That is by no means an emergency.</i>

223
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,880
Now, if you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

224
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:55,922
why don't you make an appointment
to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,

225
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,213
Monday through Friday?

226
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,380
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

227
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,338
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

228
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:04,129
-I wanna talk to your supervisor.
-I am my supervisor.

229
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,837
-Yeah, what is your name?
-Shaniqua Johnson.

230
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,212
Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.

231
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,338
Ohâ€¦

232
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,670
<i>â€¦1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>

233
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,710
<i>Vehicle described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>

234
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:35,085
<i>California plates, 4
Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>

235
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,253
<i>Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.</i>

236
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,210
That's not it.

237
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,668
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

238
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:55,552
The driver's gotta be 40, and nobody
jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.

239
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,834
They were doing something.

240
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,206
Enthusiastic.

241
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:52,580
Keep your hands
where I can see them, please.

242
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,371
I'm gonna need to see your
driver's license and registration.

243
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,121
No problem. I'm gonna have to

244
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:02,121
reach inside of the glove compartment
to get the registration.

245
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,496
-Is that okay?
-Nice and slow, please.

246
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,662
Okay.

247
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,412
How are you tonight, Officer?

248
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,662
Excellent.

249
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,704
Here you go.

250
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,078
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

251
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,660
Let's do it again right now.

252
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,910
Step out of the car, please, sir.

253
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,701
Wait, wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

254
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,368
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

255
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:46,367
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

256
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:48,034
No, it's okay.

257
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:49,868
It's fine.

258
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,159
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

259
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:00,742
That's good. Right there.

260
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:03,783
Look at me.

261
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,408
I want you to stand on your right foot.

262
00:19:07,492 --> 00:19:10,825
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

263
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,865
I told you he doesn't drink.

264
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,365
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time
to stay in the vehicle.

265
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:23,865
-Ma'am?
-Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

266
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,157
Don't you "ma'am" me.

267
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,197
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

268
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:30,364
Look, Officer,
my wife has had a couple of drinksâ€¦

269
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,864
All right, both of you turn around.

270
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:33,781
Put your hands on top of your head
and interlock your fingers.

271
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,947
No, wait. Wait a minute.
We're only a block away from our house.

272
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:37,197
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

273
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:38,697
-That's not even necessary.
-Hands on your head.

274
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:39,739
Interlock your fingers.

275
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,697
Look, I'm a television director.

276
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:44,155
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

277
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,446
Get your hands off him.
He has done nothing wrong.

278
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,196
Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.

279
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,155
-Will you just do what he says?
-Fuck you!

280
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,946
Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.

281
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,280
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

282
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:57,363
-You motherfucking pig!
-Christine, just stop talking.

283
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,821
That's quite a mouth you have.

284
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,820
Of course you know that.

285
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:04,654
Fuck you!
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

286
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:07,029
You thought you saw
a white woman blowing a black man,

287
00:20:07,113 --> 00:20:08,736
and that just
drove your little cracker ass crazy.

288
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,694
Will you just shut your fucking mouth?

289
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:13,195
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

290
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,362
Put your legs open.

291
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:21,528
Now, do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

292
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:24,152
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

293
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,777
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

294
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,236
He's clean.

295
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:32,236
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

296
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:37,067
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

297
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,776
while you were operating a motor vehicle.

298
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,651
That's reckless endangerment,
which, incidentally, is a felony.

299
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:47,317
Now we can charge your wife here

300
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:50,817
with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

301
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,567
Now you say you're a block from home.

302
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,817
Now, we could use our discretion

303
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,192
and let you go with a warning,

304
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,899
or we can cuff you
and put you in the back of the car.

305
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:08,566
What do you think we should do, sir?

306
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,232
Look, we're sorryâ€¦

307
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,565
â€¦and we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

308
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,897
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

309
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:36,231
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

310
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:40,022
Yeah.

311
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:41,814
All right.

312
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,855
You can go.

313
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,980
You folks drive safe now, huh?

314
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:32,685
Let's go, Tommy.

315
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,517
It won't close.

316
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,892
I can do that.

317
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,850
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

318
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,434
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun.

319
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:54,307
Here. Now you can shoot anybody you want.

320
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:57,182
Dorri, that man could've
killed your mother.

321
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,557
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

322
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,766
Farhad, it won't close.

323
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,390
Dorri, you should be at work.

324
00:23:21,639 --> 00:23:23,347
Who are you calling?

325
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,306
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

326
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,930
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

327
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:34,054
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

328
00:23:34,138 --> 00:23:36,055
And you just stood there.

329
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:39,846
And then you apologized to him?

330
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,013
I mean, what did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

331
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:46,720
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard? Pathetic.

332
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:50,303
Yeah, well, maybe you would've
been satisfied with just being arrested.

333
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,512
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

334
00:23:54,596 --> 00:23:56,762
than get your name in the paper.

335
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:59,178
You know, you finally got me figured out,

336
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:02,344
'cause see, that's exactly
what I was worried about, right there.

337
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:05,636
Oh, and it wasn't? You weren't afraid
that all your good friends at the studio

338
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,844
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize that,

339
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:10,011
you know what, he's actually black?

340
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,969
You need to calm down right now.

341
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:16,551
No, what I need is a husband
who will not just stand there

342
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,176
while I am being molested!

343
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,719
I mean, they were cops, for God's sakes!
They had guns!

344
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,676
You know what? Maybe I
should've let them arrest your ass.

345
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,342
I mean, sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

346
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,550
Fuck you, man. Like you know.

347
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:36,175
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

348
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,592
Yeah, well, at least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

349
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:40,842
Yeah, you're right, Cameron.

350
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:44,383
I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't
quite learned how to shuck and jive.

351
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,966
Let me hear it again.
"Thank you, Mr. Policeman.

352
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,508
"You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

353
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:54,467
"You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife."

354
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:59,549
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

355
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:02,466
You know, fuck you!

356
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:07,432
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

357
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,545
-How's it going?
-Okay.

358
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,835
You didn't get scared or something,
did you?

359
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,127
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

360
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:09,627
-There's no such thing as monsters.
-Oh, that's a good thing.

361
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:12,377
I heard a bang.

362
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,294
Like a truck bang?

363
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:16,211
Like a gun.

364
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:26,918
That's funny, because we moved out
of that bad neighborhood.

365
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,835
And there's not too many guns around here.

366
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,375
How far can bullets go?

367
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,584
They go pretty far.

368
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,875
But they usually get stuck in something
and stop.

369
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,667
What if they don't?

370
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,041
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

371
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,208
Because we never did find it, did we?

372
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:53,458
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

373
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,873
And you think it was that same bullet
that you heard tonight?

374
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:05,331
-You think we should move again?
-I like it here.

375
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,415
Me, too. But if that bullet found out
where we livedâ€¦

376
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:10,581
Oh, hold on.

377
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:11,747
What?

378
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,581
So stupid! How can I forget?

379
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:16,289
What?

380
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:20,205
No, forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.

381
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:21,497
Tell me.

382
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:23,747
Okay.

383
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:28,871
When I was five,
this fairy came into my room one night.

384
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:29,996
Right.

385
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,121
See, I told you
you weren't gonna believe me.

386
00:27:32,205 --> 00:27:35,080
-Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
-No, tell me.

387
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,371
Okay.

388
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:43,204
So this fairy comes into my room and
I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

389
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,995
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

390
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,661
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

391
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:51,203
She was flying?

392
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:52,726
Yeah, but she had these little stubby

393
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,619
wings.
She could've glued them on, you know?

394
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:57,327
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

395
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,369
So she said, "I'll prove it."

396
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,785
So she reaches into her backpack,

397
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:04,285
and she pulls out this invisible cloak.

398
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,243
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

399
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:11,077
You know what "impenetrable" means?

400
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,701
It means that nothing can go through it.

401
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:15,535
No bullets. Nothing.

402
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,327
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

403
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:20,951
So I did.

404
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,409
And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.

405
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,826
I mean, how weird is that?

406
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,617
Only she told me
that I was supposed to give it

407
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:33,283
to my daughter on her fifth birthday
and I forgot.

408
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:35,658
Can I touch it?

409
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,658
Sure, go ahead.

410
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,450
-I don't feel it.
-Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

411
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:45,366
If you want I can take it off
and tie it around your shoulders.

412
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,365
She told me how to do it.

413
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,698
Unless you think it's stupid thenâ€¦

414
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:52,699
-Don't you need it?
-No, not anymore.

415
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,532
So what do you think? You want it?

416
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,531
Okay, let's get out of here.

417
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:11,448
Okay.

418
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,155
Hold your chin up.

419
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:34,696
Okay. Is that too tight?

420
00:29:35,404 --> 00:29:37,196
Do you feel anything at all?

421
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:40,946
Good. Then it's just right.

422
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,694
Do I take it off when I have a bath?

423
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:53,986
No, you leave it on all the time.
Until you have a daughter.

424
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,277
When she turns five,
then you give it to her.

425
00:29:58,235 --> 00:29:59,319
Okay?

426
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:01,152
Okay.

427
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:04,527
Okay.

428
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:08,859
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night.

429
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:53,689
No, no. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

430
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:57,481
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

431
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,647
Listen to it, man.
"Nigger this, nigger that."

432
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:04,146
You think white people go around
calling each other honkies all day, man?

433
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,855
Hey, honky, how's business?

434
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:08,188
Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.

435
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:11,230
How about this, huh? How about that?
Listen to that. You like that?

436
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:12,771
Man's singing about lynching niggers.

437
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:14,980
And you think there's a difference,
don't you? Huh?

438
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:18,729
<i>â™ª Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger â™ª</i>

439
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:21,979
You got absolutely no idea
where hip-hop music comes from, do you?

440
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:24,229
<i>â™ª I'd shoot them dead first
but I done broke my trigger â™ª</i>

441
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:27,229
You see, back in the '60s
we had smart, articulate black men.

442
00:31:27,313 --> 00:31:29,395
<i>â™ª Gonna get out my sheet
put my hood on my head â™ª</i>

443
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:32,394
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

444
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:33,853
<i>â™ª Gonna string them up good â™ª</i>

445
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:36,353
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

446
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,561
<i>â™ª Then they'll be dead â™ª</i>

447
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,811
And then the FBI said,
"Oh, no, we can't have that."

448
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,853
<i>â™ª In the home of the brave
and the land of the free â™ª</i>

449
00:31:41,937 --> 00:31:45,435
"I know, let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

450
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,143
"and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it,"

451
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,893
"and nobody will be able to understand
a fucking word they say."

452
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,186
"End of problem."

453
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:01,101
What the fuck was that, dawg?

454
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,225
Holy shit!

455
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:19,350
-What?
-Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

456
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:21,808
You're saying there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

457
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,225
What part don't you understand?

458
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:26,433
There's a Chinaman
stuck underneath the fucking truck.

459
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:29,516
Help me.

460
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,515
Oh, God.

461
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,599
What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

462
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,806
Man, this is so completely fucked up.

463
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,181
Oh, really? No shit!

464
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:43,682
Okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

465
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:46,014
-Get back in the truck.
-What?

466
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,806
-Yes, get back in the truck.
-You think we didn't drag him far enough?

467
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,639
No, no we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

468
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:53,972
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
You know why?

469
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,097
Because he's stuck underneath
the fucking truck!

470
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,347
Now, if he could've let go,

471
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,638
he probably would've considered
that option about a half a block back.

472
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:03,347
Now, what you and I gotta do,

473
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,430
just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

474
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:07,262
You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.

475
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:10,679
Then you gonna be standing in the middle
of the street holding a Chinaman's arm.

476
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:12,471
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

477
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:16,763
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

478
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,012
Now just grab his arm.
Why not just pull him out?

479
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,595
I don't wanna
cause any problems, Lieutenant.

480
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,136
I just want a new partner.

481
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,595
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

482
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,927
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

483
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,094
Well, he's been on
the force for a long time.

484
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:39,428
-Seventeen years.
-And I do have to work here, sir.

485
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:42,635
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

486
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:45,635
You just don't want
him to ride in your car.

487
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,509
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

488
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,177
That'd be great. Write a full report.

489
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:53,634
Because I'm anxious to understand
how an obvious bigot

490
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:56,468
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years,

491
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,968
11 of which he was under
my personal supervision,

492
00:33:59,052 --> 00:34:01,717
which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

493
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:05,092
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

494
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,842
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

495
00:34:08,926 --> 00:34:10,675
So now you're saying
he's not a racist prick,

496
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,676
you just don't like him.

497
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,008
-Yes, sir.
-That's not a good enough reason.

498
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:19,091
Well, then, I guess I should think
of a better one and get back to you.

499
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:21,550
So you think
I'm asking you to make one up.

500
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:25,341
No, sir.
I just can't think of one right now.

501
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:28,340
You wanna know what I heard?

502
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,340
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

503
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:35,756
-You want me to say he has flatulence?
-Not him. You.

504
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,340
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

505
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:39,173
You're too embarrassed
to ride with anybody else,

506
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:40,840
so you're requesting a one-man car.

507
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:43,839
I'm notâ€¦
comfortable with that, Lieutenant.

508
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:45,297
I wouldn't be either.

509
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:47,297
Which is why I understand
your need for privacy.

510
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:50,797
Just like I'm sure you understand how
hard a black man has to work to get to,

511
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,505
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the LAPD

512
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,838
and how easily that can be taken away.

513
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,963
Now, that being said, it's your decision.

514
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:04,463
You can put your career and mine
on the line in pursuit of a just cause,

515
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:08,422
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

516
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:10,837
of a personal nature.

517
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:16,837
Fuck.

518
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:48,669
Excuse me.

519
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,209
Excuse me. Sir?

520
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,918
-You finished?
-I replaced the lock.

521
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:57,293
But you got a real problem with that door.

522
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:01,209
-You fix the lock?
-No, I replaced the lock.

523
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:05,416
-But you gotta fix that door.
-Just fix the lock.

524
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,583
Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

525
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,625
What you need is a new door.

526
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,125
-I need new door?
-Yeah.

527
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,125
Okay. How much?

528
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,123
I don'tâ€¦

529
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:20,832
Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody
that sells doors.

530
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,582
You try to cheat me, right, huh?
You have a friend that fix door?

531
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,582
No, I don't have a
friend that fix doors, bro.

532
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,498
Then go and fix the fucking lock,
you cheater.

533
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:31,747
Youâ€¦ You know what?

534
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,997
Why don't you just pay for the lock,
and I won't charge you for the time.

535
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,247
You don't fix the lock! I pay?
What, you think I'm stupid?

536
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:40,914
You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!

537
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,956
Hey, I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop calling me names.

538
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,621
-Then fix the fucking lock!
-I replaced the lock!

539
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:49,872
-You gotta fix the fucking door!
-You cheat! You fucking cheater!

540
00:36:50,497 --> 00:36:52,872
-Fine. Don't pay.
-What?

541
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:56,496
-Have a good night.
-What? No. Wait!

542
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,620
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

543
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:03,371
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

544
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:10,579
No, I understand.

545
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:13,453
You run over a Chinaman,
stuff him in the back,

546
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:16,453
then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

547
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,286
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

548
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,911
Georgie, burn this thing.

549
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:24,286
Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

550
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,702
You watch the Discovery Channel?

551
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,702
-Not a lot.
-They got some good shit on that channel.

552
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:33,410
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a little blue light

553
00:37:33,494 --> 00:37:35,773
and finding tiny specks
of blood splattered

554
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,868
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

555
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:42,368
bathroom fixtures and special-edition
plastic Burger King tray cups.

556
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:46,117
Then the next thing they show
is some stupid redneck in handcuffs

557
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,868
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

558
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,658
Sometimes the redneck
is actually watching the Discovery Channel

559
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:55,616
when they break in to arrest him.

560
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,784
And he still can't figure out
how on earth they could've caught him!

561
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:12,033
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

562
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,866
-No.
-Then get the fuck out of my shop.

563
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,198
Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.

564
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:25,407
Without him, things could've gone
really fucking wrong tonight.

565
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:30,490
-Fuck! This could be aâ€¦
-Graham, don't! Don't! Don't you dare.

566
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,489
Don't.

567
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:34,031
Graham Waters.

568
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:39,031
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

569
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:41,031
-It's your mother?
-Yeah.

570
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:43,656
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

571
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,737
Look, he'll be home when heâ€¦
Just leave it alone, Mom.

572
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:51,571
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

573
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,363
Okay, where were we?

574
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:58,362
I was white, and you were about
to jerk off in the shower.

575
00:38:58,446 --> 00:38:59,655
Oh, shit.

576
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:02,904
Come on.

577
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:04,611
I would've said you were Mexican,

578
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:07,295
but I don't think
it would've pissed her off as much.

579
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:11,236
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

580
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,236
What, you start to feel something
and panic?

581
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,777
Come on, Ria.

582
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,194
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

583
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:20,194
That's just where I begin to get pissed.

584
00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:24,194
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way, huh?

585
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,903
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

586
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:31,610
I know if I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

587
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:34,109
Okay. I was raised badly.

588
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:37,776
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?

589
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,109
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.

590
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:42,108
How about a geography lesson?

591
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:46,026
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

592
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:48,817
Neither one of those is Mexico.

593
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,983
Well, then I guess the big mystery is

594
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:55,108
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

595
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,191
and taught them all
how to park their cars on their lawns?

596
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:27,981
Pop, you okay?

597
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:31,148
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

598
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,481
I'mâ€¦ Jesus.

599
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:37,563
I'm done now.

600
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:40,397
Give me a hand.

601
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,147
Wait a goddamn minute.

602
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:47,980
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

603
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:53,229
-All right. Okay. Okay.
-Okay. There you go.

604
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:02,812
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

605
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:05,311
-I gotta go back.
-Okay.

606
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,227
What, are you gonna stand there
and stare at me?

607
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:33,096
So Conklin just shot him?

608
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,930
-They know each other?
-Sir.

609
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:37,930
-This a grudge thing?
-Not as far as we can tell.

610
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,554
You think this is racially motivated?

611
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:44,929
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

612
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,595
-Who do we have on it?
-Graham Waters.

613
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,887
Waters. All right, well, tell him
that he speaks to no one but me.

614
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:54,261
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

615
00:42:54,345 --> 00:42:56,295
And would someone please find Flanagan?

616
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,137
-Oh, what up, Mo Phat?
-What's up?

617
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,678
Man robs purses from old ladies
and you all,

618
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:05,803
"Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?"

619
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,677
That nigga will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

620
00:43:09,094 --> 00:43:11,760
You calling him a thief? And we do what?

621
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:13,718
The man steals from black people.

622
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,010
Only reason black people
steal from their own

623
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,885
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

624
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:19,343
Oh, man, please.

625
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:22,926
Think about it.
Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.

626
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,467
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

627
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:28,009
Now, drop Mo Phat off
at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,

628
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:32,093
that nigga will run like a rabbit
soon as somebody say "decaf latte."

629
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,300
What the fuck did you do to my car?

630
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:45,925
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

631
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:49,008
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

632
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:54,340
James wanted to take this to school, but
I don't want the kids to fight over it.

633
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,841
-Are these clean or dirty?
-All clean, seÃ±ora.

634
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:00,674
You know, Maria,
just once I would like to wake up

635
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:03,048
and find these dishes in the cabinet.

636
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:06,923
-Okay?
<i>-SÃ­,</i> seÃ±ora. No problem.

637
00:44:08,673 --> 00:44:10,214
I'm starting to understand now.

638
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:13,548
By your work, you're setting an example
for our neighborhood.

639
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:16,131
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

640
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,630
Well, yeah, you laugh, man.

641
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:22,797
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

642
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:26,963
What the hell do you think
you doing right now, man?

643
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,671
Waving down the bus.

644
00:44:28,755 --> 00:44:31,296
Man, put your hand down, dawg!
Are you out of your mind?

645
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,421
You actually expect me to get on a bus?

646
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,754
No. I was hoping we could push your car
across town.

647
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,504
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

648
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,587
You have no idea, do you?

649
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:42,795
You have no idea
why they put them great big windows

650
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,378
on the sides of buses, do you?

651
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,961
-Why?
-One reason only.

652
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:50,754
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to riding on them.

653
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:52,628
How do you know that?

654
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:56,044
You know, you could fill the Staples
Center with what you don't know.

655
00:44:56,128 --> 00:44:58,044
Oh, you know,
the Kings are playing tonight.

656
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:01,678
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

657
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:03,502
I love hockey.

658
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,627
Cut! Print. Moving on.

659
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:09,751
Okay, that takes us into scene 12,
and we are in the bathroom.

660
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:13,043
Jamal, that's what I'm talking about.

661
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,335
Right on.

662
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,641
Cam, Cam, you got a second?

663
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:19,876
Yeah, Fred. I just wanna grab some coffee.

664
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,627
Yeah, listen,
I think we needed another take, buddy.

665
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,126
That looked pretty terrific, man.

666
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:29,501
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

667
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,292
What do you mean?

668
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,334
Have you noticedâ€¦

669
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,667
I mean, this is weird
for a white guy to say,

670
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:39,333
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

671
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,582
-No, I haven't noticed that.
-Really?

672
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:47,082
Like in this scene, he was supposed
to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

673
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,416
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

674
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,081
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You think because of that,

675
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:55,498
the audience won't recognize him
as being a black man?

676
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:58,124
-Come on.
-Is there a problem, Cam?

677
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:02,040
-Excuse me?
-Is there a problem, Cam?

678
00:46:07,623 --> 00:46:09,789
No, we don't have a problem.

679
00:46:10,164 --> 00:46:13,664
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

680
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:16,289
Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,
not Jamal, right?

681
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,622
I mean, you're the expert here,
but to me, it rings false.

682
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:27,413
-We're gonna do it one more time.
-Thanks, buddy.

683
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:30,747
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

684
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,454
Jamalâ€¦

685
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:42,953
-Morning, Carol. Who do I have?
-Hold for a minute, please.

686
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,786
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

687
00:46:51,161 --> 00:46:52,536
Send him in.

688
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,036
-Mr. Ryan.
-Yeah.

689
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,244
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

690
00:46:58,328 --> 00:47:00,119
I believe we spoke last night.

691
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:03,660
Oh, yeah.
I wanted to apologize about that.

692
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,660
I haven't been getting too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

693
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,827
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

694
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:14,159
This doctor he's been seeing
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

695
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:16,284
But he's been taking this medicine
for a month now,

696
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:17,659
and he just keeps getting worse.

697
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:20,576
-And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?
-Yeah.

698
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:24,034
-Between you and me, the man's an idiot.
-Really?

699
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:26,658
Well, no offense,
but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.

700
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,992
I think his nurses
are doing most of the work.

701
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:33,950
If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

702
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:38,074
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

703
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:41,323
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

704
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:45,032
-Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizesâ€¦
-Then what good is that gonna do?

705
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,491
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

706
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,032
All right. Well, you know what I can't do?

707
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:54,531
I can't look at you
without thinking about the five or six

708
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:57,156
more-qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

709
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,572
It's time for you to go.

710
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:01,864
Now, I'm saying this 'cause I'm
really hoping that I'm wrong about you.

711
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:03,822
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

712
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,947
someone who may have been given
a helping hand,

713
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:08,738
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

714
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:10,863
Carol, I need security in my office.

715
00:48:10,947 --> 00:48:13,780
You know, you don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

716
00:48:14,197 --> 00:48:17,071
But my father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

717
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:19,238
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

718
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:21,195
Saved enough to start his own company.

719
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,945
Twenty-three employees, all of them black.

720
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:25,945
Paid them equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

721
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:28,320
For 30 years
he worked side by side with those men,

722
00:48:28,404 --> 00:48:30,779
sweeping and carrying garbage.

723
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:32,445
And then the city council decides

724
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:36,194
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

725
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:38,737
And overnight, my father loses everything.

726
00:48:39,195 --> 00:48:41,778
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything.

727
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,445
Not once does he blame your people.

728
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,402
I'm not asking you to help me.

729
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:54,027
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

730
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,818
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

731
00:48:56,902 --> 00:48:59,986
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you? Nothing.

732
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:03,026
Just a flick of your pen.

733
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,401
Your father sounds like a good man.

734
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:11,776
And if he'd come in here today,
I probably would've approved this request.

735
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,566
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

736
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,150
-Get him the hell out of my office.
-Prick.

737
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,566
Yeah, sir, I spoke to our employee,

738
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,024
and he told you you needed to replace
or repair the door.

739
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,024
He say he fix the lock.

740
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:36,065
-You come here, see how fixed it is!
<i>-You're yelling again.</i>

741
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:37,858
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

742
00:49:39,483 --> 00:49:41,774
-Yes, I am.
-Mom, are you all right?

743
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,148
Stop washing. Insurance must take picture.
Okay?

744
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:50,523
-Yes.
-Look what they wrote.

745
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:54,231
-They think we're Arab.
-Please, you come see my store.

746
00:49:54,315 --> 00:49:55,856
When did Persian become Arab?

747
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,938
I wantâ€¦ I want his name. Yes.

748
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:00,356
Oh, my God.

749
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,355
-I want his name!
-Dad.

750
00:50:02,439 --> 00:50:03,730
-Give me his name!
-Dad.

751
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,188
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

752
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:06,563
Dad, did they take the gun?

753
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:09,063
-Not fix my lock! I want his name!
-Baba.

754
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:11,354
-I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
<i>-Don't hang up!</i>

755
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,563
Don't hang up! Shit!

756
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,688
Oh, thank God.

757
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,727
Mom?

758
00:51:05,517 --> 00:51:07,767
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

759
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:32,765
Did you find your brother?

760
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,932
No, Mom.

761
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,181
I was doing good.

762
00:51:49,848 --> 00:51:53,223
I wasâ€¦ I was doing real good.

763
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:57,931
-I know, Mom.
-I was doing good.

764
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,097
It's okay.

765
00:52:16,137 --> 00:52:18,137
Did you find your brother?

766
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,971
No, Mom.

767
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:26,511
Tell him to come home.

768
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,511
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?

769
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,053
Okay, baby?

770
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,761
-Okay, Mom.
-Okay, baby.

771
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:40,469
Okay.

772
00:52:41,594 --> 00:52:42,760
Okay.

773
00:53:19,258 --> 00:53:22,007
-Did you apologize to your mother?
-She wasn't there.

774
00:53:24,382 --> 00:53:28,007
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

775
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:32,091
That's lunch. One hour.

776
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,171
I tried to call.

777
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:05,879
Sounded like you were having
a bad day, huh?

778
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:07,004
Yeah.

779
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:12,754
What?

780
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:16,337
I got scared, Cam.

781
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:21,420
You know, it's not like I haven't been
pulled over before, you know?

782
00:54:22,295 --> 00:54:23,878
But nothing like that.

783
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:28,003
And, yes, I was a little drunk

784
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:30,836
and I was mouthing off.

785
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:32,877
I'm sorry.

786
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:38,252
But when that man
was putting his hands on meâ€¦

787
00:54:38,336 --> 00:54:39,543
I don't wanna talk about it.

788
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:42,461
I couldn't believe
you'd let him do that, baby.

789
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,876
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

790
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:51,335
But I was humiliated.

791
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,626
For you.

792
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:58,584
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

793
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:02,167
Yeah. That's what happened.

794
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, baby, don't do this.

795
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,833
-No. No, you're right.
-Come on.

796
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:07,250
I ain't doing it.

797
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:09,375
You gonna walk away from me?

798
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,583
-Cameron!
-Just go home.

799
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,666
I understand.

800
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,707
Thanks.

801
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,582
-Has your father read his policy?
-He doesn't read English.

802
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:39,747
Mr. Golzari,
you said that you called the locksmith?

803
00:55:40,872 --> 00:55:42,789
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

804
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:45,414
They said that their man told you

805
00:55:46,956 --> 00:55:49,206
to fix the door, and you didn't do so.

806
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:53,038
Are you saying it's his fault?

807
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:57,063
Insurance company
is calling it negligence.

808
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:59,163
They're not covering any of this.

809
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,579
No.

810
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,495
This store is all we have.

811
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,578
I really am sorry.

812
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,700
What time you must go to work?

813
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,409
Not until tonight.

814
00:56:58,784 --> 00:57:00,408
Go home and sleep.

815
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,408
It's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.

816
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:30,614
Hey.

817
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,697
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

818
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:37,239
Yeah, they told me.

819
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,363
I just wanted to say good luck
and it was good riding with you.

820
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,072
You, too.

821
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,113
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

822
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:53,155
-Yeah.
-Look at me, look at me.

823
00:57:55,279 --> 00:57:58,071
Wait till you've been
doing it a little longer.

824
00:57:59,237 --> 00:58:01,487
You think you know who you are?

825
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:05,154
You have no idea.

826
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,736
Yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?

827
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,236
Ready, amigo.

828
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:26,194
Radio check, 2-1 -L-2-3.

829
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:31,110
<i>21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.</i>

830
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:35,693
<i>Likewise, 21-L.
Is your mic open by any chance?</i>

831
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:49,267
Call it in.

832
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:29,931
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

833
01:01:30,264 --> 01:01:32,846
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

834
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,221
All right. Get an extinguisher,
and get that fire out.

835
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:36,388
Jesus.

836
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:42,305
Ma'am, are you hurt?

837
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:46,970
-Can you move?
-I can't breathe.

838
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:51,845
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

839
01:01:59,179 --> 01:02:00,636
It's okay.

840
01:02:04,803 --> 01:02:06,928
Okay. Okay.

841
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:09,553
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

842
01:02:14,843 --> 01:02:16,634
-No.
-It's okay.

843
01:02:16,718 --> 01:02:18,759
-Get away from me.
-It's okay.

844
01:02:18,843 --> 01:02:21,427
Get away from me. Stay away from me.

845
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:24,051
-Not you!
-Fuck it.

846
01:02:24,135 --> 01:02:26,218
-Not you!
-It's okay.

847
01:02:26,302 --> 01:02:29,925
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Keep away from me!

848
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:32,175
Lady, I'm tryingâ€¦ I'm trying to help you.

849
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:35,342
Fuck you! Not you!

850
01:02:35,426 --> 01:02:37,592
Somebody! Anybody else!

851
01:02:37,676 --> 01:02:39,508
-Please, somebody!
-Stop moving!

852
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:40,800
Not you!

853
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:44,757
No! Get your filthy fucking hands off me!

854
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:46,174
-Stop moving.
-No!

855
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:48,425
Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!

856
01:02:54,424 --> 01:02:56,965
Okay. Okay.

857
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:59,506
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

858
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,798
I'm not gonna touch you.

859
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:05,215
But there's nobody else here yet,
and that's gasoline there.

860
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:10,089
We need to get you out of here
right away. Okay?

861
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,881
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Okay.

862
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:18,798
I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

863
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,213
Yeah. Yeah.

864
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:26,005
Thanks.

865
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:33,213
Is anything broken?

866
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:36,129
I don't think so.

867
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:39,212
Okay. I think that's good.

868
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:43,212
-Are you gonna get me out?
-Yeah.

869
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,753
I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

870
01:03:45,837 --> 01:03:48,546
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

871
01:03:55,378 --> 01:03:56,628
Oh, fuck!

872
01:03:57,128 --> 01:04:00,128
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

873
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:04,252
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

874
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,044
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

875
01:04:08,294 --> 01:04:09,835
It's okay, it's okay.

876
01:04:09,919 --> 01:04:12,376
It's okay. It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

877
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,710
Everything's gonna be fine. Look at me.

878
01:04:14,794 --> 01:04:17,292
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

879
01:04:17,376 --> 01:04:19,209
Everything's gonna be fine.

880
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,375
Ryan!

881
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,664
Pull!

882
01:05:30,246 --> 01:05:31,538
It's okay.

883
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,244
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

884
01:05:43,328 --> 01:05:46,911
All right. Here we go.
It's okay, it's okay.

885
01:05:46,995 --> 01:05:49,620
It's all right. I got it now. I got it.

886
01:05:50,245 --> 01:05:52,243
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?

887
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,619
It's cool, it's cool. It's okay.

888
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,286
Here we go. All right, you're doing great.
You're doing great.

889
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:33,199
The DA wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

890
01:06:33,283 --> 01:06:34,490
No, he didn't.

891
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,324
If he did his own dirty work,
none of us would have jobs.

892
01:06:36,408 --> 01:06:38,740
-Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
-Graham Waters.

893
01:06:38,824 --> 01:06:41,324
-Thanks for coming in, Detective.
-He just pulled into the garage.

894
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:44,615
Great, great. Press conference is in
10 minutes, so we'll make this short.

895
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:48,323
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has
two suspicious shootings on his record.

896
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:51,573
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

897
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:54,323
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

898
01:06:54,407 --> 01:06:57,307
You know any reason
why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

899
01:06:57,865 --> 01:07:01,656
Well, it'sâ€¦ It's more complicated
than we originally thought.

900
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:07,739
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

901
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:10,364
Shit!

902
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:13,280
Go down to the garage.

903
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:15,864
Tell him to stay in the car
until he hears from me.

904
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:19,654
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

905
01:07:19,738 --> 01:07:22,279
Well, the car's actually registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

906
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:24,237
We haven't been able
to get in touch with her, yet.

907
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:27,155
Apparently, she left town this morning.

908
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:29,320
So it wasn't Lewis' car.

909
01:07:29,404 --> 01:07:31,704
He may not have even known
the money was in it.

910
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:40,820
Do you really think you're gonna be able
to make that fly?

911
01:07:43,403 --> 01:07:46,319
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

912
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:49,069
-These names ring a bell, Detective?
-Yeah, vaguely.

913
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:52,694
We have attorneys
for this slain police officer

914
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:54,277
camping in our offices.

915
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,776
We have his mother
and a half a dozen men of the cloth

916
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,318
who swear that Lewis
was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.

917
01:08:00,402 --> 01:08:03,193
We have two black city councilmen
and a congresswoman

918
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:05,901
who call on the hour, every hour,
demanding to know

919
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:08,150
what the District Attorney
intends to do about this.

920
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:09,983
And you want him
to walk into that press room

921
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:13,359
and tell them all
that the situation is complicated?

922
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:22,066
Give us a minute.

923
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:24,691
No problem.

924
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,733
Who knows about the money?

925
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:36,940
You gotta be kidding me.

926
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:39,190
There are only two people in this room.

927
01:08:41,232 --> 01:08:44,565
Myself, my partner, Ferguson
and Internal Affairs.

928
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:46,357
-Jim Ferguson?
-Yeah.

929
01:08:51,564 --> 01:08:53,730
Okay. Okay, I guess I don't see a problem.

930
01:08:53,814 --> 01:08:56,980
As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money
isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

931
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:59,814
And even if it was,
we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.

932
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:01,814
Which means
the money Internal Affairs is holding

933
01:09:01,898 --> 01:09:04,021
can't even be considered evidence.

934
01:09:04,105 --> 01:09:06,688
What? You know, you can
do this whole dance if you want to,

935
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:08,396
but I'm willing to bet

936
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,438
when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

937
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:13,855
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

938
01:09:14,772 --> 01:09:16,479
Fucking black people, huh?

939
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:19,437
-What did you just say?
-I meanâ€¦

940
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,603
You know, I know
all the sociological reasons

941
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:26,103
why per capita eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

942
01:09:26,187 --> 01:09:27,812
Schools are a disgrace.

943
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:30,186
Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

944
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,144
All that stuff. All that stuff!

945
01:09:32,228 --> 01:09:36,561
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

946
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:39,645
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

947
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:46,851
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth,

948
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:48,976
but that's the way it always plays,
doesn't it?

949
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,810
And assholes like Lewis just keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

950
01:09:54,019 --> 01:09:56,351
What did you say you did for the DA again?

951
01:09:56,435 --> 01:09:58,392
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

952
01:09:58,476 --> 01:10:00,518
Oh, please, don't do that.

953
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:03,225
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

954
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:07,392
What do you think those kids need?
To make them believe, to give them hope?

955
01:10:07,476 --> 01:10:09,975
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

956
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:12,683
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

957
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:14,891
Why don't you cut through
the bullshit, Flanagan,

958
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:17,183
and just tell me what it is you want?

959
01:10:19,517 --> 01:10:22,850
The DA's squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

960
01:10:23,058 --> 01:10:26,307
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

961
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,338
It's a high-profile position, and he wants

962
01:10:28,422 --> 01:10:30,515
to send the right
message to the community.

963
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:34,432
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

964
01:10:34,516 --> 01:10:38,016
Well, fuck you very much,
but thanks for thinking of me.

965
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:41,431
Actually, we were thinking of you.

966
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:44,431
Until we saw that.

967
01:10:46,223 --> 01:10:48,139
It's your brother's file.

968
01:10:48,223 --> 01:10:50,722
Twenty something years old
and already three felonies.

969
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:53,638
Three-strikes law. Kid's going
away for life for stealing a car.

970
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:55,264
Christ, that's a shitty law.

971
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:58,180
There's a warrant in there.

972
01:10:58,264 --> 01:11:01,930
But still, hey,
he had every opportunity you had.

973
01:11:05,389 --> 01:11:07,388
Fucking black people, huh?

974
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,679
So allâ€¦

975
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:18,970
All I need to do to make this disappear
is to frame a potentially innocent man?

976
01:11:19,054 --> 01:11:21,969
What are you?
The fucking defender of all things white?

977
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:25,719
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

978
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:29,178
And you're arguing with me
that maybe we're not being fair to him?

979
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:32,303
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're right.

980
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:33,510
Maybe Lewis did provoke this

981
01:11:33,594 --> 01:11:35,944
and maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

982
01:11:36,302 --> 01:11:39,177
Or maybe, stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

983
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,261
was enough to get him killed.

984
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:45,343
There was no one there to see who
shot first, so there is no way to know.

985
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:48,426
Which means we could get this wrong.

986
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,384
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

987
01:11:54,468 --> 01:11:57,885
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

988
01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:02,925
You're the one closest to all this.
You need to tell us.

989
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,134
What does your gut tell you?

990
01:12:22,716 --> 01:12:25,216
So, Graham.

991
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,341
What do I tell them?

992
01:12:27,632 --> 01:12:30,340
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

993
01:12:38,382 --> 01:12:41,589
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

994
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:44,881
it's pretty clear what
happened last night.

995
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:47,464
Okay.

996
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:07,254
<i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>

997
01:13:07,338 --> 01:13:11,004
<i>I know that many of you have heard
that we had our car stolen last night.</i>

998
01:13:11,379 --> 01:13:15,795
<i>And as you could imagine,
my wife and I are both pretty shaken up.</i>

999
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:17,670
<i>But we're okay.</i>

1000
01:13:17,754 --> 01:13:21,336
<i>And Jean and I truly appreciate
all your calls and your concern.</i>

1001
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,627
<i>Thank you.</i>

1002
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:26,669
<i>Now, just after 9 p.m. last night,</i>

1003
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,377
<i>Detective William Lewis,
an eight-year veteran of the force</i>

1004
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,252
<i>and an active member
of the black community,</i>

1005
01:13:31,336 --> 01:13:33,211
<i>was gunned down by a fellow officer.</i>

1006
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:50,542
Hi, sweetie.

1007
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:54,834
Bye, Lara.

1008
01:14:34,164 --> 01:14:35,330
Get out of the car!

1009
01:14:35,414 --> 01:14:37,873
Give me the keys! Get out theâ€¦
What the fuck?

1010
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:41,414
Whoa! What the fuck are you doing, man?

1011
01:14:41,498 --> 01:14:42,497
Shit!

1012
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,163
-You wanna get killed, nigga?
-Say that again!

1013
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:45,497
What the fuck?

1014
01:14:46,705 --> 01:14:48,788
-Say that again, bitch!
-You stupid motherfucker!

1015
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:51,382
Say it again, huh! Call me a nigga again!

1016
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:52,246
Christ!

1017
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,996
-Yo, man, what the fuck? Get off of him.
-Fuck you!

1018
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,288
-Shoot him!
-Fucking blow your head off!

1019
01:14:57,372 --> 01:14:58,662
Shoot this motherfucker, man!

1020
01:14:58,746 --> 01:15:00,703
Look, man, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1021
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:02,328
Stop talking and shoot!

1022
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:04,037
Come on, stop! Let's go!

1023
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:05,953
-Shit, here comes the po-po.
-Shit.

1024
01:15:06,037 --> 01:15:07,412
-Get off of me.
-Fuck off.

1025
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:10,120
-Jesus.
-Hey, hey. Where you going, man?

1026
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:11,286
Hell, no!

1027
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,328
-Oh, shit.
-Anthony! Anthony!

1028
01:15:16,036 --> 01:15:17,786
Get the fuck out of my car!

1029
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,202
Shit! Damn!

1030
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:21,119
What are you doing, man?
Get out of the car!

1031
01:15:21,203 --> 01:15:22,202
Fuck you!

1032
01:15:22,286 --> 01:15:24,910
-Get the fuck out of my car!
-You get the fuck out of the car!

1033
01:15:24,994 --> 01:15:28,660
Unit 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
Westbound onâ€¦

1034
01:15:29,452 --> 01:15:31,827
I will blow you away. Get the fuck out!

1035
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:39,868
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3â€¦ Oh, Christ!

1036
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:47,492
-Get the fuck out of the car!
-You get the fuck out of the car!

1037
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,992
-Get out of the fucking car!
-It's my fucking car!

1038
01:15:50,076 --> 01:15:52,075
-It's my fucking gun!
-Fuck, it's my gun now!

1039
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,759
You just give me my fucking gun!

1040
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:03,158
Fuck!

1041
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:09,199
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1042
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:15,824
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

1043
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:22,114
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

1044
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:23,822
Get out of my car.

1045
01:16:23,906 --> 01:16:26,323
Oh, you so brave, you
get out the car, man.

1046
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,240
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

1047
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:48,279
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

1048
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:50,445
Lie face down on the ground.
Spread your arms and legs.

1049
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:52,945
No, you lie face down on the ground
and spread your arms and legs.

1050
01:16:53,029 --> 01:16:54,737
Don't come any closer! Down on your knees!

1051
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:56,279
Fuck you, man! What are you gonna do?

1052
01:16:56,363 --> 01:16:58,529
-Pull the fucking trigger, then!
-On your knees now!

1053
01:16:58,613 --> 01:16:59,654
You get on your knees

1054
01:16:59,738 --> 01:17:01,819
and suck my motherfucking dick
while you down there.

1055
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:03,778
Do I look like I'm
fucking joking with you?

1056
01:17:03,862 --> 01:17:05,944
Yeah, that's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

1057
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:08,361
-This man is making threatening gestures.
-Threatening gestures?

1058
01:17:08,445 --> 01:17:11,403
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture for you.

1059
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:14,318
-I know this man! I know this man!
-Get back.

1060
01:17:14,402 --> 01:17:16,068
Fuck off. Give me some space.
I know this guy.

1061
01:17:16,152 --> 01:17:17,693
-Get out of the way.
-You don't fucking know me.

1062
01:17:17,777 --> 01:17:18,902
Step away.

1063
01:17:18,986 --> 01:17:21,152
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

1064
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:24,985
-Man, don't walk up on me!
-See what's happening here?

1065
01:17:25,069 --> 01:17:27,443
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

1066
01:17:27,527 --> 01:17:29,442
'Cause these guys really wanna shoot you.

1067
01:17:29,526 --> 01:17:32,317
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

1068
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:34,151
-Fuck you!
-Fuck me? Fuck me?

1069
01:17:34,235 --> 01:17:36,526
I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one who's fucked here.

1070
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,276
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

1071
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,651
and onto that man's patio.

1072
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:42,150
-Officer Hanson, step away.
-He's a friend of mine, okay?

1073
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:44,816
He's a fucking friend of mine!
This man is not armed!

1074
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,566
He's not gonna shoot you, or me,
or anybody else, all right?

1075
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,108
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

1076
01:17:50,192 --> 01:17:52,817
Lower your firearm! Lower your firearm!

1077
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:00,524
Are you starting
to understand the situation?

1078
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:03,274
What do you want from me?

1079
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:06,107
Unless you think your wife

1080
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:09,106
is gonna be better off with a husband
who has a bloody stump for a head,

1081
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:11,356
I want you to sit down on that curb,
put your hands on your head,

1082
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,356
and do nothing
until I speak with these officers.

1083
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,856
I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not
putting my hands on my head for nobody.

1084
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,314
Then stand right where you are

1085
01:18:18,398 --> 01:18:21,315
and keep your hands in plain sight.
Can you do that, huh?

1086
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:25,814
Yeah, I can do that.

1087
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:27,189
Good.

1088
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:31,889
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

1089
01:18:32,231 --> 01:18:36,646
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1090
01:18:37,021 --> 01:18:38,646
I need this favor.

1091
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:42,730
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1092
01:18:43,063 --> 01:18:45,021
I need to let him go with a warning.

1093
01:18:46,146 --> 01:18:50,062
-What kind of fucking warning?
-A harsh warning.

1094
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,979
Thank you.

1095
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,320
You've been warned. Do you understand me?

1096
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,561
Do you understand me?

1097
01:19:02,645 --> 01:19:05,519
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1098
01:19:06,228 --> 01:19:10,019
-Look, I'm trying to help you.
-I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1099
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:13,228
Go home.

1100
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,518
Yeah, that I can do.

1101
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:40,304
Look at me.

1102
01:20:42,012 --> 01:20:43,596
You embarrass me.

1103
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:46,804
You embarrass yourself.

1104
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,259
Daddy's home!

1105
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:53,048
-What's up?
-Give me my money!

1106
01:21:53,132 --> 01:21:55,298
-What? What money?
-Daddy!

1107
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:58,965
-To pay for my store. Give me my money!
-Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1108
01:21:59,049 --> 01:22:00,549
-You give me my money.
-Daddy.

1109
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:03,797
I want my fucking money!
Give me that truck.

1110
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:05,297
That's not my truck, bro.

1111
01:22:05,381 --> 01:22:07,089
-Daddy?
-Elizabeth!

1112
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:08,422
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

1113
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:11,589
You know what? Hey, I got $50. Here, here.

1114
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:13,839
$50? You took everything!

1115
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:15,047
Mommy?

1116
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,546
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1117
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:22,422
-He doesn't have it.
-Hasn't got what?

1118
01:22:22,839 --> 01:22:26,005
I have it. He doesn't have
the impenetrable cloak.

1119
01:22:28,089 --> 01:22:29,754
Lara, stay out of the street!

1120
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:58,586
It's okay, Daddy.

1121
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:02,586
-What? What?
-I'll protect you.

1122
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,125
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1123
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:35,959
-It's a really good cloak.
-Good.

1124
01:24:56,369 --> 01:24:57,869
How's it going?

1125
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:27,616
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1126
01:25:29,033 --> 01:25:31,199
Well, you know what? You are one to talk.

1127
01:25:31,283 --> 01:25:33,950
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year.

1128
01:25:35,241 --> 01:25:38,241
I'm not snapping at you. I am angry.

1129
01:25:39,657 --> 01:25:41,781
Yes. At them! Yes!

1130
01:25:41,865 --> 01:25:46,240
At them, the police, at Rick, at Maria,

1131
01:25:46,324 --> 01:25:50,073
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1132
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:53,947
at the gardener
who keeps over-watering the lawn.

1133
01:25:54,031 --> 01:25:55,073
Iâ€¦

1134
01:25:56,489 --> 01:25:58,114
I just thought thatâ€¦

1135
01:25:59,156 --> 01:26:02,198
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1136
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:05,281
and I would feel better, you know?

1137
01:26:05,864 --> 01:26:08,863
But I was still mad. And I realizedâ€¦

1138
01:26:09,947 --> 01:26:13,738
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1139
01:26:15,905 --> 01:26:18,280
I wake up like this every morning.

1140
01:26:19,822 --> 01:26:23,570
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1141
01:26:23,654 --> 01:26:26,029
Carol, I don't know why. And Iâ€¦

1142
01:26:28,737 --> 01:26:30,737
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1143
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:33,071
Bye.

1144
01:28:24,687 --> 01:28:26,437
I really appreciate this.

1145
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:28,603
No problem.

1146
01:28:34,728 --> 01:28:37,435
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1147
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:38,894
Hour, maybe.

1148
01:28:39,686 --> 01:28:41,310
Big surprise, huh?

1149
01:28:41,394 --> 01:28:44,311
Yeah, this ain't exactly
pick-up-a-brother territory.

1150
01:28:44,894 --> 01:28:45,936
True.

1151
01:28:47,436 --> 01:28:50,976
-So where you headed?
-Anywhere the other side of the hill.

1152
01:28:51,685 --> 01:28:53,309
I'm going to El Segundo.

1153
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:54,810
El Segundo's cool.

1154
01:28:55,643 --> 01:28:58,268
-You've been there?
-Fuck, no.

1155
01:29:05,225 --> 01:29:06,767
That's some good music.

1156
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:12,392
No, really. I'm starting to understand it.

1157
01:29:13,642 --> 01:29:16,600
Wrote me a country song myself
just yesterday.

1158
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,641
I'll bet you did.

1159
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:21,141
Whatever.

1160
01:29:36,057 --> 01:29:38,556
So what was going on
in the Valley tonight?

1161
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,057
Ice-skating.

1162
01:29:41,307 --> 01:29:42,806
Ice-skating.

1163
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,640
Love the ice-skating, man.

1164
01:29:45,097 --> 01:29:48,431
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1165
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:50,681
Come on.

1166
01:29:51,472 --> 01:29:54,222
What, you think that's funny or something?

1167
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:56,388
I think you're having fun.

1168
01:29:56,472 --> 01:29:57,972
Yeah. Whatever.

1169
01:30:08,138 --> 01:30:10,930
-Something else funny?
-Oh, yeah.

1170
01:30:13,262 --> 01:30:14,929
Yeah? What's that?

1171
01:30:15,637 --> 01:30:17,429
People, man. People.

1172
01:30:18,845 --> 01:30:20,512
People like me.

1173
01:30:21,804 --> 01:30:24,095
No, no, no. I'm not laughing at you, man.

1174
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,385
Yeah, I can see that.
Why don't you laugh outside?

1175
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:30,594
Dawg, why are you getting
all bent out of shape?

1176
01:30:30,678 --> 01:30:33,344
I'm not getting bent, man.
I'm just pulling over.

1177
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:39,593
Come on, man, keep driving.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1178
01:30:39,677 --> 01:30:42,384
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1179
01:30:42,468 --> 01:30:44,718
Why you being a fucking jerk, man?
Just drive the car.

1180
01:30:44,802 --> 01:30:46,676
I've got a better idea. Get out now.

1181
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,551
Fine. You want me to show you?
I'll show you.

1182
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:51,009
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see them.

1183
01:30:51,093 --> 01:30:52,259
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

1184
01:30:52,343 --> 01:30:53,467
Put your hands where I can see them.

1185
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:57,251
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.

1186
01:31:21,632 --> 01:31:22,924
Oh, God.

1187
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:33,590
Oh, God.

1188
01:32:09,337 --> 01:32:11,087
<i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>

1189
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:15,711
<i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,
the scene of country music here in LA.</i>

1190
01:32:16,003 --> 01:32:18,461
<i>It's a cold night, and
it's getting colder.</i>

1191
01:32:18,545 --> 01:32:21,711
<i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo
coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>

1192
01:32:21,795 --> 01:32:22,920
<i>so give us a callâ€¦</i>

1193
01:32:26,295 --> 01:32:29,919
-Hey, you okay?
-I'm freezing.

1194
01:32:30,335 --> 01:32:33,126
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1195
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,710
-Get out of here.
-That's what I heard.

1196
01:32:35,794 --> 01:32:38,252
-You got a smoke?
-No. I quit.

1197
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,460
Yeah, me, too.

1198
01:32:41,752 --> 01:32:43,876
-What do you got?
-Dead kid.

1199
01:32:46,793 --> 01:32:48,251
Hey, Bob.

1200
01:34:16,745 --> 01:34:19,868
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1201
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:22,702
-Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
-Do you speak English?

1202
01:34:22,786 --> 01:34:26,911
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1203
01:34:28,744 --> 01:34:30,327
-Jin Gui!
-Ma'am!

1204
01:34:31,618 --> 01:34:32,785
Kim Lee.

1205
01:34:39,535 --> 01:34:43,285
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1206
01:34:43,785 --> 01:34:45,742
It's okay. I'm okay.

1207
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,700
I went crazy speeding. I drove into a car.

1208
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,075
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1209
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,617
Got into big fight with poor woman.
I called her names.

1210
01:34:57,575 --> 01:35:00,741
Oh, fine. I die from worry and you laugh.

1211
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:06,574
Thank you for finding me.

1212
01:35:09,658 --> 01:35:13,239
-Will you do something for me?
-Anything.

1213
01:35:13,323 --> 01:35:14,907
Go to the locker.

1214
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,740
No, next one.

1215
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:26,406
In my wallet there's a check.

1216
01:35:26,947 --> 01:35:28,156
Bring it here.

1217
01:35:37,572 --> 01:35:40,696
Oh, I get it. When I said
get me a black Lincoln Navigator,

1218
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:43,904
you thought I said
get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.

1219
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,321
Fine, it's fine.
Just give me whatever for it, man.

1220
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:49,571
You should see this.

1221
01:36:05,737 --> 01:36:07,361
I'll take the van.

1222
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:09,777
They're chained to the van.

1223
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:11,403
So I'll take them, too.

1224
01:36:12,861 --> 01:36:14,444
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1225
01:36:14,528 --> 01:36:16,860
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1226
01:36:16,944 --> 01:36:19,027
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1227
01:36:19,111 --> 01:36:22,484
-What the hell are you gonna do with them?
-Sell them. What the hell do you think?

1228
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:26,110
I'll give you $500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1229
01:36:45,317 --> 01:36:47,276
Oh, no!

1230
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:53,400
No! No!

1231
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:11,690
This is Dorri.

1232
01:37:24,606 --> 01:37:27,523
My baby. My poor baby.

1233
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:31,730
Mom.

1234
01:37:33,313 --> 01:37:37,980
I promise you. I promise
I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.

1235
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:42,188
Oh, I already know.

1236
01:37:45,312 --> 01:37:46,521
You did.

1237
01:37:48,604 --> 01:37:52,021
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1238
01:37:53,437 --> 01:37:56,353
We weren't much good to you anymore,
were we?

1239
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:04,977
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1240
01:38:05,061 --> 01:38:09,520
Mom, I wanna stay withâ€¦
I just wanna wait with my baby.

1241
01:38:21,185 --> 01:38:23,768
He came home. Did you know that?

1242
01:38:25,476 --> 01:38:27,226
My little boy.

1243
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:31,559
When I was sleeping,
he brought me groceries.

1244
01:38:32,768 --> 01:38:34,726
It's the last thing he did.

1245
01:39:00,349 --> 01:39:01,432
Baba.

1246
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,848
What happened?

1247
01:39:22,889 --> 01:39:24,430
What did you do?

1248
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:27,555
Baba, what did you do?

1249
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,013
I shoot a little girl.

1250
01:39:33,513 --> 01:39:34,554
What?

1251
01:39:34,888 --> 01:39:37,429
No, she's okay. She'sâ€¦

1252
01:39:39,513 --> 01:39:41,554
She'sâ€¦ Here.

1253
01:39:42,013 --> 01:39:43,804
The gun shoot her,

1254
01:39:45,553 --> 01:39:48,053
but she's okay, Dorri. Nothing happened.

1255
01:39:51,762 --> 01:39:53,053
She's my <i>farishte.</i>

1256
01:39:54,928 --> 01:39:57,845
-What are you talking about, Daddy?
-My <i>farishte,</i> Dorri.

1257
01:40:00,177 --> 01:40:01,386
My angel.

1258
01:40:04,261 --> 01:40:05,511
My angel.

1259
01:40:07,886 --> 01:40:09,719
She came to protect me.

1260
01:40:11,844 --> 01:40:13,301
To protect us.

1261
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,260
You understand?

1262
01:40:22,593 --> 01:40:24,218
Take this. Please.

1263
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:27,009
Take it.

1264
01:40:31,967 --> 01:40:33,300
Hey, hey.

1265
01:40:34,842 --> 01:40:36,842
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1266
01:40:38,425 --> 01:40:39,717
It's okay.

1267
01:40:45,049 --> 01:40:47,383
-Okay, Daddy.
-Okay.

1268
01:41:11,756 --> 01:41:13,005
Jean?

1269
01:41:13,089 --> 01:41:15,214
<i>-Rick?</i>
-Yeah. What's wrong?

1270
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:17,547
I fell down the stairs.

1271
01:41:18,089 --> 01:41:21,006
-Are you all right?
<i>-I tried calling you.</i>

1272
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:23,921
I couldn't get through to anyone. Notâ€¦

1273
01:41:24,505 --> 01:41:27,587
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, notâ€¦

1274
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:30,671
<i>I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in
my car. I'll be home in 20 minutes.</i>

1275
01:41:30,755 --> 01:41:34,046
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1276
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,961
<i>Carol was the only one that was home</i>

1277
01:41:37,045 --> 01:41:40,461
and she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1278
01:41:40,545 --> 01:41:42,670
Well, that's because she's a bitch.

1279
01:41:43,212 --> 01:41:45,295
She's been my friend for 10 years.

1280
01:41:46,587 --> 01:41:48,461
<i>All right, honey. Feel better.</i>

1281
01:41:49,294 --> 01:41:50,961
I'll be there soon.

1282
01:41:53,753 --> 01:41:55,044
I love you.

1283
01:41:55,919 --> 01:41:57,461
I love you, too.

1284
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:31,708
Miss Jean.

1285
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:35,875
Would you like to sit up?

1286
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:42,999
Here.

1287
01:42:43,749 --> 01:42:44,832
Good.

1288
01:42:54,165 --> 01:42:57,623
-Do you want to hear something funny?
-What, Mrs. Jean?

1289
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:02,331
You're the best friend I've got.

1290
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:16,609
Hi.

1291
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:18,859
Hi.

1292
01:46:25,608 --> 01:46:26,941
I love you.

1293
01:47:57,351 --> 01:47:58,642
All right.

1294
01:47:59,559 --> 01:48:02,809
Everybody out, man. You're free to go.

1295
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:07,517
All right, come on.

1296
01:48:08,434 --> 01:48:11,391
Come on, now. This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop.

1297
01:48:11,475 --> 01:48:12,933
Come on, y'all.

1298
01:48:16,183 --> 01:48:17,475
Come on.

1299
01:48:54,722 --> 01:48:56,013
That's $40.

1300
01:48:56,097 --> 01:48:58,347
Buy everybody chop suey. You understand?

1301
01:49:01,055 --> 01:49:02,930
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1302
01:49:38,969 --> 01:49:41,844
Oh, my God!
What the hell is wrong with you people?

1303
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:46,843
Don't talk to me,
unless you speak American!
