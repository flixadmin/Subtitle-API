00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,537
Yeah. And then he doubled down
and became one of Darhk's Ghosts.

158

like a Ghost ever since.</i>

If you're not getting through
to Andy as a Ghost,

162
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
maybe you should try
reaching him as your brother.

163

No. No.

Before you give up on Andy,

169
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,892
just make sure he sees what I do.

I ran into Damien Darhk.

188

And he tried to use his
creepy magic mojo on me,

189
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,998
but after that, my bloodlust was better.

Except now, Machin's out there
and he has a bloodlust of his own.

195
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,641
And it's completely my fault.

196

No, Thea. You can't think that way.

00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,721
And I tried. Honestly, I tried, man.

317
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,639
Enough to fool you.

318
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,766
That's just not who I was.

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,853
'Cause it's always been about you, John.

320
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,607
Because I'm such an embarrassment,
my bad deeds look bad on you.

321
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,692
No, Andy, no. That's not true.

322
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,278
I did what I did because I love you, man.

323
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,991
No, I do, Andy. Then, now.

324
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:00,954
Andy, you're still my little brother,
who I stayed up late playing cards with.

325
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,624
You going through this, that's on me.

326
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,128
But do you really think Damien Darhk
gives a damn about you?

327
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,921
He believes that the world needs a reset.

328
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,924
And honestly, John, after
what we witnessed in Afghanistan,

329
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,551
can you tell me otherwise?

330
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,305
Okay. All right, so you and Darhk

331
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,681
are burning the village
in order to save it.

332
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,891
I get that.

333
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,059
Malcolm Merlyn was talking the same tune.

334
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,604
But, Andy, Darhk hurt a friend of mine.

335
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,897
A close friend.

336
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,276
A woman better than you
and me put together.

337
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,903
It doesn't matter if Darhk
wants to save the world.

338
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,446
He crossed a line!

339
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,449
So I'm asking you, Andy,

340
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,285
begging you, man,

341
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,371
brother to brother,

342
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,040
where can I find Darhk?

343
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,255
He, uh,

344
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,135
likes to talk about Stonehaven.

345
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,973
About how the leaves look there in autumn.

346
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,478
Thanks, Andy.

347
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,272
Don't thank me.

348
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
You're ashamed?

349
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,692
Now we're even.

350
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,865
Speedy. (CHUCKLES)

351
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,328
That is what the blonde
with the black leather

352
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,414
and the big mouth called you, right?

353
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,167
Hard to look at me, I know.

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,295
Your doing. I owe you a thank you.

355
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,590
Baptism by fire. It's transcendent.

356
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,509
You burnt away my weakness,

357
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,137
like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

358
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,141
If you thought burning your face off
was fun, keep talking.

359
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,853
Put an arrow through your eye.

360
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,355
So why hold back?

361
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,691
I know you want to kill me.

362
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,944
Because I can control myself.

363
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,696
No, you can't.

364
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,366
You think you can, you say you can,

365
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,493
but I can see it in your eyes.

366
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,204
The hunger to deliver death.

367
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,873
Ah, delicious.

I'm just gonna give up what I know
about where Darhk is?

00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,208
Not likely.

Good, because there's nothing to debate.
What you did is...

420
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,907
What I did?

421
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:33,369
I did what I had to do,
after you made it necessary.

422
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,290
Machin was only arrested by the SCPD
because you gave him up.

423
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,377
You were holding a man prisoner
as some sort of personal vendetta.

424
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,089
Do you have any idea
how many people Damien Darhk

425
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,299
and HIVE have killed
over the past six months?

426
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,178
This might be a vendetta,
but it's not personal.

427
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,806
I don't know what's worse.

428
00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:55,601
You actually believe that
or you expect me to.

429
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,435
I put a tracker on Machin.

430
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,271
He will lead us to Darhk,
and then we will take both of them down.

431
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,065
And when your master plan doesn't work,

432
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,193
you just sent a murdering psychotic
back on the streets.

434
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,615

you know where the door is.

There's no lecture here, Oliver.

443

Andy gave me a lead on Darhk.

-And I've been working on it.
-Good. What have you found?

Unfortunately, it was a dead end.

-But nothing. But nothing.

But you should know
that whatever your play is,

449
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,732
-I got your back.
-But?

450
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,526
But you've come so far, Oliver.

451
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:50,864
You've recovered a humanity
that you'd lost when I first met you.

452
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,575
I know you want payback
for what Darhk did to Felicity,

453
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,035
and you should.

fall in love with you in the first place.

"anger management" because

463
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,361
I don't know what else to call it.

that's really bothering you.

Thea, you've lived through more tragedies
than a person has any right to,

-You've got steel inside of you, Thea.
-Huh.

<i>Well, it's a long story.</i>

483
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,176
Short version, Machin's gotten loose,
he's after Darhk, and we're tracking him.

484
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,596
Wait. What? What happens
if he gets out and starts hurting people?

00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,682
-That's exactly my point.
-It doesn't matter.

You sound like him.

487
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,603
No, I mean the tracker's gone dark.
I mean, we just lost his signal.

488
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,273
He must have found the tracker.
We lost him.

Okay, so what do we do now?

00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,738
I don't know.

I think you need her too.

We are going to figure this out.

But right now,
you need to go and be with her.

Hey, stranger.

503
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,999
Sorry I didn't come by sooner. It's...

504
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,668
It's unforgivable.

505
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,088
Only if you were in Bali or something.

506
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,924
Were you in Bali?

507
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,508
No, I was, uh...

Beating the streets?

509
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,554
Probably a lot of people
looking for Darhk.

510
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,015
I didn't want to come see you
until Darhk was off the board.

511
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,516
Any luck?

512
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,436
We're working some leads.

It's just...

516
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,908
I can't help but think that

517
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,203
the reason that Darhk is winning

518
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,998
is because I haven't been willing
to go far enough.

519
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,709
And that if I was, if I had,

520
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,337
maybe you wouldn't be in here right now.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

522

And I don't know what the point of
what I'm doing as Green Arrow is

523
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,557
if I can't protect the people
that are closest to me.

524
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,560
What was the point of doing it
if you lose yourself in the process?

Yeah.

526
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,106
There's something else
we need to talk about.

I know.

530
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,199
My point being is
we didn't really exchange any vows,

531
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,744
so the whole "for better, for worse"
thing doesn't really apply here.

What are you talking about?

533
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,622
That maybe the real reason
you haven't been here is because...

What do you want?

544
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,042
I want Taiana's safety.

545
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,421
So long as she is alive, I'll cooperate.

546

He's manipulating you.

What do you think he's been doing
this whole time?

548

You give him what he wants,
he's gonna turn on you.

Do we have a deal or not?

00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,129
Reiter's gonna get through
with you eventually.

639
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,674
Then you and me'll have
a little uninterrupted time.

640
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,925
(GROANS)

641
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,849
You've lost a lot of blood.

642
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,187
You shouldn't let these wounds
sit open like that.

643
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,688
Thank you.

644
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,857
You saved my life again.

645
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,276
Nearly at the expense of your own.

646
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,694
No.

647
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,530
You didn't deserve to die.

648
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,366
You're a good man.

649
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:43,576
My brother would have liked you.

650
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,667
(SIGHS)

651
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,086
I already told you
everything I know, John.

652
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,215
(SIGHS) I'm not here
to ask any questions, Andy.

653
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,653
Thank you for coming.

654
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:21,906
Yeah. I'm glad I did.

655
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,242
And glad you called.

656
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,701
(CHUCKLES)

657
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,496
<i>You know, this is
a little bit confusing. Uh...</i>

658
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,789
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

659
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,833
First we're on, then we're off,
now we're...

660
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,919
-Drinking wine.
-Drinking wine. (CHUCKLES)

661
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,343
Look, um,
something happened earlier today,

662
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,931
and I guess I just wanted to say
that you were right.

663
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,060
I am stronger than I think I am.

664
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,273
Well, uh, here's to being stronger, huh?

665
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,783
Mmm.

666
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:07,034
How you feeling?

667
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,911
How long you been sitting there?

668
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,621
Not long enough.

669
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,998
Sorry I went away.

670
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,751
I think you apologized already.

671
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,963
Nowhere near done apologizing.

672
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,840
(CHUCKLES)

673
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,720
You know, I think I wanna go to Bali.

674
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,388
Yeah.

675
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,098
Wanna come with me?

676
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,726
Yeah.

677
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,978
I'd go anywhere with you.

678
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,229
Yeah.

679
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,731
Just one question.

680
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,982
Mmm-hmm?

681
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:40,485
What's Damien Darhk doing in Bali?

682
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,946
I only ask 'cause if he's still here,

683
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,157
we have some work to do.

684
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:49,869
How did you get to be so strong?

685
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,162
(CHUCKLES)

686
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,332
I take my lead from you.

687
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,174
Shh.

688
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,097
I've bought out the Fairmont
for the month.

689
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,850
You'll be safe there
until we find a new home.

690
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,520
And what about the man that attacked us?

691
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,855
Lonnie Machin?

692
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,482
He'll never hurt you again.

693
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,692
Those vigilantes saved us.

694
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,907
(SCOFFS) My dearest Ruvé, do I detect
a note of criticism in your voice?

695
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,786
Yes, but not the one you think.

696
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,373
You should have killed
the Green Arrow tonight.

697
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,917
As you said, he saved your life.

698
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,920
It would be bad form to take him out now.

699
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,674
Genesis is almost ready.
We're much too close to play games.

700
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,467
Do you remember what I promised you?

701
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,719
A new beginning.

702
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,263
And you will have it.

703
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,809
Once we've brought this world to its end.

704
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,311
(CHUCKLES)

705
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,007
Are you okay?

706
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,761
Are you?

707
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:32,387
(SIGHS)

708
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,100
No.

709
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,144
You know what you have to do, right?

710
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,566
You have to kill the son of a bitch.

711
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,865
