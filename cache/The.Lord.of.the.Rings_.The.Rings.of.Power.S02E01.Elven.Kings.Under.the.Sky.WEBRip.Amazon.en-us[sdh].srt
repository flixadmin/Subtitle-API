00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,958
[Galadriel] <i>My brother</i>
<i>gave his life hunting Sauron.</i>

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,375
<i>His task is now mine.</i>

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:14,916
This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,750
The question now is, where?

5
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,833
The evil is gone.

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,375
Then why is it not gone
from in here?

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,333
[Gil-galad] <i>These heroes shall be</i>
<i>granted a passage across the sea</i>

8
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,541
<i>to the Undying Lands of Valinor.</i>

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,333
[Halbrand] <i>You're a deserter, aren't you?</i>

10
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,625
[Galadriel] <i>Duty demanded</i>
<i>I return to Middle-earth.</i>

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,416
Was that the mark of your people's king?

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,541
My people have no king.

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,916
[Galadriel] You are more than you claim.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,041
Your people have no king, for you are him.

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,708
<i>Come with me to Middle-earth.</i>

16
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,125
<i>And together we will redeem</i>
<i>both our bloodlines.</i>

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,166
[Halbrand] <i>Be careful.</i>
<i>I am not the hero you seek.</i>

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,750
[grunts]

19
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,458
You remember me?

20
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,625
No.

21
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,125
[screaming]

22
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:58,250
After Morgoth's defeat, I killed Sauron.

23
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,250
I do not believe you.

24
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,416
[Nori] <i>I feel like he's my responsibility.</i>

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,333
-[Adar] <i>You feel like everyone is.</i>
-[Nori] <i>No.</i>

26
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>He could've landed anywhere,</i>
<i>and he landed here.</i>

27
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,750
-This stranger isn't a Man, or an Elf...
-[screaming]

28
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,333
He's something else.

29
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,333
[in Quenya] <i>Á kuita!</i>

30
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,583
-[in English] Get back!
-[Dilly yelps]

31

[Nori] <i>This is how we help him.</i>

32
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,250
He wants us to help him find those stars.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,666
-Where are you goin'?
-To help my friend.

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,458
[Poppy] <i>You're my best friend</i>
<i>in this whole wide, wild world.</i>

35
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,041
[Nori] <i>Do you remember</i>
<i>anything more yet?</i>

36
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:37,791
More has come. But to discover the rest,
I know I must go to Rhûn.

37
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,666
[Nori] <i>Sounds a bit like an adventure.</i>

38
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,875
[Gil-galad] <i>The light</i>
<i>of the Eldar is fading.</i>

39
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:49,958
Despite our every effort,
our decline has only quickened.

40
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,958
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth,
it will be the end,

41
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,541
<i>not just of our people, but all peoples.</i>

42
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,708

[Celebrimbor] <i>We are on the cusp</i>

[Galadriel] <i>All of a sudden,</i>

[Galadriel] <i>There is no King</i>

00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,250
<i>The line was broken.</i>

50
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,708
Tell me your name.

51
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,666
[Halbrand] <i>I have had many names.</i>

52
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:24,083
[voice distorting, echoing]
Sauron lives because of you!

[metal clinking]

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,541
Galadriel, where is Halbrand?

55
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,125
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

56
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,708
And should he ever,
none of us are to treat with him again.

57
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,708
What happened by that stream?

58
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,583
[dramatic music playing]

59
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,666

[Orcs snarling]

62
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,958
[Sauron] Always, after a defeat...

63
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,625
the shadow takes another shape
and grows again.

64
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,125
Morgoth is gone.

65
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,833
Leaving us alone and disgraced.

66
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,250
But today, a new age begins.

67
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,166
Under me.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,875
Your new master.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,458
Sauron.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
[Orcs clamor]

71
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,750
And with a new age, I bring a new vision.

72
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,583
A path to unconditional conquest.

73
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,333
For I seek a new kind of power.

74
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,958
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

75
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,125
A power of the unseen world.

76
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:54,833
One we shall use to enslave the peoples
of Middle-earth to our very will.

77
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,083
Many Orcs will die.

78

[all exclaiming]

79
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:06,208
But out of the chaos,
we will forge a new and perfect order.

80
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:11,791
No longer will we be hunted
as the demons who broke Middle-earth,

81
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:17,041
but rather worshipped
as the saviors who finally healed it.

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,416
By bringing its peoples together,
to rule them all as one!

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,250
[in Black Speech] Sauron lies!

84
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,666
[in English] Doubt me at your peril.

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,833
You have nowhere else to turn.
The Valar will never forgive you.

86
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,500
Elves will never accept you.

87

Men...

88
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,083
Men will never look upon you
with anything but horror and disgust.

89
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,625
-[Orcs growling]
-[Sauron] A corrupted and ignoble race,

90

[Diarmid] That way lies death, friend.

145
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,791
Then that is my path.

146
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,166
An army of Orcs moves against Men.

147
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,750
We were the fortunate ones.

148
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,041
Perhaps the fortunate ones
were the first to die.

149
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,083
I know you've suffered.

150
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,750
I can see it in your eyes.

151
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,666
There's another life waiting for you.

152
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,583
You just have to turn toward it.

153
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,541
That heraldry.

154
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,625
What is it?

155
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,375
[Diarmid] A symbol of kings, long-dead.

156
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,833
-Your family?
-[Diarmid] No.

157
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,708
My family served them.

158
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,000
Then why wear it?

159
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,000
As a reminder that our fates
are never certain,

160
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,250
that fortunes can turn,
for even the most powerful.

161
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
A grim reminder.

162
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,833
Or a hopeful one.

163
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,666
A sure path may crumble,

164
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,583
but there's always another.

165
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,458
Often, it can lead us someplace better.

166
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,208
Someplace good.

167
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:40,208
They say there's places across the sea,
a man can escape himself.

168
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,250
Find another path.

169
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,583
Perhaps another life.

170
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,208
Come with us, if you like.

171
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,875
Or, walk on.

172
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,875
And keep chasing death.

173
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,333
Choice is yours, friend.

Nightmares again?

180
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,083
What haunts you so?

181
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,250
I've done evil.

182
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,500
All of us have done things
that we care not to admit.

183
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Not like I have.

184
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,416
Find forgiveness.

185
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,291
You are alive
because you have chosen good.

186
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,541
But what of tomorrow?

187
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,791
You have to choose it again. [chuckles]

188
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,041
And the next day. And the next.

189
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,708
Until it becomes a part of your nature.

190
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,791
[rumbling]

191
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,750
[low wailing]

192
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,833
[indistinct chatter]

193
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,750
-Grab hold of something.
-Ah!

194
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,458
-[passengers screaming]
-[Diarmid] Help! Help me!

195
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,416
[dramatic music playing]

196
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,083
Help me!

197
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,500
[roars]

198
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,166
[growling]

199
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,416
[wails, screeches]

200
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,041
[gasps]

201
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,833
[panting]

202
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,833
[Galadriel] Over here!

203
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,291
[dramatic music playing]

204
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,083
[Galadriel breathing heavily]

205
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,791
[gasps]

206
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,583
-[grunts]
-The tides of fate are flowing.

207
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,791
Yours may be heading in, or out.

208
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,833
[theme music playing]

209
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,625
[intense music playing]

210
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,583
-[horse whinnies]
-[Elrond grunts]

211
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,791
[Galadriel grunts]

212
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,083
[birds chirping]

213
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,208
Elrond, stop, give them to me!

214
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,000
[sighs]

215
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,250
[grunts]

216
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,125
[Mirthless Guard] We intend no insult,
Commander Galadriel,

217
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,500
but by order of Herald Elrond,
you are to come with us.

218
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,875
[suspenseful music playing]

219
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,875
[Gil-galad] Is it true?

220
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,000
High King.

221
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,708
Herald Elrond carries three Rings.

222
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:12,708
A means of halting the fading
and saving our people.

223
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,416
We will discuss the Rings
once you have answered the question.

224
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:21,125
Elrond just informed me your companion,
this Halbrand,

225
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,958
was not who he claimed.

226
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,791
Yet you chose to withhold this
from him and Celebrimbor.

227
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,125
Is it true?

228
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,750
Yes.

229
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,208
Who is he?

230
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,458
He is not what I thought.

231
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,500
Which is the reason I did what I did.

232
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,666
Why do you dance so
to avoid revealing the truth?

233
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,750
[in Sindarin] High King

234
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,416
You must believe I would never
knowingly endanger our kind.

235
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,333
[in English] I will believe you

236
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,958
when I no longer see the lie
behind your eyes.

237
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,875
Now, who is this Man?

238
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,958
He is no Man.

239
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:17,166
He has been... masquerading as one.

240
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:24,458
Appearing in fair form,
to hide his true self.

241
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,041
He is Sauron.

242
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,375
[ominous music playing]

243
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,166
[exclaims in Sindarin]

244
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,291
[in English] How could you?

245
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,333
Of all our kind.

246
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,125
He deceived me. I was deceived!

247
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:56,416
No, Galadriel, you were blind.
Blinded by your own pride.

248
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,083
And what frailty blinded you, Elrond?

249
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,000
[in Sindarin] Silence!

250
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,500
[in English]
What other path did your failure

251
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:01,750
in Khazad-dûm leave us with?

252
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,666
You were my friend.

253
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,125
[in Sindarin] Silence!

254
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,458
[in English] The Rings. Show them to me.

255
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,500
Dare not, High King.
He's no doubt corrupted--

256
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,958
He never touched them, High King.

257
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:17,333
He worked with Celebrimbor for weeks.
We know not the depth of his influence.

258
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:20,208
Soon, the last Gold-leaf will fall,

259
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:24,583
and it will be my task to inform
all Lindon our time here is ended,

260
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,291
and the Elves
must abandon these shores forever.

261
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:32,000
Now, you inform me
our most cunning enemy is rising again.

262
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,541
If we leave now,
the peoples of Middle-earth

263
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,333
will be left to suffer
under the tyranny of a new Dark Lord.

264
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,375
Those Rings are more than our last hope,

265
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,958
they may be the last hope
for all Middle-earth.

266
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,083
It is a risk we must chance to take.

267
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,416
Give them to me.

268
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,000
High King...

269
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,708
Sauron has not yet amassed
that degree of power.

270
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,250
These Rings may be how he attains it.

271
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,208
They must be destroyed.

272
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:07,375
That decision is far above your privilege,

273
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:11,041
one you endanger
with each moment you refuse to obey.

274
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,333
The Rings, Elrond.

275
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,541
It is a command from your King.

276
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,375
I will not utter it again.

277
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,166
[Galadriel, in Sindarin] Obey him.

278
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,416
[in Sindarin] You would say that to me?

279
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,833
It is the only way. Obey him!

280
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,708
[Elrond] I cannot.

281
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,750
You know I cannot.

282
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:53,958
Seize him!

283
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,583
[Galadriel, in English] Elrond, no!

284
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,916
[dramatic music playing]

285
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,166
[in Sindarin] Find him. Find the rings.

286
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,458
Go!

287
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,708
[sinister music playing]

288
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,375
[Orcs shouting]

289
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,958
Keep up! Move!

290
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,291
Move those legs, king.

291
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,875
[Orc] Well, take that.

292
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,250
[Waldreg] Welcome to Mordor.

293
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:02,125
Work its land well,
and you'll be fed well.

294
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,416
Work it badly, and you'll feed the soil.

295
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:13,291
You, lad, do you swear allegiance to Adar,
Lord-father of the <i>Uruks?</i>

296
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,583
-[yelps]
-[Orcs grunts]

297
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,083
[straining]

298
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,833
It is the Southlands no more!

299
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:26,916
In Mordor, ya bow or ya bleed.

300
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Right, you there.
Do you swear allegiance to Adar?

301
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:33,458
[whimpers]

302
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,458
[screaming]

303
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,583
[Waldreg] I'll take this one!

304
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,791
[Glüg] The King of the Southlands
turned himself in, Lord-father.

305
00:29:57,875 --> 00:30:00,208
Says he wants to negotiate.

306
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,291
Let my people go.

307
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,000
[all laughing]

308
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,916
Or yours will die.

309
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,916
My people defeated the Men of these lands.

310
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:23,916
We defeated the Elves
who came to their aid.

311
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,458
We even defeated their allies,
the Men from beyond the sea.

312
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,375
There is no one left for us to fear.

313
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,208
There is one.

314
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:46,750
Since Galadriel's defeat,
she sought out a new ally.

315
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:52,166
An ancient sorcerer, to instruct the Elves
in forging a new weapon.

316
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,666
One you first told her about.

317
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,750
A power over flesh.

318
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,375
Do you remember those words?

319
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:07,083
A power that will allow him
to use your children

320
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,416
as slaves in his army once more.

321
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,541
Set my people free, and I will tell you
where he can be found.

322
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,208
So you can destroy him,
and rid us both of his evil.

323
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,083
No, Your Majesty.

324
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:29,583
You will tell me everything
you think you know of this sorcerer now.

325
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,625
Or I will spill the words
from your throat.

326
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,208
If I die, all that I know dies with me.

327
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,375
You can't kill me.

328
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,541
In time, you will beg me to.

329
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
Ah!

330
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,833
[groans]

331
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,166
[sighs]

332
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,625
Your Majesty.

333
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,541
-Ha!
-[groans softly]

334
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,833
[Glüg] What he said, Lord-father...

335
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:06,500
Sauron... could never return, could he?

336
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,583
No.

337
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,083
Sauron is dead.

338
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,583
[Waldreg] On your knees, you maggots!

339
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,291
[suspenseful music playing]

340
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,166
[panting]

341
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,625
[indistinct whispering]

342
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,916
[insects trilling]

343
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,916
You got that look in your eye.

344
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,625
You had that dream again last night,
didn't you?

345
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,541
If you tell me what it is you keep seein',
maybe I could...

346
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,375
help you puzzle it out.

347
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,583
Maybe it's a clue
to what we're going to find...

348
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,333
when we reach those stars.

349
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,250
It's the heat. That's all.

350
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,958
[man breathing heavily]

351
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,125
No. It can't be.

352
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,166
Stone trees.

353
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,666
We're goin' in circles.

354
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,500
There must be some evil upon this land,
confusing our path.

355
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,500
Just admit it. We're lost.

356
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,708
Panic is the fool's meal, Nori.

357
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,125
We would be wiser to sup on patience.

358
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,875
We haven't supped on anything
since we ran out of snails.

359
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,583
There's nothin' to eat out here.

360
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:52,250
[Stranger panting]

361
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,000
[playful music playing]

362
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,333
Oh, no. Oh, no.

363
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, come on.

364
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:14,750
It might bear some fruit.
Least you could do is try.

365
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,458
Have you forgotten what happened
when last I tried such a thing?

366
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,708
Further.

367
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,166
Further, Nori.

368
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,166
[sighs]

369
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,333
All right?

370
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,041
[rumbling]

371
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:55,875
[exhales softly]

372
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,458
[speaking Quenya]

373
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,750
[tree creaking]

374
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,250
Ah! [grunts]

375
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,875
[gasps]

376
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,208
[groaning]

377
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,375
You did it. We'll eat for days.

378
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,708
[laughing]

379
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,666
[insects trilling]

380
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,541
[Nori] Don't be so glum.

381
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:02,458
I asked you to conjure us up some food,
and you did.

382
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,416
Nobody got hurt.

383
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,708
I lost control.

384
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,041
So you need to learn
how not to lose control.

385
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:16,416
In the dream, there's a kind of... branch.

386
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,041
Under the stars.

387
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,583
When I reach out to grasp it...

388
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:30,708
What is it? What happens next?

389
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,458
Some things are best not shared aloud.

390
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:42,208
Except, well, you did sort of
share it aloud.

391
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,000
So it's not rightly fair
to be all cryptic about it now, is it?

392
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:49,458
But perhaps, wizards are not always fair.

393
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,625
-[Nori chuckles]
-Hmm.

394
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,583
Mmm.

395
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,083
[laughs]

396
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,791
-I can feel the legs in the throat.
-That's the best part.

397
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,916
They're dancin'.

398
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,875
Poppy and I,
we used sing little buggy songs

399
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,166
so they'd have music
to dance to when they...

400
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,500
Well.

401
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:21,666
It is quite all right
for a Harfoot to miss home.

402
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,958
I knew it'd be hard. It's just, um...

403
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,625
Well.

404
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,250
This hard's different.

405
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,541
Strange how that which is left behind
can be the heaviest burden to carry.

406
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,750
I miss my home, as well.

407
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,291
You don't even remember yours.

408
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,791
No.

409
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,250
Sometimes,
I perceive a glimmer of it nonetheless.

410
00:38:56,875 --> 00:39:01,041
A longing for a feeling
I can't remember or even name.

411
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,750
But I know it's real.

412
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,083
Just beyond the sunset.

413
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,875
It appears we're being followed.

414
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,416
[music playing]

415
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,625
[growling]

416
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,791
[growls, snarls]

417
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,791
Come on, Your Majesty.

418
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,625
Not even kings can go without food.

419
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,750
Why don't you open up?

420
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:37,583
You tell old Waldreg
everything you know about Sauron.

421
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,000
[exclaims]

422
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,291
Pain must be something you enjoy.

423
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,291
[grunts]

424
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,208
After Lord-father releases me,
I'm going to kill you.

425
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,541
Adar doesn't even remember you're here.

426
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,625
[Halbrand grunts]

427
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,750
[gasps]

428
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,250
[breathing heavily]

429
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,958
[creature growling]

430
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,041
[intense music playing]

431
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,416
[speaking Black Speech]

432
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,375
[horse whinnies]

433
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,500
[indistinct shouting]

434
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,583
[indistinct chatter]

435
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:26,916
Perfection.

436
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,666
Perfection exists only in Valinor.

437
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,250
Thank you, Master Círdan.

438
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,875
You needn't hide any longer.

439
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,083
Master Círdan.

440
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,041
Please forgive the unexpected nature
of my visit,

441
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,166
but I have nowhere else to turn.

442
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,125
You are the oldest and wisest of our kind.

443
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,583
And the Elves are facing
our greatest test in an age.

444
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,250
I perceive you carry something
in your charge.

445
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:56,166
Something louder than the sea.

446
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,250
What have you brought here?

447
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,000
[rings clink]

448
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,583
It is to be given directly
to Lord Celebrimbor.

449
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,375
He must be informed

450
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:12,000
that Halbrand is Sauron.

451
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,750
Move with haste,

452
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,791
and trust no stranger upon your path.

453
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:18,666
Yes, my lord.

454
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,875
[door closes]

455
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,166
I have yet to thank you.
For trusting me, regarding the Rings.

456
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,666
Trusting you?

457
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,791
Let us be clear, Commander.

458
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,875
You and I are momentarily aligned
for one reason,

459
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,250
because your actions
have left us no alternative.

460
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:51,375
Because of you, our enemy lives.

461
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,291
Because of you, we've no choice
but to test the virtue of the Rings.

462
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,875
I should have you thrown in fetters

463
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,708
and cast to the Ettenmoors
for what you've done.

464
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,416
Then why have you not?

465
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,333
I am considering it.

466
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:16,666
I swear to you, High King,

467
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:22,541
I will not stop until he is destroyed
and I have put this right.

468
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,125
You would not be here now
if I thought otherwise.

469
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,625
[female guard] High King,
we have not found the Rings.

470
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,208
We've scoured everywhere water meets rock,
and yet,

471
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,375
there's no trace of him.

472
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,125
-Perhaps the fall--
-No.

473
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,416
Elrond lives.

474
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,666
Expand the search.

475
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:53,833
Set a watch at every crossing.
He must not escape.

476
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,458
Escape is not his plan.

477
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,458
Meaning?

478
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,875
He spoke of destroying the Rings.

479
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,833
Elrond would seek out
someone he can trust.

480
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:13,208
Someone older, wiser...

481
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Whose voice would command respect.

482
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,250
Even from you.

483
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:23,041
Someone who could turn the tides his way.

484
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,458
[Elrond] You may examine them.

485
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,208
I've seen Celebrimbor's work before.

486
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,625
-He's remarkable.
-He is.

487
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:42,458
I remember, he used to speak of, one day,
crafting objects of such power,

488
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:45,166
they could change the heart
of any who beheld them.

489
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,666
If, as you say,

490
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,875
these Rings have so quickly
turned Elf against Elf...

491
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,291
it would appear he has succeeded.

492
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,041
Perhaps it was not Celebrimbor's hand
that produced that effect.

493
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,125
If what you've told me is true,

494
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:11,166
these three Rings were made
without Sauron's touch.

495
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,250
The Enemy is cunning.

496
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,458
The Rings may well be a ploy on his part.

497
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,916
A device in some larger plan,
the end of which we cannot yet see.

498
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,291
What would you ask of me?

499
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,541
The Rings must be destroyed.

500
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,541
Do so, and the Age of the Elves will end.

501
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:41,625
We would be abandoning
all Middle-earth to its fate.

502
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:43,791
Could you accept that?

503
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:48,083
If to do otherwise means falling prey
to the designs of the Enemy...

504
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,375
Yes.

505
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,333
You do your father proud.

506
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,791
[suspenseful music playing]

507
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,708
Long ago, there was a battle.

508
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,583
One whose weapons
were the very bones of the continents.

509
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,500
Still now, at the spot
where our bay meets the sea,

510
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:17,375
there remains on the seabed
a scar so deep,

511
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,250
its end none but Manwë himself knows.

512
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:25,166
If one were to cast these Rings
into its depths, they--

513
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,500
[horse whinnies]

514
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,916
Let me speak with him first.

515
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,583
Please, High King.

516
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,541
Give me one last chance
to reason with my friend?

517
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,541
Reason quickly.

518
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,625
Elrond?

519
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,500
I have come to coax you willingly.

520
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
If I fail, the High King
will see you removed by force.

521
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,083
I have failed enough of late, old friend.

522
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,250
Help me succeed this time?

523
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:25,000
I should have trusted you,
as I asked you to trust me.

524
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:30,500
But unless we both trust in the Rings now,
all will be lost.

525
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,625
With three, there is balance.

526
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:36,958
Don't you remember?

527
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:39,500
We chose this path together.

528
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,208
-No, you chose it for me.
-Elrond--

529
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,125
What so frightens you, you cannot consider

530
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,708
the possibility of their corruption?

531
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,583
Because in my heart,

532
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,666
I know The Three Rings
are free of his influence.

533
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,541
But are you?

534
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:04,375
The light of Valinor shone
upon your very face, Galadriel,

535
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,666
and you turned your back on it.

536
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:12,375
Was it truly to fight the darkness
or was the darkness calling to you?

537
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,583
Can you not see?
All this may be by his design.

538
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,708
I did what I felt was right.

539
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:23,666
And time alone will reveal
whether that was folly or wisdom.

540
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,083
What time do you think you have?

541
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,208
Where is Círdan?

542
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,916
You did what you must, Galadriel.

543
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,083
So have I.

544
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:41,416

545
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,541

[Nori] Mmm, honey biscuits.

553
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,708
Never been happier in my life
than right now.

554
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,666
How's everyone at home?

555
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,416
About the same.

556
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,375
Your ma took to giving me your chores,

557
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,208
but your da said I didn't have to do 'em.

558
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,333
You came after us.

559
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,125
Wasn't so hard.
You haven't exactly gotten very far.

560
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:45,583
Yes, well, we appear to be lost.

561
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,000
So now you admit it.

562
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,166
Well, you won't be for long. Look.

563
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,916
I was sifting through Sadoc's old book.

564
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,500
Harfoots must've journeyed this way
a long time ago.

565
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,208
See, there's a warnin',

566
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,750
"Not to forget the words to the song,
or you'll just go round in circles."

567
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,791
Song? What song?

568
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:03,916

-I think it's some kinda directions.

571
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,583
Our folk have been wanderin' for years.

572
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,791
Guess this path
must have been important to them.

573
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,625
I say, we climb.

"Trees of stone... Light in the tower,
no longer my home."

575
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,125
There.

576
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,208

577
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,666

"I trade all I've known
for the unknown ahead."

Welcome to the lands of Rhûn.

580
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,125
Come on. What are you waitin' for?

581
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,625
This is only the beginnin'.

582
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,708
Why you looking at it like that?

583
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,000
Like what?

584
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,458
Like you've been here before.

585
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,750

I was in your place once.

593
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,958
In the eldest of the Elder Days.

594
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:32,125
Thirteen of us were chosen
to be blessed of Morgoth's hand,

595
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,041
with the promise of power.

596
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,416
A new birth.

597
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:45,166
I was led up to a dark and nameless peak.

598
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,541
Chained and left.

599
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:53,916
And after what seemed
endless thirst and hunger...

600
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,166
I saw it.

601
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,875
His servant's face.

602
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,083
Sauron's face.

603
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,708
And it was beautiful.

604
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:17,375
He offered me wine, red as a blood moon.

605
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:24,208
He offered me wine,
and on that dark and nameless peak,

606
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,166
I drank it.

607
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,958
I drank it all.

608
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,708
Your people have been set free.

609
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:41,000
Now, tell me what you know of Sauron.

610
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:48,875
Sauron has returned in a new form.

611
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,083
I am not yet certain
what shape he has taken.

612
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,833
Then of what use are you to me?

613
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,833
I have something you don't.

614
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:00,416
The trust of the Elves.

615
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,875
Release me,

616
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,458
and I'll go to them and seek him out,

617
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,750
so you can marshal your legions
to destroy him.

Yes.

622
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,250
Then kneel.

623
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,000
Now, swear it.

624
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,333
-I vow--
-With your head at my feet.

625
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,458
I vow to serve the Lord of Mordor.

626

627
