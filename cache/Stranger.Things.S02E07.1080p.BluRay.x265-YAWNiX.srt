1
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,970
<i>Mama? It's me. Jane.</i>

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,339
<i>I'm home.</i>

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,223
<i>No.</i>

4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,602
Breathe.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>Sunflower.</i>

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,104
<i>Rainbow.</i>

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,145
<i>- Four-fifty. Three to the right...
- Breathe.</i>

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,067
<i>Four to the left. Sunflower.</i>

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,940
<i>- Four-fifty. Rainbow.
- Breathe.</i>

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Breathe.</i>

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,592
<i>Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.</i>

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,122
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,584
Three to the right. Four to the left.

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,413
Okay. You okay?

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,045
And it just kept repeating?

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,710
Repeat?

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,844
Like a circle? Just showing you
the same image over and over?

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,892
She kept showing the girl in the room.

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,018
The rainbow room?

20
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,600
What did the girl look like?

21
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,946
- Different.
- Different than you?

22
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,694
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.

23
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,121
To show you the girl?

24
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,333
I think she wants me to find her.

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,720
When Terry was looking for you,

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,175
she kept these files
of other missing kids.

27
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,727
Kids she thought were like you.

28
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:52,644
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.

29
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:53,738
Here.

30
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,867
Does anyone look familiar?

31
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,887
Is that her?

32
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,453
Did you find her?

33
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,663
No.

34
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,463
Hello?

35
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,443
Becky! Becky, I found her.

36
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,526
I just...
I didn't know who else to call.

37
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,659
He gave me this number,
and he came here looking for her.

38
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,741
I thought maybe he could help me.

39
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,875
Yeah, Jim Hopper, he came here
with some woman named Joyce Byers?

40
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,091
Well, that's a little hard to explain.
Uh...

41
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,763
There's another girl, and she's missing,
and I think she's in trouble.

42
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,556
I just... I didn't know who to call.

43
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,134
Thank you, thank you. And you are?

44
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,720
Florence...

45
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,941
I'm gonna have to call you back.

46
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,817
Jane? Jane?

47
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,452
Jane?

48
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,122
Jane!

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,282
Jane!

50
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,450
Jane!

51
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,413
Four-fifty... Breathe. Sunflower...

52
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,479
Watch it, kid.

53
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,350
Mouth breather.

54
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,142
They're dead.

55
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,853
They're all dead!

56
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,401
They're all dead!

57
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,275
They're all dead!

58
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,599
You should do stand-up, Axe.
There's a spot a few blocks away.

59
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,979
Hello?

60
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,107
Well, well...

61
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,981
What do we have here?

62
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,032
What is she wearing?

63
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,610
What are those, overalls?

64
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,866
There aren't any cows
to milk here, kid.

65
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,614
Go on back to the farm now.

66
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,370
I'm looking for my sister.

67
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,670
Aw... Shirley Temple lost her sister.
So sad.

68
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,373
I saw her. Here.

69
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,343
Uh-uh. Hand out of pocket. Slow.

70
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,505
Give me that shit.

71
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,062
- Is that Kali?
- Kali?

72
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,605
How did you find us?

73
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,812
- Who else knows you're here?
- No one.

74
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,772
So, what then? Poof! You just show up
like magic with that picture?

75
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,356
Stay calm. She's just a kid.

76
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,986
A kid who could get us all killed.

77
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,327
If I have to ask again, Shirley,
you'll start losing things.

78
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,573
Starting with those pretty little locks
of yours. Yeah?

79
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,990
Come on, Axe. Put down the knife.

80
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,495
How did you find us?

81
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,496
- I saw her.
- Axe!

82
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,586
That's not an answer.

83
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,999
Jesus. Jesus Christ!

84
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,674
Get off! Shit! Shit!

85
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,303
You're a terrible dancer, Axel.

86
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,518
I told you, stay out of my head.

87
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,975
So, we're threatening little girls now,
are we?

88
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,149
- She knows about you.
- She had this.

89
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,825
Where did you get this?

90
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,288
Mama.

91
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,827
Your mother gave this to you?

92
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,620
In her dream circle.

93
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,999
Dream circle.
I think she's a schizo or something.

94
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,298
- Says she's looking for her sister.
- Yeah. Like I said, schizo.

95
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,343
Jesus!

96
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,639
I saw you.

97
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,641
In the rainbow room.

98
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,430
What is your name?

99
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,644
Jane.

100
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,918
Sister.

101
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,374
Sister.

102
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,725
And this memory
your mother shared...

103
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,394
that is your only memory of me?

104
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,238
Yes.

105
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,988
And how long have you been
with this policeman?

106
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,837
Three hundred
and twenty-seven days.

107
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,745
And this policeman, he thinks

108
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,199
he can work out some sort of deal
with these men to set you free?

109
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,204
Yes.

110
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,377
- He says soon.
- He's naÃ¯ve then.

111
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,463
We'll always be monsters to them.
Do you understand?

112
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,594
Let me guess. Your policeman,
he also stops you from using your gifts?

113
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,141
What you can do is incredible.

114
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,802
It makes you very special, Jane.

115
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Wait.

116
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,059
- Do you have a gift?
- Different.

117
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:20,271
I can make people see, or not see,
whatever I choose.

118
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,325
Is that why you made the man
with the crazy hair dance?

119
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:29,497
- Axel is not so fond of spiders, so...
- You made him see spiders?

120
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,700
But it doesn't have to be scary.

121
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,547
This butterfly, it isn't real.

122
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,843
I've just convinced your mind it is.

123
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,137
Think of it as a kind of magic.

124
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,525
Are you real?

125
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,277
Yes, I'm real.

126
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,756
What's wrong?

127
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,508
Nothing is wrong.

128
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,604
I just feel... whole... now.

129
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,562
Like... a piece of me was missing,

130
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,530
and now it's not.

131
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,824
Does that make sense?

132
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,661
Yes.

133
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,492
I think your mother sent you here
for a reason.

134
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,292
I think she somehow knew
that we belong together.

135
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,503
I think this is your home.

136
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,457
Home.

137
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,676
Yes. Home.

138
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,352
<i>This is car 13,
responding to a 245 at 31 Ashbury.</i>

139
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,765
<i>...suspect under surveillance.</i>

140
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,977
Shit.

141
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,946
How's your white hick sister?
You tuck her in real tight?

142
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,779
Yeah, what about a lullaby?
Did you sing her one?

143
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,501
She found me with only this.

144
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,511
What's that mean?

145
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,178
It means she can find people
without moving.

146
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,881
With nothing but an image.

147
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,434
You telling me Shirley's a human
radar detector or some shit?

148
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,931
Or some shit, yes.

149
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,603
Come on. No way.

150
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,100
We'll find out soon enough.

151
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,357
I want to do one. Tomorrow.

152
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,435
- You serious, Kal?
- We're way too hot right now.

153
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,529
Paranoid.

154
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,941
Realistic. You don't kill their men
and expect them to look the other way.

155
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,401
If they find us, they will unleash hell.

156
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,576
So we give in to fear?

157
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,160
She's in pain. She needs this.

158
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,326
We go out tomorrow.

159
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,040
Swear to God,
Shirley Temple's gonna get us all killed.

160
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,386
<i>It's me.</i>

161
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,065
<i>I know that I've been gone too long,
and, uh...</i>

162
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,776
<i>I just want you to know
that it's not because of you.</i>

163
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,199
<i>And it's not because of our fight.</i>

164
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,404
<i>Something came up,</i>

165
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:01,743
<i>and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.</i>

166
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,202
<i>I just, um...</i>

167
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,507
<i>I want you to know that I'm not...
I'm not mad at you. I...</i>

168
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,545
<i>I'm just sorry.</i>

169
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,674
It's okay. It's only me.

170
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,184
Bad dream?

171
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,853
What time is it?

172
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,476
It's late.

173
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,023
You slept well. Come.

174
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,817
It's time you meet my friends.
Properly this time.

175
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,654
We need more money, Kal.
I can't keep eating this garbage.

176
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,364
- This is Axel.
- The spider hater?

177
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,575
Yes, the spider hater.

178
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,375
This is Dottie, our newest.

179
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,169
Like you, she just left home.

180
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,340
- You mean the loony bin.
- Mick, our eyes, our protector.

181
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,339
This is Funshine, our warrior.

182
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,636
Don't let his size frighten you.
Fun's a teddy bear.

183
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,432
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.

184
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,017
If you're looking for a number,
you won't find one.

185
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,395
They're not like us.

186
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,274
No, not in that way.
But like us, they're outcasts.

187
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,571
Outcasts?

188
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,774
- Freaks.
- Speak for yourself.

189
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:19,111
Society left them behind,
hurt them, discarded them.

190
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,288
We were dead, all of us.

191
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,118
Kali saved us. Here. And here.

192
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,204
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.

193
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,256
No, not mushy. True.

194
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,458
Now we help her.

195
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,545
In this life, kid,
you roll over or you fight back.

196
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,504
We're all fighters here.

197
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,593
Fight who?

198
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,103
Everyone you see here was
in some way responsible

199
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,305
for what happened to us.

200
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,773
You hurt the bad men?

201
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,855
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.

202
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,530
You kill them?

203
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,203
They're criminals.
We simply make them pay for their crimes.

204
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,952
Boom.

205
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,214
Damn, Shirley. What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

206
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,253
We can't all be fighters, I guess.

207
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,008
I'm a fighter. I've killed.

208
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:25,762
These men you killed, did they deserve it?

209
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,055
They hurt me.

210
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,893
And they still want to hurt you.
To hurt us.

211
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,069
We're just making the first move.

212
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,778
Come.

213
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,612
I was just like you once.

214
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,278
I kept my anger inside.

215
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,033
I tried to hide from it,
but then that pain festered.

216
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,619
Festered?

217
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,758
It spread.

218
00:18:55,384 --> 00:19:00,004
Until finally I confronted my pain,
and I began to heal.

219
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,061
- Do you see that train?
- Yes.

220
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,309
I want you to draw it to us.

221
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,855
I can't.

222
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,811
Last night you told me
you lifted a van once.

223
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,894
Yes.

224
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,694
The bad men were trying
to take you again,

225
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,397
<i>and that made you angry.</i>

226
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,905
Good. So, find that anger,

227
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,578
focus on that, not the train,
not its weight.

228
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,413
I want you to find something
from your life.

229
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,417
Something that angers you.

230
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,007
Now channel it.

231
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,888
Dig deeper.
Your whole life you've been lied to...

232
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,015
- Do I have a mother?
- She's not around anymore.

233
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,728
...imprisoned.

234
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,443
Don't walk away from me!
Grow the hell up!

235
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,106
The bad men took away your home,

236
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,783
your mother...

237
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,946
Jane.

238
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,500
They took everything from you.

239
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,586
Papa!

240
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,787
They stole your life, Jane.

241
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,584
I want you to find them.

242
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,475
Yeah!

243
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,522
Yeah, Jane!

244
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,028
So, how do you feel?

245
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,025
Good.

246
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,953
These are the bad men, as you call them.

247
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,457
The one's we believe are still alive.
Do you know any?

248
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,013
Him.

249
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,300
<i>Four-fifty...</i>

250
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,603
He hurt Mama.

251
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,774
His name is Ray Caroll.
And he did more than hurt your mother.

252
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,272
The bad men like Ray, they know about us.

253
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,325
It's made them hard to track.
But maybe not anymore.

254
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,112
"Gramercy Apartments.
Washington and Bethel."

255
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,314
That's gotta be it. Right?

256
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,401
- "Lilburn." Where is that?
- About an hour east.

257
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,235
We don't even have a new ride.

258
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,412
So we swap plates.
We have plates, right?

259
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,330
- Yeah.
- It's risky.

260
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,283
Where's the fun if there's no risk?

261
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,461
We want to give my sister
a memorable first day, right?

262
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,630
I'm in. For Miss Jane.

263
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,551
Yeah, sure. Why not? Mick?

264
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,849
Screw it!

265
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,380
Bitchin'.

266
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,591
Bitchin'.

267
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,185
Get off me! Get off me!

268
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,209
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

269
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,908
What are we doing?

270
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,412
Stocking up.

271
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,417
Hey, your bathroom is leaking.

272
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,412
Oh, shit.

273
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,506
Yes.

274
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,299
Shit.

275
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,346
Okay, contestants,
you have a minute and a half,

276
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,674
let's begin your supermarket sweep!

277
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,700
Hey! Put that back,
or I'll blow your head off.

278
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,999
- You hear me, freak?
- Put the gun down.

279
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,705
Stay back. Stay back.

280
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,667
Darrel, your money is insured.

281
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,472
We're only stealing from the war criminal
billionaires who own this place.

282
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,970
- You won't even lose a dime.
- I said stay back.

283
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,642
We're on the same side.

284
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,518
- I promise.
- Stay back.

285
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,275
Damn, Shirley.

286
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,903
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

287
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,614
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!

288
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,482
We should case the place,
stick to the routine. We have time.

289
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,276
We also have her. Can you look?

290
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,158
- He's watching television.
- Is he alone?

291
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,086
I saw him. No one else.

292
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,381
- Good enough for me.
- Me, too.

293
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,378
Let's do this.

294
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,175
- Keep it running.
- Meet you around back.

295
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,480
<i>Punky, what's the matter?</i>

296
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,574
<i>A nightmare.</i>

297
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,609
<i>I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.</i>

298
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,822
<i>All of a sudden, he's started to give me
my shot in my arm.</i>

299
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:51,080
<i>Then the needle got bigger
and bigger and bigger...</i>

300
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,434
Hello, Ray.

301
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,146
Jesus Christ!

302
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,234
Sit down. Please.

303
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,569
- I said sit.
- Please...

304
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,945
Just, please... just take what you want.

305
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,651
Oh, we will.

306
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,495
Where's your wallet?

307
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,664
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.
- Come on.

308
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,788
Yes.

309
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,545
Got it.

310
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,936
Do you remember us?

311
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,195
What about us?
Do you remember us, Ray?

312
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,618
Please. Please.

313
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,326
You hurt Mama.

314
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,629
Wait.

315
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,338
Please. Listen...

316
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,179
I just did what he told me to do.

317
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,508
He said she was sick.

318
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,886
You had a choice, Ray.

319
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,768
And you chose to follow a man
you knew was evil.

320
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,440
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

321
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:43,146
I can help. I can help you find him.

322
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,569
- Find who?
- Brenner!

323
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,151
I can take you to him.

324
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,487
Papa is gone.

325
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,537
No, he is alive.

326
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,208
Do not lie to us, Ray.

327
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,751
I'm not lying!

328
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,330
I swear...

329
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,505
He trusts me.

330
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,044
I'll take you to him.

331
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,970
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

332
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,797
Just as she found you.

333
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,473
Do it, Jane.

334
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,602
- Do it.
- Wait.

335
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,062
Not too quick.

336
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,239
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

337
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,147
<i>Sweetie, just stay calm.</i>

338
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,629
Oh, shit!

339
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,837
<i>The police are on their way, honey. Okay?</i>

340
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,724
What's wrong?

341
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,098
- What's wrong?
- We got a problem.

342
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,774
Kids in the apartment.

343
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,231
Please...

344
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,531
- Did he show your mother mercy? No.
- Please. No.

345
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,324
- I'm sorry.
- He took her from you, without hesitation.

346
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,279
Please don't. Please.

347
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,616
We got to go, K.
They called the cops.

348
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,871
We finish this first.

349
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,122
- Kali!
- Jane, now!

350
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,079
Please, don't...

351
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,335
Please. Please.

352
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,391
Kali, we gotta go!

353
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,799
- Shit!
- Go, go, go!

354
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,148
Shit!

355
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,233
Come on. Get in!

356
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,739
If you wanted to show mercy,
that is your choice.

357
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,244
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

358
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,201
Do you understand? Do you understand?

359
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,388
I see you, and I raise you ten.

360
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,932
How ya like that?

361
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,690
That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.

362
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,987
I think you're full of shit.

363
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,252
May I sit?

364
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,722
I was once just like you, you know that?

365
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,395
But that's why I'm hard on you,
because I see in you my past mistakes.

366
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,315
They were kids.

367
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,364
Does that excuse that man's sins?
Were we not also children?

368
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,749
I remember the day I came
to the rainbow room and you were gone.

369
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,371
So, when my gifts were strong enough,
I used them to escape.

370
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,581
And I ran.

371
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,707
I ran away as far as I could.

372
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,761
And it was there, far away,
that I found a place to hide.

373
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,600
A family.

374
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,188
A home.

375
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,598
Just like you and your policeman.

376
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,856
But they couldn't help me.

377
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,192
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

378
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,162
So, I decided to play the part.

379
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,614
To stop hiding.

380
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,496
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.

381
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,250
You're now faced
with the same choice, Jane.

382
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,879
Go back into hiding
and hope they don't find you.

383
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,836
Fight, and face them again.

384
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,171
Face who?

385
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,515
The man who calls himself our father.

386
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,804
Papa is dead.

387
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,537
That man tonight disagreed.

388
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,104
You're not real.

389
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,776
All this time?
And you haven't looked for me?

390
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,745
Why?

391
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,289
Because you thought I was dead?

392
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,580
Or because you were afraid
of what you might find?

393
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,836
Go away.

394
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,210
You have to confront your pain.

395
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,636
You have a wound, Eleven,
a terrible wound.

396
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,055
And it's festering.

397
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,306
Do you remember
what that means? Festering?

398
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,060
It means a rot.

399
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,016
And it will grow.

400
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,898
Spread.

401
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,987
- Get out of my head.
- And eventually, it will kill you.

402
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,194
Get out of my head!

403
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,169
This isn't a prison, Jane.

404
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,423
You're always free
to return to your policeman.

405
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,679
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

406
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,594
Let us heal our wounds together.

407
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,326
- Full house.
- Screw this. I'm out.

408
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,910
Out of money, you mean. You are broke!

409
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,590
- You want in, Mick?
- Nope.

410
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,046
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.

411
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,299
How am I the worst?

412
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,507
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

413
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,093
two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.

414
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,974
- Are you in or out?
- Out.

415
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,481
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

416
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,671
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

417
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,505
You'd better run!
She's our friend, and she's crazy!

418
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,506
<i>No, El, you're not the monster.</i>

419
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,715
You saved me, you understand?
You saved me.

420
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,433
<i>Compromise?</i>

421
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,978
<i>It's something that's kind of
in between. Like halfway happy.</i>

422
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:17,396
<i>Once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice. Real nice.</i>

423
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,192
This is your new home.

424
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,089
That's where I was.
It's a damn graveyard.

425
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,964
I need to get through!
I need to get through!

426
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,765
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I need to warn them. It's a trap!

427
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,845
I need to get through. It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.

428
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,931
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

429
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,100
Mike!

430
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,151
Mike! Mike!

431
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,230
Mike! Mike, where are you?

432
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,816
Mike! Mike!

433
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,118
Go, go, go!

434
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,385
Let's go.

435
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,837
Don't move!

436
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,678
- The hell's going on?
- They found us!

437
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,384
- Jesus! Jesus Christ!
- No, no, no.

438
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,685
Shh...

439
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,276
- Spread left.
- Right.

440
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,059
Let's go! Now!

441
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,885
- Hey! Hey!
- Jane, come on!

442
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,521
Come on, hurry!

443
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,773
Look out! Look out!

444
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,817
Get down! Get down!

445
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,910
Do something, Kal.
Do something!

446
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,851
Jane, get in.

447
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,517
It's a damn graveyard.

448
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,476
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

449
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,484
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I have to go back.

450
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,991
My friends... My friends are in danger.

451
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,070
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now!

452
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,952
Your mother sent you here
for a reason, remember?

453
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,455
We belong together.

454
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,288
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.

455
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,132
No.

456
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,760
But I can save them.

457
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,842
Jane. Jane!

458
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,310
Jane!

459
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,682
Jane!

460
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,286
The hell was that? What's wrong with her?

461
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,806
You all right, sweetie?

462
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,776
You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you?

463
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,367
Hmm.

464
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,199
You are awfully young
to be traveling alone, aren't you?

465
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,041
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

466
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,711
So, where are you headed?

467
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,840
To your parents, I hope?

468
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,471
I'm going to my friends.

469
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,105
I'm going home.

470
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:15,129
