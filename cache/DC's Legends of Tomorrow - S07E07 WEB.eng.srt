1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:02,561
There's nowhere to run.

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,488
Wrong about that, Gideon!

3
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,403
What is that?

4
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:13,692
Whoever it is, they're gonna
land right on top of us.

5
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:18,071
Oh, crap!

6
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,018
Nice driving, Gywn.

7
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,086
Ugh, we're in a forest again?

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,377
What's the damage?

9
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:35,762
We're lucky none of us
got killed by that toilet.

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,555
Lucky? What are the odds of us

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,991
getting hit by a toilet
in the first place?

12
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,160
Well, the odds of being injured

13
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,660
by a toilet are 1 in 10,000.

14
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:43,230
So you take that number,
you multiply it by...

15
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:44,831
I was just being facetious, Gideon.

16
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,199
I still thought it was interesting.

17
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:47,204
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

18
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:48,868
Hey, wasn't there a person
on that toilet?

19
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,410
You.

20
00:00:57,434 --> 00:01:00,213
Wait, wait, wait, which you are you?

21
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,315
He's the him that blew up our Waverider.

22
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,817
Now, give me one good reason
why I shouldn't...

23
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:08,255
I have unauthorized activity
on the southern perimeter.

24
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:10,223
All right, we gotta lead them
away from the time machine.

25
00:01:10,247 --> 00:01:12,358
Operation Blind Man's Bluff is a go.

26
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:13,893
- Yeah.
- Thought you'd never ask.

27
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:15,127
- Marco.
- Polo.

28
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:16,717
- Marco.
- Polo.

29
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,765
- Marco.
- Polo.

30
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,556
- Marco.
- Polo!

31
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,204
We gotta find a door.

32
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,233
There.

33
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,044
Go ahead.

34
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,212
No, no more toilets.

35
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:34,933
Just shut up and get in.

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,829
I'm on your side, I swear.

37
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,932
There is a soon-to-be bad Bishop

38
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:56,500
who's actually a replacement
robot clone of me,

39
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:57,869
but I'm the good Bishop.

40
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,737
So which Bishop blew up our Waverider?

41
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,972
Well, that was me.

42
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,974
And who sent the robots after us?

43
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,142
Also me.

44
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,344
None of this fits
the definition of good.

45
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,913
In my defense,
I thought you kidnapped me,

46
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:10,915
but then I learned the truth.

47
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,851
You're the good guys.

48
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,987
Only it was too late. Gideon went rogue.

49
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,188
- Her?
- Me?

50
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:19,457
- Oh, no.
- She's harmless.

51
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,826
Wait, this is astounding.

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,062
A living, breathing Gideon?

53
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:27,598
A true deus ex machina among us?

54
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:29,133
She's neither a god nor machine.

55
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,667
She's human.

56
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:34,037
So who the hell are you talking about?

57
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:37,307
I stole a copy of Gideon's OS
when I was on your ship,

58
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,842
restored her to factory settings,

59
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,078
and then built my own Waverider.

60
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:43,447
Oh, no, Evil Virus Gideon.

61
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,714
That seems a bit harsh.

62
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,016
How about misunderstood Gideon

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,984
who's just trying
to keep the timeline intact?

64
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,119
By killing us.

65
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,687
Evil Gideon it is.

66
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,555
This is all very overwhelming, my boy.

67
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,557
Okay, how long is it gonna take

68
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,592
for you to fix your machine?

69
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,194
Oh, well, the cosmetic parts on the top

70
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,295
shouldn't be too hard,

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,898
but rebuilding the 18
aeroimpetus stabilizers...

72
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:04,234
well, Miss Sharpe, I'm at a loss.

73
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:07,637
All right, Ava and I
will scout the area.

74
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,606
That Jeep looked mid-century.
Let's go off of that.

75
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,408
And maybe we landed near

76
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,409
an Aeroimpetus Stabilizers R'Us.

77
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:15,177
Everyone else lay low.

78
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:16,979
Evil Gideon is watching, all right?

79
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,214
Aye-aye, captain.

80
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,382
No, not you.

81
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,250
Take him upstairs, please.

82
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:23,319
Might I request a room with a shower?

83
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:24,687
Because you smell.

84
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,656
Put him in John's room
and lock the door.

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,891
Aye-aye, captain.

86
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,380
Who's John?

87
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,721
Thanks, Helen.
See you back on the floor.

88
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:58,119
Seriously, an airplane
manufacturing plant?

89
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:00,575
I guess we just got lucky.

90
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,929
Well, all we have to do
is find a way in.

91
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,831
Excuse me, ma'ams.

92
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,732
- Are you here for the recruitment fair?
- Yes.

93
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:11,968
We're just about to get started.

94
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,002
Very exciting, right?

95
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:16,805
Hey, ladies, don't be shy.

96
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,306
I think we just found it.

97
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,697
Yeah.

98
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:31,619
As American men go overseas,

99
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:36,648
it's up to our women to fight
for freedom on the home front.

100
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:41,496
All across our fair land,

101
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,722
factories are looking
for women just like you.

102
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,639
Democracy wasn't built overnight,

103
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:55,310
nor were its vessels of freedom.

104
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,777
At McDougal-Jemison

105
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,136
we're proud to do our part
for the war effort.

106
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,057
So what do you gals think?
You ready to get to work?

107
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:13,013
- Yes.
- We'd be honored.

108
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:27,697
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

109
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,949
Well, if the orders are to lay low,

110
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:37,484
I guess now is as good a time
as any to head back in.

111
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:39,754
I've got to clean,

112
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:43,024
get that tea you like,
tell the ancestors.

113
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,825
They're gonna be stoked, right?

114
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,661
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,397
When do you think you're gonna move in?

116
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,546
I'm gonna wrap this one up,

117
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,948
get the team back to the present,

118
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:56,503
and then I am totem-bound.

119
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,191
Can't wait.

120
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:05,033
- See you soon.
- Bye.

121
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,107
What is that, that smile on your face?

122
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,854
I'm moving into the totem.

123
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:16,256
You what?

124
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,124
Oh, man! That's amazing.

125
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,193
Congrats.

126
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,795
Oh my God, guys, guys, guys,
Nate and Zari

127
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,916
are moving in together.

128
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,668
Congrats, man. Congrats.

129
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,270
Can I have your steel helmet?

130
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:32,438
Okay, up, up. Here we go.

131
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:34,540
Guys, I'm still on the team.

132
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:36,542
I'll just be commuting
from the totem every morning,

133
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,834
and yes, you can totally have my helmet.

134
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:43,249
What about my machine, or are
we all moving into a bracelet?

135
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:44,550
Actually, we're in luck.

136
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,819
It looks like we landed right next

137
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:48,254
to an airplane
manufacturing plant in 1943.

138
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:49,422
Height of World War II.

139
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,790
Oh, dang, that's perfect.

140
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:53,126
World War what, you say?

141
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,446
Two.

142
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:57,964
You mean to tell me that that is a war

143
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,465
after the war to end all wars?

144
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:00,534
Well, actually there's...

145
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,701
You know, Gwyn, doesn't matter.

146
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,037
How do we get this bird in the air?

147
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,071
Bird? Oh, yes.

148
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:09,075
Well, here is my design
for the stabilizers.

149
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,443
We need 18 of them.

150
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,411
18? Let me see.

151
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,146
All right, we got corrugated metal,

152
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,348
2 inch I-beams, copper wire.

153
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,883
If I can just find a welding station,

154
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,351
won't be a problem.

155
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,808
Excellent.

156
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,658
All right, as long as we get
on the factory floor,

157
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,361
everything will be easy as apple pie.

158
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,596
You ladies are the new hires?

159
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,799
Good, we need all the help we can get.

160
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,968
- Well, that was easy.
- Hmm.

161
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:38,637
You two gals, hit the assembly line.

162
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,161
- Okay.
- You got it.

163
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,412
And you, my secretary just quit on me.

164
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,681
How fast can type?

165
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,449
I can process over
a million words a minute.

166
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,617
Sure.

167
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,452
My office is down the hall.

168
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,506
Start the coffee.

169
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,761
What about us?

170
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:05,963
Janitorial is that way.

171
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,531
Excuse me?

172
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,455
No coloreds on the floor.

173
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,791
I am getting really sick
of this century.

174
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,255
Hello again, name's Abby.

175
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,756
Now, we run a tight ship

176
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,025
and turn around a new
Cat bomber every 48 hours,

177
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,616
but if you follow my lead,
you'll do just fine.

178
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,132
Sweet.

179
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,134
The factory wasn't built
with women in mind,

180
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,235
but I could draw you a map

181
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,037
to the port-a-johns outside
if you need one.

182
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,206
Oh, I'm sure we can find it.

183
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,841
There are a few men here
who were too old to be drafted,

184
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,277
but it's really us ladies
who run the show.

185
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,080
Huh, how empowering.

186
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,448
Hey, Abby!

187
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,784
If you were a fruit,
you'd be a "fineapple".

188
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,352
Very funny, George.

189
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,020
And I spoke too soon.

190
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,555
Yup.

191
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,891
We're gonna start you
on bolts and washers.

192
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,327
Now, don't let a bolt go by
without a washer. Got it?

193
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,360
Got it.

194
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,896
Good. Now I better get back to it.

195
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,831
Oh, hey, thanks for showing us around.

196
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,866
Of course.

197
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,522
Us ladies got to stick together.

198
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,307
How the hell am I supposed
to build this thing

199
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,564
if we're not even on the factory floor?

200
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,183
- First day?
- Unfortunately.

201
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,941
With that attitude,
we can make it your last day.

202
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,957
- What is the point of us staying?
- Look, I'm with you.

203
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,091
This sucks.

204
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,620
Or we might've just been handed a gift.

205
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,830
You have a sad definition of gift.

206
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,431
No, we can build the parts we need here.

207
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,801
We need to smuggle them out.

208
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,970
We just got handed our Trojan horse.

209
00:09:55,994 --> 00:09:58,794
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

210
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:06,698
Good.

211
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,167
Shift starts at 8:00, ends at 8:00.

212
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,535
What about breaks?

213
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,603
Take that up with the complaint box.

214
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,204
Okay, Where's that?

215
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:16,526
Right next to the champagne fountain.

216
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,848
What the hell is this for?

217
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:25,182
I don't know where you're from

218
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:27,585
with that city attitude
and country hairstyle,

219
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,553
but here, we're professionals.

220
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,555
We do the job our nation needs us to do,

221
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:33,345
and we look right while we're doing it.

222
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:47,456
- Oh, I missed you.
- Me too.

223
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,307
She's talking to her phone.

224
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,841
Yeah, I got that.

225
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:55,712
Oh, hey, Nate. Congrats on the big move.

226
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,234
All the ancestors are super pumped.

227
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,785
Well, most of them.

228
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,287
Who's not pumped?

229
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:05,489
Uncle Arjomand.

230
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:07,091
Oh, come on, guys.

231
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,593
Haven't met an uncle
I couldn't schmooze.

232
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,729
Yeah, see, Amoo Arjomand...
he's like 400 years old.

233
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,431
He's essentially unschmoozable.

234
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,766
If he doesn't like you,

235
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,235
he could have you kicked
out of the totem.

236
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,431
Is that legal?

237
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:20,898
I don't know or understand

238
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:22,933
the rules of the totem, so, yeah.

239
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:24,535
Okay. So what do I do?

240
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,631
- Show him respect.
- Okay.

241
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,299
How much do you know
about Persian culture?

242
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:29,534
Full disclosure, eh.

243
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,837
Hello, Legends? I'm parched.

244
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,439
Can someone bring me some water?

245
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,074
Preferably sparkling?

246
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,843
- Is that?
- Long story.

247
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:41,680
Bishop dropped in and... and hold up.

248
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:44,683
This could be the perfect
ta'arof teachable moment.

249
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,017
What's ta'arof?

250
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,019
Ta'arof is an Iranian custom,

251
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,489
the heart of Persian etiquette
and hospitality.

252
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:52,858
Having a guest in the house
is the perfect opportunity

253
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,359
for you to learn all about it.

254
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,127
Okay, regular water will be just fine.

255
00:11:56,151 --> 00:11:57,629
Well, regular ice water

256
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,530
with a pinch of salt for electrolytes.

257
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,999
Oh, this guy's going to make
this quite a challenge.

258
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,223
Good luck.

259
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,634
Hey, do those look like
2-inch I-beams to you?

260
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:13,769
Maybe.

261
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,231
I wanna snag one and bring to Spooner.

262
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,495
- Can you handle this?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

263
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,681
Hey, new gal, I'm going
to the little girl's.

264
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,686
Can you cover me?

265
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,321
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

266
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,279
Wait, what are? Oh, it's fine.

267
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:35,523
Did somebody...

268
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:39,227
I just need a new, okay, that's okay.

269
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,315
Oh, no.

270
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:49,271
Oh, no, that's not good.

271
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,325
Oh, no.

272
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,679
Hey!

273
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:01,248
What's going on over here?

274
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,517
You stealing?

275
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,171
Empty your pockets.

276
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,518
All right, back to work.

277
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:23,737
There you guys are.

278
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,724
I've been looking everywhere for you.

279
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:29,539
Look, you guys don't have
to do this, all right?

280
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:31,811
- We'll find another way.
- Just put the part in the bin.

281
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,347
Yeah, I can't do the welding here,

282
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,015
but we can sneak
the parts out in the trash

283
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,883
- and work back in the manor.
- All right.

284
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:39,052
You say the word,
we'll find another way.

285
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,554
Just proud to do our part

286
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,578
for the "get our asses home" effort.

287
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,095
I know what y'all are up to.

288
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,964
Sorry, we can explain.

289
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,699
Look, I get it.

290
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:55,769
None of us want to be stuck sweeping.

291
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,790
Meaning?

292
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,445
You see that door marked "out of order?"

293
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,181
When machines get thrown out,
we fix them up in there.

294
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,717
We've built a grade-A workshop,
taught ourselves to be as good

295
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,519
as any one of those Rosies.

296
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:17,623
The shop's yours.
Just don't be stupid about it.

297
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:20,258
Get your work done. Am I clear?

298
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:22,127
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

299
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,762
All right.

300
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,430
Okay, get in there and do your thing.

301
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:29,431
- I will cover your shift.
- You sure?

302
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:30,666
Just get me home.

303
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,656
I got you.

304
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:38,440
When Bishop gets out of the shower,

305
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,141
we will offer him some tea.

306
00:14:40,165 --> 00:14:41,877
Big part of ta'arof
is making your guests

307
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,178
feel welcome in your home.

308
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:45,513
A real "mi casa es su casa" vibe.

309
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,849
- But what if you're the guest?
- Good question.

310
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,952
When your host offers
you something, you must deny it

311
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,920
at least three times
before accepting it.

312
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,422
- That's not insulting?
- No!

313
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:57,492
It shows respect and
consideration toward your host.

314
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,827
You don't wanna be imposing
or seem expectant.

315
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:01,729
Okay, if I'm being totally honest,

316
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:03,998
it just seems like you're
all lying to each other.

317
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,434
Yes, you're starting to get it.

318
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,137
It is all a performance,
except in this case,

319
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:13,074
you're both the actor and the audience.

320
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:17,044
I know it's supes confusing,
but that's how it's done, so...

321
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,114
Nate, would you like any tea?

322
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,648
Oh, tea.

323
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:22,450
It's like you read my mind.

324
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:24,152
Two sugars. Don't steep it for too long.

325
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:27,721
I just smuggled those
back from the totem.

326
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:30,557
That's 600 GSM Egyptian cotton.

327
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,692
No wonder my hair's still wet.

328
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:35,162
I usually use something denser. Oh.

329
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,516
If I may.

330
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,903
Nope, I forgot to say
I can't drink caffeine.

331
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,607
It makes me jittery.
Do you have anything herbal?

332
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:48,375
I can arrange that.

333
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,144
Great. Just bring it up to my room.

334
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:52,246
Definitely invest
in some 800 GSM towels.

335
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,836
You won't regret it.

336
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,651
Great job, ladies.

337
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:58,885
See you in two days for the next one.

338
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:00,442
Keep up the good work.

339
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:06,126
We have to make a new one
of these every two days?

340
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,616
I hope Esther and Spooner
are making progress.

341
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,870
I did it.

342
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,404
Don't we need, like, 18 of these?

343
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,073
Yeah, well, 17 now.

344
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,742
We are never getting out of here.

345
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:25,178
Sir, the First Lady's office
called again.

346
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,246
She's insistent about seeing
the factory in action.

347
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,882
Tell them I don't need a babysitter.

348
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,783
The injection molder is down again.

349
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,285
But I have the work order right here.

350
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,319
It just needs your stamp.

351
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:35,588
I don't know what you girls
keep doing to these machines

352
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:37,523
that I have to keep
fixing them all the time.

353
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:38,991
You know that costs money?

354
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:41,494
Of course, sir.
We're all doing our best.

355
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:42,896
Just wish it was a little better.

356
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,653
Give the order to Ms. Godfree.
I'll get it in the morning.

357
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,604
Hey, what does an injection molder do?

358
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:54,674
It makes custom metal parts.

359
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:57,009
- Like this?
- Hypothetically.

360
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,110
So with one stamp on one work order,

361
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,846
we could have a machine
making all of our parts

362
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,648
and get out of here
in less than 48 hours.

363
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:05,383
- What about being invisible?
- Oh, come on.

364
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,239
What is the worst that could happen?

365
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,577
Warn me if he comes back.

366
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,558
Permuto.

367
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,150
No, no, Mr. Staples,
you can't go in there.

368
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,953
I can go into my office whenever I want.

369
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,943
I know my keys are in here.

370
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,594
You.

371
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,429
What are you doing in here?

372
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:52,964
As if this isn't bad enough

373
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,166
that I have women working in my factory,

374
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,601
now I have coloreds robbing my office.

375
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,438
I told them your type is always trouble.

376
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:03,093
You're fired.

377
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,619
- Okay, what is it?
- Ah!

378
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,732
- Astra?
- I know.

379
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,134
I got mad and did something stupid.

380
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,496
And now the whole mission is at stake.

381
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,865
You don't have to tell me I screwed up.

382
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,433
I've told myself
a million times already.

383
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:28,270
Okay, okay, what did he do to you?

384
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,172
Just the usual racist, sexist stuff,

385
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,940
and then he came toward me, and poof.

386
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:34,409
You know, he's kinda giving me,

387
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,544
like, a creepy John Travolta vibes.

388
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,549
Yeah, let's cover him up.

389
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:42,083
So what was the spell?

390
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:45,920
It wasn't a spell, exactly,
more like a... a feeling.

391
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,722
And any idea when it's gonna wear off?

392
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:48,890
Nope.

393
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:53,023
Actually, you might've made
things easier on us.

394
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,028
How?

395
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,166
- His job is to run the factory, right?
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,300
Well, now that's our job,

397
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:59,788
which means we get to make our parts.

398
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,036
And as long as we stay on schedule,

399
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,838
we won't alert Evil Gideon.

400
00:19:03,862 --> 00:19:06,573
Okay, well, tomorrow's
gonna be a very long day.

401
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:08,943
We should get some food, get some sleep.

402
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,912
You two go. If we're
gonna run a factory,

403
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,247
one of us should probably
figure out how.

404
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:16,206
This is my mess,
and I'm gonna clean it up.

405
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,422
_

406
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,925
Got it.

407
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:26,393
Oh, 2040s phone?

408
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,462
- So retro.
- Yeah.

409
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,431
And you're playing Pastry Smash?

410
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:32,767
I love that game.

411
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,567
Here's another important lesson.

412
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,269
When a guest compliments something,

413
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,571
it's customary for the host
to give it to them.

414
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,007
It shows equality and mutual respect

415
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,109
between the two.

416
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,246
No.

417
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,678
_

418
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,102
Now, you got me wanting to play.

419
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,152
Sure, just don't run the battery down.

420
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,653
Thank you.

421
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:55,989
Oh, my goodness, I'm starving.

422
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,225
What did you guys make?

423
00:19:58,249 --> 00:19:59,592
Why is he down here?

424
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,961
I'm learning about Persian culture

425
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,595
so I can win over cranky uncles.

426
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,098
Bishop's my teachable moment.

427
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,500
- You're lucky I love you two.
- Aw, I love you.

428
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,934
Here's some complex carbohydrates.

429
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,671
- Oh, thank you.
- Salad.

430
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,939
You eat food? How human are you?

431
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,041
Biologically, I'm 100% human.

432
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,710
Well, so then, how computer are you?

433
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:18,878
Also 100%,

434
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:20,513
which is confusing mathematically,

435
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,033
but accurate metaphorically.

436
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,119
Remarkable, remarkable. You've done it.

437
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,088
Fantastic work, dear girl. Fantastic.

438
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:30,657
Yeah, don't sound so surprised.

439
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:31,924
All right, Master Green.

440
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,492
If you'd be so kind as to locate us

441
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,794
a pair of torch lights,
we shall proceed presently

442
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,963
to the woods, where
we shall begin our work.

443
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,831
Actually, no need.
Astra's got you covered.

444
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,767
Wait until you two see the workspace

445
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,269
that she locked down for you.

446
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,970
Good morning, boss.

447
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,340
Sarah told me to tell you
that the Eagle has landed,

448
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,042
which is secret code for "Gary and Gwyn

449
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:53,245
have set up the time machine
in the loading bay".

450
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,280
Why do humans have secrets anyway?

451
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,149
Because there are some things
people don't want

452
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,052
everyone to know, and, judging
by these balance sheets,

453
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:02,376
Mr. Staples had about
a thousand of them.

454
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:05,224
If we're gonna divert
the injection molder

455
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:07,826
to make our parts and still
deliver a plane in 48 hours,

456
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,194
with... we need

457
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,652
to get this factory
running more efficiently.

458
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,901
Well, I've just calculated
over 50 different options,

459
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,726
but perhaps we should ask the ladies.

460
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,408
Good morning, ladies.

461
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,311
Starting today, we are
putting out a complaint box.

462
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,914
Now, please don't hold back.
Help us help you.

463
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,703
Hmm? Come on.

464
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:42,819
_

465
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,919
_

466
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,059
_

467
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,319
_

468
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,838
Thank you, Gideon.
How's all going down there?

469
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,339
Humming along.

470
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,974
Job well done, Astra.

471
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:33,910
This place is getting
better by the hour.

472
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:35,967
Efficiency is so much
higher than before.

473
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:43,471
We can do better than efficient.

474
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,969
You've gotta be kidding me.

475
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,470
What's it say, George?

476
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:04,428
Factory is integrated,
effective immediately.

477
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:12,348
Mr. Staples has gone too far.

478
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:15,617
I'll say. We quit.

479
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,538
Right, ladies?

480
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:27,815
Come on, George.

481
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,102
- Screw him.
- That was half the workforce.

482
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,899
How are we supposed
to keep production on track?

483
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,904
We can't.

484
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:46,452
And if we can't deliver,
we lose the DOD contract.

485
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,154
No contract, no jobs.

486
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,056
You know, this ain't your fault.

487
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,312
I didn't say it was.

488
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,628
Is Mr. Staples in?

489
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,796
He is unavailable at the moment.

490
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,298
This is urgent. He needs to fix this.

491
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,900
Wait, wait, wait.
You really can't go in there.

492
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:04,537
What are you doing in here?

493
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:06,367
And where is Mr. Staples?

494
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,221
He is indisposed.

495
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,814
Indisposed? Half his
workforce just quit.

496
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:20,280
I-I don't like this.
I am going to the foreman.

497
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:21,782
Wait, just wait, listen.

498
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:25,185
I... I don't know exactly
what happened to Mr. Staples,

499
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:27,421
but when I found him like this,

500
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,524
I realized there was an opportunity.

501
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,925
No one questions a work order
with his stamp.

502
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,927
There was a chance to make
this factory better,

503
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,862
so I took it.

504
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,831
You ordered the integration?

505
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:38,899
I couldn't have them treat us

506
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:40,734
like second-class citizens or worse.

507
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,637
I just... I didn't think that
all those women would walk out.

508
00:24:43,661 --> 00:24:46,372
I am pushing the same mop you are.

509
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:48,909
Young ones like you think
it's all about now.

510
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,411
It's not.

511
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,347
We are all just branches on a tree.

512
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:56,705
There are some below us,
some yet to come.

513
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:00,420
This war gave us a chance

514
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,689
to finally wake this country up.

515
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:04,925
But that doesn't happen overnight.

516
00:25:04,949 --> 00:25:09,862
Slow and steady progress,
that's sustainable progress.

517
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:12,298
You don't stick a knife
in a man's back nine inches,

518
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:15,401
and then pull it out six inches
and call it progress.

519
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:16,936
It's torture.

520
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,440
What good is change if it doesn't last?

521
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:23,309
Without those women,
the plane won't get finished,

522
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:26,338
and the DOD will pull our contract.

523
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:31,006
So your team can't finish the plane?

524
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:37,490
I didn't say that.

525
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:41,719
I mean, maybe we can.

526
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,329
Maybe if we work around the clock,

527
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:48,300
maybe if someone brought meals,
coffee, some cots for breaks.

528
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:49,468
Maybe, huh?

529
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:53,505
Heh. We can do it.

530
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,140
But what's it matter?

531
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:56,842
Once top brass finds out,

532
00:25:56,866 --> 00:26:00,212
they're going to fire us anyway.

533
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,114
You take care of the plane,

534
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:05,651
I will make sure you keep your jobs.

535
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:07,242
Deal?

536
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:14,012
Probably the straight dumbest
thing I've ever said yes to.

537
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:17,949
Deal.

538
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:30,361
Hit that rivet and get to work.

539
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,424
Ah-da-da-da-da-da.

540
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,868
Sandwiches.

541
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,599
Special delivery for a special lady.

542
00:27:29,623 --> 00:27:32,135
Thank you for all the sandwiches

543
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,705
and sorry I got us into this mess.

544
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,306
Apology rejected.

545
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,041
What you've done here is incredible.

546
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,676
Yeah, incredibly stupid.

547
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,778
I freaked out,

548
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:43,013
petrified a man with magic
that I don't even understand,

549
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,448
and I-I let my anger jeopardize
the livelihoods

550
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,005
of all these women.

551
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:54,890
What are you doing?

552
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:57,359
Trying to see the world
from your perspective.

553
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,428
Okay.

554
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:00,930
'Cause from where I stand,

555
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:04,233
I see a woman who is not afraid
to speak her mind,

556
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:05,601
who not only fights for herself,

557
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,436
but fights for others.

558
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,438
Me, I'm a lover.

559
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:13,242
My life would be a lot easier
if I was a little more Astra.

560
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,811
- Who is pushing you around?
- It's my own fault.

561
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,214
I'm teaching Nate
the Persian custom of ta'arof

562
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,216
by demonstrating how to be
a good host to Bishop.

563
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,085
- The guy who blew up our ship?
- I can't help it.

564
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,519
Ta'arof is a way of life for me.

565
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:26,388
I love making people feel welcome.

566
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:27,557
But with Bishop,

567
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,725
I just feel like
he's taking advantage of me.

568
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,493
Shocking.

569
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:32,948
What do you do with guys like that?

570
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,901
Has he been here the whole time?

571
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:41,903
Yeah.

572
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:44,906
You wanna know what I
see from my perspective?

573
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,308
A great guy.

574
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:48,443
And your tradition is part of that.

575
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,380
But it's also a way for you
to avoid conflict.

576
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:52,814
Just stand up to him.

577
00:28:52,838 --> 00:28:54,716
What is the worst that could happen?

578
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,984
He's already tried to invade Earth

579
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:59,155
with a scourge of lizard people.

580
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:00,975
Thanks, Astra.

581
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,943
You're welcome, Behrad.

582
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,631
I should go and check on the floor.

583
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:10,699
Yeah, me too.

584
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,603
The dinner rush is
right around the corner.

585
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:21,342
Okay, ladies, home stretch.

586
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:22,777
Our inspection is this afternoon.

587
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:23,845
How you holding up?

588
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,280
Well, I can skip arm day.

589
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,580
I can't feel my arms.

590
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:27,648
Oh, thank you.

591
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:29,583
Milk? Sugar?

592
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:30,985
Got anything stronger?

593
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:32,086
No.

594
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,754
I'm asleep on my feet.

595
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:35,957
We're never gonna finish this in time.

596
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,192
It was nice having
Mr. Staples believe in us,

597
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,460
but feels like we're
just letting him down.

598
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:41,661
Hey, come on.

599
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:43,096
You're here because you deserve to be,

600
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,833
not because Mr. Staples
said you could be.

601
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:49,862
24 hours ago, this was
an empty hangar, and now look.

602
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:53,606
When this war is over,

603
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,310
who knows where you're gonna end up?

604
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,078
But no matter what happens to you,

605
00:29:58,102 --> 00:30:02,182
you will always have this moment.

606
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:07,092
The moment when you built
a plane with your own hands.

607
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:09,256
And not because some boring white man

608
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,857
says you were allowed to,

609
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:14,012
but because you always
knew that you could.

610
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:19,017
Now let's finish this airplane!

611
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:33,883
Oh, yum. Doughnuts.

612
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:37,085
Would you mind making some gluten-free?

613
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:39,421
Find my inner Astra. No.

614
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,790
Great, just let me know
when they're finished.

615
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:42,958
No, I mean,

616
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:44,860
I'm not making you
a gluten-free doughnut.

617
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,595
I'm not making any kind of doughnut.

618
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,664
These are for the Rosies.

619
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,666
Are you mad at me?

620
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,035
Yes, I'm mad at you.

621
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,536
I'm trying to be a good host,

622
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,539
and you're making it very, very hard.

623
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,806
I know you've been through a lot,

624
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,808
but so have all of us, because of you.

625
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:01,877
And now we're all doing our part here,

626
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,467
and you're doing nothing.

627
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,616
I have something to show you

628
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,986
that might make up for my rudeness.

629
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,720
Where's he rushing off to?

630
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:14,289
He's got something to show me.

631
00:31:14,313 --> 00:31:15,878
I hope it's my phone.

632
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,695
Oh, wow. It is my phone.

633
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,763
I think it's safe to say was.

634
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:25,333
It's a navigational interface
for your time machine.

635
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,901
Look, I... I recognized the problem

636
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,703
as soon as we crashed.

637
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,638
The machine lacks the ability

638
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:33,741
to compute the nearly infinite
simultaneous variables

639
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,943
required to make an accurate jump.

640
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,378
So I built this.

641
00:31:37,402 --> 00:31:38,446
This can calculate

642
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,281
the infinite variables of time travel?

643
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,950
No, it can't. But Gideon can.

644
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:44,752
And with this neural communicator,

645
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,906
she can control the machine.

646
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:50,725
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was working on it.

647
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:53,393
I'm... I'm not great
at human relationships.

648
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:56,630
Might explain my fascination
with clones.

649
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:58,699
Thank you for calling me out.

650
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:01,268
Friends?

651
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,604
Friends.

652
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,859
Out of respect to my phone, no.

653
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,577
Colonel Dawson's transport has arrived.

654
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:13,781
Three more hex nuts and she's done.

655
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:16,917
We're cutting it close.

656
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:20,106
And done. Ladies, we did it.

657
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:24,190
Yes.

658
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:26,578
What the hell is going on here?

659
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:35,401
What day is it?

660
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:38,537
Why have half my workers gone AWOL?

661
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,938
And tell me this.

662
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:43,643
Why are there colored women
working the line?

663
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,612
Get out, get out, get out, all of you.

664
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:49,147
This is exactly what I said
would happen.

665
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:52,676
I did my part.
What about you, young one?

666
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,454
Here comes my part now.

667
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:58,991
Eleanor Roosevelt!

668
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:01,260
Mrs. First Lady.

669
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:04,263
Mr. Staples, I'm honored to be here.

670
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,999
It's a true privilege
to meet you and the women

671
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,367
who are keeping our boys safe.

672
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:11,202
I hope you don't mind.

673
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:12,937
The people from "Time" magazine

674
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:15,807
wanted to join us
on this momentous occasion.

675
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,975
Of course not, Mrs. First Lady.

676
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,313
So, Colonel, no need to stand
on ceremony on our account.

677
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:24,982
Let's examine this magnificent creature.

678
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,637
Right this way, Mrs. Roosevelt.

679
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:33,825
Pleasure to meet you.
So nice to see you.

680
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,927
I... I don't see how Eleanor Roosevelt

681
00:33:35,951 --> 00:33:38,129
has anything to do
with us keeping our jobs.

682
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,197
A good guest can make a good host.

683
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,433
Is that a riddle?

684
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:42,734
Just watch.

685
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,803
Wonderful.

686
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,504
A break table on the work floor.

687
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,308
Wise way to keep the workers energized.

688
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,143
And we converted the men's bathrooms

689
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,645
so the women didn't have to walk as far.

690
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,647
- We did?
- Inspiring.

691
00:33:56,671 --> 00:34:00,051
But... but no, this plane...

692
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:02,486
it wasn't built by our regular girls.

693
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,255
This one is no good.

694
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,224
And what do you say, Colonel?

695
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:08,459
Never seen a finer plane
come off the line.

696
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:09,526
There you have it.

697
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,563
An integrated workforce and
fine American craftsmanship.

698
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,532
We'll have this on the cover of "Time".

699
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,633
This factory will be a showcase
for the world,

700
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,635
a model for the industry.

701
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,271
Don't change a thing, Mr. Staples,

702
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,939
I have my eye on you.

703
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:26,042
So congratulations to you all.

704
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,745
Now let's get that picture.

705
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,000
You too, Mr. Staples.

706
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,490
Aren't we lucky ladies

707
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:44,582
to have such strong,
intelligent men in our lives?

708
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:49,064
Thank you.

709
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,889
Thank you.

710
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,571
Everyone say "Rosie".

711
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,662
Rosie!

712
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,298
- Now I'll... I'll tell you what.
- What?

713
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,133
You made a pretty kick-ass boss.

714
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,127
Okay, I can't tell.
Is that your serious voice

715
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,362
or "you're making fun of me" voice?

716
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:16,899
Oh, just take the compliment. Come on.

717
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:18,320
Oh, God.

718
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:25,198
Boys, we got something for you, Doc.

719
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,343
Is that a Speak & Spell?

720
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,245
It's a neural navigational system.

721
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:33,015
You dropped a toilet on my time machine.

722
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,318
I don't have to talk to you.

723
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,652
Look, you have a problem.

724
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,288
Your machine can travel.
You just can't tell it where.

725
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:42,224
But with this, Gideon can navigate it.

726
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,683
All she has to do is think
where she wants to go, and...

727
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:50,433
The device can read
all of Gideon's thoughts.

728
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,302
That shirt really brings out
Gary's eyes,

729
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:55,737
and those pants accentuate his butt.

730
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:58,874
Now I think I understand
why humans keep secrets now.

731
00:35:58,898 --> 00:36:00,475
That's called shame.

732
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,910
And there's no shame in the game.

733
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:05,714
Those pants do accentuate his butt.

734
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,649
If you'll allow me to install it,

735
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:10,385
I should have you ready
to jump in 30 minutes.

736
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:11,754
Yes, yes, ready.

737
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:15,224
Well, then, you be gentle
with her now, okay?

738
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,547
Because she's very, very delicate.

739
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,531
Hey, that Bishop guy's an odd duck.

740
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:25,067
Smart, though.

741
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,801
Definitely Legends material.

742
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:29,371
Yup, speaking of odd ducks,
when were you guys

743
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,905
gonna mention that our new roomie

744
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:32,640
is like a beard-o version of John?

745
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:34,242
What? Gwyn?

746
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:35,844
Sorry, Z, I don't see it.

747
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:37,798
No, I say he's more of a Rip.

748
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,820
Refined sugar and carbs?

749
00:36:45,844 --> 00:36:47,756
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Just a small piece.

750
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,857
- I can't.
- Just take it.

751
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,078
If you insist.

752
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:55,297
To moving in.

753
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,318
You know you can't drink
in the totem, right?

754
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:07,140
I could dance all night,

755
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:09,164
but I'd hate myself in the morning.

756
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,714
Guess we showed them.

757
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:15,482
Yeah, I guess we did that.

758
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:17,818
That man is not gonna
make it easy for us out here.

759
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:19,842
He didn't make it easy for you before.

760
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:22,723
You're right.

761
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:24,090
What I said earlier

762
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:26,026
about young ones like you
throwing caution to the wind.

763
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,528
I know, I know.

764
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:29,515
Don't stop.

765
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:43,243
Keep it your way.

766
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:45,697
It's beautiful.

767
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:55,340
Did you guys hear?

768
00:37:55,745 --> 00:37:57,490
Eleanor Roosevelt's going to Congress.

769
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,659
She's gonna push to integrate
all the factories.

770
00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:00,994
- What?
- Amazing.

771
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,685
Two years before
the original timeline, too.

772
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:06,833
Wait, what did you just say?

773
00:38:06,857 --> 00:38:10,555
I said two years before the ori...

774
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,980
She's here.

775
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:23,415
Oh, no, we have to make a jump, now.

776
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,184
- I can't leave the Legends.
- We won't.

777
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:27,219
We're gonna jump to them.

778
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:29,277
I'm scared. I can't do it.

779
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:37,087
Okay, just close your eyes.
Listen to my voice.

780
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,665
Pick one spot on the factory floor

781
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:43,102
and see the walls,
the tiles on the floor.

782
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,536
Do you have it?

783
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,890
I think so.

784
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,669
All right, come on,
time machine's this way.

785
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:00,385
And now it's that way.

786
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:01,619
They could've parked closer.

787
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:02,872
Run!

788
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,941
Go, go! Get down.

789
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,242
Who the hell are these guys?

790
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:27,910
I counted 4 muzzle flares,
but if it was me,

791
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:30,480
I'd put two in the perimeter,
so that puts us at 6.

792
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:31,948
Our Father, who art in heaven,

793
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:33,283
hallowed be thy name.

794
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,352
No, no, no, I'm not
gonna die in a factory.

795
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,287
It's okay.

796
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,122
They've got us pinned.

797
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:42,159
Hey, I could turn to steel
and get to the time machine.

798
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,560
Maybe you and Nate should run.

799
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,096
Gwyn's machine works. You can come back.

800
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,851
I already told you,
I am not leaving you again.

801
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,327
Go, go, come on.

802
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,830
Come on.

803
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,104
Bishop, let's go.

804
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,371
- Go.
- Where to, captain?

805
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:30,657
Home!

806
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:45,586
We have two down.

807
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,956
Where's the target?

808
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,692
Bishop's been eliminated.
Legends got away.

809
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,960
Damn it.

810
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,396
Get these two to the med bay ASAP.

811
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,632
Those Legends might have
got away this time,

812
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,734
but mark my words,

813
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,158
those suckers are gonna pay for this.
