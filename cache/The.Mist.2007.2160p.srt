1
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Whoa!

2
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,200
All the food's gonna go bad.

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,100
Yeah, I drew up a list.

4
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,400
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

5
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
Fuck.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,700
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,399
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,700
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
see if they can extend my deadline.

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,300
What choice do they have?

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You kiddin'?

12
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,800
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

13
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,276
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

15
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Just stupid, I guess.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

17
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,076
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

18
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,576
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,120
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,399
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

21
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Order in some new glass.

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,860
Oh, you know what?
That was your...

23
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,400
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,200
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
It's just stuff, though.

26
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

27
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah.

28
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,700
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,576
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,699
But you gotta come look.

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,799
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,999
Billy.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,100
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,500
Whoa!

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Whoa.

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,099
- Whoa.
- Come on.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,099
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,700
Come on!

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

41
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,500
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
No.

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
- Norton's tree.
- Yeah.

45
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,200
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,499
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
That tree?

48
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,800
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Look at that.

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,300
What is it, Daddy?

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Mist.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,700
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,700
Coming off the mountain like that?

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,300
Two fronts meeting,

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,600
left over from the storm,
something like that.

56
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,100
You sure?

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,900
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
I'll take him to town with me.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
Okay. Where you going?

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,900
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,100
Hon.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,199
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,500
You know what he's gonna say.

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,699
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,200
Honey, one property dispute with
this guy is enough to last me a lifetime.

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,000
- Okay.
- That's all.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah.

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Ohh!
Mother fucker!

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,099
Aw, shit!

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,600
Ohh, you mother fucker!

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,000
Cock sucker!

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,199
"Turn on.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
"Full choke.

76
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,700
Pull five... choke."

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,600
I guess you've seen the...

78
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,199
boathouse.

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,500
Yeah, and...?

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,299
Nothin'.

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,600
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
That's all.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna <i>love</i> me.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,100
Oh.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Shit. The 1980.

86
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,100
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,700
I don't know, the weather was so beautiful coming
out of New York, I just... you know, top down.

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

89
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,100
Sincerely.

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,200
I hate to see it like that.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Okay, I'll tell you what,

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,500
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,100
- That okay?
- No problem.

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,500
So, uh, David...

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,600
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

97
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,100
Well, CMP's out in force.

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,700
Maybe we'll get our power back.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I know. Some storm, huh?

100
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,200
One for the books, yeah.

101
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,999
For a moment there last night,

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,499
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

103
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,600
WZON is off the air,

104
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,800
but Portland's still broadcasting.

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,800
- Daddy, look.
- Ah.

106
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,500
Guys from the base.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,700
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
The Arrowhead Project?

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,799
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,399
Missile defense research...

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

112
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,399
Oh, sure.

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,800
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

114
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,000
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

115
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Miss Tabloid.

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

118
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,000
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
You know, real reliable stuff.

120
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Well, they're in a hurry.

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Maybe their power's out too.

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
Huh. Still no signal.

123
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,900
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,500
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,300
Here's a list.

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,700
- Sure.
- Okay?

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Meet you guys in there.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,300
Hold hands.

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your sister.

132
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Those look <i>so</i> freaky!

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Hmm.

134
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,800
You guys look jammed up.

136
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

137
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,400
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,000
Only to keep the food cold.

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,000
Everything else, welcome to the Dark Ages,
and bring your checkbook.

140
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,800
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

141
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,000
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

142
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh, my God.

143
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,199
The storm.

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

145
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,600
Crappy day, huh?

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,000
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

148
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,700
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

149
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,000
but I guess we'll have to make do.

150
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,300
Hey, champ.

152
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,800
Your wife should be a doctor.

153
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,260
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

154
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,900
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,176
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay, done.

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,100
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

158
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,400
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

159
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Oh, I don't know.
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

160
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

161
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,499
I guess not.

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
Hey. And that's a start, huh?

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,900
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
The power outage got us too.

165
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,600
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

166
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

167
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,500
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,500
Yes, ma'am, those are $1.25.

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,700
I need some change on register five.

170
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Hello, Ms. Reppler.

172
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,900
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We had a tree come through the picture
window last night, right in my studio.

174
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,900
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,300
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Sorry to hear that.

177
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
How'd you guys make out?

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

179
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,040
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

180
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,800
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

181
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,800
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

182
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,300
but with funds being cut every year...

183
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,500
You'd think educating children would
be more of a priority in this country,

184
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
but you'd be wrong.

185
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

186
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,400
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,700
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

188
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

189
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,699
Check our papers.

192
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,699
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
I don't know why.

194
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,800
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

195
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
That's an order.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

198
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,200
Oh, my God!

199
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,999
Something in the mist!

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Something in the mist took John Lee!

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,800
Dan, catch your breath.

202
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,800
Something in the mist took John Lee.

203
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,600
I could hear him screaming.

204
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,600
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

205
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

206
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,899
Don't go out there.

207
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,199
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,700
Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
Mister, no!

210
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,500
Oh, shit.

211
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
Please hold me.

212
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,199
It's okay, it's okay.

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,300
It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

214
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,500
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

215
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,400
What is it?

216
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,100
What's going on?

217
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
It's death.

218
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Aah!

219
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,700
Stay down!

220
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
Daddy!

221
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,000
You all right? You okay?

222
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,700
That was an earthquake.

223
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,000
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

224
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,600
Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

225
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,900
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,900
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No.
No, don't go out there.

228
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

230
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,900
Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,999
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,476
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

233
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm sorry, I... I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,800
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

235
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

236
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,200
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

237
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,900
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
You're not listening!

239
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,600
I can't stay here.

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only eight.

241
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,000
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

242
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,900
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,400
She's only eight.

244
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,300
For their sakes, don't.

245
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

246
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Shh. It's okay, pal.

247
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Won't somebody here see a lady home?

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
You?

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You?

250
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,799
- It's okay, buddy.
- You?

251
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,100
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

252
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,799
I hope you all rot in hell.

253
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,100
Ma'am, please, wait until...

254
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

255
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

256
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,200
Aisle three has medical supplies.

257
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,099
It's okay. It's okay.

258
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,800
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

259
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Come on.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,699
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

261
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

262
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,800
Come on!

263
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,899
Come on, you're gonna hurt yourself.

264
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,200
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

265
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
All right, I know you want Mommy.

266
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,400
All right, just try to breathe.

267
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,700
Just try to breathe, okay?

268
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
It's all right.

270
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,599
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was two years old.

271
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
He's in shock.

272
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,200
I think we all are.

273
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,000
You haven't met.

274
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,599
Amanda Dunfrey.

275
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,800
She's new in town
as of this semester.

276
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,300
Teaches third grade

277
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,699
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

278
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

279
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,800
And David's an artist.

280
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,800
He does movie posters and such.

281
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
And me...

282
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

283
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,999
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,299
Boy settle down?

285
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
How is he?

286
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,999
Still hot.

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,799
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

288
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,499
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

289
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,099
Thanks.

290
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,600
How's Dan?

291
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
His nose stopped bleedin'.

292
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,900
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

293
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,300
Can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.

294
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,399
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

295
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

296
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

297
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,899
You bet. Sally, you mind?

298
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

299
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,700
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

300
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,900
Daddy, don't go.

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

302
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,000
Mrs. Reppler's here,

303
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
and so is Mrs. Turman.

304
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,600
I'll be close by, okay?

305
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,300
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

306
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
Let me look at you.

307
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Hmm?

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,099
Wanna lie down?

309
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,200
Yeah.

310
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,500
There you go.

311
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,200
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe <i>an d</i> free,

312
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,700
but we have to be smart about it.

313
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,500
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

314
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,900
and find out what's happened.

315
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,700
Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

316
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,400
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

317
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

318
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,200
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

319
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,420
would be their top priority.

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Jeez!

321
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh, <i>shit.</i>

322
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,000
Ow!

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Shit!

324
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,499
God <i>damn</i> it!

325
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Ow! Ow!

326
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,799
Bitch!

327
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
It's obvious that we're...

328
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,099
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

329
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,799
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

330
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,100
There ain't nothin'
<i>natural</i> about it either.

331
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
That's right.

332
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,900
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,500
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

334
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,100
Ohh, fuck, now.

335
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,800
You've done that to yourself
by a life of sin and dissolution.

336
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,800
Hey, whoa! David!

337
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,200
Hey, you guys hear that?

338
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,200
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

339
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,200
No, no, I turned the generator off.

340
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
It... it was backing up.

341
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,300
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

342
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,900
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,799
back there in the dark.

344
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,300
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

345
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,900
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,899
No, only after.

347
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,200
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

348
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,399
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

349
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,100
No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

350
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
You had a scare, no doubt.

351
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,700
What say we all go check it out? Here.

352
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,300
Oooopf!

353
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,499
Man.

354
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,600
It's pretty rank in here.

355
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,800
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

356
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,100
Go on, fire it up.

357
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,100
All right!

358
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,300
Shut it off!

359
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
Holy crow, don't that stink!

360
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Something's got the exhaust
vent plugged up from the outside.

361
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

362
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,199
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

363
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
No, no, you can't do that.

364
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,499
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

365
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

366
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,900
Okay, I'll do it.

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,900
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

368
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,999
What, don't you think I can do it?

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,700
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

370
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,299
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

371
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,900
- J-Jim, right?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Myron? You guys are...

373
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

374
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,300
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

375
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

376
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,300
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

377
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Like what?

378
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,700
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

379
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
Are you guys being willfully dense?

380
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,699
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

381
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,400
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I mean, we're not hearing
anything now, right? Anybody?

383
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
See?

384
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Now, I know, I know...
you're a big shot artist

385
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

386
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,076
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

387
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,499
Hey, I didn't say that.

388
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,800
Nor do I like being
talked down to or called stupid

389
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,100
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

391
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,599
The food'll keep without it.

392
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,099
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor, you raise the
door, and you yell out when you got enough room.

393
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Yeah. Okay, good.

394
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,500
Wait.

395
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
This is... you guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

396
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,399
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

397
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,876
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

398
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Norm!

399
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

400
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,500
The next time you got somethin' to say,
you count your teeth,

401
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,900
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
All right? Come on, Myron.

403
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,299
- This is crazy!
- Leave 'em be.

404
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

406
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,299
What's going on here?

407
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,276
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

408
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,200
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

409
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,299
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

410
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,899
- Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

411
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,300
Norm, come on.

412
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Don't, man.

413
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
It's a mistake.

414
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,700
Pussy.

415
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,300
Go up!

416
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,600
So...

417
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
any boogeymen?

418
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,599
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

419
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,700
Yeah, right.

420
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,000
Norm.

421
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,700
Norm!

422
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,100
What the fuck!

423
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,700
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

424
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,699
Get this friggin' thing off me!

425
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
Get it off! Help me!

426
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,300
Help me! Help me!

427
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Aah! Aaahhh!

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,100
Jesus!

429
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
There's more! There's more!

430
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,600
Somebody help me.

431
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,100
Somebody help me.

432
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,900
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

433
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,700
Aaahhhh!

434
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,700
Hang on!

435
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Aaahhhh!

436
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

437
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,400
Aaahhhh!

438
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Oh, Jesus!

439
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,300
Aah!

440
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,800
Aah!

441
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,600
Shit! Oh, shit!

442
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh, shit!

443
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,700
David, it's no good!

444
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,899
Aah!

445
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,399
Start the generator.

446
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

447
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,800
Gaaahhhh!

448
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,900
Hey, I'm sorry.

449
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,200
I mean, how the... how the hell
was I supposed to know what you meant?

450
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
You said you <i>heard</i> something.

451
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,076
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

452
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,376
You should've said
what you meant better.

453
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or some...

454
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,300
You got that kid killed!

455
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,399
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

456
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,600
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

457
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
- Huh?
- David!

458
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,376
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

459
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,100
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

460
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

461
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Okay, I'm done.

462
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Okay.

463
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,900
- What's next?
- Kill the generator.

464
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,100
That's the first thing.

465
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,300
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

467
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm... I'm sorry about the kid.

468
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,900
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

469
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
We oughta get out of here.

470
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,400
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

471
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

472
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,600
What's your excuse, huh?

473
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,200
Get outta here.

474
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,200
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

475
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Don't say anything, to anybody.

476
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Not yet.

477
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,600
Not yet.

478
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,000
Shit.

479
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,900
David? Need a little light here.

480
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,500
We have to tell 'em.

481
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,500
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

482
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
They won't believe us.

483
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
They have to.

484
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,700
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was <i>h ere.</i>

485
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
W-what we saw was impossible.

486
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,800
You know that, don't you?

487
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
I mean, what...

488
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,900
what do we say?

489
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,600
How do we convince them?

490
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

491
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Oh, my God!
Are... are you all right?

492
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,300
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

493
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,700
W-what the hell happened?

494
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,700
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?
I need to deal with something first.

495
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Please, I've got to...

496
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,999
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

497
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,999
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

498
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,100
Okay.

499
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,600
Hey, look, I'm sorry about Norm.

500
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,100
Me too.

501
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,599
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

502
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,900
Look, we need to tell people.

503
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

504
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

505
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,900
People need to know.

506
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,500
What about the out-of-towners?

507
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,300
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

508
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,699
- Brent Norton?
- That windbag?

509
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,499
He's an important attorney in New York.

510
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,699
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

511
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,200
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or anywhere.

512
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,976
- Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

513
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,800
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

514
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,700
W-wait. What do you mean getting in?

515
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,900
You shut the loading door.

516
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

517
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Jesus Christ.

518
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,699
I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

519
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,200
Um, listen...

520
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

521
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,100
they're... they're...
We saw <i>tentacles.</i>

522
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,500
- Ain't goin' very well, is it?
- Unh-unh.

523
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,700
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got...

524
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,100
Come here.

525
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,200
Tell him.

526
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
It's true.

527
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,500
Tentacles. Yeah.

528
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,200
Um, gentlemen, um...

529
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,999
I'm sorry, I...
I'm just not that stupid.

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,300
I mean, what do you take me for?
I'm shocked.

531
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm shocked.

532
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless using what's
happening here to try to make me look like an idiot.

533
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,299
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

534
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

535
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
I'll show you.

536
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,000
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor.

537
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
No.

538
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,900
No? What do you mean no?

539
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,300
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

540
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,400
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.

541
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,400
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?

542
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,199
Oh, please! Please!

543
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,776
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

544
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,600
and you guys are backing him up.

545
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,300
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

546
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,600
You wanted to humiliate me some more,

547
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,000
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks

548
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,476
stand around laughing their asses off.

549
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,400
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

550
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,200
- Hey, hey, fuck...!
- Mr. Norton, I swear,

551
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,400
you have got us all wrong.

552
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,000
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

553
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

554
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,000
and I have seen <i>you</i>
talking behind my back.

555
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
Y'all stick together.

556
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Well, don't I feel foolish?

557
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,399
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

558
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,976
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

559
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,199
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

560
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,699
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

561
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,376
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

562
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,999
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

563
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,100
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David...

564
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,500
Okay, my <i>son 's</i> life.
Now, I need <i>you.</i>

565
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,100
Brent, please, get your
head out of your ass.

566
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
All right, I'll drag you back there
if I have to. Come here.

567
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,400
David, get... get your
goddamn hands off of me!

568
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,400
I'll sue your ass again!

569
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,800
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

570
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,399
This man assaulted me.

571
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,000
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

572
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,176
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

573
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
No.

574
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,300
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

575
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,600
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

576
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,300
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

577
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,699
Okay.

578
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,700
W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

579
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,300
You're drinking?

580
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,900
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

581
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,999
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

582
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,076
Look, I'm gonna be taking down names,
starting with you.

583
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

584
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,099
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

585
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,000
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

586
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
This is Mr. David Drayton.

587
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,400
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

588
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,140
Go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

589
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,500
Listen, don't be scared.

590
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
It's okay.

591
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Okay.

592
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,400
This is how it is.

593
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,900
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

594
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,176
but there are things in it,
and they're dangerous, like Dan said.

595
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
That's right.

596
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,600
That's exactly right.

597
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,600
What kind of things?

598
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,600
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

599
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,500
I got knocked down.

600
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,799
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

601
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,400
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

602
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
me...

603
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,700
Norm, the bagboy.

604
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

605
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,100
So Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

606
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

607
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,800
- Took him?
- What do you mean?

608
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
Just... killed him.

609
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,400
I mean dragged him off.

610
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,100
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

611
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,600
All we saw were tentacles.

612
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
<i>Tentacles?</i>

613
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,300
Tentacles, he says.

614
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Tentacles from Planet X.

615
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,400
It's a lie, you know.

616
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,600
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

617
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,900
It's a pile of shit.

618
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,200
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie. It's lunacy.

619
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,100
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

620
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,000
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it. Go look.

621
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
Over there.

622
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,900
What the hell is that?

623
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,700
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

624
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,500
Yeah, just keep 'em in line. Thanks.

625
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
Let me...

626
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,600
help these people.

627
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,400
Let me...

628
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
let me preach Your word.

629
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,999
Let me shine Your light,

630
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,500
'cause they're not <i>all</i> bad.

631
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,900
They can't <i>all</i> be bad.

632
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,800
Some can be saved, can't they?

633
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,600
Yes.

634
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,300
Some <i>can</i> be brought...

635
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,500
to heaven's holy gates
through Your grace.

636
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,800
I have to believe that,

637
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,300
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

638
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,600
If I can save a few...

639
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
even one...

640
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,400
then my life will have counted
for something.

641
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,200
I will have pulled my weight.

642
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,700
I will have earned my place at Your side.

643
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,000
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

644
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Hello?

645
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,099
What?

646
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,399
I just need to use the bathroom.

647
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,500
Oh.

648
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

649
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,600
Ma'am...

650
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,500
I... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

651
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
being scared, I mean...

652
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,800
and, well, if you need a friend...

653
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,300
you know, someone to talk to.

654
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I have a friend...

655
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,400
God up above.
I talk to Him every day.

656
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Don't you condescend to me.

657
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm sorry?

658
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,300
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

659
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
That's not what I was doing.

660
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Well, I'll tell you what...

661
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,099
the day I need a friend like you,

662
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,100
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

663
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,500
Maybe you <i>do</i> believe this.

664
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,700
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

665
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,000
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

666
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,800
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

667
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,799
You're not arguing a case, and you're doing
nothing but damage, talking the way you are.

668
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,900
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

669
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,320
- You still haven't fooled anyone.
- Leave it alone, David.

670
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,200
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

671
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,299
even when their hair is burning.

672
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,800
Denial is a powerful thing.

673
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, keep talking.

674
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

675
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,099
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

676
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,100
There's no defense
against the will of God.

677
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,400
There's no court of appeals in hell.

678
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,800
There's no defense here, either.

679
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,700
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world,
not even if you stack it as high as you can.

680
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,100
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

681
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,500
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

682
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,499
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

683
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,299
Those who want to stack dog food...

684
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,000
knock yourselves out.

685
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,900
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

686
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,100
It should help.

687
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,600
Yeah, think so?

688
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,400
Duct tape and dog food bags.

689
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,000
That bad?

690
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,100
It's not good.

691
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,300
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

692
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,100
Open your eyes.

693
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,499
Let the scales fall away.

694
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
This has all been written.

695
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Revelations, chapter 15:

696
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,800
"And the temple was filled with smoke

697
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,000
"from the glory of God

698
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,499
"and from His power,

699
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
"and no one could enter the temple

700
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,100
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

701
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, what are you saying?

702
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,900
What are you proposing?

703
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,600
That we all prepare...

704
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,500
to meet our Maker.

705
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,700
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

706
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,300
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

707
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
so that it can waggle at both ends.

708
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,100
The end time has come,

709
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,899
not in flames, but in mist.

710
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,000
Come here!

711
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,200
Easy! Back off!

712
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,699
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

713
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,200
- How about that?
- Hey, there's no call for that.

714
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,500
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

715
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,400
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

716
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,700
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

717
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

718
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,500
A monstrosity <i>did</i> pull
that poor boy away.

719
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,400
Things in the mist...
do you doubt?

720
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,600
Do you?

721
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,000
Then go out.

722
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,400
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

723
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,600
Shut up, lady.

724
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,400
For God's sakes.

725
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,699
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

726
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,199
They should be scared.

727
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,900
Oh, yes, they should.

728
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,400
Their beautiful, pure little minds

729
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,900
have been corrupted with lies.

730
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Lies.

731
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,200
All this talk of a modern God,

732
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,000
or no God.

733
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,799
There is one God.

734
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,499
The God of the Israelites.

735
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,400
And He is a stern and vengeful God,

736
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,000
and we have been mocking Him
far too long,

737
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,700
and now He demands
retribution in blood.

738
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,500
It is time to declare yourselves.

739
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,200
Take sides...

740
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,100
the saved and the damned.

741
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,700
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

742
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,600
- Blood!
- What?

743
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,800
Blood.

744
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,500
Little Normie was first,

745
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,699
and now God calls the rest of us.

746
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,200
The bill is due.

747
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,800
It must be paid.

748
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

749
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,800
to prove his love for God, so...

750
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,300
Enough.

751
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,400
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

752
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,400
A few more pennies in the jar.

753
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,020
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

754
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,300
I-I'm sorry everybody,

755
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,400
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

756
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,000
They'll come for you.

757
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,500
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

758
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,900
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

759
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
See if they don't.

760
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,899
And when they do,

761
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,500
you will cry to God,

762
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,300
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

763
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,700
That's fine.

764
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,000
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

765
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,100
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

766
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,499
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

767
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,000
And you, bitch...

768
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,100
you hit me again...

769
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
if you dare.

770
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,900
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

771
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,300
Those of you who aren't local should know that
Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being...

772
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,600
unstable.

773
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,900
No shit.
What was your first clue?

774
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,400
Shh.

775
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,400
- Hi.
- What's up, little dude?

776
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,300
How come your friends
don't come get us?

777
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,000
They got tanks and stuff, right?

778
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,800
Why can't you just call 'em?

779
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,000
Phones don't work.

780
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,900
But don't you got, like, a radio?

781
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
Hey, champ, what's going on?

782
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,700
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

783
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,976
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

784
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
- But...
- Shh.

785
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,600
Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

786
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,800
Yeah, sure thing.

787
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,599
Troop, off your asses.

788
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,400
- You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

789
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,800
Oh, man, I don't either.

790
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,400
But you know what?

791
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,200
Maybe she's scared too.

792
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
You think?

793
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,700
You think Mommy's okay?

794
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,000
Billy...

795
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

796
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,200
Aw, hey.

797
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,300
Mommy loves you very much.

798
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,900
And I'll bet she's fine.

799
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
And I promise you,

800
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

801
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,000
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

802
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,400
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

803
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops to make torches.

804
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
And we've got knives and stuff, God knows.

805
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,900
This may be a silly question, Bud, but...
do you happen to have a <i>gun</i> in the store?

806
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,700
Here? No. Please.

807
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,600
This... this isn't Los Angeles.

808
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,300
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

809
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,100
I could try for it if you want.

810
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,499
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

811
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,600
Hold on.

812
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,500
This gun, um...

813
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,400
my husband's idea.

814
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,500
He's away on business a lot.

815
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,799
It's not even loaded.

816
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,500
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

817
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Um...

818
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,700
You know how to use that?

819
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,599
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.
Hit the target a few times.

820
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,400
So, we got a gun.

821
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,400
Anybody know how to shoot it?

822
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,900
<i>Well,</i> I mean?

823
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I do.

824
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
You?

825
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,700
Ollie. Please.

826
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,900
Some target shooting.

827
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,200
State champion in '94.

828
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,900
- You're crazy if you go out there!
- Let us pass! Let us pass, please!

829
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,276
Let's just talk this thing through.

830
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,500
We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

831
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,500
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

832
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,976
- Why don't we just sit down and just...
- What, and let you keep on talking?

833
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,176
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

834
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,276
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

835
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,399
<i>Your</i> people?

836
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,276
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

837
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,800
Now... now listen, everyone.

838
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,800
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

839
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,899
I don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,

840
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,800
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

841
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,200
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

842
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,999
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

843
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,700
is to seek rescue.

844
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,500
We're going out.

845
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,299
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

846
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,500
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

847
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,799
Tie this around your waist.

848
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,900
What for?

849
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,100
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

850
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
I'll do it.

851
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,500
- Are you throwing in with them?
- Me? No thanks.

852
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,200
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

853
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,400
Gonna get somebody killed.

854
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,300
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

855
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,000
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

856
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,200
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

857
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,100
Son, you got brass balls.

858
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,100
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

859
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,400
Drive it back.

860
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,800
All right.

861
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,600
Just see they're paying out this line.

862
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,900
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

863
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,300
just so you understand.

864
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,500
Yeah.

865
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,400
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

866
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,800
David... there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

867
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,800
What if you're wrong?

868
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,400
Then, I guess...

869
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,500
the joke would be on me after all.

870
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,000
We're gonna send back help.

871
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,500
You'll die out there.
All of you.

872
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,400
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

873
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,500
I just don't think He's the bloodthirsty
asshole you make Him out to be.

874
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,200
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

875
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,900
You just chat it over at your leisure.

876
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,520
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

877
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,000
Keep it loose.

878
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,300
Nice and easy.

879
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,600
Keep going.

880
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,300
Look.

881
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,700
It's going.

882
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,900
They're doing good.

883
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,600
Aah! Aaahhhh!

884
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,300
Put it down!

885
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,600
Ohh! Pull!

886
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,900
Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

887
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,700
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

888
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,200
Get it off!

889
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,600
Oh, my God.

890
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,700
- Aw, sh...
- Blood!

891
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,500
Awww, sh...!

892
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,300
Oh, my God!

893
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, my God!

894
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,600
Cut the rope!

895
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Shut the door!

896
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Now do you see?

897
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,500
Now do you believe?

898
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,900
About a half-hour of daylight left.

899
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,099
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

900
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,700
- We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.
- Yeah, check it out.

901
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,700
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

902
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,200
These batteries ain't topped up.

903
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,400
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

904
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,600
How quick?

905
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,699
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

906
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,700
Okay, emergencies only.

907
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,200
If something gets in the store.

908
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,500
Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

909
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,200
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

910
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,500
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

911
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

912
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,500
Barely. How about you?

913
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,200
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

914
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,900
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

915
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,100
That's less than
five miles from here.

916
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,700
How 'bout yours?

917
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,400
Well, they're out of town right now.

918
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,000
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

919
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,800
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

920
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,200
I hope so.

921
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,000
So... how soon you shipping out?

922
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,700
Uh, couple weeks.

923
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,900
Scared about going over there?

924
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Yeah.

925
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,100
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

926
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,300
How come you never asked me out?

927
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,300
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

928
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,100
So how come?

929
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm stupid, I guess.

930
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,100
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

931
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,499
Don't be. I just... I just didn't really
want it to happen like this, you know?

932
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,200
Some shitty locker room at work.

933
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,500
Can we just stay in here a while, then?

934
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,300
I mean, just... just you and me.

935
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,200
- The parking lot lamps turned on.
- They're on a timer.

936
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,300
Must be a different municipal line.

937
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,100
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

938
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,000
get some electricity in here.

939
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,700
That'd mean walking out the door.

940
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,500
Gaaaahhhh! God!

941
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,799
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

942
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,800
David! David!

943
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,200
You sure?

944
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Look!

945
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,900
My God.

946
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,900
Are those bugs?

947
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,200
Not like any I've ever seen.

948
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,400
"They came out of the smoke,

949
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,400
"locusts upon the earth,

950
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,000
"and unto them was given power

951
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,300
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

952
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,900
Wow.

953
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,400
Look at those stingers.

954
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,900
Dear God.

955
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,500
Holy shit!

956
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,900
Myron, get the ones in the back!

957
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,260
God, I think they're
attracted to the light.

958
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,600
Look out, look out, look out!

959
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,780
The light! Douse the light!

960
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,800
Look out! Look out!

961
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Move! Move!

962
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,300
Light, light,
light, light, light!

963
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,300
"And there came a voice
from the temple

964
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,200
"saying to the seven angels,

965
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,600
"'Go your ways

966
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,800
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth.'"

967
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,200
Ollie, the glass is gonna give!

968
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,699
- Shit!
- Oh, my God, they turned on all the lights!

969
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,200
- Jim! Myron!
- Fire!

970
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,200
- Douse the lights!
- Fire! Lighter!

971
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,500
Come on, come on!

972
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,600
Aah!

973
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,700
Whoa!

974
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,300
Aah!

975
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,500
Oh, ugh!

976
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,500
Sally, look out!

977
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,900
No!

978
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,300
Ohh! Oohhhh!

979
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,300
Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

980
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,399
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

981
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,500
Let me see. Let me see.

982
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,276
You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

983
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,576
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

984
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,700
Come on!

985
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,100
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe, breathe, Sally!

986
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,800
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

987
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Aaahhhh!

988
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,100
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

989
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,499
Shoot it! Shoot it!

990
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,100
I can't! I'll smash the window!

991
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,400
God!

992
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,100
Oh, God! Ohh!

993
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,300
- Aaahhh!
- Go! Go!

994
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,600
Get down!

995
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,400
Shit!

996
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,340
- Ollie, you want these lights on or off?
- Leave 'em on.

997
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,300
Aah! Aaahhhh!

998
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Oh, God!

999
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,800
Ohh! Ohhh! Kill it!

1000
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:16,500
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1001
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,840
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

1002
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,000
Come on.

1003
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,100
Sally!

1004
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,200
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

1005
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,100
What's happening?!

1006
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,300
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1007
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,600
Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

1008
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,300
Plug that hole!

1009
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,500
Dad!

1010
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,100
Down! Down! Lay down!

1011
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,300
Ohh.

1012
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,700
My life...

1013
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,200
my life for You,
Your will be done.

1014
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,699
Daddy!

1015
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,000
Bugs! Daddy!

1016
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,700
- Nooooo! Billy!
- Daddy!

1017
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
- Billy!
- Daddy!

1018
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,300
Billy! Oh!

1019
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,500
Dad!

1020
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,100
Billy, come back here.

1021
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

1022
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,000
Billy!

1023
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,200
Come on, let's move it!

1024
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
Somebody please
come over here and help.

1025
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,000
Here's some tape!

1026
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,500
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

1027
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,499
Hurry up with the blankets!

1028
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,500
It hurts so bad! Please!

1029
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,900
It hurts so bad!

1030
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,900
Block it up here.

1031
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,100
Get me some more bags!

1032
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,700
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1033
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,400
She was right.

1034
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,800
She said that it would happen like this.

1035
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,900
She said that
they would come at night.

1036
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,900
She told us someone would die.

1037
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,600
Mommy.

1038
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1039
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,000
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1040
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,300
It's just a bad dream.

1041
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,100
I want my mommy.

1042
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,800
I know.

1043
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,100
I know. Of course you do.

1044
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,800
- Shh.
- I wanna go home.

1045
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,400
Just sleep.

1046
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,400
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1047
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,600
Think he likes you.

1048
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,700
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1049
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,200
You have kids?

1050
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,500
No.

1051
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,800
I always wanted to, but...

1052
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,500
things haven't been working out.

1053
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,800
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1054
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,800
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...

1055
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,600
they shouldn't exist.

1056
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,600
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1057
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,300
You're not alone in that.

1058
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,800
We're all right there with you.

1059
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,700
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1060
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,700
David.

1061
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,000
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1062
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,900
Joe.

1063
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,500
How you holdin' up, partner?

1064
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,900
David... is that you?

1065
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,500
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1066
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,300
It's bad. He's bad.

1067
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,000
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1068
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,300
If you guys can't help me...

1069
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,800
you... you gotta end it, okay?

1070
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,400
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1071
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,400
- Right?
- No. No way.

1072
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,800
You can't fuck with me on this, bro.

1073
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,099
Not with me like this.

1074
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,600
I'll do it.

1075
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,400
Just give me the gun.

1076
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,100
Hey, hey. Shh.

1077
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,300
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1078
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,100
Joe, now, listen.

1079
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,399
Pal... we're gonna work something out.

1080
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,300
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay? Can we do that?

1081
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,900
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1082
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1083
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,200
Hattie.

1084
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,100
See anything?

1085
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,200
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1086
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,400
Dawn's coming.
What's on your mind?

1087
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,800
It's Joe.

1088
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,600
We don't get him on some serious
antibiotics, he's gonna die of infection.

1089
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,000
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1090
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,900
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1091
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,700
You... you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1092
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,700
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene...

1093
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,600
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1094
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,800
- She knows where they keep it.
- Slow down.

1095
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,599
You can't actually
be thinkin' of doin' this.

1096
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,599
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1097
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,300
We have to get out of here.

1098
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,800
- I mean <i>permanently.</i>
- Why? We got plenty to eat!

1099
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,899
And what happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1100
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,700
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1101
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,700
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1102
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

1103
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,400
It's Hattie.

1104
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,299
Here?

1105
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1106
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,700
One... two... three.

1107
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,500
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1108
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,900
lying there next to us.

1109
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,700
I thought she was sleeping.

1110
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,899
I got my four-wheel drive.

1111
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,500
It's out there.

1112
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,300
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1113
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,100
Well, we...

1114
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,000
should hit the pharmacy first.

1115
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,676
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1116
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,999
I mean, if we don't,

1117
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,800
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1118
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,000
But after that...

1119
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,720
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1120
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,000
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1121
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,300
and try to get clear of this mist.

1122
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
That's it?

1123
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,800
That's the plan?

1124
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,800
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1125
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,900
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1126
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,400
No, no, no. Amanda, <i>think.</i>

1127
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,400
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1128
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
That's how much rope played out.

1129
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,600
I'm parked half that distance from here.

1130
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,699
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1131
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,276
It could be the entire eastern seaboard.

1132
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,500
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1133
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,800
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1134
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,800
We have one gun.

1135
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,800
- How many rounds?
- We got ten left.

1136
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,000
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1137
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,800
Okay, so ten.

1138
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,799
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1139
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,800
I'll give you the best one. Her.

1140
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,400
Mrs. Carmody.

1141
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,300
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1142
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,100
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1143
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,200
He's right.

1144
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,599
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1145
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,300
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1146
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,899
Look, a few people maybe, but...

1147
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,200
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1148
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,800
By noon, she'll have four more.

1149
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,000
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1150
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,600
she'll have a congregation,

1151
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:27,200
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1152
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,900
to make it all better.

1153
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,699
Hmm?

1154
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,699
You, Amanda?

1155
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,000
My little boy?

1156
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,700
He's right.

1157
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,900
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1158
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,300
None whatsoever.

1159
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,900
I can't accept that.

1160
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,700
People are basically good, decent.

1161
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,800
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1162
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,900
Sure, as long as the machines
are workin' and you can dial 9-1-1,

1163
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,800
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1164
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,899
you scare the <i>shit</i> out of them,

1165
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,800
no more <i>rules,</i>

1166
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,800
you'll see how primitive they get.

1167
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:04,199
You scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.

1168
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,800
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1169
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,100
or <i>whatever.</i>

1170
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1171
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,000
I wish I could.

1172
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,400
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1173
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,100
Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides
and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.

1174
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,799
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1175
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,599
Oh, Jesus, that's just... wrong.

1176
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,100
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1177
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,400
First things first... the pharmacy.

1178
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,599
That'll be our test run.

1179
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,700
Okay?

1180
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,699
It's all right, Big Bill.

1181
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,400
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1182
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,800
I don't want them.

1183
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,500
I want you to stay here.

1184
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,600
I won't be gone long.

1185
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,700
Just... just next door.

1186
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,600
Hey, you'll be safe.

1187
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,200
Daddy...

1188
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,800
Daddy, there are things out there.

1189
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,600
Things...

1190
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,600
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1191
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,100
They'll wait. They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1192
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,500
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1193
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,000
they'll come and eat you up!

1194
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,400
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

1195
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,000
I'll be back.

1196
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,800
Big Bill... I promise.

1197
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,200
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1198
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,800
All right?

1199
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,000
Together, we're going home.

1200
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,299
If something happens,
anything at all, you cut and run.

1201
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,000
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1202
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,600
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1203
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,600
best as you can,
as long as you can.

1204
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,400
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1205
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,099
You... you get him out of here.

1206
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,500
You just keep drivin'.

1207
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,100
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1208
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,199
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1209
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,300
My boy is no concern of yours.

1210
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,699
Listen up.

1211
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,700
We're going to the pharmacy.

1212
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,799
We're gonna bring back some supplies.

1213
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,200
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1214
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,499
Listen, folks, listen!

1215
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
We're not gonna take any chances.

1216
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,099
If there's any trouble,

1217
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,100
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1218
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,599
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1219
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,100
She's right.

1220
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,200
You'll make 'em notice us.
You'll make 'em come.

1221
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,900
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1222
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,800
Lady, this what you call
"well enough"?

1223
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,400
You wanna stop us?

1224
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,000
You better explain to Bobby here

1225
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,376
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1226
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,500
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1227
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,300
You'll die out there, young man.

1228
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,499
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1229
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,799
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1230
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,600
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1231
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,700
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1232
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,000
- No!
- No! No! No!

1233
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,099
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1234
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,600
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1235
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,300
This kind of pride and defiance of...

1236
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,800
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1237
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,100
You old bitch!

1238
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,600
No, no, no, no!

1239
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,400
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1240
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,100
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1241
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,000
And I got lots of peas.

1242
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,700
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1243
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,499
How 'bout it, Army?

1244
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,000
Any help from the armed forces?

1245
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,200
I'll go.

1246
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,600
Jim Grondin.
I had you in school, didn't I?

1247
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,700
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

1248
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,400
Pair of underachievers.

1249
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,700
After you, Jim.

1250
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,100
Yes, ma'am.

1251
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,599
Oh, <i>shit.</i>

1252
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,000
That it?
That's everybody?

1253
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,600
Everybody that's goin'.

1254
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,700
- Yep.
- Okay.

1255
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,800
Single file,
one by one, all right?

1256
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,600
Let's get this thing over with.

1257
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,900
Let's go.

1258
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,700
- After you.
- Yes.

1259
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,700
Stay together.

1260
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,700
- Get the door.
- You know what?

1261
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,376
- Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.
- I don't care.

1262
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,100
- Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1263
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,200
Save the batteries.

1264
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,299
<i>Shit.</i>

1265
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,300
They left the doors propped open.

1266
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,200
Think something got in?

1267
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:32,200
Let's just... get what we need,
get the hell outta here.

1268
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,700
Yeah. Let's do that.

1269
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:38,200
The meds are
over at the end there, in the cubicle.

1270
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,100
- Will you not do that?
- I'm sorry. I'm <i>sorry.</i>

1271
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,200
Oh, <i>Go d.</i>

1272
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,199
Where's that Silvadene?

1273
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,700
It's over behind David.

1274
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,700
In the fridge. Check there.

1275
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,300
Silvadene. Got it.

1276
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1277
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,400
- Penicillin.
- Yeah.

1278
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,000
Any strong antibiotics.

1279
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,700
Yeah.

1280
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,200
Pain meds like Vicodin or OxyContin.

1281
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,800
- Shh!
- OxyContin!

1282
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,300
Hydrochloride?

1283
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,900
Penicillin.

1284
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,100
Guys.

1285
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,600
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1286
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,500
What?

1287
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,300
Somethin' fuckin' weird.

1288
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,700
Oh, God.

1289
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,200
Oh, <i>Go d!</i>

1290
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:44,300
No. Oh, no.

1291
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,100
Oh, nooooo.

1292
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,700
Oh, <i>fuck.</i>

1293
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,600
Look.
There's another one.

1294
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,499
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

1295
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,900
Oh, no, no.

1296
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:00,600
Guys, let's get out of here <i>now.</i>

1297
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,500
- Aaaahhhhhh!
- Holy shit!

1298
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,100
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

1299
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,600
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

1300
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,800
Good Lord!
Help him!

1301
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,100
Son of a bitch!

1302
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,700
This stuff ain't comin' off!

1303
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,100
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

1304
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,000
It's our fault.

1305
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,199
It's all our fault.

1306
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,700
It's really stuck.

1307
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
God, I can feel 'em!

1308
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,100
I can feel 'em!

1309
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,700
Oh, my God!
<i>Jesus!</i>

1310
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,500
Oh, my God.

1311
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,000
Ohh! I...

1312
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,500
Aaahhhh!

1313
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,100
Aah! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1314
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,300
There's more!

1315
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,400
Ohh!

1316
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,600
- Aah! Aah!
- There's another one! Hit it!

1317
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,799
- Aah!
- What the hell is that stuff?

1318
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,600
Ollie! One over there!

1319
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,300
Ollie, there!

1320
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,100
Got it!

1321
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,700
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1322
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,600
Shit!

1323
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,900
Where are they?
You see 'em?

1324
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
- Where the hell are they?
- Aah! Aaaahhhhh!

1325
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,200
Bobby!

1326
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,900
Bobby!

1327
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,600
- Aaahhhh!
- Hold on, man! Hold on!

1328
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,400
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

1329
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,500
Help me!

1330
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,500
Let's get out of here!

1331
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,900
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1332
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,700
- Aaaaahhhhhh!
- Hold it tight.

1333
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,400
- I got him, I got him. Hold on.
- I can't feel my...

1334
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,900
Pull it tight!

1335
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,100
Look! Look!

1336
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,800
Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1337
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,000
Ohhhhhh!

1338
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,800
Gaaahhhh!

1339
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,400
Light!

1340
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Light!

1341
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,200
God!

1342
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,400
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1343
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,999
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1344
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1345
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,400
Let's get out of here!

1346
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,800
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1347
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,000
Come on!

1348
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,900
Oh, my God! We can't go.

1349
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,700
Ollie! Ollie!

1350
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,000
Kill it! Kill it!

1351
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,900
- Fuckers!
- Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1352
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,600
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1353
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,000
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

1354
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,100
Come on, Drayton, he's dead!
Come on!

1355
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,600
Open the door!

1356
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,400
Where's Bobby?

1357
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Daddy!

1358
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,100
Close up the doors!

1359
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,299
Hurry up!

1360
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,800
What happened?

1361
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,600
They're dead!
They're all dead!

1362
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,500
Expiation, because we have seen

1363
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,199
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1364
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,200
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1365
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,700
obscenities and profanities
of such nightmare proportions.

1366
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,600
And for these evil, lurking spirits,

1367
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,700
and for these evil people...

1368
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,100
How long was I out?

1369
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,600
Most of the day.

1370
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,200
You just came over here,
lay down, and went to sleep.

1371
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,800
Just passed out, is more like it.

1372
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,400
What will stop this Great Whore?

1373
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,400
Just shut down for a while. Sorry.

1374
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,100
How will it end?

1375
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,200
Expiation!

1376
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,899
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1377
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,600
How's Joe?

1378
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,200
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1379
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,500
We were just too late.

1380
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,400
- I <i>told</i> you this would come!
- Oh, God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1381
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,800
No dream.

1382
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,000
She's getting people whipped up.

1383
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:34,300
That poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1384
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,299
She's got 'em believing she's a psychic;
she has a direct line with God.

1385
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,800
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1386
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,200
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1387
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,300
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1388
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,700
I'm in.

1389
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,700
No. Sorry.

1390
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,600
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1391
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,400
I won't... do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1392
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,000
You might want to reconsider that.

1393
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,400
What will... what will keep
these evil, these abominations at bay?

1394
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,000
What will keep them away?

1395
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,999
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1396
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,500
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1397
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
- Expiation!
- So what are we talking about?

1398
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,200
- Expiation!
- Yeah, say it again like you mean it!

1399
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,500
Expiation!

1400
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:22,600
Welcome to <i>Sesame Street.</i>
Today's word is "expiation."

1401
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,799
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1402
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,400
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1403
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,500
His mind's just snapped. Gone.

1404
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,200
Hasn't even been two days.

1405
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,700
Not even two days.

1406
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,399
I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1407
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,100
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1408
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,500
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1409
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,900
It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1410
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,500
It'll be your call.

1411
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,900
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1412
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,300
Who will save them? No one.

1413
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,499
These rocks <i>will</i> not hide them.

1414
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:04,300
I want some idea of what we're up against.
I want to know what this mist is.

1415
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,200
- I want to talk to the soldiers.
- Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1416
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,400
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1417
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,800
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1418
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,599
The situation was insane.

1419
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,400
He said he was sorry.

1420
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,500
Wasn't that the word
he used... "sorry"?

1421
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,899
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1422
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,800
- What did he mean by that?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

1423
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,500
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1424
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,900
Verse 17!

1425
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,499
"poured out his vial into the air,

1426
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,400
"and there came a great voice

1427
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,200
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1428
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,800
"'It is done! It is done!'

1429
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:41,100
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1430
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,200
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1431
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,000
Yes! Come to me!

1432
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,200
What?

1433
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:50,500
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1434
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,899
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1435
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,900
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1436
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:02,000
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1437
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,500
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1438
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:08,400
That's not what the M.P. said in the pharmacy
before the spiders came out of his skin.

1439
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,600
They're not in the store.

1440
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,800
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1441
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,999
Because you know.

1442
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,100
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1443
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,499
Yes? Tell us.

1444
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,799
Here is an old man who has seen!

1445
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,999
Yes, he has <i>seen!</i>

1446
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,100
Amen.

1447
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,800
And I <i>want</i> to say,
do I want to walk with you

1448
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,600
into my Father's hands?

1449
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,100
Morales.

1450
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,200
Donaldson.

1451
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,000
Guys...

1452
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,700
- It's the only place they can be.
- What?

1453
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,200
Couldn't just disappear.

1454
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,300
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are...

1455
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,100
I didn't think they'd do it.

1456
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,500
They said they would do it, and I just...

1457
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,999
I told them what the M.P. said at the
pharmacy, and they swore they'd do it.

1458
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,800
I just... I didn't think
they would. Oh, Jesus!

1459
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,099
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?

1460
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,600
This mist, it's some kind of,
what, military fuckup?

1461
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,476
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1462
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,300
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1463
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,400
Get in there!

1464
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,400
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1465
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,000
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1466
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,500
Those two peckerwoods
that he's been with this whole time,

1467
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,900
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1468
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,500
They knew it all along!

1469
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,499
- He's crazy. He doesn't know...
- Get on your knees!

1470
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,800
Stay out of it, Drayton!

1471
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,999
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1472
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,499
All about the Arrowhead Project and
all that secret shit up on the mountain.

1473
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,000
That's what brung it down on us.

1474
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,200
That's what brung down the wrath of God!

1475
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,300
Oh!

1476
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,100
Private Jessup.

1477
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,100
It wasn't <i>me.</i>

1478
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,500
I'm just...
I'm <i>stationed</i> up there.

1479
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm not responsible...

1480
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,700
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1481
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
Most of you people know me.

1482
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:06,000
You stop your chicken shit whining
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1483
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,700
Now you tell us!

1484
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,899
Tell us.

1485
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,600
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1486
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,100
I heard stuff.

1487
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,500
Stuff?

1488
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,600
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1489
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:23,700
Like how they, um...

1490
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,800
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1491
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,700
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

1492
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,300
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1493
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,800
a window...

1494
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:35,661
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1495
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,500
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1496
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,400
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1497
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,099
- Oh, the scientists!
- Yes, the scientists!

1498
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,200
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1499
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,140
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1500
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,500
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1501
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,600
I didn't understand the half of it.

1502
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,100
It ain't my fault!

1503
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Oh.

1504
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,600
Ain't. His. Fault.

1505
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,200
No, no, no.

1506
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:10,300
Ain't nothin' ever anybody's fault.

1507
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,700
But he denies it.

1508
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,299
He points the finger,

1509
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,500
this Judas in our midst.

1510
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,600
Judas!

1511
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,400
David!

1512
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,800
You! You!

1513
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,800
Don't you know by now?

1514
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,900
Don't you know the truth?

1515
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,600
We are being punished.

1516
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,200
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1517
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,600
For going against
His forbidden rules of old!

1518
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,100
Walking on the moon!

1519
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,700
Yes! Yes!

1520
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,699
- Or... or splitting His atoms!
- Amen!

1521
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:49,499
Or... or... or stem cells and abortions!

1522
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:52,500
And destroying the secrets of life

1523
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,800
that only God above has any right to!

1524
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,400
Amen! Amen!

1525
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,099
Yes, I know! It is true!

1526
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,700
And now we are being punished.

1527
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,700
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1528
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,400
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1529
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,199
and star Wormwood blazes!

1530
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,500
And it is his fault!

1531
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,900
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1532
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
<i>They</i> did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1533
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,100
No!

1534
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,300
Get over there!

1535
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,000
No!

1536
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,700
Judas!

1537
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Jim!

1538
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,500
Kill him! String him up!

1539
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,300
Stand up, you coward!

1540
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,400
Unkh!

1541
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,000
Jesus!

1542
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,200
No!

1543
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,700
Aaaahhhh!

1544
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,900
Expiation!

1545
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,600
- No!
- Stab him!

1546
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,100
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

1547
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,899
Feed him to the beast!

1548
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Expiation!

1549
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1550
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,100
No, no! No!

1551
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,800
Aaaaahhhhh!

1552
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,100
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1553
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,300
Aaahhhh!

1554
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,900
Aaahhhh!

1555
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,500
Aah! Aaahhh!

1556
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,600
Aaahhhh!

1557
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,700
Aaahhh! Aah!

1558
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,200
Please.

1559
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:24,500
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1560
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,200
Tomorrow...

1561
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,900
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1562
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,400
Daddy.

1563
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,200
Daddy.

1564
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,900
Sorry I left you, pal.

1565
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,900
I'll never leave you again.

1566
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,400
Promise?

1567
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,500
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1568
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,000
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1569
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,800
Tell me.

1570
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,900
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1571
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,700
Ever. No matter what.

1572
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,900
I promise.

1573
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,900
I love you, Daddy.

1574
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,900
I love you, Billy.

1575
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,200
More than anything.

1576
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,100
It's dawn.

1577
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:16,399
Hey, pal, you ready to go home?

1578
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,800
Come on.

1579
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,200
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1580
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,800
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1581
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:27,199
Okay.

1582
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:30,999
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1583
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,200
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1584
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,999
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1585
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,200
Let's go.

1586
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,800
Stealing food now?

1587
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1588
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,000
Please stand aside.

1589
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,000
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1590
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,400
Won't allow it?

1591
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,100
It's against God's will.

1592
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,300
Don't you know that by now?

1593
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,900
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1594
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,500
Haven't I shown that I am His vessel?

1595
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,900
What's the matter with you?

1596
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,600
Don't you believe in God?

1597
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,200
No one's interfered with you.

1598
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,900
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1599
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,300
You heard him.

1600
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,900
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1601
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:01,100
They... people who refused
to bend to the will of God,

1602
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,800
and claim it privilege.

1603
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,900
Sinners in pride.

1604
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Yes, haughty.

1605
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,100
Privileged!

1606
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:15,000
They mock us. They mock our...
our God, our faith,

1607
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:18,500
our values, our very lifestyle.

1608
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,800
They mock our humility

1609
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,800
and our piousness.

1610
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,900
They piss on us and laugh.

1611
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:34,400
It's from them the blood
of human sacrifice must come.

1612
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,499
From them...

1613
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,100
- Come on.
- The blood of expiation.

1614
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,200
Come on.

1615
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,800
You try it.

1616
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,200
Fuckin' try it!

1617
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,799
Come on!

1618
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,000
- Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

1619
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,500
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1620
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,700
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1621
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,700
The boy!

1622
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,200
David! David!

1623
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:55,100
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1624
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,500
Get off me!

1625
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,099
Get off me! Get off me!

1626
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,500
Grab him!

1627
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,900
And get the whore too!

1628
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,500
Grab her!

1629
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,900
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1630
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,700
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1631
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,400
I... I killed her.

1632
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,800
Thank you, Ollie.

1633
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,000
Let's go.

1634
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,300
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1635
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,500
You killed her!

1636
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,900
You <i>murdered</i> her!

1637
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,699
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,
not if there'd been any other way.

1638
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:59,200
That's why I said thank you.

1639
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:00,499
Okay.

1640
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,800
Okay, then... let's go!

1641
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,800
Get up, Myron!

1642
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,300
- Come on! We gotta go!
- My ankle!

1643
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:20,900
Okay. All the way down!
Where are they?

1644
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,400
Bud! Myron!

1645
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,500
Ambrose!

1646
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,200
I think I broke it!

1647
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,800
Come on! Come on!

1648
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,399
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1649
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,700
They're lost!

1650
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,000
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

1651
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,699
Ollie!

1652
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,700
Aaahhhh!

1653
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,700
Aaaaahhhhhh!

1654
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
- Oh!
- Aaahhh!

1655
01:42:00,700 --> 01:42:01,799
Ohh!

1656
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,200
Aaah! Aaaahhhh!

1657
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,700
Aaah! Aaaaahhhhh!

1658
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,700
All that screaming!

1659
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:27,200
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1660
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,500
Let me... let me in!
Let me in!

1661
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,400
Are we going?

1662
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,500
- No.
- Yeah.

1663
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,700
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1664
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,100
- Daddy.
- David.

1665
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,100
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1666
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,900
- David!
- Daddy!

1667
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,500
Get back in the car!

1668
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,200
- Daddy!
- David!

1669
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,200
Oh, my God!

1670
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,600
Aaahhh!

1671
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,100
Oh, my God!

1672
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,200
We gotta go.

1673
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,500
I told her I'd fix it.

1674
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,200
Front window... broken open.

1675
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,100
Tree.

1676
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:10,600
My... grandfather's tree.

1677
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,000
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

1678
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:48,600
Let's, uh... see how far this...

1679
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,600
fuel takes us, huh?

1680
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,700
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1681
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,300
Well...

1682
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,500
we gave it a good shot.

1683
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:21,400
Nobody can say we didn't.

1684
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,100
Nope.

1685
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,000
Nobody can say that.

1686
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,300
Well...

1687
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:00,800
We got, uh...

1688
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,500
four.

1689
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:12,000
Four bullets.

1690
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,000
But there's five of us.

1691
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,400
I'll figure something out.

1692
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,900
Aaaaahhhhh!

1693
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,300
Aaahhh!

1694
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:24,700
Aah! Aah!

1695
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,600
Come on!

1696
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,900
Come on!

1697
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,700
Come on!

1698
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:47,100
Come on. Come on.

1699
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,300
Come on.

1700
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,900
Come on.

1701
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,700
Come on.

1702
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,500
Come on.

1703
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,600
Come on, <i>come on!</i>

1704
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,600
Come on! Come on!

1705
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:48,199
They're... they're dead.

1706
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:49,700
For what?

1707
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,400
Aah!

1708
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,000
Aaaaahhhhhh!
