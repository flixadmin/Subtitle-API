00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,440
My son's not here to speak...

163
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,720
So I'll speak on behalf of us both.

164
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
Truce.

165
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
Five for peace.

166
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,440
Two for truce, one abstension.

167
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,480
Let's get on with the war.

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
Whoa. Curly, how are ya?

171
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,080
Here, catch.

172
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,640
Right, come on then,
boys, unload, unload.

173

174

Dan Tremelling
plays in goal for the Blues

176
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,000
and Tommy Jackson for the Villa.

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,400
Fair enough.

178
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
-Charlie?
-What is it, Curly?

179
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
We've run out of bullets Charlie.

180
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,040
We need more ammunition.

181
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,080
More ammunition.

182
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,400
Johnny, more ammo.

(IN ROMANI)

184
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,400
We're like sitting ducks
here if the wops come.

185
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,680
Yeah, well, Tommy said
we should do it in the open.

186
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,040
This is how John wanted to go.

187
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,680
On the smoke.

188
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
And the truth is...

189
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
we died together once before.

190
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,400
Arthur,

191
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Freddie Thorne,

194
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,680
Jeremiah,

195
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,640
and John.

196
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,440
We were cut off from the retreat...

197
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,400
No bullets left, waiting for
the Prussian cavalry

198
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,240
to come and to finish us off.

199
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,280
And while we waited...

200
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,120
Jeremiah said, "We should sing,
'In the Bleak Midwinter.'"

201
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
But we were spared.

202
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
The enemy never came.

203
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,080
And we all agreed...

204
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,120
that everything after that was extra.

205
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,280
And when our time came...

206
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,440
we'd all remember.

207
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,560
POLLY: You remember that God spared you.

208
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,720
But what did you do with that
extra time that he gave you, eh, Thomas?

Do not return fire.

213
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,560
I repeat, do not return fire.
Stand down.

214
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,960
The men doing the firing
are on our side.

215
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,160
I took the trouble...

216
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,640
of giving an invitation
to Aberama Gold.

217
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh fuck! Now it's begun.

218
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,880
Put it out in the open on purpose.

219
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,440
You used John's funeral fire
as a fucking beacon.

220
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
ARTHUR: We were never
in any danger Polly.

221
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,040
You set a trap.

222
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,560
Finn? Finn? Go to
the yard and light the fires.

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,440
You set a trap with us as fucking bait.

224
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,600
Who's dead?

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,360
TOMMY: Our enemies.

226
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,440
-Who's dead?
-You wanna know, Poll?

227
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,560
Two fucking no good Italians
heard about the vendetta,

228
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,120
tried to make a fucking name
for themselves, that's who.

229
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,080
We got word to them about the funeral,

230
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
the where, the when...

231
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Told them where to
stand for the best shot.

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,760
TOMMY: And Aberama Gold
would do the rest.

233
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,400
That's the language of vendetta,

234
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,440
they take one of ours,
we take two of theirs.

235
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,160
You used your own brother's funeral.

236
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,320
When did we vote on this, Tommy?

237
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,080
Curly, get a boat ready
to take the bodies to the city.

238
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,680
And another boat for anyone,

239
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
anyone who wants no more part of this.

240
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,120
'Cause this is how it's gonna be.

241
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,320
Polly?

242
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm not staying for
this, Arthur, I'm going home.

243
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,880
Oh, yeah? Home's 57, Watery Lane.

244
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,200
You go there, lock
the doors, you wait for me.

245
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,320
Key to number 57.

246
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm going home to the country.

247
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
You will stay here until it's over.
Take the fucking key, Linda.

248
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
Look, away from here
you are a weakness to all of us.

249
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,160
They will take you hostage and the baby,

250
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,040
they will use the baby.

251
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,040
Take it. Put the kettle on,
wait for your husband.

252
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,720
The only way any of you
Shelbys will leave this place

253
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,920
is on a cloud of smoke like John.

254
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,680
Well, you're a Shelby now too, Linda.

255
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,120
Five hundred each.
A thousand for the brace.

256
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Where do you want them?

257
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,560
Charlie, take him to the yard.

258
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,000
TOMMY: Not too far
and not too deep, Curly,

259
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,520
I need the message to get through.

260
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,920
Okay, Tommy.

261
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,840
Finn, you go with him.

262
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,560
Go on. Go with him.

263
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,280
Oh, Tom, uh, tell Janet to
save me some goose, please.

264
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
On your feet.

265
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,240
Wait outside.

266
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
Hello, Mum.

267
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,040
POLLY: They said you'd be out cold.

268
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,800
-No, don't move.
-(SIGHS)

269
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,560
The doctor said they've
sewn you up like a football.

270
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,320
What else did he say?

271
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
He said you took four bullets.

272
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,160
Only one was live, one was ricochet...

273
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
Two were already spent.

274
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,480
Two had passed through John.

275
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Last thing I remember
was his face.

276
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,360
I watched him go.

277
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,760
Where's Tommy?

278
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,920
Oh, don't worry about Tommy,
just get better.

279
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
Where is he?

280
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,520
Tommy's back.

281
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,760
We're all back. Garrison,
Watery Lane, Charlie's...

282
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,280
-I need a cigarette.
-No.

283
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,840
I made a decision.

284
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
Give me a cigarette, Mum.

285
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
-It's not allowed.
-It's not allowed?

286
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
-I've decided we're gonna get away.
-Mm, yeah?

287
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,080
Just me and you, Australia.

288
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,440
I've been to the Cunard office
and I've got a magazine.

289
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,480
-Hmm.
-Now, America's no good

290
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,200
because that's where they are,
but there's no Italians in Australia.

291
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,960
I think there are, Mum.

292
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
Bad ones, I mean.

293
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,800
Have you stopped taking
those prison tablets?

294
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
Don't you worry about me.

295
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
Well, I do.

296
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,920
And just you get better.

297
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,920
The doctor says it'll be five weeks,
then you'll be up and walking.

298
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Now, there's a boat that
leaves on February the 13th.

299
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,880
Tell Tommy I need to see him.

300
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,520
Tell him to bring a gun small enough
to fit in the chamber pot, in case...

301
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,840
I've banned Tommy from coming.

302
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,080
The factory's coming
back to work tomorrow.

303
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,560
Just forget about the fucking factories.

304
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,200
Is there any word of
them going out on strike?

305
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,520
We can go to Australia,

306
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,880
it'll just be you, me, and your sister,

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
'cause I've found out where she was
buried, somewhere outside Melbourne.

308
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,360
Listen, Mum...

309
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm gonna get better slowly.

310
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
But you need to get better fast.

311
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,600
Without you he falls apart
and without him...

312
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
without him, they'll take us all.

313
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,320
You've got to get us through this.

314
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,760
And I promise...

315
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,280
I'll board that train with
you and we'll go to Australia.

316
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
I like your yard, Mr Strong.
How much would you take for it?

317
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
It's not for sale.

318
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,000
Not for sale?

319
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
Okay.

320
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,160
I just took a look around.
I like this place.

321
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,360
Fire for melting silver,
canal to get it away.

322
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,560
How much?

323
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,600
Nothing you see here
is for sale, Mr Gold.

324
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh, everything's for sale, everything.

325
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,440
You tell Mr Strong
I'm going to buy his yard.

326
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,360
This yard has been in
his family since they settled.

327
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,840
But I've decided to
make it part of our deal.

328
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,800
Charlie?

329
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
Charlie, come here.

330
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,720
I'm gonna spin a coin
for your yard, Charlie.

331
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
You're going to what?

332
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
If it's heads...

333
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,000
Abbie here takes all
of this with my blessing.

334
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
Tommy?

335
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,400
And if it's tails...

336
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
I fuck your daughter, Mr Gold.

337
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
You have three daughters I hear,

338
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,560
and Esmeralda is the oldest
and also the prettiest,

339
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,360
so I'll have her.

340
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,320
So make her part of the deal
and spin against the yard.

341
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Tommy, for fuck's sake.

342
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,720
Here, you toss the coin, Mr Gold.

343
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,880
No.

344
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,040
Please don't believe this is a joke,

345
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,040
the coin to us is sacred, yes, Arthur?

346
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,400
Sacred.

347
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,440
You toss that coin, you take
a bet before witnesses,

348
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,200
and if I win...

349
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
Then we'll insist

350
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,640
that the terms of this agreement...
wager are fulfilled.

351
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,360
Toss the coin, Mr Gold.

352
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
Tommy Shelby, OBE...

353
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,240
No wager today...

354
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,600
but with this penny I will buy
a flower to put on your grave...

355
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
When the time comes.

356
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
And before that time...

357
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,280
please don't again disrespect
my friends or their valued property.

358
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,200
We missed Christmas, let's have it now.

359
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,160
Peace on earth, goodwill to all men.

360
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,880
Drink?

361
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,920
Rum, Curly?

362
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,800
Toast to my brother, John,
raise your glasses all of you.

363
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,840
Raise them up, all of you.

364
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
John Shelby.

365
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,120
I've got wire, I've got chains,
I've got the steel rods. Now what?

366
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,760
Right, put the steel rods
up the geese's arse there,

367
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,080
and then you put those
steel rods above the fire,

368
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,360
spinning the rod to stop
the bird from burning.

369
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,400
ALL: Cheers!

370
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,120
JOHNNY: You did get potatoes, Charlie?

371
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,400
No, I didn't get fucking potatoes,
what's the matter with you?

372
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,520
I don't want that bastard Aberama Gold

373
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,960
putting it around that we live
like Diddycoys.

374
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,360
I want him to see that we live proper,
that we eat proper, in the proper way.

375
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,480
What the fuck are you talking about?

376
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,480
I'll get the potatoes me self.

377
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,320
Never thought my high
fucking heels from Paris

378
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,240
would be stepping through the horse shit
of Small Heath ever again.

379
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,000
Temporary, Polly.

380
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,400
LIZZIE: Yeah, until hell freezes over.

381
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
(CLEARS THROAT) How's Michael?

382
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,080
You said eight men from New York,
seven from Sicily, at £500 each?

383
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,640
Course you can afford it.

384
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,600
Most we'll do ourselves.

385
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,160
How many of your factories
are in the safe territories?

386
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
Seventy percent.

387
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,040
Shelby Company Limited
will continue to manufacture.

388
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,800
Lizzie says its only whores these days?

389
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,120
Yeah.

390
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Have them smuggled in, I suppose.

391
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
I need you back, Polly.

392
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,560
Paying whores for sex.

393
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,240
Paying killers to kill.

394
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Yep, nothing for nothing.

395
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
Poor Thomas.

396
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
You know, our mother went this way.

397
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,200
Spirits and ghosts, tablets,
fucking... fucking séances,

398
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,240
scaring us kids
halfway to fuckin' death.

399
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah, well. I'm not going that way.

400
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,440
'Cause in the smoke
I realised something.

401
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm just like you now.

402
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
You and Arthur.

403
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,520
I was dead in that noose
and then I was saved,

404
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,600
so everything from now on is extra.

405
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,480
But what I didn't understand until today

406
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,320
is when you're dead already...

407
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,000
you're free.

408
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,880
Fucking love it.

409
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,640
I'll help you because
Michael wants me to help you.

410
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,280
Starting now...

411
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,720
Get your whores vetted by Lizzie,
they'll use your weakness.

412
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,560
Don't take any new men on
in the factories

413
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
unless you know their families.

414
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,320
And your new friend,
Mr Aberama Gold...

415
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,200
he wants something
other than just money.

416
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,680
I see things in the air around people,
but it's not just the tablets.

417
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,560
It's real.

418
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,000
Ask him what he really wants.

419
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,160
She's a fine beast this one.

420
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Shelby.

421
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,160
You know your grandfather
camped with mine for a while?

422
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,160
Yep...

423
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
And didn't last.

424
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,120
No, it ended badly
in a pub called the Wenlock.

425
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,760
We were owed money, still are.

426
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,400
Other than money, and this
scrapyard that's clearly not for sale,

427
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,040
what is it that you
want from me, Mr Gold?

428
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,080
How do you know
I want anything from you?

429
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,400
Well, because my company treasurer

430
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,160
is a certified accountant
and also apparently, a witch.

431
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,360
You're a sporting man.

432
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,040
-Yes, I am.
-And a gambling man.

433
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,920
Bonnie, take off your shirt.

434
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,920
What I want from you, Mr Shelby,
is for you to take a gamble on him.

435
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I want you to help
my son achieve his ambition.

436
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,760
(GRUNTING)

437
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,840
What ambition might that be?

438
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
(KNOCKING <i>AT</i> DOOR)

439
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,280
(KNOCKING)

440
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,640
Who is it?

441
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,040
Inspector Moss.

442
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,480
-I'm looking for Tommy.
-He's at Charlie's.

443
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,880
But I wouldn't go there,
some bad men have arrived.

444
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
Yes, I've heard.

445
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,960
They'll be drunk by now, or worse.

446
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,480
Can you take a message?

447
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,760
The, uh, intelligence service in London

448
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,160
have sent seven officers up
to Birmingham

449
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,760
to check out the investigation
into communists and seditionists.

450
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,040
They've got a list of people
of great interest and, uh,

451
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,640
top of that list is
Ada Thorne, formerly Shelby.

452
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,200
Now, they seem to think that
she came back from New York

453
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,840
to organise a revolution in Birmingham.

454
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,480
Well, tell them they're wrong.

455
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,760
Ada Shelby's now firmly back
in place in the family business.

456
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,760
Thing is, when you get
a mark against your name...

457
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,600
it's very hard to shift it.

458
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,920
They will come looking for her.

459
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,640
Well, tell them there's a queue.
Everybody wants a Shelby.

no less dangerous than any Italians.

You tell Tommy,
I think he'll understand.

463

-Oh, hello.

horse. I'm a little early, I think.

-Yeah, they call them the Mafia.

and, and Polly's back,

so it's gonna be okay, yeah.

00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,840
uh, the convener with
the boiler makers unit at 11 :00,

483
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,440
and then Chamber of Commerce at 1 :00.

484
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,640
But that isn't the thing...

485
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,040
Right. Clear a space here,
move this car back,

486
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,320
give me a hundred feet of rope
and a bell.

487
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,240
-Rope?
-Yep, and a bell.

488
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,840
Mr Shelby, this place
is about to explode.

489
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
A rope and a bell, Devlin.

490
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,080
Bonnie, this way.

491
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,520
Yes, Mr Shelby.

492
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,280
And by the way, the revolution
is scheduled to begin at noon.

493
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,160
TOMMY: There he is, Billy Mills,

494
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
former heavyweight champion,

495
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,280
Staffordshire, Warwickshire
and Worcestershire.

496
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,440
Hello, Billy.

497
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,640
Yeah.

498
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,520
And now I work for you, Mr Shelby,

499
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,240
for not enough money.

500
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,400
Right. That enough for you?

501
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,440
Enough for what?

502
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,200
Someone here who wants to fight you.
Bonnie Gold, come here, son.

503
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,320
I'm a heavyweight,

504
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
he's a welterweight at best.

505
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,960
Nevertheless, he wants to fight you.

506
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,520
Yeah. And then when I damage him,
the Blinders will take my eyes.

507
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,560
No comeback, Billy,
just a fight, Queens bury Rules.

508
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,360
BILLY: When?
TOMMY: Now.

509
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,760
BILLY: Where?
TOMMY: Here!

510
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,440
ARTHUR: Right, you lot, come here.

511
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,080
Let's make it interesting.
Come place a wager with me.

512
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,800
I'll give you good odds.

513
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,520
I'll give you good odds on the boy,
even better on the big lad.

514
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,640
There you go, what you want?

515
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,400
Bonnie, come here, son.

516
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,760
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

517
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,600
-Give him one!
-Let's have it then!

518
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,200
Your boy knows he can hit back, right?

519
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,440
Told him in the professional game
people want their money's worth,

520
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,000
don't win too fast.

521
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
But if you've seen enough...

522
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,120
Finish it, Bonnie.

523
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,560
Fuck me. That was a punch.

524
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
What's he got, horseshoes
in those gloves or what?

525
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,840
No, just his dad's strength
and his mother's temper.

526
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,320
TOMMY: Does he have fits?
ABARAMAH: No.

527
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,080
-Asthma?
-No.

528
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,360
How's he cut?

529
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,640
Well, no one's cut him
yet, but his skin's thick.

530
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,840
-Does he drink?
-Water, sometimes.

531
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
-How many fights?
-Twenty-five, bare knuckle,

532
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,560
all knockouts, five with gloves
in pastures, all knockouts.

533
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,560
Against Romany fighters?

534
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
That's why they won't let us in the
fairs no more, he keeps winning.

535
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,120
I could fight a fucking tree
and knock it out, Mr Shelby.

536
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,560
(LAUGHS) I like him. I like it.

537
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,240
-Mrs Eden is waiting upstairs
-I'll be there in a minute. Arthur?

538
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,400
Mr Shelby's on his way.

539
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,960
Fight in the workshop?

540
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,920
No, no, just a bit of sport.

541
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Do you want some more tea?

542
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,560
No, what kind of sport?

543
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,720
Sport between men, Mrs Eden.

544
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,720
Actually, I'm Miss Eden.

545
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,280
Be patient, a good man will come.

546
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,200
TOMMY: What do you think?
ARTHUR: No, that was over fast.

547
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, but you can tell, eh?

548
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,560
I'd give him to the Irish boys
at Digbeth, they can teach him.

549
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,400
-And then what?
-We promote him.

550
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,560
Big money in London,
New York, if he's good.

551
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,120
We control him.

552
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,040
On the book, control the odds,
like a horse.

553
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,280
Control when he wins, when he loses.
Alfie Solomon runs a fighter,

554
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,040
says it's fuckin' money for nothing,
fighting's been good for us,

555
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,640
better if you know who's gonna win.

556
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,680
But we got a lot going on, that's all.

557
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,120
Yeah. That's why it'd be good
to have the kid around.

558
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,600
We take the fucking kid on,

559
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,880
one day he may end up
fucking taking a bullet for you.

560
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,400
Can't afford to lose
another brother, can I?

561
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,680
No one else is like him,
so he's all right.

562
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,560
Come on.

563
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,400
All right, I'll do it.

564
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,280
ABARAMAH: But we need to
do a deal about money.

565
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,800
-ARTHUR: Hmm.
-Yeah. Speak to my accountant.

566
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,280
-The witch?
-Yeah.

567
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,840
So when will my first real
fight be do you think, Mr Shelby?

568
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,200
Soon as we can find anyone stupid
enough to get in the ring with you.

569
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,600
God help him.

570
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,120
There you go, Bonnie.

571
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,640
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

572
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,520
-There you go, the lion's share.
-Thank you.

573
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,240
Mr Shelby...
I understand you've had a bereavement.

574
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
TOMMY: I'm here to talk business.

575
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,840
Then I'll be blunt.

576
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
As will I.

577
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,680
What you're doing here is robbery.

578
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,240
Every man is free to leave.

579
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,720
You cut five shillings
from the weekly wage.

580
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,840
And you said, if I did that

581
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,240
you'd bring every man and woman
in all my factories out on strike.

582
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,120
Yes.

583
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,800
Do you have a whistle?

584
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,440
If so, blow it.

585
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,400
I thought at least
we might have a discussion,

586
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,000
as I do with other owners.

587
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,360
I'm not other owners.

588
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,960
No.

589
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,960
You believe because coal is expensive
and it's been a cold winter

590
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,240
and because wages have been
cut over the past twelve months,

591
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,000
you think because of all that
nobody will walk out on strike,

592
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,640
because no one can afford to.

593
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,480
And until recently
that would've been true.

594
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
But something has changed
this past year.

595
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,800
Cold winter in the east,
people are not afraid anymore.

596
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,480
I have it on very good authority

597
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,520
that the Bolsheviks couldn't
organise a fucking picnic.

598
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,640
You know, Mr Shelby...

599
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,360
It's almost as if you want trouble.

600
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,040
If the rule of law
in Birmingham were to break down

601
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,680
during this period
of turmoil for my family,

602
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,480
then yes, that would
indeed have its benefits

603
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,280
for reasons you could not understand.

604
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,720
I've heard rumours.

605
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,520
Sport between men.

606
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,480
Just blow your fucking whistle, eh?

I did say this would happen.

Who's next?

618
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,360
Um, he's a, a delegate from
the European Council for Trade.

619
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,640
He's here to talk about
the import of car parts to France.

620
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,200
-Right.
-He's come all the way from Paris,

621
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,440
but given the circumstances
I could send him away?

622

Given what circumstances? Send him in.

623
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,280
Mr Shelby, this is
Monsieur Paz from Paris.

624
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,520
I heard you had trouble.

625

It's good of you to see me.

626

You just came from Paris, eh?

627
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,280
You know Paris?

628
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,760
I left Paris in a cattle truck.

629
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,960
They said you were French.

630
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,720
Well, I came here from Paris.

631
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
That does not mean I'm French.

632
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,840
Guess where I'm from.

633
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,840
Well, in my cattle truck in Paris...

634
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,480
There were American
soldiers who played cards.

635
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,960
They sound like you.

636

Yeah. Did you win?

637
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,840
You didn't come on a train. Your suit
is pressed, your shoes are clean.

Where do you get your suits made?

639
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,640
I have a tailor in New York City.

640
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,600
Look.

641
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,360
Funacci, Italian.

642
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,040
He's my uncle.

643
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,520
He makes suits in
the basement of Madge Street.

644
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,680
He is my uncle,

645
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,720
so every stitch, stitched with blood.

646
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,960
I heard you dress well, Mr Shelby,

647
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,360
but now I see...

648
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,640
not so well as me.

649
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,640
You know, I have uncles as well...

650
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,200
But they're not the sort of men who
would, who would work in a basement

651
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,640
with a needle and thread,

652
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Mr Changretta.

653
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,680
I am surprised how easy it was
to get into a room with you.

654
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,720
And now?

655
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,160
And now?

656
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
And now you should know

657
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,480
that during the trouble you
had earlier on your factory floor

658
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,840
I sent an accomplice
into your office in overalls.

659
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,480
He found your gun...

660
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,520
and unloaded it.

661
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,560
Arthur Shelby.

662
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,000
Polly Gray.

663
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,320
Michael Gray.

664
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,920
John Shelby.

665
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,320
Spent.

666
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,040
Ada Thorne.

667
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,440
And finally...

668
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,480
Tommy Shelby.

669
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,000
None of you will survive.

670
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,880
You're level of security is pitiful

671
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,240
and we are an organisation
of a different dimension.

672
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,520
I could've killed you when
I walked through the door.

673
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,280
But you see...

674
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,520
I want you to be the last.

675
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,800
I want you to be alive after
your entire family is dead

676
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,000
'cause my mother says

677
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,360
that is what will hurt you the most.

678
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,400
You people have
traditions of hon our, as do we.

679
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,520
Instead of sending you a black hand,
I could've had you killed in the night.

680
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,000
I don't know why...

681
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,120
But I want you to know why

682
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,400
and I wanna suggest to you that
we fight this vendetta with hon our.

683
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,480
No civilians, no children.

684
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,040
No police.

685
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,280
Welcome to Birmingham, Mr Changretta.

686
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,760
<i>Grazie.</i>

687
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,920
<i># Where the road is dark</i>

688
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,600
<i># And the seed is sown
Where the gun is cocked... #</i>

689
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,880
Ah, that smell. I miss it.

690
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,560
What, the shit house?

691
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,080
No. I don't know what it is.

692
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,640
Birmingham, I suppose. Small Heath.

693
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,680
-That smell.
-The smell brings it back.

694
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,720
Where's John do you think, Tom?

695
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,440
Fuck knows.

696
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,480
Well, he's gone, though.

697
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,280
Like a hole behind your head.

698
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,720
Thought you thought
there was are heaven.

699
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,000
No. More like hell for our John.

700
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,920
No, neither one.

701
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,920
He's just not here anymore.

702
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,600
<i># Now I been out in the desert</i>

703
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,200
<i># Just doin' my time</i>

704
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,080
<i>#Searchin' through the dust</i>

705
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,640
<i># Lookin' for a sign</i>

706
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,120
<i>#if there's a light up ahead... #</i>

707
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,000
It's like with Grace, Arthur...

708
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,440
They're just gone,

709
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,720
just fucking gone.

710
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,400
<i>#I got this fever burn in'
in my soul #</i>

711
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,880
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man #</i>

712
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,080
<i># In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand #</i>

713
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:58,104
