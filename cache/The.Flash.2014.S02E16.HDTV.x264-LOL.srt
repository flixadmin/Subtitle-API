1
00:00:01,448 --> 00:00:02,962
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,987 --> 00:00:05,721
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:09,532
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:12,592
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:16,196
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,098
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,468
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,745
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,151
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:29,403
Previously on “The Flash”...

11
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,138
We've got Turtle locked
up in the Pipeline.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,706
All we got to do is
use him to figure out

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,041
how to steal Zoom's speed.

14
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:36,205
That might take longer than we thought.

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,929
- Why's that?
- Because Turtle's dead.

16
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:40,532
You need to figure out
what triggers your vibes.

17
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,822
Sometimes it's when I touch something

18
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:44,440
that belongs to a breacher;
sometimes it just happens.

19
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:45,549
There's always a cause.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,052
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

21
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,487
I'm here.

22
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,877
You want me to leave
everything I have here?

23
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,271
I mean, my life...

24
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:52,151
You don't have a life here anymore.

25
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,488
Zoom is too powerful.

26
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,791
Close it. Close it now.

27
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,893
- No!
- Augh!

28
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,041
Jay's death was not in vain.

29
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:02,498
We will meet Zoom again.

30
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,233
And the next time, I will beat him,

31
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,627
whoever that monster is.

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,583
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

33
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:24,119
Uh, it didn't look this deep on the map.

34
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:25,487
That's 'cause maps are flat.

35
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,348
This is, like, 1,000 feet deep.

36
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,121
Well, you want to get faster.

37
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:32,158
Maybe plummeting to your death
is the motivation you need.

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,327
So to reach escape velocity,

39
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,097
you're gonna have to go...

40
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,832
that fast.

41
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,101
Well, that fast is impossible.
I can promise you that.

42
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,005
Ah, “Nothing in life is
promised except death”"

43
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,708
- Edgar Allan Poe?
- Kanye West.

44
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,477
If it makes you feel any
better, Evel Knievel

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,379
cleared a line of cars
that was twice this long,

46
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,147
and he didn't even have superpowers,

47
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,951
unless you count that sweet-ass ride.

48
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,519
- Do you hear yourself?
- What?

49
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,887
Look, you're gonna be fine.

50
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,255
I'm 80% sure of it.

51
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,224
- Okay.
- 76.

52
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,726
Like, a strong 72.

53
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,861
I can't stop, Caitlin, help.

54
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,931
If you don't feel ready, you
probably shouldn't do it.

55
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,299
Not helpful.

56
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,767
Look, Zoom's still out there.

57
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,202
And once I find a way back to Earth-2,

58
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,536
I have to be faster than him.

59
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,773
And, I mean, right now... I wasn't even

60
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,776
fast enough to save Jay.

61
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:27,079
I have to try.

62
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,807
He's gonna make it.

63
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,516
- No!
- Oh, damn.

64
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,897
“Why'd you have to bring
those drones along, Cisco”"

65
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,533
“Oh, I don't know.”
You're welcome, everyone.

of solo albums.

69
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,514
Pop music would never be the same

70
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,750
after Beyoncé left Destiny's Child.

71
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,785
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

72
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,020
They mean Senator Knowles?

73
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,760
Scooch.

74
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,428
What?

75
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,163
So how'd it go?

76
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,732
Well, he's not a red splat
on the side of a mountain.

77
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,401
That's our new definition of success?

78
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,702
It's one of them.

79
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,504
So, you didn't make the canyon jump?

80
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,406
No. What else can we try?

81
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,708
A bigger canyon?

82
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,176
Okay, fine, no more canyons.

83
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,511
I know I crack this.

84
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,346
I've just been going about it wrong.

85
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,815
I need to find my leg up.
Have we factored in drag?

86
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,517
Wells, can we rerun the simulation?

87
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,718
Let it go for now.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,920
Zoom's still out there.

89
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,189
He's terrorizing a whole world
full of people, your world.

90
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,724
You know, I'm not doing this for fun.

91
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,526
Barry, we've been working
on this all week.

92
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,927
You're tired, we're tired.

93
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,263
Yeah, what we need is some downtime.

94
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,398
Downtime leads to
increased productivity,

95
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,202
ergo we have to have fun.

96
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,837
And the best way to have fun

97
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,572
is for us to go out to the club.

98
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,808
Am I right, Team Flash?

99
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,110
Let's get turnt!

100
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,578
No, but seriously, we need a break.

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,946
You know, I think Cisco's right,

102
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,281
and if I'm saying we need a break,

103
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,649
then you know it's serious.

104
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,318
All right, let's go out tonight.

105
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,389
Oh, yeah. Can I go?

106
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,258
Over my dead body.

107
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,726
Look, just 'cause you're
stuck in this lab all day

108
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:54,927
doesn't mean I should be too.

109
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:57,296
Over my rotting corpse.

110
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,798
Look, what happened to trying
new things, meeting new people?

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,500
You said I should start
a life here, right?

112
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,169
And Zoom's over there,
and we're over here,

113
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:05,237
so there's nothing to worry about.

114
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,206
There's always something to worry about.

115
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,475
Okay, well, you said Barry
and them are good people

116
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,876
and I should get to know them.

117
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,781
- I did.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,716
And you know they'll keep
me safe no matter what.

119
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,318
Look, I have a life to live, Dad,

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,753
and whole world to explore.

121
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,154
Please?

122
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,657
Please?

123
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,396
Fine.

124
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,666
But if you're gonna go, you
should take protection.

125
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,201
Oh, Dad,

126
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,303
I don't need... I don't
know what you thought

127
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:39,104
I was gonna be doing, but I...

128
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,310
Oh, right.

129
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,979
I mean, is it necessary?
It's kind of, you know...

130
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:50,316
Or I could always build you
an inescapable daughter cube.

131
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,818
Funny.

132
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,788
You know I'd get out though, right?

133
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,326
All right, fine. I'll do it.

134
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:03,495
Thank you.

135
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,186
Oh, God, sorry. It keeps doing that.

136
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,554
My dad made me wear it.

137
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,989
Don't worry about it. It's all good.

138
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,457
I'm really glad you came, Jesse,

139
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,993
even though this place
is less than ideal.

140
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,930
Hey, toast?

141
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,832
To Jay.

142
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,268
I wonder what Jay would say
if he was here right now.

143
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,136
“What's a Kamikaze”"

144
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,038
And then you'd spend ten
minutes explaining it.

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,474
And he'd say, “Just kidding.
We have those on Earth-2.”

146
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,142
Yeah, well, we don't have those, so...

147
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,044
Eh-eh, I'm sorry, Miss Underage.

148
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,613
None of us plan on getting
murdered by your father tonight.

149
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,849
- Oh, whatever, he's all talk.
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,618
Yo, guys, what's up?

151
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,919
- Hey.
- Hey.

152
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,921
Glad you could make it.

153
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,323
What's up, Wally?

154
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,892
Hey, interesting choice of venue.

155
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,260
The tic-tac-toe theme is cool.

156
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,662
- Barry picked it.
- Cisco picked it.

157
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,096
- I...
- For real?

158
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,698
Yeah, I picked it. I don't go out much.

159
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,166
It had four stars on Yelp, so...

160
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,669
- Okay, fair enough.
- So who's this?

161
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,672
This is Wally. He's my...

162
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:23,008
foster, or step... adopted...

163
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,543
My new... this is... he's my new friend.

164
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,778
This is Jesse.

165
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,914
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

166
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,250
So, Jesse, are you new in town?

167
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,085
Yeah, you could say that.

168
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,953
Yeah, me too. Are you from far away?

169
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,922
Like you wouldn't believe.

170
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,092
Oh, you know what?

171
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,927
Would you just excuse me?

172
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,331
I just need to go powder my... watch.

173
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,999
Mm-hmm.

174
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,737
Hey, so I know I'm
practically your brother,

175
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:56,775
and I'm, like, half Jay's
size, but you want to dance?

176
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,645
- Sure.
- Come on, let's go.

177
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,855
Stupid watch.

178
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:14,026
All right, buddy, you have
beeped your last beep.

179
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,498
Something else rising also,

180
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,002
some dark instinct about what I would do

181
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,438
to the person who had taken you,

182
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,140
the things I would do.

183
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,254
So how's Wally doing?

184
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,424
Yeah, he's good; he's just
diving into his schoolwork.

185
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:46,658
- Good.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,161
I'm glad.

187
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,096
Oh, God.

188
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,637
Promise me if we ever do get married,

189
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,006
you will not do that
dance at our wedding.

190
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,442
Oh, I can promise you that.

191
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:08,213
I mean, not the wedding, the dancing.

192
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,382
What?

193
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,050
I don't know; I just think it's weird

194
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,020
that were married in the
future and on Earth-2.

195
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,627
I wonder what our married
doppelgangers are doing tonight.

196
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,730
Probably Earth-2's equivalent
of “Netflix and chill.”

197
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,334
Sounds nice. I mean, for them.

198
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,884
- It was The Flash!
- My wallet's gone.

199
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,454
Someone took my purse.

200
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,440
Who the hell are you?

201
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,553
Okay, I got it. Thanks, man.

202
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,078
- Hey.
- Hey, excuse me.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,233
What happened last night?

204
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,881
I know you didn't rob these people.

205
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:20,549
No, I was bored. Thought
I'd have some fun.

206
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,485
Well, look, whoever did
this, they got everyone

207
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,658
within a ten-block radius
in under six minutes.

208
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:25,855
You couldn't catch them?

209
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,653
No, this speedster's
faster than me, I guess.

210
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,455
Unbelievable. Hey, babe.

211
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,380
Hey, so I spoke to that girl over there.

212
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,316
She snapped a photo of the red blur.

213
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,420
- Look familiar?
- This is not good.

214
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,055
I know, it looks exactly like the photo

215
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,857
I took of you last year.

216
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,125
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

217
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:45,294
- We always do.
- Hey.

218
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,562
Oh, it's work. I've got to go.

219
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,230
Keep me posted, okay?

220
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,032
Joe, I don't want people
thinking The Flash

221
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,600
is a petty thief.

222
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,102
Well, we need to get to
work squashing those rumors

223
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:56,805
before they spread.

224
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:00,542
Here it is, people: evidence
that The Flash has gone rogue.

225
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,277
Couldn't it be the
speedster in the helmet?

226
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,146
The photo speaks for itself.

227
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,683
No helmet glare, confirming that
this is The Scarlet Speedster.

228
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:09,151
We're gonna expose him as a fraud.

229
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:10,886
McKay, I want you at
the police department

230
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:12,287
getting any interview you can.

231
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,689
Okay, on it.

232
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,524
Williams, eyewitness encounters.

233
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,126
The people of this city need to know

234
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:20,696
what it feels like to
be robbed by a hero.

235
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:24,033
West, I want you to do a piece
on it from your perspective.

236
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,301
You were there last night.
You've seen him in action.

237
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:28,137
Okay, but why would The
Flash need to make off

238
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,472
with a couple of hundred bucks
when he's saved so many lives?

239
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:32,808
I mean, he is actually a hero.

240
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,611
Iris, you're a smart woman.
You can't be that naive.

241
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,012
We live in a city full of meta-humans

242
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,548
who continually do whatever they want,

243
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,517
The Flash included.

244
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,785
Write it up,

245
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:46,188
his journey from streak to freak,

246
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,690
due on my desk tomorrow.

247
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:10,946
So... fun night?

248
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:15,651
Before all the chaos broke loose?

249
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:21,323
Then I would do anything
to get you back,

250
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:25,060
including killing a man.

251
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:28,530
Tell me I'm not hearing this right.

252
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,138
No, that's true.

253
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,443
Zoom had you.

254
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:44,980
Zoom needed The Flash's speed.

255
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:47,783
And it was him or you.

256
00:12:47,785 --> 00:12:50,886
And I was not going to lose you.

257
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,922
You know, you were my hero.

258
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,091
My dad, the brilliant scientist

259
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,594
who could accomplish
anything he put his mind to.

260
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,629
He taught me I could
never dream too big.

261
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:04,533
But now...

262
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,968
now you're a killer,

263
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,469
and I barely recognize you at all.

264
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:08,704
- Jesse...
- No, no, no.

265
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,239
Don't... don't worry.

266
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,707
I'm not going far.

267
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,012
I mean, where did this
speedster even come from?

268
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,514
I don't know, man.

269
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,649
All I know is that blur made
60 smackeroos off of me.

270
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,417
Ridiculous.

271
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,553
Maybe it's another one of
Zoom's henchmen somehow?

272
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,921
The breaches are closed.

273
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,556
The only other way to become a speedster

274
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,191
is from a particle
accelerator explosion.

275
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:30,392
Okay, but then why only

276
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,528
make yourself known now?

277
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,029
You see what I'm saying?

278
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,864
We'd have had to seen
them in action before.

279
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,699
I'm not saying it makes
sense; I'm just saying

280
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,568
that's the only other way
to become a speedster.

281
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,303
Actually, there's another way.

282
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,576
It's called Velocity-9.

283
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,279
Ooh, that's a sexy-ass name. What is it?

284
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,014
It's a speed drug.

285
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,382
Jay took it when you were on Earth-2

286
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,450
to save the city from a meta-human.

287
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:58,253
What? How could you not tell me this?

288
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,589
I promised Jay I wouldn't.

289
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,959
Jay, what do you... why?

290
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,729
Because Jay knew how
dangerous this drug is.

291
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:10,632
I should know, Barry; Snow
and I worked on it together.

292
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,970
Guys, I have been busting
my butt out there,

293
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,672
pushing myself to the limit,

294
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:18,807
trying to get better,
trying to be faster,

295
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,409
and you're telling me that
there's been something

296
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,277
this whole time that could've helped me?

297
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,012
This could've helped me take down Zoom.

298
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:27,015
It could have helped me
save Earth-2 Joe, save Jay.

299
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,383
Jay was sick.

300
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,052
The drug that he took
to regain his speed

301
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:33,422
was also causing cellular degeneration.

302
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,424
It was killing him.

303
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,759
I tried to help, I tried to find a cure,

304
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:41,597
but in all my experiments, the
effects were just temporary.

305
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,233
The V-9 is deadly.

306
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,636
Why not tell me this? Why
keep me in the dark?

307
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,304
Caitlin.

308
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,941
Where am I?

309
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,287
- Are you okay?
- Did you vibe?

310
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,488
Uh...

311
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,859
Meta-human.

312
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:13,295
Yeah, social media app for the win.

313
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,197
Bad Flash is back.

314
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,602
Bad Flash... what?

315
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,504
No. I'm losing my touch over here.

316
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,383
He's coming up on Fifth and Everett.

317
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:37,019
You can use the alley to cut him off.

318
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,121
A lady speedster?

319
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,113
It only took us two years,
but we finally got one,

320
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,748
a lady speedster.

321
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,888
Hey, here's a question for
you, purely scientific,

322
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:09,889
was she good-looking?

323
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,125
You know, I was a little busy
getting my ass handed to me,

324
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,589
so I didn't really notice.

325
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,180
Right, right, right, but, you know,

326
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,682
next time, for science?

327
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,417
Okay, yeah, next time she
punches me in the face,

328
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,651
I'll be sure to get her number.

329
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:20,578
There you go.

330
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,483
But the question remains, who is she?

331
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,118
I have no idea.

332
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,819
We could run her through
the facial recognition.

333
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,187
She had a mask on.

334
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,023
- What was her suit like?
- Hey.

335
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:30,924
- Hey, it's a valid question.
- It is, actually.

336
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,193
How was her suit constructed?

337
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,596
It was good. It was very good.

338
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,464
It was like mine.

339
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,199
It was made by somebody

340
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,435
who understands the
needs of a speedster.

341
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:45,973
So that would be someone with
access to tech and a lab.

342
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:49,610
Oh, no. I'm having a very bad thought.

343
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,348
When I designed V-9,

344
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,650
I was having trouble formatting
the extracellular matrix,

345
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,452
so I called a colleague
of mine at Mercury Labs

346
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,888
for some assistance, Eliza Harmon.

347
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,623
She knows how to make this speed drug?

348
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,024
No, I followed the protocols

349
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:05,626
of information compartmentalization.

350
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,828
I only gave her three
of the eight components

351
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,563
necessary for V-9's structure.

352
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,665
Okay, so she didn't
have the full recipe.

353
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,967
Unless she reverse
engineered her own V-9.

354
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,369
Eliza's a genius, but that's way

355
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:16,704
out of character for her.

356
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,005
Well, it's worth taking a look.

357
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,273
I'll go see her.

358
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,041
Hey, I'm coming too.

359
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,579
Great.

360
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,181
I'm gonna go train.

361
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,630
Knock-knock.

362
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,733
Am I hallucinating, or is that disgraced

363
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:48,001
ex-Mercury employee Caitlin Snow?

364
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,703
Eliza Harmon, burning the midnight oil.

365
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:51,338
Don't you ever take a break?

366
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,540
Well, you know what they
say, these thiocyanate ions

367
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,775
won't bond themselves.

368
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,845
- Hi.
- Hi.

369
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,680
Who is your handsome friend?

370
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:02,549
- Detective Joe West, ma'am.
- Detective?

371
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,151
What brings you around these parts?

372
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:05,786
Well, that's a funny story.

373
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,621
You know how there's a
speedster that's been

374
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:08,889
wreaking havoc on the city?

375
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,324
Yeah, I heard The Flash went nuts.

376
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,192
Fame will do it to you.

377
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,328
I guess some people can't
handle the limelight, right?

378
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,697
Well, we happen to know
it was someone else.

379
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:20,300
That's why we're here looking into this.

380
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:24,805
Wow, how very “Law &
Orde”" of you, Caitlin.

381
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:27,608
Do you remember that formula

382
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,010
that you were helping me
with a few months ago?

383
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,345
Yeah, vaguely.

384
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,447
We think that it was somehow involved.

385
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,982
How? What did you have me working on?

386
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,683
It's classified,

387
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,952
but let's just say it was
some kind of enhancement,

388
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,989
and we're afraid that
my research was stolen.

389
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,657
Not from this lab.

390
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:49,663
Okay, between you and me, the
place is pretty vulnerable.

391
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,765
Ever since that break-in
a few months ago,

392
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,567
some of us think McGee
hasn't sufficiently

393
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,203
stepped up security, but I
kept my research on lock

394
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,472
and destroyed the originals
when it was given back to you.

395
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:03,377
But hey, you're free to look
around my lab if you want.

396
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,145
I don't think that'll be necessary.

397
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,980
Sorry. I wish I could be more help.

398
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,349
It's okay. It's actually
kind of a relief.

399
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,151
Will you call me if you
hear anything, though?

400
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:14,621
Of course. That's what friends are for.

401
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,156
Thank you.

402
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,496
So what do you think?

403
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:23,964
For now, we take her at her word.

404
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,542
West, how's your article coming?

405
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,144
Um, great.

406
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,979
I have a source who knows for a fact

407
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,281
that this speedster is not The Flash

408
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,549
but an imposter.

409
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,585
Ah, who's your source?

410
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:47,321
I am not at liberty to say.

411
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:48,922
Well, if you can't tell me your source,

412
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:51,058
I'm running the original story.

413
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,160
Wait, wait, wait.

414
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:56,163
You're right; what's one unnamed source

415
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,466
compared to dozens of eyewitnesses?

416
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,668
Honestly, I'm just...
I'm having a hard time

417
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,038
wrapping my head around
your vision for the story.

418
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,674
Something isn't adding up.

419
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:11,812
How about we talk about it some more?

420
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:14,014
Grab some coffee? What you say?

421
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:16,350
Coffee? Right now?

422
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,018
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,354
I mean, a little caffeine
never hurt anybody, right?

424
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,223
Sure.

425
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,475
I'm so tired.

426
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,577
Oh, well, you've been
pushing yourself too hard.

427
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,846
No, not hard enough.

428
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:47,748
I'm sick of always being passed over

429
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,417
for the grant, for the promotion.

430
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,052
I'm underpaid and understaffed

431
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:54,354
and six months behind on my research.

432
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:56,156
That's why I started all of this.

433
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:58,325
Your problem is you're too
much of a perfectionist.

434
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,094
You don't have to be.
There's beauty in chaos.

435
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:02,996
I don't have time for chaos.

436
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,698
This was supposed to fix things,

437
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,033
and it ended up making it worse.

438
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:07,534
Oh, silly girl.

439
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,102
You know it makes you feel better

440
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:11,605
to blow off some steam.

441
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,206
You will say anything for a fix.

442
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,042
It's your fault we're hooked.

443
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:16,777
It's Caitlin's fault;
if she didn't want us

444
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,412
to find out what she was working on,

445
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:21,448
she shouldn't have made it so damn easy.

446
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:36,797
There's not enough for both of us.

447
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,699
We... we need to save
it for an emergency.

448
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:41,768
You take it now; worry
about getting more later.

449
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,071
You'll thank me.

450
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,802
I know what's best for us

451
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:17,537
and where to get more.

452
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,652
Whatcha doing?

453
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:34,788
- Training.
- Training?

454
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,258
Allen, don't be stupid.

455
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:44,331
I know you took the V-9, Allen.

456
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,166
- No I haven't.
- Oh, no?

457
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,667
No.

458
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,637
I took it, but I haven't taken it yet.

459
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,740
- Good.
- Tell me why I shouldn't.

460
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,942
Figure it out.

461
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:57,511
If the game is already rigged,

462
00:22:57,513 --> 00:22:59,046
why can't I level the playing field?

463
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:00,680
I mean, if everybody else is cheating,

464
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:03,984
how can... I want to be fast enough

465
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:05,419
to stop Zoom and any speedster

466
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,854
that tries to hurt my friends.

467
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:10,123
Shouldn't I use everything
in my power to do that?

468
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,092
You want to take a
shortcut; is that right?

469
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:13,894
You want to take a shortcut?
Remember this.

470
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:17,397
You lose a chunk of your humanity

471
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:20,700
every time you compromise your values.

472
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:25,372
Sorry, that's really
good coming from you.

473
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:27,641
So don't be like me.

474
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,709
Be better.

475
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,046
Be like Jay.

476
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,500
Are you okay?

477
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:54,768
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

478
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,973
Hey, any luck locating our speedster

479
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,775
since Eliza checked out?

480
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:03,110
I'm still working on it, but...

481
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:13,420
Hey!

482
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,957
Time to have some fun.

483
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:26,115
Hey! Cisco! Hey, Joe!

484
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,908
Hey, she's got me in the Pipeline!

485
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,622
- What do you want?
- Where's the V-9, Caity?

486
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,935
I need a fix.

487
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,351
Eliza, is that you?

488
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:45,953
Oh, Eliza's not here right now.

489
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:47,555
My name is Trajectory.

490
00:24:47,557 --> 00:24:49,657
Oh, why do the crazy ones
always name themselves?

491
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:53,294
Look, Eliza, Velocity-9
is very dangerous, okay?

492
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:54,862
It made a friend of mine very sick,

493
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:57,031
and he already had the
speed force in him.

494
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,265
Look, your cellular system...

495
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,967
Enough!

496
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:02,670
You are boring me to death.

497
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,906
Hand over the V.

498
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:07,508
I'm a physician. I took an oath.

499
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,276
I can't give you anything
that will hurt you.

500
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,979
Right, so either hand over the V,

501
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:13,280
or the cat guy gets it.

502
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:15,516
Oh!

503
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:26,660
Hey, move, now.

504
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,662
Look, all the flasks are gone.

505
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:30,931
There's nothing left.

506
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,567
Hey, I was really hoping
you wouldn't make me do

507
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:35,769
one of those “I have to
kill you each one by one

508
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,538
until you give me what I want.”

509
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,073
Oh, well.

510
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:40,341
Wait.

511
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:41,909
Wait.

512
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:45,846
You want V-9?

513
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,550
We'll make it for you.

514
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:50,851
Dad, you can't.

515
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,654
We have all the ingredients.

516
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:56,824
I'm not a patient person,
so better move fast.

517
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:15,075
Ah, latte for me, and a Flash for you.

518
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:17,845
Wow, this guy even gets a
drink named after him.

519
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,980
Yes, he does; he's saved
a lot of people's lives.

520
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:22,249
They just want to show
their appreciation.

521
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:24,718
A little too much, if you ask me.

522
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,255
Why can't you see what
everyone else sees?

523
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:30,457
A few years back, I won
the Dornfeld Award

524
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:31,992
for Investigative Reporting

525
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:33,928
for my story on corruption
in the mayor's office.

526
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,232
I investigated a man
that everyone loved.

527
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:41,602
The mayor was young,
telegenic, a former war hero.

528
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:44,405
He was voted in with
overwhelming popular support.

529
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,273
It was...

530
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:50,477
But... but I knew that his
campaign was bought and paid for

531
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,979
by the mob.

532
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:54,949
Okay, but not everyone
is a corrupt mayor.

533
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,917
But I saw him for what everyone else

534
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,886
was too blind to see.

535
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:00,554
Everyone wants a hero.

536
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:03,090
Yeah, but in this case, The
Flash actually is one.

537
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:05,192
Iris, Iris, it's our job

538
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:08,062
to ensure that people, even heroes,

539
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:10,898
are held accountable for their actions.

540
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:16,904
So I'm guessing

541
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,973
on your list of dating pros and cons,

542
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:22,009
being anti-Flash is a major dealbreaker.

543
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:26,113
Dating pros and...

544
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:27,948
did you think that this...

545
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,017
Oh, what? No, no.

546
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,119
No, forget what I said. I get it.

547
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:37,124
You just wanted to talk about
the story some more...

548
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:41,662
To stall.

549
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,564
Right, because you're trying to get out

550
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,834
of writing this article altogether.

551
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:48,769
Scott, wait, please don't leave.

552
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:52,840
I'm sorry, I didn't
know that this was...

553
00:27:52,842 --> 00:27:55,142
Why would you?

554
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:58,278
Excuse me.

555
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,594
It's what you wanted.

556
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:15,462
Now let her go.

557
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,366
How do I know the two of you

558
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,869
didn't lace this with a
sedative to put me on my ass?

559
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,772
We wouldn't do that.

560
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,607
You can never be too safe, right?

561
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:30,611
No!

562
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,086
Thanks for the fix, Snow.

563
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:43,123
- Get Barry.
- Are you okay?

564
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,595
Well, good job on the cell, Cisco.

565
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:49,830
Jesse.

566
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,398
- What happened?
- Turn her on her side.

567
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,966
Eliza shot her up with V-9.

568
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,568
She's going into shock. It's too pure.

569
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,036
Stay with me, Jesse. Stay with me.

570
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,604
What do we do?

571
00:28:57,606 --> 00:28:58,839
We've got to get the
V-9 out of her system.

572
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,340
She needs a blood transfusion.

573
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:02,309
The new blood will flush the
drug out of her system.

574
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:04,078
- What blood type is she?
- PZ negative.

575
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,213
Yeah, that's not a thing
on this Earth, man.

576
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,815
I'm a match.

577
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:12,419
Jesse.

578
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,406
Hey.

579
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:35,309
What happened?

580
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:38,779
We... you're fine. You're...
you're gonna be fine.

581
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:41,115
We got the drug out of your system.

582
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:42,616
Oh.

583
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:44,952
Looks like you saved the day again.

584
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:50,224
Look, honey, I know
that this isn't enough.

585
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:52,826
I promise you, though,

586
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:55,562
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

587
00:29:55,564 --> 00:29:58,999
making it up to you for the...

588
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,601
for that terrible thing that I did.

589
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:03,937
- Yeah?
- Yes.

590
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:05,839
And how many more terrible things

591
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,774
are you gonna do to protect me?

592
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:13,914
What does that mean?

593
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,383
I mean, everything that you do

594
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:20,087
and everything that
you have done for me,

595
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:23,323
it's so dark, and... and
you don't even see it.

596
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:26,193
I mean, you didn't even
hesitate out there.

597
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:27,528
Of course not.

598
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,296
I'm not going to lose you, Jesse.

599
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:32,766
Okay, but you just gave
that crazy speedster

600
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:36,203
everything she wanted
without even blinking,

601
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:37,771
without even thinking

602
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:39,773
what other lives could be at stake.

603
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:41,542
It is my job to keep you safe,

604
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:43,210
to protect you; that's my job.

605
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:46,013
That's all that matters.

606
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:47,614
Well, maybe it shouldn't be.

607
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:57,090
Caitlin, I know she was
your friend and all,

608
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:59,259
but homegirl has gone cuckoo bird.

609
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,961
Now she's out there with more V-9.

610
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,963
What she doesn't know is,
I put in micro tracker

611
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,198
in the drug.

612
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,766
Hmm, that's a brilliant idea.

613
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:10,237
You can run, but you can't hide.

614
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,672
I'm the one to blame for all this,

615
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:13,207
so I need to help fix it.

616
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:15,042
There's plenty of blame
to go around, Snow.

617
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,310
What's her location?

618
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:18,312
Central City bridge.

619
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:20,214
Why is she running back and forth?

620
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:21,615
Villains gonna vill.

621
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,383
She's creating friction,

622
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:25,752
and at that vibration and speed...

623
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:27,654
- What?
- Complete chaos.

624
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,990
She could destroy that whole bridge.

625
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:31,491
And everyone on it.

626
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:03,950
Guys, this bridge is coming down.

627
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:08,854
Barry, there's about 200 people
on that bridge right now.

628
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,771
You're ruining all my fun.

629
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,419
Trajectory's too far away.

630
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:42,421
You won't get to her
running across the river.

631
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,278
I will if I jump.

632
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,564
Barry, to make that jump,
you'll need to go Mach 3.3,

633
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,266
but only for a second.

634
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,434
Okay.

635
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,897
Yeah, buddy!

636
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,520
It's over, Eliza.

637
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:48,725
It is never over.

638
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,960
Wait, hey!

639
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,097
Stop doing this to yourself.

640
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,366
You don't actually want to hurt anyone.

641
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,901
You don't know anything about me.

642
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,104
No, I know you're not a bad person.

643
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,905
This is the V-9 in your system.

644
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,676
I also know what it feels
like to want to be the best.

645
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,512
It makes you feel like
there's not enough time

646
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,147
to accomplish things the right way,

647
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,217
but it's a cop-out.

648
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,386
And this is killing you.

649
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,079
Look at yourself, Eliza.
You're not well.

650
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,752
Let us help you, please.

651
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,737
That is all the help I need.

652
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:49,950
How does it feel to
know that I am faster

653
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:51,485
than you will ever be?

654
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:55,656
See you around.

655
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:58,759
The lightning, it's turning blue.

656
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,788
Your article was well-written.

657
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,225
Thank you.

658
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,793
You know, it's a lot easier to write

659
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:49,162
when it's the truth.

660
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:52,165
Not every hero is a fraud.

661
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,735
It's okay to believe in them.

662
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:56,303
So I've been told.

663
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:01,341
And sometimes, even great journalists,

664
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:04,010
smart and brilliant journalists,

665
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:07,280
can misread situations.

666
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:11,318
And sometimes they can
be caught off guard.

667
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,020
Look, about the other night,

668
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,790
it... it just surprised me.

669
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,960
But once the surprise
went away, I, uh...

670
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,067
Not a dealbreaker.

671
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:35,075
Noted.

672
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,580
Okay.

673
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:49,689
Hey, have you seen Jesse?

674
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:51,992
No.

675
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,574
Hey, Dad.

676
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,310
It's me.

677
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:13,079
Listen, your job over the years

678
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:15,448
has been to shield me from harm.

679
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,785
But now it's my turn to go
out into this new world

680
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:22,055
on my own, no shield,

681
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:25,358
and discover what this Earth can offer.

682
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,563
You know, you are the best
teacher I've ever had,

683
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:33,500
but I don't know what
more you can teach me.

684
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,103
I love you.

685
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:39,005
Please, don't come looking for me.

686
00:37:55,424 --> 00:38:00,260
So Eliza just evaporated
from running too fast?

687
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:03,129
Looks like cellular
degeneration, same as Jay's.

688
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:05,332
Jay warned us V-9 was dangerous.

689
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:08,535
At least now we know why.

690
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,936
You find Jesse?

691
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,371
She went out.

692
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,644
Barry, what is it?

693
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:20,914
It's just right before
Eliza disappeared,

694
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,416
her lightning, it turned blue.

695
00:38:23,418 --> 00:38:25,385
Right.

696
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,487
What if it's a side effect of the V-9?

697
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:29,256
Yeah, but Jay took Velocity-9,

698
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:30,991
and his lightning didn't turn blue.

699
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,292
About how fast was he running?

700
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:34,394
Not as fast as Eliza.

701
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,864
All right, so what if V-9 is
what turns your lightning blue?

702
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,967
I mean, that would explain why
Zoom is so much faster than me.

703
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:43,069
If that's true, then that
means he's sick, right?

704
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,573
He's dying.

705
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:47,941
That's why he wants your speed.

706
00:38:47,943 --> 00:38:50,477
He's dying, and he needs a cure.

707
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,681
Same as Jay.

708
00:38:55,884 --> 00:38:57,284
No.

709
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:59,386
Jay? No.

710
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:01,321
See, he died right in front of us.

711
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:03,323
Zoom killed him right in front of us.

712
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:08,728
Cisco, we've seen a speedster be
in two places at once before.

713
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,833
Then I guess there's
one way to find out.

714
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,338
I guess now would be a good time

715
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,273
to tell you all I've been vibing Zoom.

716
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,541
What?

717
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:24,477
You... for how long?

718
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:28,248
It started when we
closed the last breach.

719
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,151
And every time it's happened,

720
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:32,852
I've been near that thing.

721
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,242
We need to know.

722
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,900
Oh, no.

723
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,169
No, no...

724
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,414
I saw Jay.

725
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,318
He's Zoom.

726
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,405
Barry!

727
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,063
