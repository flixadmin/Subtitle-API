1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,108
<i>I hope that it's not for long</i>

2
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,681
<i>I'll call you when
we get settled, and we</i>

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,247
<i>have a better indication
of what's going on...</i>

4
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,327
Mommy?

5
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:14,967
Oh!

6
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:17,047
Jellybean.

7
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:21,282
Daddy and I have a last
minute business trip.

8
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,934
So, Rose is gonna stay
with you for a few days.

9
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,114
No! I don't want you to go.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,304
Oh. It's gonna be so boring.

11
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:32,084
I won't be able to keep my... eyes...

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,394
Goodbye sweetheart. All
right, we'll see you soon.

13
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:43,525
Janet, we gotta go.

14
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:47,749
<i>I wish we could have put down our bags</i>

15
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,073
<i>and tucked you back into your bed.</i>

16
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:52,653
<i>But too many lives were at stake.</i>

17
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,258
Oh my god.

18
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,338
They've already launched!

19
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:01,752
We have to stop it!

20
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,832
Come on!

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,713
<i>To disarm the missile we
had to get inside it.</i>

22
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:17,093
<i>But the plating was too thick.</i>

23
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:21,130
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

24
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,186
I can't get through.

25
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:28,763
Hank.

26
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,430
<i>We both knew that
if we go that small</i>

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,510
<i>there's no coming back.</i>

28
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:35,934
<i>It should've been me.</i>

29
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,247
<i>But my regulator was damaged.</i>

30
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,208
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

31
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,995
Tell Hope I love her.

32
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,936
- <i>She turned it off.</i>
- Janet! No!

33
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:51,394
<i>And went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.</i>

34
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,692
<i>Your mother saved thousands
of lives that day</i>

35
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,656
<i>knowing she'd be lost in the Quantum Realm.</i>

36
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,816
<i>Alone, afraid,</i>

37
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,740
<i>gone forever.</i>

38
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:27,835
<i>Telling you that she
wasn't coming home</i>

39
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,262
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

40
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,649
But then, Scott showed up...

41
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,396
Or should I say, broke
into our house.

42
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:44,294
<i>And when he went to
the Quantum Realm...</i>

43
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,519
<i>and came back,
everything changed.</i>

44
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,823
I started to wonder...

45
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,945
could your mother
still be alive?

46
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:01,674
So I dusted off some old plans.

47
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,272
Dad, what are you saying?

48
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:17,373
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

49
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,902
Okay. We're in.

50
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:05,637
Aw, this place is a maze.
Where's that map?

51
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,466
We're definitely close.

52
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,154
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

53
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,536
Are you sure? Because once we're inside,
you show any hesitation or fear,

54
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,482
- we're done.
- I eat fear for breakfast.

55
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:22,681
Oh, wow. That is super cool.
Come on.

56
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,794
Look! It's Anton. He'll
show us the way.

57
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:32,552
Anton, which way do we go?

58
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:37,158
Anton, which way do we go?

59
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,310
Thanks, Anton.

60
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:50,032
Look! The ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

61
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,622
Oh, no! Lasers!

62
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,888
Oh! I can't, I got lased!

63
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:01,465
The secret vault.

64
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:05,020
- Tell me you brought the contact lens.
- Yup!

65
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,692
Perfect! Right there.

66
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:15,953
There! It's the microtreasure.

67
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,156
My trophy?

68
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,851
- It looks like treasure.
- Oh, it is to me.

69
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:24,367
- I wanna take it to show and tell.
- Oh, no, you can't do that. Can't.

70
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,726
It never leaves the house.
It's too important.

71
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:29,390
This is the best birthday
present you've ever got me.

72
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,187
I'm so touched you think I'm
the World's Greatest Grandma.

73
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,402
- It was the only one they had.
- It makes me wanna knit you a sweater.

74
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,867
- Oh, no, the fuzz!
- Hey, Scotty.

75
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,523
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings,

76
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,312
and I think we have way too
many security cameras, don't we?

77
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:48,125
- No, not at all.
- I mean, 'cause, it's a lot of security cameras.

78
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,883
I know what he needs. Who's the
security expert in our business?

79
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,625
I mean, you are. But I'm
running the company, right?

80
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:55,429
And if we overquote him, he's gonna go
somewhere else, I mean, we have to land this bird.

81
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,952
He ain't going anywhere. And the
expression is "land this fish."

82
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,835
No, it's "land the bird."

83
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:02,056
Just like you land the plane. You gotta
land the plane to be in business.

84
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:04,585
I know it's silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things. But I do...

85
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,999
How am I gonna land a fish?
It can't walk.

86
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,972
And if it swam up on shore, and it
battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

87
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:13,819
You've really turned me
around on this thing.

88
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,101
It's okay. We're gonna
land Karapetyan.

89
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,195
Now if you'd just excuse me, I'm in the middle
of trying to steal something with my daughter.

90
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,046
I'm gonna go recheck it.

91
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,472
To the escape ant!

92
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,733
Let's bounce before
the po-po come back!

93
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,967
Po-po? How do you
even know that?

94
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,261
Let's fly, Ant-oinette!
Let's fly!

95
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,158
Crash landing!

96
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:51,775
- I wish we could shrink for real.
- It is pretty cool.

97
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,520
Hey, I'm headed to
the office, Scotty.

98
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,192
Hey, sorry about freaking
out earlier, you know?

99
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:58,184
But I feel like... I'm way better. Like, my heart
is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff?

100
00:06:58,264 --> 00:07:00,942
And, like, my hands are shaking. But
I think it's unrelated, you know?

101
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:03,418
It's gonna be great, Luis. You
got nothing to worry about.

102
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,996
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

103
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:07,910
I'm the boss. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,990
Daddy!

105
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,332
Come on, Woo. I've
got three days left.

106
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:20,225
- Why would I try to escape?
- Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.

107
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,177
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

108
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,818
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

109
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:27,779
Thank you. It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

110
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:29,859
Our flying ant crashed.

111
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,005
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year
old when you can't leave the house.

112
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,520
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

113
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:38,538
Close-up magic.

114
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:42,778
I learned that.

115
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,579
Why can't you just
leave my daddy alone?

116
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,708
Oh, Cassie.

117
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:51,910
This must all seem like a bunch of
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

118
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,528
Well, think of it this way:

119
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,794
Your school has rules, right?
Like...

120
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,809
You can't draw on the walls.

121
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,575
Well, your daddy went to Germany and
drew on the walls with Captain America.

122
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:06,440
And that was a violation of Article 16,
Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.

123
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,590
Now as a part of his joint plea deal with
Homeland Security and the German government,

124
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,863
he was allowed to return to the U.S., provided
he serve two years under house arrest,

125
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,996
followed by three
years of probation.

126
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,910
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology,

127
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,801
or contact with any former associates,
who were or currently are,

128
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:27,348
in violation of said Accords.
Or any related statutes.

129
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,411
Okay, sweetie?

130
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,036
Wow. You're really
great with kids!

131
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:34,450
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

132
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,825
Anyway, not to be a
Johnny Ask-a-lot,

133
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,973
but you haven't had any contact with
Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

134
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,607
- No.
- You sure?

135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,803
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

136
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,475
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

137
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:49,498
And associating with them
breaks your deal. And, uh...

138
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,524
I don't need to
remind you, that...

139
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:55,501
Any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

140
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,891
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

141
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,661
- They hate his guts.
- Thanks, Peanut.

142
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:05,146
- How'd you do it, Scott?
- Do what?

143
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,409
The card trick?

144
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,057
Seriously?

145
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,041
Oh, my god!

146
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,984
You people can't just show up here
whenever you want and search the place.

147
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,195
Actually, they can.

148
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,367
- You need a warrant.
- Actually, they don't.

149
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,468
Really? Wow.

150
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:25,410
- Did you pack your soccer shoes?
- Yeah. -All right.

151
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:29,707
Next time I see you
will be on the outside!

152
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:33,806
I'll get on the inside of this.

153
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,177
Hey, three days. Seriously,

- Me too, Peanut.

- How'd you do that?

Snap your fingers. That
gets them to look over there.

166

Hey, Hank.

171
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:45,892
It's been a while.

172
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,033
Umm... I don't even know
if this is your number...

173
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:50,165
Anymore... and,

174

I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from. But...

175
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,395
I just had a really
weird dream.

176
00:11:56,475 --> 00:12:00,814
And I know that doesn't sound like an
emergency or anything, but it just felt...

177
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,467
Very real.

178
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:06,505
I was back in the
Quantum Realm, and...

179
00:12:06,585 --> 00:12:09,877
I think I saw your wife.

180
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:12,363
And then I
was your wife.

181
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:15,860
I mean, not, y'know, not in
a weird way, or anything...

00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,355
You know...

183
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:22,042
Hearing this out loud, I'm
thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.

184
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:24,734
I'm sorry to bother you.

185
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,945

Is this another dream?

189
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,218
Do you think it was a dream? Or is it possible
that you really saw my mom down there?

190
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,835
I'm not sure.

I can't be here! I can't be here,
I'm under house arrest.

Whoa!

00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,658
Scotty?

198
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:22,057
He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

Nine hours in bed, five
hours in front of the TV,

whatever that's about.

201

That's totally inaccurate.

How do you know about my daily

I'm sorry. I know
you're mad.

216

I'm not looking for
an apology, Scott.

217
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:14,445
The only reason why we're even talking
is because we need what's in your head.

- Save it.

- Can we start?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:11,938
So, while you were relaxing
at home, we were building this.

225
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:16,119
It's a tunnel. To
the Quantum Realm.

226
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,442
To my mom.

227
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:20,020
We think she might still be down
there, we just don't know where.

228
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,169
What?

229
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,223
If we can pinpoint my mom's location,
then the pod can take me down to get her.

230
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:28,082
You built all this and you
don't even know if she's alive?

231
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,113
It's called a hypothesis.

232
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:34,988
Last night we powered up the tunnel for the
first time. It's overloaded, and it's shut down.

233
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,933
But for a split second,

234
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:40,918
the doorway to the
Quantum Realm was opened.

235
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,183
And?

236
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:45,598
And five minutes later, you
called. Talking about Mom.

237
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,574
We think when you were down there,
you may have entangled with her.

238
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:51,176
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

239
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:53,277
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

240
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:58,104
We think she might have put some kind of a
message in your head. Hopefully, a location.

241
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,667
And opening the
tunnel triggered it.

242
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:03,268
Your mom put a message in my
head? Come on. That's insane.

00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,809
No, Scott. Insane...

00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,785
Just tell me you weren't
lying about the suit you took.

246
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,816
Tell me you
really destroyed it.

247
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,042
I did. I destroyed it. I swear.

248
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,753
I can't believe you
destroyed my suit.

249
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,515
I mean, that was my life's work.

250
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:26,750
- What was I supposed to do?
- You were supposed to not take my suit!

251
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,310
I'm sorry, Hank. I'm
sorry I took the suit.

252
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,873
I'm sorry that
I called last night.

253
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:35,208
I don't remember seeing Janet
down there. I wish that I did.

254
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:39,259
I just had a dream about her playing
hide and seek with a little girl.

255
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,388
What?

256
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:48,929
You... I had a dream. She was
playing hide and seek with a...

257
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,483
little... girl. Cassie and I do it all the
time. It doesn't mean anything.

258
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:55,095
But, was it Cassie
in the dream?

259
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,181
No.

260
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,112
- Where was she hiding?
- What?

261
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:01,486
The little girl, where was she
hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?

262
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:04,158
No, it was in a, like a tall dresser.

263
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:06,939
- You mean a wardrobe.
- Is that what that's called?

264
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,319
- What color was it?
- Red.

265
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:16,319
- Were there horses on it?
- Oh, boy.

266
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:20,166
It's where I hid every
time that we played.

267
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:24,014
Doesn't sound like you really
got the gist of the game.

268
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:27,310
She's alive!

269
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,565
I knew it.

270
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,050
I knew it!

271
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:37,092
- We need to get that part.
- Okay.

272
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,509
The sooner we get the tunnel working, the
sooner we can get this message out of his head.

273
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,355
- Does Burch have it?
- Yeah. Let's go.

274
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:47,586
What part? Who's Burch?
Wait, what's happening?

275
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:51,218
We need a component to stop
the tunnel from overloading again.

276
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:55,105
I grabbed your clothes.
You might wanna change.

277
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,897
Look. I'd really like
to help you out.

278
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:10,030
But if I'm not home when they come to take off
my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.

279
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,282
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel,
we'll get the message and have you home by lunch.

280
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,587
We have to hurry. The
entanglement won't last.

281

You owe us.

282
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,497
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

283
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,208
Let's go.

- No.

Ah! Susan!

00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:22,646
- Welcome to Oui!
- Sonny.

289
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,900
Oui is French for yes. As
in, yes to farm-to-table,

290
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,182
yes to locally sourced, and yes,

291
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:30,931
to planet-before-profit.

292
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:32,807
Well, let's hope it
also means yes to

293
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,592
Do you have the
component I ordered?

294
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,641
You know, I've always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

295
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,454

- No, I'm good. Thank you.

- Sonny Burch.

297
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,487
He traffics in black
market technology.

298
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:50,008
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

299
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,998
- Can I just have one?
- No.

300
00:21:54,598 --> 00:22:00,104
You know, I have a, a special friend, at
the FBI. And I say special, because...

301
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:04,030
Well, he tells me things that
I didn't previously know.

302
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,823
For example...

303
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:08,050
Your name isn't Susan.

It's Hope Van Dyne.

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,542
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

306
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:16,507
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

307
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,579
What do you want?

308
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,102
Relationships are
built on trust, Hope.

309
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,423
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

310
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:34,372
- Our relationship?
- Our business landscape has been shifting, Hope.

311
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:38,561
Hell, SHIELD & Hydra don't even exist
anymore. But now, Hank Pym?

312
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:42,213
- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity.
- Do you have a point?

313
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:46,349
Oh, you think that I don't know what
you've been building? With all of this?

314
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,581
Quantum technology.

315
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:52,659
And you can forget nano-tech.
Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency.

316
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,414
Quantum energy is the future.
It's the next gold rush.

317
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:58,944
- Is that so?
- I want in, Hope.

318
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,608
So, as a gesture of goodwill,
I have taken the liberty

319
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:04,334
of arranging some
buyers for your lab.

320
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:09,310
Starting bid?
One billion dollars.

321
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,029
Thank you,
Sonny. Really.

322
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,056
But my father and I have something slightly
more pressing than starting a business.

323
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:18,345
So, I'll just take the component.
As arranged.

324
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:21,695
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

325
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:26,910
So, we are either in business together,
or we aren't in business together.

326
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,562
- Then I guess we aren't.
- You can go.

327
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,636
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

328
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,023
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

329
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,500
Listen, Sonny.

330
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,882
This is gonna be so much easier on
everybody if you just give me that component.

331
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:49,898
Darling, the only thing you're
taking from here is my heart.

332
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:52,699
But it will mend in time.

333
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,470
Okay.

334
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:05,920
- So now, what?
- You'll see.

335
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,703
She said her and daddy
had something pressing.

336
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:12,435
I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not
working with us, they're working with somebody.

337
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,567
So find out. I want a name...

338
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:20,933
Hold on. You
gave her wings?

339
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:29,275
Get her. Go on!

340
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:46,453
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

341
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,179
Stop firing! Stop!

342
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:59,307
All right, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go! Go.

343
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,451
Wings and blasters.

344
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:05,750
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me?

345
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,830
No, I did.

346
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,711
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

347
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,578
Oh, our business isn't
finished yet, Hope.

348
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:16,090
I can assure
you of that.

349
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:24,960
What the hell is that?

350
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:39,472
Dad, are you
seeing this?

351
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:42,117
Hope, get out of there!

352
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,889
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

353
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:59,382
It's still a work in progress.

354
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:19,685
You taught me that
kick. Remember?

355
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,974
- Yeah, great form.
- Those were the days.

356
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:24,685
- Whatever happened to us?
- Not the time, Scott.

357
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:27,229
Dammit, where'd it go?

358
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:29,735
I've lost it.

359
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,764
I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams. Why the...?

360
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:36,104
Dad?

361
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:46,246
Give me that. Now.

362
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,086
- Are you okay?
- No. They got the lab.

363
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,166
- No.
- Come on.

364
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,973
- What was that?
- I don't know.

365
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,861
But we need to find somewhere to
regroup and figure out where the lab is.

366
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:06,293
So where to now?

367
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:09,152
How about my house? Mmm?
I'm supposed to be there anyway.

368
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:12,871
- Woo could walk in any second.
- Exactly why we're not going to your house.

369
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:15,047
What about your house?

370
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,232
Sorry.

371
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:20,539
Well. There is one
place I can think of.

372
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:21,957
No.

373
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:25,360
No, no! No! No!

374
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,497
No!

375
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,073
Wow, Dr. Pym.

376
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:34,073
Like, like, who would've thought
that, once again,

377
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:37,261
in your hour of need that, that you
would turn to us? You know?

378
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,003
Not me.

379
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,393
Help yourself.

380
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:43,159
Hey what's up with the fancy pastry?
We gotta keep the food budget down.

381
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,221
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

382
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:47,926
- The oatmeal packets.
- Oatmeal packets.

383
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,615
- It's insult.
- Why is it insult?

384
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,364
- Because it takes like sand.
- You know why? It's 'cause it's organic.

385
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,897
- No, that's not organic. It's sand.
- The most important meal of the day.

386
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,831
- You know what, you can get creative with it.
- It break teeth.

387
00:28:57,911 --> 00:28:59,872
You can put a little brown sugar on it, you
put some cinnamon, put a little honey...

388
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:02,708
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
Come on, man!

389
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,695
We got bigger fish to fry.

390
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,578
- Is that my desk?
- Yeah.

391
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,638
What? Why do I have
such a small desk?

392
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:12,005
Well 'cause you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

393
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:12,572
You snooze, you lose.

394
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:13,943
- I was under house arrest.
- Yeah!

395
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:16,466
You know what, this isn't
even a desk. This is garbage.

396
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,105
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

397
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:20,504
I got it at a rummage sale.

398
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:22,863
- So, you saved money on my desk?
- Guys.

399
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:25,493
Hope, please! We need
to focus. All right?

400
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:28,333
We gotta find that
lab already. Geez.

401
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:31,210
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.

402
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,835
Like this crazy, creepy cat who like,
walks through walls and stuff.

403
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:35,522
Like a... Like a Ghost!

404
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:38,097
Like Baba Yaga.

405
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,616
Baba Yaga. A witch.

406
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:45,722
They tell stories to
children to frighten them.

407
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,147
You know Baba Yaga?

408
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:50,975
Whoever stole it...

409
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,311
We need to find it.

410
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,631
Well, you don't find
someone like that.

411
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,807
- They find you.
- Like Baba Yaga.

412
00:29:57,946 --> 00:30:00,668
Dr. Pym, you're like the
smartest genius I know.

413
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:03,128
Didn't you put some kind
of, like, LoJack on your lab?

414
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,261
Because if you didn't, we have a
variety of affordable options.

415
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,560
Of course, I did, Luis.

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,964
It was disabled.

417
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,708
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

418
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:15,761
- They also looked like they were phasing.
- Phasing?

419
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:19,050
Quantum phasing. When an object
moves through different states of matter.

420
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,011
Oh, yeah. That's what
I was thinking.

421
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:24,964
The lab emits radiation. Could we modify
a quantum spectrometer and track it?

422
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:27,831
That could work, yes. But all
of my equipment is in the lab.

423
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,554
Well, where else can
we find that equipment?

424
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,359
Well, there is one person.

425
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:37,112
- Bill Foster.
- Great!

426
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,184
Who's Bill Foster?

427
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:41,111
He's an old colleague
of my dad's. From SHIELD.

428
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:45,049
- They had a falling out years ago.
- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

429
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:47,072
It's probably just
a waste of time.

430
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:50,346
Hey, I'm risking everything by being
here. Don't you think we should check?

431
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:53,350
We need to find out
who took the lab.

432
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,302
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.

433
00:31:48,382 --> 00:31:51,349
Relax. No one's gonna
recognize us.

434
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:53,749
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

435
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,350
It's not a disguise, Hank.

436
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,811
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

437
00:31:57,891 --> 00:31:59,858
In an isolated system...

438
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:02,030
Particles co-exist in a

439
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,548
stable phase relationship. If
the system is interfered with,

440
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:10,149
that stability becomes chaos.

441
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,111
Unpredictable.

442
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,376
Dangerous.

443
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:15,001
Beautiful.

444
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,589
Isolated completely, a quantum system would
revert back to separate states of matter.

445
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,355
Each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

446
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:24,839
In other words...

447
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,910
The object in question would
be both in and out of phase

448
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,204
with multiple parallel realities.

449
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,603
Speaking of being out
of phase with reality...

450
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:45,473
I am noticing an unusally high number
of glazed eyes out there among you.

451
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:49,101
So, why don't we call
it a few minutes early.

452
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:53,583
That'll be enough for today, thank
you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go.

453
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:57,664
It's incredible.
Your link to Janet.

454
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,799
It's quantum entanglement,

455
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:02,158
between the quantum states of
Posner molecules in your brains.

456
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:04,507
Yeah. That's what I
was thinking.

457
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,916
Do you guys just put the word
'quantum' in front of everything?

458
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,623
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

459
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,490
Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't have
anything like the equipment you're describing.

460
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,889
I told you this is a waste of time.
Come on. Let's go.

461
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,436
Don't condescend, Hank.

462
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:17,295
You're the one who's on
the run from the FBI.

463
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,390
All because you had
to grow to a size

464
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,311
that finally fit your ego.

465
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:25,104
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

466
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,183
Really?

467
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:29,144
Going that big must've
been exhausting.

468
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:31,878
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

469
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,018
Actually, I do.

470
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,565
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner
in a project called GOLIATH.

471
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,315
Excuse me, you were my partner?

472
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:40,768
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,

473
00:33:40,848 --> 00:33:43,140
is putting up with
Hank's bullshit.

474
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:45,387
Right.

475
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:48,421
How big did you get?

476
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:49,476
My record?

477
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:50,749
Twenty-one feet.

478
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,702
- Not bad.
- You?

479
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,519
- I don't...
- No, really. I'm curious.

480
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:57,508
- Sixty-five feet.
- Whoa.

481
00:33:57,588 --> 00:33:58,891
- Yeah.
- Huge.

482
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,788
- Sixty-five.
- If you two are finished comparing sizes...

483
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:04,399
We need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

484
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:08,888
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet? Strange.

485
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:12,415
You had all the answers back in the day.
That's why I left the project.

486
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,766
Left? I fired you.

487
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,305
Best decision I ever made.
Hank was a terrible partner.

488
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:20,313
Temperamental. Stubborn.
Impatient.

489
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:22,547
Sooner or later he just
pushed everyone away.

490
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,969
Just the mediocrities.

491
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:27,563
Janet was the only one who could
endure him and chose to stick it out.

492
00:34:27,643 --> 00:34:28,485
Watch it, Bill.

493
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,375
She paid the price
though, didn't she?

494
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:31,191
You son of a...

495
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,570
We didn't come here to
listen to you two squabble.

496
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm trying to save my mother.

497
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:38,628
Now, which office is that?

498
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,470
Aw, it's Woo.

499
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,712
Ah, someone must have seen me.

500
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,279
Relax. If this is about you
they'd be in your house by now.

501
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,581
- What are you, fifteen?
- Come on. We gotta go, right now.

502
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:53,140
Wait! You might be able to
improvise that tracker.

503
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:56,277
If you modify the defraction
units on one of your regulators.

504
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:58,359
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

505
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,739
Thank you. Thank you.

506
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:03,998
Campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

507
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:05,280
I don't know what
to tell you, agent.

508
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,498
I haven't talked to
Hank in thirty years.

509
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:09,787
I can assure you I am the last
person he would wanna visit.

510
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:12,565
- Oh, come on. You expect us to...
- Hey, hey.

511
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:14,967
- Why is that?
- Simple.

512
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,175
We hate each other's guts.

513
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,537
So I'm a terrible partner?

514
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,921
Foster, he hasn't had one good
idea in his unremarkable career.

515
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:25,030
But his idea about the
defractors could work.

516
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,178
Fine, one decent idea.

517
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:31,386
Except I eliminated defractors
when I upgraded the suits.

518
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,691
So if we had an old suit,

519
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:38,002
we might be able to
track down the lab?

520
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:40,561
Yes. But we don't.

521
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,345
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

522
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,946
I mean...

523
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:49,429
- Life's funny...
- Oh, my God.

524
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,546
- You didn't destroy the suit.
- What?!

525
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:55,762
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.
I couldn't destroy that.

526
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:59,491
Before I turned myself in, I shrunk
it down and mailed it to Luis.

527
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:01,715
You sent my suit
through the mail?

528
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:04,677
Hey, the postal service is
very reliable, you know?

529
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:07,294
They do tracking numbers now.
Like UPS.

530
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,434
Where is it?

531
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:11,286
It's in a very safe place, all right?
Don't worry.

532
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:13,872
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

533
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,576
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?

534
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,185
I, I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

535
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:18,560
Hey. Get away from the plant.

536
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,440
I put it back after
Cassie and I were p...

537
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:23,221
Show and tell.

538
00:36:23,301 --> 00:36:25,301
Scotty?

539
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:27,911
Stop!

540
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,705
Well, the good news is,
I know where it is.

541
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,954
Whenever you go back to school, isn't
everything supposed to look so much smaller?

542
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,868
This place seems huge. Ah!

543
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,938
- What is it?
- It's the new regulator.

544
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,719
Hank, what's going
on with this suit?

545
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,411
How much of a work
in progress is this?

546
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:52,575
Uh-oh. Oh, no.
No, no, no.

547
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,783
Come on!

548
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:03,368
Oh!

549
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:06,298
What, are you laughing?
Please, can you just...

550
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,378
Okay. Okay.

551
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:12,846
<i>What do you see?</i>

552
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,924
The sizing coils are
malfunctioning.

553
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:16,073
Just let me...

554
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,153
Oww!

555
00:37:19,934 --> 00:37:22,194
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

556
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,587
Okay. All right.

557
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,668
Try it now.

558
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:33,806
So...

559
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:39,894
Awesome.

560
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,105
If only Cap could see you now.

561
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,695
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

562
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:56,306
Hey!

563
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,591
Where's your hall pass?

564
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,287
Hey, I'm talking to you.

565
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:04,893
Hey!

566
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,339
Hey...

567
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,754
You can do it. You
almost got it!

568
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,755
Oh, Peanut.

569
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:04,153
Okay. Let's go.

570
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:21,491
Hiya, Champ! How
was school today?

571
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:24,312
Hahaha. All right, get
your jokes out now.

572
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,882
- Can you fix the suit?
- He's so cranky.

573
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:29,984
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

574
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:32,609
Do you really have that?

575
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:44,060
Let's see if Foster was right.

576
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:58,716
This has got to be the lab.

577
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:04,724
- Let's go get it.
- Yeah.

578
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,427
This seems right.

579
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,456
Look at us. Teaming
up twice in one day.

580
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,011
Makes you think, huh?

581
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:23,956
- About what?
- Germany?

582
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,855
- What do you mean?
- We were working together.

583
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:30,965
Training together. And,
other-stuff-ing together.

584
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,074
If I'd asked you,
would you have come?

585
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:36,349
I guess we'll never know.
But I do know one thing.

586
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,324
What?

587
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:40,712
If I had, you'd have
never been caught.

588
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,598
Hey, Scott.

589
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:53,552
You think you can stop daydreaming about
my daughter long enough to get my lab?

590
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:56,205
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

591
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:02,992
Okay, you're transmitting.

592
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:04,383
What took you so long?

593
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,383
Sorry, I had to come up
with a name for my ant.

594
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:09,758
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

595
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,052
- You like it?
- Hilarious.

596
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:17,048
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

597
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:18,891
- Be careful.
- You know me, Hank.

598
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm always care... Whoa!

599
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,368
- It's okay. It's just the suit.
- How do you know?

600
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,448
Look.

601
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,512
That's Ghost?

602
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:30,973
What is she doing?

603
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,911
You think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?

604
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,856
Let's just get out of
here before she wakes up.

605
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:39,306
Hope, look. There's the lab.

606
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,199
Now. We're sure this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else's, right?

607
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:49,968
Just take it, Scott.
C'mon, we gotta be fast.

608
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,565
I'll get it.

609
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,687
Oh, sh...

610
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,212
Hope.

611
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,829
Hank.

612
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:11,150
Guys?

613
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,146
I don't think they can hear you.

614
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:18,226
Hi.

615
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:20,078
I'm Ava.

616
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:21,632
Scott.

617
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:23,712
So...

618
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:27,251
You don't need a suit to, uh...
You know.

619
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,798
Go through things.

620
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,449
No.

621
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:35,595
It just helps me control it.

622
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:40,204
And the pain. Supposedly.

623
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:48,455
You're not gonna reach into my
chest and crush my heart, are you?

624
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:53,419
You're funny.

625
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:59,161
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Scott, unless I have to.

626
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,127
I need...

627
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:06,463
What's in your head.

628
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:23,767
Let's wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with, shall we?

629
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:29,017
Get up! Come on!

630
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,780
Dad?

631
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:36,685
Don't ever touch him again.

632
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:38,622
Now, now, Hope...

633
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:42,892
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your father, all things considered.

634
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,611
What the hell are
you talking about?

635
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:49,031
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

636
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:52,536
Bill.

637
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:54,807
What have you done?

638
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:57,901
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

639
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:59,448
You're with her?

640
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:01,964
Aw, man. I thought
you were cool.

641
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:03,745
What the hell is going on here?

642
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:08,956
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.
Why would he?

643
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:11,511
Elihas Starr.

644
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:14,097
They were colleagues at SHIELD.

645
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:16,446
Quantum research.

646
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:20,868
Until my father dared disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

647
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:25,982
You had him fired. Oh, and
discredited for good measure.

648
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,754
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

649
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:37,123
Desperate to restore his
name, so he took risks.

650
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:38,482
<i>No!</i>

651
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:40,596
Too many.

652
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:43,429
Until something went wrong.

653
00:44:43,624 --> 00:44:45,275
He told us to run.

654
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:48,034
- Elihas, what's happening?
- Just go. Go!

655
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:49,565
Daddy!

656
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,531
<i>I could tell he was scared.</i>

657
00:44:57,304 --> 00:44:59,619
- Daddy!
- Ava, no!

658
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:05,236
<i>I didn't want him to be alone.</i>

659
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:08,408
No! No! No!

660
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,581
<i>When I woke up, my
parents were dead.</i>

661
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:21,893
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

662
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:30,321
<i>They call it "Molecular
Disequilibrium."</i>

663
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:32,410
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

664
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,785
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

665
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:42,050
Every cell, in my body, is torn
apart and stitched back together.

666
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,445
Over, and over, every day.

667
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,706
I was still at SHIELD
when I got the call about a

668
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:53,007
"quantum anomaly" in Argentina.

669
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,267
Hello, Ava.

670
00:45:57,392 --> 00:45:59,523
My name is Bill.

671
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:02,395
I was a friend of your father's.

672
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,703
I brought you something.

673
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:11,890
It's all right. Try again.

674
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:14,542
That's it.

675
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:17,640
<i>Dr. Foster did his
best to keep me safe.</i>

676
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:22,483
But others at SHIELD saw an
opportunity in my affliction.

677
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,471
They built me a containment suit
so I could control my phasing.

678
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,330
And trained me to be
a stealth operative.

679
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,681
They weaponized me.

680
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:37,541
I stole for them,
spied for them.

681
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,229
I killed for them.

682
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:42,417
And in exchange for my soul,

683
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:45,179
they were going to cure me.

684
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:49,465
They lied.

685
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,010
When SHIELD collapsed,
I took Ava in.

686
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,973
I built the chamber to slow
her decay, but her condition

687
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:58,827
was progressive. I didn't
know how to cure her.

688
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,955
She wanted to kill you, Hank.
But I told her, no.

689
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:04,181
And that she should watch you instead.
And sure enough,

690
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:07,600
she discovered that you
were building a tunnel.

691
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:10,493
Then she told me about Lang.

692
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:14,687
And the message from
Janet inside his head...

693
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,937
- For Christ's sake!
- That's me. I'm sorry.

694
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:19,707
Look, can you tell
me who's texting me?

695
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:21,735
Cassie. 911.

696
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:23,967
That's my daughter. I
need to text her back.

697
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:25,228
No. That's not happening.

698
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,080
It's 911. That means
it's an emergency!

699
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,030
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

700
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,976
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

701
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:35,172
Okay, well, she's trying to videochat
me now. Something might be wrong.

702
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,512
Let me talk to her. Please!

703
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,293
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

704
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:43,996
- I can't find my soccer shoes.
- What?

705
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:45,419
I have a game tomorrow.

706
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:46,750
Hey, Scott, I know
that they're there.

707
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,082
Can you just walk the
phone around the house?

708
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:50,723
- No, I can't do that right now.
- Why not?

709
00:47:50,803 --> 00:47:51,660
Because I'm sick.

710
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,465
Hey, um, can you just maybe look around later
then and call me back? Please? Thank you.

711
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:57,707
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Peanut!

712
00:47:57,787 --> 00:48:00,308
- Feel better!
- Feel better, buddy!

713
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:02,988
I'm sorry. It said emergency.

714
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:04,754
Ava, I wanna help you.

715
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,856
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

716
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:09,357
- Oh, really? How?
- Janet.

717
00:48:09,437 --> 00:48:12,352
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.

718
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:16,138
We can extract that energy. We can use it
to repair Ava's molecular structure...

719
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:17,329
- Extract it?
- Yes!

720
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:19,688
Are you insane? That
would rip Janet apart!

721
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:23,422
You don't know that. I'm
gonna fire up your tunnel.

722
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:26,001
When Janet's location pops into Lang's
head, he's gonna give it to me,

723
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,977
- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.
- What?

724
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:33,302
You are gonna stay here just
in case I need your help.

725
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:36,489
- Like hell, I would help you!
- You'll do whatever I say.

726
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:39,614
- You're gonna kill Janet.
- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

727
00:48:39,694 --> 00:48:42,439
Goddammit, Bill!

728
00:48:42,663 --> 00:48:44,731
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

729
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:47,283
So help me, God...

730
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,231
It's his heart! He needs
his pills, please.

731
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:53,329
Dr. Foster, they're
in the tin, please.

732
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:56,566
He could die! For... come on!

733
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:57,871
Help him!

734
00:48:57,951 --> 00:49:00,605
Dad, just hang on, all right?
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

735
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:04,469
- Help him, man! Come on!
- The Altoid tin!

736
00:49:05,882 --> 00:49:07,882
Wait!

737
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:12,372
Thanks, guys!

738
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,452
Hank!

739
00:49:25,404 --> 00:49:28,083
Bill is filling that
girl's head with lies.

740
00:49:28,163 --> 00:49:31,432
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

741
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:33,862
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

742
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:36,705
No, no, no. The bolt
is on the other side.

743
00:49:36,785 --> 00:49:39,674
Tighten that one down, then
bring it down one notch.

744
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:42,041
- Good job.
- It'll work.

745
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:44,351
Foster, he could've fried
the entire system.

746
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,398
Look, we'll adjust the relays while you
go reprogram the settings. All right?

747
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:49,478
It's gonna be fine.

748
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,148
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

749
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,703
You'd think with all this time
to prepare, I'd be more ready.

750
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:02,789
Well, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

751
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,625
It kind of melts your mind.

752
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:08,864
- I mean, seeing my mom again.
- Oh.

753
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:12,766
What if she's a completely
different person?

754
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:15,351
Yeah, like uh, George Washington?

755
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:19,934
- I'm serious, Scott.
- Or, George Jefferson?

756
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,910
What if she's
forgotten about me?

757
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,296
When I was in prison...

758
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:28,812
The only thing that got
me through was Cassie.

759
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,863
I could've been locked up for 100 years.
I never would've forgotten her.

760
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:38,078
I know your mom is counting the
minutes until she can see you again.

761
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:41,755
Thank you.

762
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:50,694
- Hey.
- We've got a big problem.

763
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:53,492
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.

764
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:54,101
Oh no.

765
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:57,744
And, and they're on the proposal, and
Karapetyan asked for them specifically.

766
00:50:57,824 --> 00:51:01,512
Uh, yeah. Look, it's uh,
it's been a little crazy, uh...

767
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:03,885
Uh, look, maybe I can stop by
tomorrow and take a look at it.

768
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:04,944
No, no, no, no!

769
00:51:05,024 --> 00:51:07,575
The meeting's first thing in the morning.
You gotta come right now and fix it.

770
00:51:07,655 --> 00:51:10,091
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

771
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:12,692
You know what, I'm coming to you.
I'll just bring the plans,

772
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:15,286
they're on the laptop, and
you can fix them there.

773
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:17,536
- Just tell me where you are, okay?
- It's complicated.

774
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,330
What do you mean,
it's complicated?

775
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,903
As you can see, sir...

776
00:51:24,983 --> 00:51:27,411
This system is state-of-the-art.

777
00:51:27,491 --> 00:51:29,606
- Security of tomorrow...
- Today!

778
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,669
Oh, that's so good! I love the
lead-in, bro. Keep practicing.

779
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:34,942
Hey, I just gotta drive up to
Scotty's, so he can fix the plans.

780
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:36,663
But don't worry. I'll be
back in plenty of time.

781
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:37,501
As you can see, sir...

782
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:39,581
Oh! Oh! Oh!

783
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,251
Tell me you got the van
washed for tomorrow morning.

784
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,946
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

785
00:51:43,026 --> 00:51:45,893
- You sprung for the undercarriage wash?
- Well, you said get the works.

786
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:48,149
That's a scam, Bro. We live in
California, not Minnesota!

787
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,149
He's right.

788
00:51:50,229 --> 00:51:52,079
The undercarriage wash.

789
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:53,998
That's for cleaning
off road salt.

790
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,975
Laid down in our more
snow-laden sister states.

791
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,139
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?

792
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,420
Ah, well, my name is Sonny Burch.

793
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,276
And I do my research, Luis.

794
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,630
To wit, I have learned,
from a friend of mine,

795
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,312
at the FBI, that you are a
known associate of Scott Lang,

796
00:52:13,392 --> 00:52:16,431
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who, I've also learned,

797
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,595
has a portable shrinking laboratory.
Filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

798
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:24,428
And you're gonna
tell me where it is.

799
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:28,402
Well, I hate to break it to you, but I
don't know what you're talking about.

800
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:31,210
Well, I sense a
resistance in you, Luis.

801
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:34,694
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

802
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:39,202
So, I'm gonna introduce you,
to my good friend Uzman.

803
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:42,561
Now, Uzman, is a master

804
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:47,534
at extracting information from the
unwilling through psychoactive means.

805
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:50,526
Oh, is that truth serum?

806
00:52:50,606 --> 00:52:52,636
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

807
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:54,691
That's just nonsense from TV.

808
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,370
- What is it, then?
- It's a little concoction,

809
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,521
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the SIS.

810
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:03,620
It makes you suggestible.
And highly responsive.

811
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,511
- Well, dude, that's truth serum!
- No, it's not.

812
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:07,212
No fencing, but,

813
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,211
- this sound like truth serum to me.
- Right?!

814
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:12,508
- It's not a truth serum.
- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you.

815
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:13,985
It's not a truth serum.

816
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,196
If it walk like duck,
and talk like ducks...

817
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,454
It's a truth serum.

818
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:20,735
Well, I have a lot of allergies.
So...

819
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:23,450
You might wanna
think about that.

820
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:27,990
We've got to get that lab back.

821
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:30,032
What?

822
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:33,708
The chamber and the suit are
barely helping anymore.

823
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,911
How long have I got?

824
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:41,628
A couple of weeks, maybe.

825
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:45,413
Well then, we'll make
them bring the lab back.

826
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:47,493
How?

827
00:53:47,633 --> 00:53:49,891
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

828
00:53:49,971 --> 00:53:52,683
You can't mean that. Ava?

829
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:56,566
I tolerate a lot of the
things you do out there,

830
00:53:56,646 --> 00:53:58,980
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

831
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,034
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

832
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,573
I am!

833
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:06,281
You said you could fix me.

834
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:10,138
You promised!

835
00:54:10,218 --> 00:54:12,450
I know. I will.

836
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,530
But not like that.

837
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,845
You lay one finger on
that little girl...

838
00:54:18,998 --> 00:54:22,001
I won't help you.
And we're done.

839
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:28,861
Fine.

840
00:54:29,502 --> 00:54:32,426
There are other options.

841
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:47,567
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

842
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:48,809
'Cause I don't feel anything.

843
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,934
That was a lie. I
did feel something.

844
00:54:51,014 --> 00:54:53,013
- This is truth serum!
- There's no such thing.

845
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:55,060
Okay!

846
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,099
Okay, okay.

847
00:54:57,179 --> 00:54:59,568
Now I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

848
00:54:59,648 --> 00:55:01,648
Okay.

849
00:55:02,938 --> 00:55:04,607
Where...

850
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:06,339
is Scott Lang?

851
00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:09,738
Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when
I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

852
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:12,628
And I'm not talking about cell block D.
His wife had just filed for divorce.

853
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,977
And I was like, "Damn, homie, she
dumped you when you were on lock-up?"

854
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:17,089
And he was like, "Yeah, I know. I thought
I was gonna be with her forever,

855
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:18,102
but now, I'm all alone!"

856
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,743
And I was like, "Damn, homie, you know what, you
gotta chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner.

857
00:55:20,823 --> 00:55:22,102
But you know what? I'm Luis."

858
00:55:22,182 --> 00:55:24,533
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty.
And we're gonna be best friends."

859
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,167
Okay, hold on, hold on. Now I like a
good story as much as the next person,

860
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,486
but what in the hell does this have
to do with where Scott Lang is?

861
00:55:29,566 --> 00:55:30,785
I'm getting there,
I'm getting there.

862
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:33,590
You put a dime in him, you got
to let the whole song play out.

863
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,496
He is like human jukebox.

864
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:37,449
Oh! My abuelita had a
jukebox in a restaurant.

865
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:39,512
Yeah. Only played Morrissey.

866
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:42,528
And if anybody ever complained,
she'd be like, "Oh, porque? Gusta mas?"

867
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:44,812
And El Chicanos, we call
them mas, "then, adios!"

868
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:47,993
Well what can I say, you know? We relate
to these melancholy bandits, you know?

869
00:55:48,073 --> 00:55:49,570
- Lang.
- Right, right, right, right, right.

870
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,424
So anyway, Scotty gets out of
jail and he starts working for Hank.

871
00:55:51,504 --> 00:55:53,445
That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all like,

872
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:55,922
"I want nothing to do with you. Look
at my hairdo. I'm all business."

873
00:55:56,002 --> 00:55:56,961
And then Scotty's like,

874
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:59,836
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken,
and I'll probably never find love again.

875
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:00,916
But damn, if I
want to kiss you!"

876
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:03,077
But then you fast-forward and they're
all like into each other, right?

877
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:05,459
And then Scotty's like, "You know
what, I can't tell you this,

878
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:07,318
but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America!"

879
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:10,523
And then she said, "I can't believe you split
like that! Smell you later, dummy!"

880
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:13,818
So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he
won't admit it, but his heart is all like,

881
00:56:13,898 --> 00:56:16,984
"Damn! I thought Hope could've been
my new true partner. But I blew it!"

882
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:19,547
But fate brought them back together,
and then Hope's heart is all,

883
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,687
"I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's
gonna screw up again and ruin everything."

884
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,432
And then my heart, is all like, "That
fancy raspberry filling represents

885
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:28,171
the company's red. And we're days away
from going out of business! Oooh!"

886
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,046
- Out of business?
- Days away?!

887
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:32,632
Damn truth serum! And you know, I
was trying to protect you guys.

888
00:56:32,712 --> 00:56:35,491
I swear to God. You know, I was trying
to be a good boss. But we're broke.

889
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:37,718
And the Karapetyans are our last hope,
and if we don't show up, we're done!

890
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,491
- That's terrible bossing.
- Damn, Bro!

891
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:41,972
- That's on me. That's on me!
- Hey!

892
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,125
Enough.

893
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:48,840
I'm gonna ask you
one more time...

894
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:50,599
Where is Scott Lang?

895
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:52,482
I've been trying to tell you. He's in
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

896
00:56:52,562 --> 00:56:54,325
Emotionally speaking.

897
00:56:54,405 --> 00:56:57,474
But where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking?!

898
00:56:57,554 --> 00:56:58,950
Oh! The woods.

899
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,481
The woods?

900
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,561
Baba Yaga!

901
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:04,497
What do you mean, the woods?

902
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:07,310
The Muir woods! Second fire
road of the Panoramic Highway.

903
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,390
For God's sake!

904
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:14,779
Baba Yaga, coming late, little
children, sleep at eight.

905
00:57:16,712 --> 00:57:19,445
Aw! Damn it!

906
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,269
If that freak gets Pym's tech,
I'm never gonna see it.

907
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:25,657
So what do we do now?

908
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,277
It's easier to steal it from the
feds than from a boogeyman.

909
00:57:31,212 --> 00:57:32,468
Hey. It's me.

910
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,437
How'd you like to
get a promotion?

911
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:38,233
I've got the location on
Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang.

912
00:57:38,313 --> 00:57:41,500
But you're gonna have to take them down now,
'cause they ain't gonna be there for long.

913
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,304
And when you do, you're
gonna get me that lab.

914
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:46,384
Understood.

915
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,988
Good news, gentlemen.

916
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:51,847
Feds are gonna do the
hard work for us.

917
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,641
What are you looking at?
Change my tire!

918
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:57,555
Sir...

919
00:57:57,635 --> 00:57:59,635
Can you knock?

920
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:02,833
Sorry, sir. Uh, but
I just got a lead.

921
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,762
Ooh. I love leads.

922
00:58:12,124 --> 00:58:15,424
- System's in the green.
- Priming the coils.

923
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,756
Full charge. As soon as the tunnel's
open, let us know if you get anything

924
00:58:20,837 --> 00:58:23,921
- that could be part of her message.
- Yeah, yeah. I will.

925
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:27,273
Okay, then.

926
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,994
Here it goes.

927
00:58:44,665 --> 00:58:46,665
We did it!

928
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:49,261
You got anything?

929
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,944
Nothing.

930
00:58:53,024 --> 00:58:55,980
Just give it a minute.
Because it could...

931
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,733
No. No, no, no, no!

932
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:02,406
- What's happening?
- It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.

933
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:04,664
We've gone over them a million times.
I know they're right.

934
00:59:04,744 --> 00:59:07,762
- Well then, what else could it be?
- I don't know.

935
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:15,502
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

936
00:59:15,582 --> 00:59:16,494
Scott, we had...

937
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:20,467
I'm sorry. I don't know how much time
I have. I need to fix the algorithm.

938
00:59:21,652 --> 00:59:24,112
Trust me, after 30
years down here...

939
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,780
I've thought about it a lot.

940
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:32,419
Janet?

941
00:59:34,231 --> 00:59:36,231
Hi, Hon.

942
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,092
Oh, Jellybean.

943
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:43,172
Mom?

944
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:46,998
It's not the reunion I had
imagined. It's all so rushed.

945
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:49,232
You two have done
such great work.

946
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:51,998
You just need
a little...

947
00:59:52,078 --> 00:59:54,078
nudge.

948
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:10,799
Janet, how is
this possible?

949
01:00:12,718 --> 01:00:15,568
It wasn't a message you put in
Scott's head. It was an antenna.

950
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:17,490
Clever girl.

951
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,591
I'm so proud of you.

952
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:23,044
Honey, tell us where you are.
Tell us how to find you.

953
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:26,849
No, the probability fields are too complex.
That's why I needed to talk to you.

954
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,834
You have to
follow my voice.

955
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:32,214
- Of course.
- Like tracing a call back to its source.

956
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,743
I'm tracking your signal using
subatomic frequencies,

957
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:42,174
between point
2 and point 9.

958
01:00:42,254 --> 01:00:45,004
- I'd narrow it to 4 and 6.
- That's too tight. We could miss you.

959
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:47,948
Look at us squabbling again.

960
01:00:48,028 --> 01:00:50,739
Fine. All right, between 3 and 7.

961
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:54,788
Our first fight in decades
and it's over just like that.

962
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,037
Bullseye.

963
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,756
- Source lock.
- It's you!

964
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,443
Ha! We got it!

965
01:01:16,523 --> 01:01:18,725
You have to meet me at
these exact coordinates.

966
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:21,327
In the wasteland, beyond
the quantum void.

967
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:24,832
It's very dangerous, especially on
the human mind. So be careful.

968
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:27,559
Time and space work
very differently down here.

969
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:30,441
You have two hours. After that,
the probability fields will shift,

970
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,522
and it'll be another century
before they align like this again.

971
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:35,992
We'll find you.

972
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:44,732
I know you
will, Jellybean.

973
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,448
Nope.

974
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:53,553
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

975
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:55,432
Perfect.

976
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:58,132
How did we get up here?

977
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:04,963
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds
of lights, and it's gonna get really trippy

978
01:02:05,043 --> 01:02:08,010
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

979
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,488
Scott, I'll be fine.

980
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:13,055
- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there.
- Yeah, so you've mentioned.

981
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:18,868
Um, sorry. I have
to take this.

982
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:20,285
Hey, man. You coming?

983
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:22,246
No, I'm not. But you
know what? Ghost is.

984
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:24,511
And you know what? The
feds, they know where you are.

985
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:26,121
- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

986
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:29,152
They gave me some truth serum, then all
of a sudden I started talking all honestly,

987
01:02:29,232 --> 01:02:32,784
like, I hate the way that you load the
dishwasher. I hate it, I hate it.

988
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,378
But you need to go home because
the feds are probably going there now!

989
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,105
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, okay?

990
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:40,195
They don't go there!

991
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:49,671
Ah, I feel like
such a jerk.

992
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:52,929
You're gonna be really
mad. We gotta go. Now.

993
01:02:53,009 --> 01:02:54,812
- What?
- Ghost knows where we are.

994
01:02:54,892 --> 01:02:56,750
- So does the FBI.
- How?

995
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,884
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

996
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:01,376
I told him to come here, so I can help
him with the Karapetyan proposal.

997
01:03:01,456 --> 01:03:02,603
Oh, my God!

998
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:06,110
But... Look, we need to land that account.
Otherwise, we lose the business!

999
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,125
Do you know how hard it is for ex-
cons to find work these days?

1000
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,560
Jesus, Scott!

1001
01:03:19,273 --> 01:03:20,921
90 seconds to
close the aperture.

1002
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,533
- You have to depolarize the coils first.
- I know.

1003
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:25,877
I'm really sorry, but the, um...

1004
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:28,721
FBI is coming
to my place, so...

1005
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:31,085
I have to go.

1006
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,622
Can I borrow the suit?

1007
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:40,591
Look, uh... I'm just
gonna borrow the suit.

1008
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:42,860
I'll come back. Just
tell me where you'll be.

1009
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,352
- Don't bother.
- What?

1010
01:03:44,432 --> 01:03:46,922
We'll come and get the suit from
you as soon as we've found my mom.

1011
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:50,059
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

1012
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:08,603
- Scott?
- Daddy?

1013
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:12,267
- It's us, buddy!
- We're here for Cassie's shoes.

1014
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:13,681
He must be resting.

1015
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:16,126
Honey, why don't you go upstairs.
Go look under your bed.

1016
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:19,290
Daddy? You upstairs?

1017
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,370
Daddy...

1018
01:04:21,933 --> 01:04:24,380
What the...?

1019
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:28,118
He really lives like
a pig these days.

1020
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:32,201
Daddy?

1021
01:04:38,899 --> 01:04:41,077
Spread out!

1022
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:43,702
- Again?
- You people have no shame!

1023
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:47,457
- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.
- Yeah, I'm not buying it.

1024
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:51,242
Cassie, let
the man get by.

1025
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:53,694
- But Daddy's super sick!
- I'll see about that.

1026
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:55,711
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick.

1027
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,875
Well, I'll take my
chances, sweetie.

1028
01:04:57,955 --> 01:05:00,180
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1029
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,208
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1030
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:06,601
- Like, a lot, a lot?
- Yes!

1031
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:09,473
- Forget it. Move aside.
- No!

1032
01:05:13,732 --> 01:05:15,644
Woo!

1033
01:05:15,724 --> 01:05:18,875
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

1034
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:22,534
So I'm sorry. I'm just really sick.

1035
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:24,354
I told you.

1036
01:05:24,434 --> 01:05:27,558
Excuse me. Sometimes you
just gotta get it out, you know?

1037
01:05:27,638 --> 01:05:29,638
Sorry.

1038
01:05:35,726 --> 01:05:39,784
I'll start the van.
You get the lab.

1039
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:45,556
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1040
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:03,583
Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne.
You're under arrest.

1041
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:06,710
- This is harassment.
- Actually, it's not.

1042
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:11,082
What does the FBI even stand for?
Forever Bothering Individuals?

1043
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:15,062
- His monitor check out?
- Of course, it does.

1044
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:18,691
Damn it. Looks like I just got
fed a bowl of malarkey.

1045
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,569
We got them, sir. Pym and
Van Dyne are in custody.

1046
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:24,402
Seriously? Yes!

1047
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:28,928
Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were
your friends. That's insensitive.

1048
01:06:29,008 --> 01:06:31,561
I just really needed a
win, you know? Anyway...

1049
01:06:31,641 --> 01:06:35,876
I'll be back later for the official end of your
sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal.

1050
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:38,959
You should feel
great about yourself.

1051
01:07:01,743 --> 01:07:02,565
What is it?

1052
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:05,903
We have a man down,
and Pym's lab is gone.

1053
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:15,711
Hey.

1054
01:07:16,797 --> 01:07:20,331
- Thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.

1055
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:24,240
So..

1056
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,049
How long have you
been Ant-Man again?

1057
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,091
Not long.

1058
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:34,138
It just sort
of happened.

1059
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:37,802
I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm
sorry for risking everything.

1060
01:07:37,882 --> 01:07:40,752
- Dad, it's okay.
- It's not.

1061
01:07:41,335 --> 01:07:45,302
I do some dumb things, and the people
that I love the most pay the price.

1062
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:46,350
Mainly, you.

1063
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,756
Trying to help
people isn't dumb.

1064
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:50,836
Well...

1065
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:53,359
I screw it up just
about every time.

1066
01:07:53,439 --> 01:07:56,600
So maybe you just need
someone watching your back.

1067
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,952
Like a partner.

1068
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,546
Well, she's made it clear that's
about the last thing she wants.

1069
01:08:00,626 --> 01:08:03,214
- Who?
- Hope.

1070
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:08,323
- Wait, who did you think?
- Me.

1071
01:08:08,403 --> 01:08:09,862
You?

1072
01:08:09,942 --> 01:08:11,721
Don't laugh.

1073
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:15,584
- I'd be a great partner.
- Oh, Peanut! Oh.

1074
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:18,213
You would be awesome.

1075
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:21,999
And if I let you, I would
be a terrible dad.

1076
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:23,408
Fine.

1077
01:08:23,488 --> 01:08:26,897
Have Hope be your
partner. She's smart.

1078
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:30,111
She reminds me of you.

1079
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:32,440
You gonna go help her?

1080
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,337
I think you should help her.

1081
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:37,233
I wish I could, but...

1082
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:40,694
I don't know how I can help
her without hurting you.

1083
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:47,877
You can do it. You
can do anything.

1084
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:51,182
You are the World's
Greatest Grandma.

1085
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,005
Agent Woo will
see you in an hour.

1086
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:02,301
An hour? We don't
have an hour.

1087
01:09:02,381 --> 01:09:05,563
Aww. You got somewhere
else to be?

1088
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:15,470
Aw, now, that's my girl.

1089
01:09:21,038 --> 01:09:23,737
All right, what's our plan?

1090
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:26,576
To shrink that wall.

1091
01:09:26,656 --> 01:09:29,334
It looks load bearing.
Ceiling could collapse.

1092
01:09:29,414 --> 01:09:33,326
- Then we run like hell.
- I just made out 15 or 20 agents on the floor.

1093
01:09:33,406 --> 01:09:35,357
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1094
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,537
- They're all heavily armed.
- Not great odds.

1095
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:41,542
- You got any better ideas?
- Nope.

1096
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:43,932
But I'm not giving
up on Mom.

1097
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:46,585
She'd be so proud of you.

1098
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:53,066
Okay.

1099
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:55,454
One...

1100
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:57,534
Two...

1101
01:10:01,526 --> 01:10:02,424
Scott?

1102
01:10:02,504 --> 01:10:04,290
What are you two just
standing around for?

1103
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,556
We gotta go
find that lab.

1104
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,883
What about me?

1105
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,391
Perfect.

1106
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:13,833
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1107
01:10:16,555 --> 01:10:18,555
Sir.

1108
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,182
Okay. Now what?

1109
01:10:27,262 --> 01:10:29,421
You're asking me?

1110
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:33,223
Get in!

1111
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:39,705
Hi.

1112
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,785
Hi.

1113
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,887
Uh, excuse me. Are we
planning on leaving soon,

1114
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:50,923
or are you two gonna keep staring at each
other until they start shooting at us.

1115
01:10:56,964 --> 01:10:58,337
- Hey, Burch.
- Yeah?

1116
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:01,873
- Yeah. They're out.
- I'm on my way.

1117
01:11:05,488 --> 01:11:08,253
- A suit is missing, and so is the van.
- How could this happen?

1118
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,875
I mean, what the dickens?

1119
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,651
Thank you.

1120
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:17,156
You're welcome.

1121
01:11:18,051 --> 01:11:20,198
So, uh, how do
we find the lab?

1122
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:24,659
After I lost it the first time,
I put on a new tracker...

1123
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,437
...of sorts.

1124
01:11:35,382 --> 01:11:37,760
That'll work.

1125
01:12:03,471 --> 01:12:05,555
Is it ready or not?

1126
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:08,794
We can begin the
extraction process now.

1127
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,892
Listen, Ava, this whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1128
01:12:12,972 --> 01:12:16,947
- Maybe, maybe we should...
- Maybe we should what? Wait?

1129
01:12:17,027 --> 01:12:20,217
I've got days until I'm dead.

1130
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:24,393
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1131
01:12:26,117 --> 01:12:28,919
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1132
01:12:28,999 --> 01:12:31,677
We don't have much time before Mom's
location shifts and we lose her.

1133
01:12:31,757 --> 01:12:34,474
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1134
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:37,630
You know, my Pap-pap always said if you
wanna do something right, you make a list.

1135
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,997
So, we should do that.

1136
01:12:39,077 --> 01:12:41,310
One, we have to
break into that lab.

1137
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,124
Two, we have to kick
out Foster and Ghost.

1138
01:12:44,204 --> 01:12:48,122
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.
That seems like it should be part of 2.

1139
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:50,405
2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A.

1140
01:12:50,485 --> 01:12:52,343
Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh!

1141
01:12:52,423 --> 01:12:56,085
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully
grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed.

1142
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:56,725
Scott...

1143
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:58,108
You want me to start
again? I'll start again.

1144
01:12:58,188 --> 01:13:00,472
I'm going to dive.

1145
01:13:01,368 --> 01:13:04,272
The only chance we've got is if
the 2 of you are out here

1146
01:13:04,352 --> 01:13:07,651
together, protecting the tunnel.

1147
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:10,906
Let me do this,
Hope. Please.

1148
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,140
Let me get her.

1149
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:17,204
I think he's right.

1150
01:13:24,128 --> 01:13:26,654
Whassup?

1151
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:31,767
You remember that
beloved commercial?

1152
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,954
Whassup?

1153
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,907
I had him follow us here.

1154
01:13:35,987 --> 01:13:39,068
I thought we could
use some help.

1155
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:43,259
All right. I'm in position.
The ants are headed in.

1156
01:13:43,339 --> 01:13:46,306
- Copy that.
- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1157
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:48,386
- You want a Pez?
- No.

1158
01:13:49,116 --> 01:13:51,224
Cassie gave me
this for my birthday.

1159
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,787
By the way,
I love that suit!

1160
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:55,997
Thanks, man.

1161
01:13:56,077 --> 01:13:58,562
I wish I had a suit.

1162
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:02,777
I would even, eh, I would even like, like, a
suit with like minimal powers, you know?

1163
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:06,996
Or maybe, even just
a suit. With no powers.

1164
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:23,639
What is it?

1165
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:25,831
I don't know.

1166
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,169
It's them.

1167
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:36,122
They can't be far.

1168
01:14:55,877 --> 01:14:58,156
Hank? Hank?

1169
01:14:58,236 --> 01:15:00,236
Stop it!

1170
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:02,289
Dad, what's your status?

1171
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:06,379
Foster's taken care
of. Suiting up, now.

1172
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:12,241
I just wanted to save Ava.

1173
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:16,554
She's facing death or something
far more terrible. She's afraid.

1174
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:21,108
I'll help you find a cure when
I get back. I promise.

1175
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:24,925
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1176
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:28,423
Good luck, Hank.

1177
01:15:28,503 --> 01:15:30,710
Thanks, Bill.

1178
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:34,222
Now, I'm gonna need
you to step back.

1179
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:54,390
Time remaining:
fifteen minutes.

1180
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:57,965
Hank's in, Scott.
Any sign of her?

1181
01:15:58,045 --> 01:16:00,868
No. Nothing yet.

1182
01:16:05,286 --> 01:16:07,286
Ava!

1183
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:11,503
Call off the ants, Scott.

1184
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,583
Oh, boy.

1185
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:39,980
Can I get a status report, 'cause I got
some serious Ghost problems here?

1186
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:44,433
Ready to dive.

1187
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,244
- In case I don't make it...
- Don't. Don't say that.

1188
01:16:54,538 --> 01:16:56,583
I can't lose you, too.

1189
01:16:56,663 --> 01:16:59,486
I love you, Hope.

1190
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:03,259
Guys, everything's bad
over here. Please...

1191
01:17:17,912 --> 01:17:19,912
Now.

1192
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:30,413
Misdirection.

1193
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:34,777
One of the first things they teach you
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1194
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:38,524
No!

1195
01:17:40,563 --> 01:17:42,655
Mighta worked, we
got it, Scotty.

1196
01:17:42,735 --> 01:17:46,047
- Meet us at the rendezvous point.
- Okay. On my way.

1197
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,096
Oh, no.

1198
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:51,662
Really?

1199
01:17:51,742 --> 01:17:54,310
- This guy? Again?
- Who?

1200
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:57,674
I told you our business
wasn't over.

1201
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:01,343
Change of plans.

1202
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,225
Hang on.

1203
01:18:13,328 --> 01:18:16,472
I want that lab, boys.
Whatever it takes.

1204
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:27,221
Hold on.

1205
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:39,906
Ooh!

1206
01:18:39,986 --> 01:18:41,619
That undercarriage is filthy!

1207
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:44,254
Now they have
bigger problems.

1208
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:51,056
Hope, what are you doing? You're
heading away from the rendezvous point.

1209
01:18:51,136 --> 01:18:53,462
Don't worry. I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.

1210
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,379
Wait, what
are you... Oh.

1211
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,740
No!

1212
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:19,723
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're
gonna die! We're gonna die!

1213
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:33,769
Signal lost.

1214
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,004
What the hell are
they doing up there?

1215
01:19:38,313 --> 01:19:41,019
Recalibrating.

1216
01:19:55,317 --> 01:19:57,812
Recalibrating.

1217
01:19:58,223 --> 01:20:01,632
You never said it was
so beautiful, Scott.

1218
01:20:07,194 --> 01:20:09,806
Recalibrating.

1219
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:14,770
Okay. Anytime now.

1220
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,853
Recalibrating.

1221
01:20:19,577 --> 01:20:22,324
- Recalibrating.
- Come on.

1222
01:20:22,404 --> 01:20:24,985
Signal restored.

1223
01:20:37,147 --> 01:20:40,032
Bikes, it's all you.

1224
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:45,657
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait, Hope!

1225
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:57,490
Well, the 60's were fun.
But now, I'm paying for it!

1226
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:59,058
Be careful up there!

1227
01:20:59,138 --> 01:21:02,096
Give me a break. I haven't
driven in two years.

1228
01:21:30,978 --> 01:21:33,238
Aw, you got Pez'd!

1229
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:37,037
Up here!

1230
01:21:39,073 --> 01:21:41,365
Oh, that's not good.

1231
01:21:44,073 --> 01:21:46,073
Hope!

1232
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:52,724
No!

1233
01:21:56,774 --> 01:22:00,020
There it is right there, get the lab.
Get, get, get the lab!

1234
01:22:08,275 --> 01:22:11,153
I've got her.
Westbound on Primo.

1235
01:22:13,438 --> 01:22:15,157
Hope! Wait!

1236
01:22:15,237 --> 01:22:17,958
Hey! What about me?

1237
01:22:25,928 --> 01:22:27,928
We got you now, Ava!

1238
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:55,834
Not again!

1239
01:22:56,732 --> 01:22:58,884
Piece of junk!

1240
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:03,938
Ah! Yes!

1241
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:08,277
Go. Go, go, go, go!

1242
01:23:09,687 --> 01:23:13,072
Burch got the lab.
I'm going after him.

1243
01:23:21,905 --> 01:23:24,454
No, no, no,
no, no!

1244
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:29,626
Work in progress, my ass.

1245
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:45,927
Scott, where are you? I've got
Burch in my sights. Hurry!

1246
01:23:46,007 --> 01:23:49,425
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- We're running out of time!

1247
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,447
Warning. Approaching
quantum void.

1248
01:24:20,816 --> 01:24:23,358
I'm coming to you, Honey.

1249
01:25:09,331 --> 01:25:10,602
Guys...

1250
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:12,470
Don't you need the
remote to the lab?

1251
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,768
'Cause I just found it.

1252
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:16,324
We can't grow the lab without it.
Get it to us, fast.

1253
01:25:16,404 --> 01:25:20,304
- Yeah, but the van is busted.
- Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1254
01:25:22,169 --> 01:25:24,169
Wha?

1255
01:25:28,694 --> 01:25:30,302
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1256
01:25:30,382 --> 01:25:34,181
The remote! We're missing the remote.
We gotta check the van.

1257
01:25:36,568 --> 01:25:38,568
Huh?

1258
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:43,719
Awesome!

1259
01:26:09,475 --> 01:26:12,098
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.
Burch's boys are all over me.

1260
01:26:12,178 --> 01:26:15,923
- I'm on my way.
- Right. I'll get the lab.

1261
01:26:18,959 --> 01:26:20,959
Hi!

1262
01:26:21,114 --> 01:26:23,624
Oh, that's badass!

1263
01:26:31,469 --> 01:26:33,469
Oh, nice!

1264
01:26:42,316 --> 01:26:44,316
Toink!

1265
01:26:48,424 --> 01:26:52,293
Come here, you little weasel!
Oh, no, you don't!

1266
01:26:54,704 --> 01:26:57,319
I guess... Well,
maybe, you do.

1267
01:26:57,399 --> 01:26:59,399
Come on!

1268
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:14,420
Anyone see a southern gentleman
carrying a building?

1269
01:27:17,903 --> 01:27:20,781
How did he even have
time to buy a ticket?

1270
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:25,374
Just one time, please. Work!

1271
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:29,155
Yes! Oh. All right, I need help.

1272
01:27:29,363 --> 01:27:31,363
That's it.

1273
01:27:31,464 --> 01:27:34,489
Oh... sorry! Uh...

1274
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,295
Hey! Come on, man!

1275
01:27:38,542 --> 01:27:40,298
Not cool!

1276
01:27:40,378 --> 01:27:42,378
Murderers!

1277
01:27:43,283 --> 01:27:45,701
Yes! Yes!

1278
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:52,730
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas.
You're a badass! Yes!

1279
01:27:55,245 --> 01:27:58,748
No. No. No! Ant-onio!

1280
01:28:00,386 --> 01:28:05,010
Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the
San Francisco bay for a little leisure,

1281
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:08,194
- and a little breeding.
- Listen, Uzman...

1282
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:12,368
Just meet me at the
waterfront in three hours.

1283
01:28:12,448 --> 01:28:17,021
Oh, folks, we've barely left the dock, but
it looks like we've got some company!

1284
01:28:19,846 --> 01:28:23,493
Look, there, right there, you see it folks?
There it is. There's a breach.

1285
01:28:23,573 --> 01:28:25,573
What the...?

1286
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:34,706
Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's
okay, it's okay.

1287
01:28:34,786 --> 01:28:37,872
Sorry. No, I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1288
01:28:37,952 --> 01:28:40,488
Hey! That doesn't belong to you.

1289
01:28:40,568 --> 01:28:43,394
- No! No! No! No!
- You're embarassing yourself now.

1290
01:28:43,474 --> 01:28:46,074
- Come on. Let go!
- No!

1291
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,154
Thank you.

1292
01:28:49,614 --> 01:28:51,614
I'll take this now.

1293
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:03,665
No...

1294
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,259
<i>...melts your mind...</i>

1295
01:29:10,196 --> 01:29:12,621
<i>...a message in your head...</i>

1296
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:17,370
<i>...I had a dream...</i>

1297
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:38,937
<i>Daddy?</i>

1298
01:29:42,449 --> 01:29:44,449
<i>Daddy?</i>

1299
01:29:46,618 --> 01:29:48,092
Dad?

1300
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:51,955
What's going on? Why
haven't you found Mom?

1301
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:56,526
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1302
01:29:57,562 --> 01:30:01,096
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1303
01:30:56,098 --> 01:30:58,098
It's me.

1304
01:31:11,204 --> 01:31:13,504
I'm so sorry!

1305
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:18,668
- It took so long.
- No.

1306
01:31:19,243 --> 01:31:21,394
No...

1307
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:23,571
You're here now.

1308
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:26,891
Let's go home.

1309
01:31:28,123 --> 01:31:30,448
I thought I was gone.

1310
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:33,434
But that energy from your hands.

1311
01:31:33,514 --> 01:31:35,737
How did you do that?

1312
01:31:37,862 --> 01:31:40,884
I'm not the same woman I
was 30 years ago, Henry.

1313
01:31:40,964 --> 01:31:43,060
This place...

1314
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:45,818
It changes you.

1315
01:31:46,948 --> 01:31:50,118
And adaptation is part of
it, but some of it is...

1316
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:52,198
Evolution.

1317
01:31:53,956 --> 01:31:58,607
Lab coordinates not found.
Do not ascend.

1318
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:02,825
I should probably tell you what
we're dealing with up there.

1319
01:32:03,846 --> 01:32:09,607
I got the lab. I got the lab.
Move. Move...

1320
01:32:09,893 --> 01:32:11,758
Move!

1321
01:32:11,838 --> 01:32:14,513
Get out of the...

1322
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:21,528
Let's go.

1323
01:32:22,559 --> 01:32:25,605
Uh, no one here appears to
be sure what this is.

1324
01:32:25,685 --> 01:32:29,827
It seems he's
90, 80, 85 feet tall.

1325
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,685
Get out of the way!

1326
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:41,654
I got the lab. The lab! Okay...

1327
01:32:41,734 --> 01:32:42,998
The air feels chunky.

1328
01:32:43,078 --> 01:32:46,229
Oh, no. He's too big.

1329
01:32:48,835 --> 01:32:51,521
- Scotty!
- Scott!

1330
01:32:51,601 --> 01:32:53,099
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1331
01:32:53,179 --> 01:32:55,982
I'm just gonna go to sleep
now for five minutes.

1332
01:32:56,062 --> 01:33:01,127
I just need five minutes.
Five minutes...

1333
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:10,165
You get the lab somewhere safe.
Scott's air won't last!

1334
01:33:10,245 --> 01:33:12,245
Okay!

1335
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:29,330
Move. Move. Move!

1336
01:33:31,964 --> 01:33:34,006
No, wait!

1337
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,437
Lab at full scale.

1338
01:33:46,517 --> 01:33:48,797
- They did it!
- Ready to ascend.

1339
01:33:48,877 --> 01:33:51,380
Let's go see our daughter.

1340
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,540
Scott.

1341
01:34:15,509 --> 01:34:17,140
Scott!

1342
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,918
Scott, come on. Wake up.

1343
01:34:32,996 --> 01:34:36,546
Come on. Come on.
Where are you, Scott?

1344
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:40,070
Gotcha.

1345
01:34:43,188 --> 01:34:45,188
Scott?

1346
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,859
Hey!

1347
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:57,594
Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in.

1348
01:34:57,674 --> 01:35:00,599
Did you get crushed by the building?

1349
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:04,559
- Sco...
- Where's the remote, Luis?

1350
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:07,185
It, it, it's probably in there.

1351
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:08,771
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1352
01:35:08,851 --> 01:35:12,963
I guess this is where
we say, Adios, amigo.

1353
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,249
No, no, no, no!

1354
01:35:18,204 --> 01:35:20,204
Thanks, guys.

1355
01:35:25,568 --> 01:35:28,563
Ava? Ava!

1356
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,315
Ava.

1357
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:36,963
- Almost ready for extraction.
- Please, stop. People are getting hurt.

1358
01:35:37,043 --> 01:35:39,870
Everything hurts. Don't
talk to me about pain.

1359
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:43,291
What if Hank is right? What
if this process kills Janet?

1360
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:44,739
What, you're worried about her?

1361
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:48,036
All I'm saying is that she is a brilliant
scientist. She may be able to help.

1362
01:35:48,116 --> 01:35:50,770
Oh, she will help. Right now.

1363
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:53,409
And if she dies, she dies!

1364
01:35:53,489 --> 01:35:54,535
No, no.

1365
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:58,540
I'm sorry, we can't do this.
We have to find another way.

1366
01:36:00,927 --> 01:36:03,391
This is the way.

1367
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:25,912
Janet!

1368
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,680
She's starting the extraction.

1369
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,346
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1370
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:50,570
No!

1371
01:37:23,898 --> 01:37:25,898
Hope!

1372
01:37:42,366 --> 01:37:44,366
Are you okay?

1373
01:37:58,116 --> 01:38:00,116
Mom?

1374
01:38:08,051 --> 01:38:10,343
Oh my god.

1375
01:38:14,254 --> 01:38:16,254
We found you.

1376
01:38:19,832 --> 01:38:21,832
I missed you so much.

1377
01:38:22,207 --> 01:38:25,264
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1378
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:32,436
It's okay. I'm, I'm here now.
We have time.

1379
01:38:33,145 --> 01:38:35,999
No more last minute
business trips, okay?

1380
01:38:36,809 --> 01:38:38,127
I promise.

1381
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:41,276
No, it's okay, it's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1382
01:38:41,356 --> 01:38:43,538
- I'll be fine.
- Dad!

1383
01:38:48,185 --> 01:38:49,871
Scott.

1384
01:38:49,951 --> 01:38:51,951
Miss Van Dyne.

1385
01:38:53,154 --> 01:38:54,777
It's nice to...

1386
01:38:54,857 --> 01:38:57,344
Well I guess we've already met.

1387
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,560
I guess we have.

1388
01:39:01,904 --> 01:39:03,904
Wait.

1389
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:13,329
Your pain.

1390
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,720
I can feel it.

1391
01:39:18,748 --> 01:39:20,748
It hurts.

1392
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:24,705
It always hurts.

1393
01:39:26,486 --> 01:39:28,512
I'm sorry.

1394
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:34,114
I think I can help you.

1395
01:40:07,486 --> 01:40:10,075
Did you know she could do that?

1396
01:40:12,822 --> 01:40:14,822
It's okay.

1397
01:40:16,447 --> 01:40:19,977
Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa!

1398
01:40:20,057 --> 01:40:21,281
The, uh, the...

1399
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:24,969
The cops are coming.
Like, all of them.

1400
01:40:25,049 --> 01:40:27,953
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go.

1401
01:40:28,033 --> 01:40:30,458
What about them?

1402
01:40:32,979 --> 01:40:34,352
Hands in the air!

1403
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,353
No. No, no,
we do our jobs.

1404
01:40:36,433 --> 01:40:38,837
You see, we see these guys,
they trying to shoot people.

1405
01:40:38,917 --> 01:40:41,837
So we apprehended them. For you.
You're welcome.

1406
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:46,103
- We traffic in stolen technology.
- And we have killed many, many people.

1407
01:40:46,183 --> 01:40:49,650
- He's in charge.
- That's true. I am.

1408
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:53,322
I've also committed numerous healthcode
violations in my restaurant.

1409
01:40:53,402 --> 01:40:56,561
Some of them would shock you.

1410
01:40:58,659 --> 01:41:00,927
It is truth serum.

1411
01:41:04,832 --> 01:41:08,217
We gotta get out
of here. Fast.

1412
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,744
I have an idea.

1413
01:41:10,824 --> 01:41:14,135
Giant figure now spotted at the
intersection of Broadway and Wycona.

1414
01:41:14,215 --> 01:41:17,100
- All units move in.
- Go. Go.

1415
01:41:20,014 --> 01:41:22,579
There he is.

1416
01:41:26,224 --> 01:41:28,011
It's over, Scotty.

1417
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:30,688
I'm sorry but we got you, man.

1418
01:41:30,904 --> 01:41:34,766
Come on, it's the end of the line, pal.
There's nowhere to hide.

1419
01:41:36,099 --> 01:41:39,563
Just pull off that band-aid.
You lost. It's okay.

1420
01:41:40,943 --> 01:41:44,242
Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself!

1421
01:41:49,149 --> 01:41:51,149
Aw, magic!

1422
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:56,370
Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now.

1423
01:42:02,596 --> 01:42:04,735
Well done, Honey.

1424
01:42:04,815 --> 01:42:06,815
Let's go!

1425
01:42:14,457 --> 01:42:16,534
- Leave me here.
- We can make it.

1426
01:42:16,614 --> 01:42:18,929
You said it yourself.

1427
01:42:19,168 --> 01:42:21,374
I've hurt people.

1428
01:42:21,504 --> 01:42:23,205
But you haven't.

1429
01:42:23,285 --> 01:42:26,689
- Go, please.
- We can make it, Ava.

1430
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:28,415
Bill...

1431
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:30,780
I'm not leaving you.

1432
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,970
Oh, hey guys.

1433
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:18,482
Are my two years up already?

1434
01:43:24,718 --> 01:43:27,927
What's it like out there?
Huh? I mean...

1435
01:43:28,007 --> 01:43:32,129
Do people still dance? Are
food trucks still a thing?

1436
01:43:32,209 --> 01:43:35,168
Oh, you got away with it
this time, Scott, but uh...

1437
01:43:35,248 --> 01:43:37,457
I'll be seeing you again.

1438
01:43:37,537 --> 01:43:39,457
Where?

1439
01:43:39,537 --> 01:43:40,512
Huh?

1440
01:43:40,592 --> 01:43:42,965
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1441
01:43:43,045 --> 01:43:44,707
Like...

1442
01:43:44,787 --> 01:43:48,622
in general, I'll see you. Like, the
next time you do something bad.

1443
01:43:48,702 --> 01:43:50,450
- I'll be there. To catch you.
- Oh.

1444
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:54,869
You'll be watching and then... I thought
you were inviting me somewhere.

1445
01:43:55,733 --> 01:43:57,292
Why would I do that?

1446
01:43:57,372 --> 01:43:59,513
That's what I was wondering.
Why would you do that. I, I...

1447
01:43:59,593 --> 01:44:01,433
Like a party, or, like,
dinner or something?

1448
01:44:01,513 --> 01:44:03,652
I don't know. I thought you
were planning the evening.

1449
01:44:03,732 --> 01:44:06,035
No. I meant to, like, arrest you.
Like, I'll arrest you later again.

1450
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:08,115
- Take it easy.
- Okay.

1451
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:10,775
Did you wanna grab dinner
or something?

1452
01:44:10,855 --> 01:44:14,514
I mean, 'cause I'm free.
Yeah. Come on.

1453
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:26,550
- You ready?
- Yes!

1454
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:29,675
- Daddy!
- Hi!

1455
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:34,648
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1456
01:44:34,728 --> 01:44:38,074
- 8:30, Monday.
- Sounds great.

1457
01:44:38,259 --> 01:44:41,874
Mr. Karapetyan?
Yeah, you saw that?

1458
01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:45,500
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1459
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:48,527
I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M.
Okay.

1460
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,539
That's how you close the deal!

1461
01:45:20,749 --> 01:45:22,978
This is awesome.

1462
01:45:23,343 --> 01:45:24,536
So, Cassie.

1463
01:45:24,616 --> 01:45:26,794
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

1464
01:45:26,874 --> 01:45:30,759
I wanna help people.
Like my dad.

1465
01:45:31,014 --> 01:45:33,014
Really?

1466
01:45:33,288 --> 01:45:35,076
I wanted to be his partner.

1467
01:45:35,156 --> 01:45:37,565
But he said he wants you.

1468
01:45:37,836 --> 01:45:39,836
Is that so?

1469
01:45:43,476 --> 01:45:45,476
Daddy!

1470
01:45:46,288 --> 01:45:48,240
Whoa! Hold on.

1471
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,916
- Move! Get outta here!
- No. Don't. Don't!

1472
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,482
Oh! Gross.

1473
01:45:55,562 --> 01:45:58,115
Ugh. I hate that, moth dust.

1474
01:45:58,195 --> 01:46:02,502
Go. Shoo! Shoo!

1475
01:46:04,975 --> 01:46:12,975
