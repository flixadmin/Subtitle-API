1
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,310
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,040
Your mother
never understood this.

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,800
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,980
I saw potential.

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,460
When a bully took your money,
you took his eye.

6
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,090
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

7
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,750
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,440
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,540
Love?

10
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,890
No.

11
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,510
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,270
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,450
because a father and his son
is everything.

14
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,970
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

15
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,490
You.

16
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,420
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,670
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,470
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,880
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,470
Kill them?
You'd show them mercy?

21
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,850
No, my son.

22
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,350
When suffering is owed,
never accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,730
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,810
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,530
And in there,

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,450
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

27
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,620
Let's get started.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,420
Shit!

29
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,270
Hey, there's too many of them!

30
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,180
- We're not gonna make it.
- You're right. We aren't.

31
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,240
- You are.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

32
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,030
Now, you stick with the plan.

33
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,810
It was always the plan.

34
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,480
Get him.

35
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,170
You had it.

36
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,380
I didn't have it.

37
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,830
B, no one starts
at the finish line.

38
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,010
You got to have faith.

39
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,700
Remember today's lesson.

40
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,390
Find the line,

41
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,390
feel the car,

42
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,740
and let it fly.

43
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,850
- It's okay to be afraid.

44
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,120
Sometimes fear can be
the best teacher.

45
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,680
I wasn't scared.

46
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,580
- Everyone gets scared, son.
- You don't.

47
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,590
You're not afraid of anything.

48
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,510
We better hurry.

49
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,410
- Great-Grandma just flew in.

50
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,760
And she's making
her famous maduros.

51
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,520
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

52
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,110
Now, that's something
to be afraid of.

53
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,470
You have been dead.

54
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,230
- It's time to get you living.
Told you guys,

55
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,230
I don't need that.

56
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,170
There, profile done.

57
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,620
You're welcome.

58
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,070
Now, you give it
about three, four days...

59
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,410
- It never happens instantly.

60
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,170
- Wait, what?
Hmm.

61
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,490
Wow.

62
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,830
Let me see
your profile picture again.

63
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,110
He must have
put a filter on there.

64
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,730
What are you guys looking at?

65
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,250
- Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
- They're just video games, man.

66
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,490
- H-H-Hold on, man.
- Just videos, man.

67
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,700
Can I sit next to you?

68
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,630
Boy nosy.
- You drifting yet?

69
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,880
I am.

70
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,980
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

71
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,360
Hey!

72
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,360
!¡Oye, familia!

73
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,850
I am starving!

74
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,540
- Come on.

75
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,710
I also want a hug from
every single person in--

76
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,100
Oh.

77
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,680
- Ah.
- You see the line?

78
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,480
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

79
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,510
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait till you taste this.

80
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,620
It's really good.

81
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,480
I put myself out for this one.

82
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,930
- Oh.

83
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,730
Okay, everybody pipe down,
please.

84
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,780
Abuelita would like
to say something.

85
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,390
- Piping and downing, please.

86
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,640
As I look out
at this wonderful family,

87
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,990
I am filled with so much pride.

88
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,440
The kind of pride that my son--
your father--

89
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,340
would have enjoyed
if he were here.

90
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,240
I know that this road
has been very hard

91
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,080
and also not fair.

92
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,520
And yet here you are,

93
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,140
despite all of the odds,

94
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,460
building this magnificent

95
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,490
- leg...

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,050
It is a legacy that will go on
for generations.

97
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,500
No one can take it away.

98
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,440
Not now.

99
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,890
Not ever.

100
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,960
- Yeah!

101
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,030
To familia.

102
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,000
Familia.

103
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,140
Siempre. Always.

104
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,730
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

105
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,180
Come on, Roman.
The agency put you in charge,

106
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,350
and you said I get to drive.

107
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,180
See, what I really need

108
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,290
is I need your brain.

109
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,290
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

110
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,400
So talk me through it again.
I need details.

111
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,050
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

112
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,190
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

113
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,440
will be transported
through the streets of Rome,

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,610
and they need us to steal it.

115
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,540
I checked Roman's intel.

116
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,580
It's legit.

117
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,650
Of course it's legit.

118
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,000
We're talking 'bout Rome.

119
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,240
Rome. Roman.

120
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,660
Come on, man.

121
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,240
That's like planning a heist
in my backyard.

122
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,690
Only thing you know about Rome
is "ro-man" noodles.

123
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,630
One thing
you didn't explain to us is:

124
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,110
Why the hell
do we need a RC car,

125
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,630
a gold Lamborghini
and 12 tanks of laughing gas?

126
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,010
Yes, I'm in,
'cause you are definitely

127
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,500
going to need
all the brains you can get.

128
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,910
You up to something.

129
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,530
- Hey, Rome... -
Don't talk to me, man.

130
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,880
Don't talk to me.

131
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,470
- All right.
- You know what?

132
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,780
The disrespect
is gon' have to stop.

133
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,470
Now!

134
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,270
That's just my--
You know what I'm saying?

135
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,620
Me just, you know,
practicing my leadership voice.

136
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,480
I see what's going on.

137
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,380
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

138
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,520
Look at you.

139
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,870
Spying on me.

140
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,660
What's up with
this old boat anchor?

141
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,840
No fuel injection.

142
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,280
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

143
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,560
and better from you, Dom.

144
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,940
Little B and I
are building it together.

145
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,770
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

146
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,290
That's the problem nowadays.

147
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,020
- Nobody listens anymore.
- Well, you better watch out.

148
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,810
Little man's gonna be
a better wrench than any of us

149
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,130
by the time he's 12.

150
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

151
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,440
Pass it down.

152
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Each generation
better than the last.

153
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,310
That's true.

154
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,810
That's fatherhood.

155
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,870
Come a long way from
the two of us popping gas trucks

156
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,970
- in the D.R., huh?
- We sure did.

157
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,660
Those were some tough times.

158
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,990
Those were some great times.

159
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,500
Oh, you...
Y-Y'all was in a meeting?

160
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,160
- I'm sorry.

161
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,780
I-I ain't want
to interrupt y'all.

162
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,540
Han, let's go, man.

163
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,510
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

164
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,240
How could I tell him no?

165
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,320
But you know I can't let them
go to Rome without you.

166
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,620
Los bandoleros for life.

167
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,810
Lo bandolero for life.

168
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,150
You honor his name.

169
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,550
Hold us in your heart...

170
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,340
...and you will never
lose your way.

171
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,100
You will be better than me.

172
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,150
What are you looking at?

173
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,400
You.

174
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,980
- Kid's asleep.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,200
How do you get more beautiful?

176
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,190
- Is it here yet?

177
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,140
No.

178
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,610
- It'll come when the time
is right. -Mm.

179
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,190
You know, when we were
in the car today...

180
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,810
...B said, "Daddy,

181
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,170
you're never afraid."

182
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,000
But I am.

183
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,970
I'm afraid of losing a son.

184
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,530
Or a wife.

185
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
That's not gonna happen again.

186
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,510
You can keep your eyes
on that rearview all you want.

187
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,160
But you know what you miss?

188
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,610
What?

189
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,990
Eternity

190
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,890
in this moment.

191
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm as surprised as you are.

192
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,450
I've imagined killing you
a thousand times.

193
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,730
Last time, there was six inches
of reinforced glass,

194
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,760
- guns...
- : No!

195
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,870
...guards.

196
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,770
I couldn't reach you then.

197
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,490
Now I can.

198
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,770
You're gonna want to hear
my last words.

199
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,680
- Dom! -
- : No!

200
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,990
Did you hear Elena's last words

201
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,790
before you killed her?

202
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,480
Then don't you think I'd have a
goddamn good reason to be here?

203
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,080
Maybe the only reason
that's ever mattered to you.

204
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,190
Little B.

205
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,760
Wake up, sweetie.

206
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,700
We have an unwanted guest.

207
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,230
You know what to do.

208
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,750
What is it that you want?

209
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,180
Speak.

210
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,700
I met the devil tonight.

211
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,110
Honestly, I always thought
it was me.

212
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,450
So that was
kind of disappointing.

213
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,440
He came to my door.

214
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,450
He let himself in.

215
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,330
They say
when you're facing death,

216
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,030
your life flashes
before your eyes.

217
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,080
Are they right?

218
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,000
I'd start with who you are.

219
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,210
A question most can't answer
in a lifetime.

220
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,660
You have three seconds.

221
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,220
Before you bleed out
on my couch,

222
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,630
you might want to explain
why you're here.

223
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm here

224
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,810
because the enemy

225
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,640
of my enemy

226
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,710
is you.

227
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,750
I am a man with

228
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,820
no name.

229
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,610
Heir to nothing.

230
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,580
And I'm here for
the same reasons you are.

231
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,510
Dominic Toretto.

232
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,890
You want to kill Dom?

233
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,790
Line's around the block.

234
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,590
No, no, no.

235
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,080
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

236
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,730
But I need your help.

237
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,460
Your toys and your tech.

238
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,050
All your boys.

239
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,360
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

240
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,160
I don't play well with others.

241
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,090
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

242
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,640
You're looking at
who I love most.

243
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,850
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

244
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,100
I wasn't talking to you.

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,840
I was talking to Zeke.

246
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,840
Amir.

247
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,550
Kevin's dad.

248
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,400
Who could it be?

249
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,510
Cute kids.

250
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,760
Ooh.

251
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,580
They all had something to take

252
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,960
except that poor bastard.

253
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,030
Not even a kitty cat.

254
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,590
The rest of you have a choice.

255
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,430
Me or...

256
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,300
You want to control the world.

257
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,930
I just want to punish it.

258
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,820
I will remember this.

259
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,040
I think everyone will.

260
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,000
Huh. I need someone to help me
operate this, don't I?

261
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Nerds?

262
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,110
Come with me.

263
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,450
All right, you know what to do

264
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,350
if you want to see
your families again.

265
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,750
Ciao.

266
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,330
Kill her.

267
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,030
Shit.

268
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,940
Did you think I would trust you?

269
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,320
It is hard finding good help
these days.

270
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,890
There's a war coming.

271
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,720
The sides are being chosen.

272
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,030
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

273
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,910
Lost six pints of blood.

274
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,460
Normal person dies at four.

275
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,050
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

276
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,670
- She may not make it.
- But did her story check out?

277
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,330
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

278
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,880
but her tech wasn't there.

279
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,470
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

280
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,540
- You've alerted your people?
- Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

281
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,610
I tried to get in touch
with Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han.

282
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,940
- No answer.
- Any idea where they might be?

283
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,970
In Rome.

284
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,730
Working for you.

285
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,710
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

286
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,350
It's a setup.

287
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,390
Shit.

288
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,600
We're going to Rome.

289
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,580
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,450
Son, you and I will finish
that driving lesson.

291
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,560
It's a promise.

292
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,690
No matter what happens.

293
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,140
And I always keep my promises.

294
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,050
Head back up.

295
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,420
" by ANNA,
MadMan and Gemitaiz playing]

296
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,880
So can somebody
please help me understand

297
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,190
how we're pulling off
a mobile heist

298
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,990
but I don't even get to drive?

299
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,990
Well, the sooner we break into
the truck and steal the chip,

300
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,470
the sooner you get to live
la dolce vita,okay?

301
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,100
Roman, the convoy's
almost in position.

302
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,510
Where the hell are you at?

303
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,890
You're supposed to be
running interference.

304
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,450
Romey-Rome's in the building.

305
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,000
- You see me shining, baby.

306
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,590
We on my mission now.

307
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,830
Yeah, we all know
that this is your mission.

308
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,980
'Cause nobody else on Earth
would put Han in an Alfa.

309
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,740
You know, we'd already
be there if Roman wasn't

310
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,320
driving Fort Knox on wheels.

311
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,050
You know
what's under this hood, baby.

312
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,120
This car is sick.

313
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,470
What this old girl lacks
in horsepower,

314
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,990
she makes up for in agility.

315
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,410
Yeah, it's true.

316
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,410
While the Lamborghini has a V-10

317
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,170
with a Stage 3
UGR twin-turbo kit,

318
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,250
the Alfa will definitely have an
advantage in this environment.

319
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,280
What?

320
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,110
Oh, that's right.
I know stuff now.

321
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,110
- Will you marry me?

322
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,660
That's all it took?

323
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,810
All those agency toys,

324
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,600
and you still can't
reach Roman?

325
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,150
No cell phone,
emails or text messages.

326
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,710
Nothing's going through.

327
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,310
I even tried swiping right
on Han's dating app.

328
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,650
Whoever sent him
on this bogus mission

329
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,320
made for damn sure
we couldn't warn them.

330
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,200
Keep searching. They're close.

331
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,830
All right, everybody, showtime.

332
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,900
- Here we go!

333
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,530
In position.

334
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,010
Cue Tiny Tej.

335
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,150
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Tiny Tej?

336
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,600
- What are you talking about,
Roman? -

337
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,400
All right, all right,
fire 'em up!

338
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,880
We never agreed on that.

339
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,430
You said you wanted to drive.
Now you driving.

340
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,160
- What are you laughing at?
Don't... -

341
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,250
Where'd you even get that?

342
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,130
Just so you know,
Tiny Tej's brain?

343
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,270
Still bigger than yours.

344
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,670
Back is blind.

345
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,530
Watch out, ladies.
This ain't "nun" ya business!

346
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,680
It's time to shine!

347
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,350
We're in. I have the wheel.

348
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,980
We're locked inside!

349
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,510
The truck's being
steered remotely.

350
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,040
And a one, and a two, and a...

351
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,660
Holy shit! What happened?!

352
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,330
Put a little too much in, huh?
Ready?

353
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,120
That was awesome!

354
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,260
Ooh.

355
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,860
Scusi!

356
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,580
They're stealing our truck.

357
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,730
And with us inside.

358
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,930
Just got reports of
two explosions near the Forum.

359
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,590
That's them.

360
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,900
Ready? And...

361
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,420
- Wait, you hear that?

362
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,890
- What the hell is that?!
- I have no idea!

363
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,880
Oh, shit.

364
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,260
That's a big-ass bomb!

365
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,020
- What?
- Bomb!

366
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,120
Roman, you said
this was carrying chips

367
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,370
for a supercomputer.

368
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,830
That is not a chip.
It's a bomb!

369
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,230
What happens if it goes off?

370
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,480
What do you mean,
"What happens if it goes off?"

371
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,310
The Seven Hills of Rome
will be down to two and a half!

372
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,550
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

373
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,280
You know, the thing bombs do.

374
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,140
We're coming to you.

375
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,910
All right, dorks.
What are we blowing up?

376
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,040
What?

377
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,420
The Vatican?

378
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,150
Wow.

379
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,570
Okay. I'll do it.

380
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,550
But you guys are going to hell.

381
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,760
That's their truck.

382
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,300
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

383
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,540
Ooh. Look who's here.

384
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,680
You're right on time, Dominic.

385
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Turn off the encrypted radio.

386
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,720
Ramsey?

387
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,210
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

388
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,110
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

389
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,730
Ah! Found it.

390
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,940
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

391
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,980
I just need physical hands
on the device.

392
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,880
- We have to stop that truck.
- Sorry, Captain America.

393
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,580
Can't let you do that.

394
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,860
We got to hurry!
The truck is speeding up.

395
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,540
- We got to block its path.
- I'm gonna get ahead of it.

396
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,070
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

397
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,390
Whoop.

398
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,430
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

399
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,270
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

400
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,030
Dominic.

401
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,240
Come on!

402
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,350
Damn it, he's fast.

403
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,340
Really? The clothesline?

404
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,790
Well, we can't drive it,

405
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,530
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

406
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,710
Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

407
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,350
- We have to crash into it.
- We have to what?!

408
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

409
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,230
It's not stopping!

410
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,030
Dom, the bomb is out.

411
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,160
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

412
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,100
No. We got this.

413
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,980
Letty!

414
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,150
Have we made them all
terrorists?

415
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,740
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

416
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,090
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

417
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,810
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

418
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,470
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

419
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,590
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

420
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,230
Buongiorno, Roma!

421
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,720
All right.

422
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,690
Man, who the hell is that?

423
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,140
:
Hey! There he is!

424
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,490
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

425
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,230
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one.

426
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,580
Oh, Letty!

427
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,880
I think I found our guy.

428
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,850
Hey, Letty. Vaffanculo!

429
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,560
I'm on him.

430
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,540
That pump's gonna blow.

431
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,680
Little Nobody, you're up.

432
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,450
- Moving to dis...
- Peekaboo!

433
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,750
- Get out of there!
It's gonna blow! -Oh, shit.

434
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,580
- Boom.

435
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,220
We need to jam
the detonator now.

436
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,540
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

437
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,500
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

438
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,260
cellular interference
through your phone.

439
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,900
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

440
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,970
Letty.

441
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,860
Bravo!

442
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,210
It's getting tricky, guys.

443
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,070
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

444
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,970
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

445
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,080
The Tiber? Uh...

446
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,530
Uh, 60 feet.

447
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,120
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

448
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,320
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

449
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,560
Damn it!

450
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,520
You missed me
by that much, baby!

451
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,350
I lost him. He's gone.

452
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,870
Damn!

453
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,010
He's out of our reach.

454
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,490
We can't jam the signal anymore.

455
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,510
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

456
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,700
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

457
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,630
Dom, he armed the bomb,
and you're almost at the river.

458
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,070
15 seconds, Dom.

459
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,280
Dom, listen to me.

460
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,800
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

461
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,210
Get out of there.

462
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,870
You've done
everything you could.

463
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,680
Not everything.

464
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,510
Five.

465
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,930
Four.

466
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,690
Three.

467
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,830
Two.

468
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,940
One.

469
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,530
What have we done?

470
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,850
Through your suffering,
I'll fulfill my destiny.

471
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,570
Come find me.

472
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,530
Your pain has just begun.

473
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,230
I'll see you soon, Dom.

474
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,810
Breaking news from Italy.

475
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,990
The capital Rome has been hit
by a massive explosion.

476
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,820
...to be
a large military weapon.

477
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,520
The Vatican has sustained

478
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,620
some structural damage.

479
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,380
...but no lives were claimed.

480
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,380
Authorities have identified
the terrorists as

481
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,490
- these five individuals.

482
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,150
...as these five individuals,
led by this man.

483
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,870
- Dominic Toretto.
- Toretto. -Toretto.

484
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,740
- Dominic Toretto.
Dominic Toretto.

485
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,360
Law enforcement is
working across borders,

486
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,540
mobilizing
an international fugitive hunt

487
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,920
- of unprecedented scale.
I'm sorry, sir.

488
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,020
- I don't know how she got in.
- I do.

489
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,440
I stole your badge.

490
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm done with it now, though.
Thanks.

491
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,790
Well, if it isn't, um--

492
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,410
Honestly, I-I don't know
what to call you.

493
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,240
Little Miss Nobody?

494
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,790
How about you call me
by my actual name?

495
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,110
Last I heard, Tess, you were
running ops in Damascus.

496
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,420
You think you can
walk in this room

497
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,900
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

498
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,590
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

499
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,210
on behalf of the defense.

500
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,630
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

501
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,320
Casualties were kept
to a minimum,

502
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,670
but the impact was global.

503
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,260
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

504
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,610
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

505
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,640
- stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
- Oh, come on, Aimes.

506
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,230
- That's bullshit
and you know it. -Careful, now.

507
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,890
With Little Nobody
out of commission

508
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,410
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

509
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,450
Showtime.

510
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Los Angeles, 2001.

511
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,970
Humble roots, local kids,

512
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,660
street racers
who became hijackers.

513
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,250
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

514
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,840
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

515
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,740
If it could be done in a car,
they did it.

516
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,460
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

517
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,050
You write that yourself?

518
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,980
We first took notice in 2011,

519
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,470
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

520
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,440
left his body on a bridge.

521
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,030
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

522
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,410
so he recruited them--
freelance, of course.

523
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,550
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

524
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,350
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

525
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,280
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

526
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,940
but they had their champions.

527
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,390
That's their M.O.

528
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,280
To corrupt law enforcement.

529
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,600
Brian O'Conner.

530
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,500
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

531
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,390
Everyone becomes family.

532
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,330
It's like a cult with cars.

533
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,930
Even Tess's dear old dad.

534
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,920
So we're all just

535
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,510
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

536
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,780
What's your point?

537
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,340
Point is they're criminals.

538
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,100
Rome was a matter of time.

539
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,790
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

540
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,100
and at least one nuclear sub.

541
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,830
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

542
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,380
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

543
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,220
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

544
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,110
Something is not right
with Rome.

545
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,250
It can't be.

546
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,600
It can and it is.

547
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,430
The agency is better than this.

548
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,880
We are smarter than this.

549
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,570
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

550
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,090
That is the very least
that we can do.

551
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,890
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

552
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,870
The fallout will be existential.

553
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,860
I'm asking for
full green-light authority.

554
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,480
Kill or capture
the Toretto clan by any means.

555
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
Aimes, what are you doing?

556
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,220
Looks like the ayes have it.

557
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,010
As your direct superior,

558
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,630
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

559
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,570
and I hate barbecues.

560
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,120
You know I'd make a
freight train take a dirt road,

561
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,350
so do not get in my way.

562
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,870
Okay.

563
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,480
I'll go my own way.

564
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,100
When Rome falls,
so does the world.

565
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,380
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

566
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,210
And you're no Gregory Peck.

567
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,140
Mm.

568
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,660
My family?

569
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,420
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

570
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,020
They've taken Letty.

571
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,500
- Who's they?
- The agency.

572
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,290
And you've just shot
to number one

573
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,950
on the world's most wanted list.

574
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,430
Whoever did this wanted
to sever your ties to the agency

575
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,330
and isolate you
from your family.

576
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,650
Any attempt to contact your team
will be traced.

577
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,170
I need you to get a message
to Mr. Nobody.

578
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,820
You'll need a medium for that
or a magician.

579
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,860
He's done his disappearing act.

580
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,480
Just get the message out.

581
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,690
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

582
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,970
and he'll know where to go.

583
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,660
I've got a message for you,
ducky.

584
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,970
The world is on fire,
and you want to keep running

585
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,360
into the burning building
to save lives,

586
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,640
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

587
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,410
I don't care about dying.

588
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,730
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

589
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,440
You know why gladiators
never had families?

590
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,540
- Why?
- Because they knew

591
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,170
that every day
might be their last.

592
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,380
You're choosing a lonely way,
my darling.

593
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,150
Can't take anyone with you.

594
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,650
Bring God's Eye online.

595
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,720
Yes, sir.
Initiating.

596
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,580
Get me Toretto
and the others' locations

597
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,030
to the millimeter.

598
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,720
Sir, we have a problem.

599
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,590
The God's Eye tracking hardware
has been removed.

600
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,280
Tess.

601
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,730
I guess her visit
wasn't purely a social call.

602
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,070
Do me a favor.

603
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:27,520
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

604
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,490
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

605
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,190
Toretto has a sister, a son.

606
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,500
Until we find him,

607
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,270
find his family.

608
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,320
:
Oh!

609
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,110
- Again.

610
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,250
Wow.

611
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,910
Are you cheating
on-on your favorite auntie?

612
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,710
It doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

613
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,840
Winning's winning.

614
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,810
Where have I heard
that one before?

615
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,510
Go! Go!

616
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,350
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

617
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,170
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

618
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,350
No! Mia! Let her go!

619
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,980
Run!

620
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,630
- What's up?
- Uncle Jakob?

621
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,700
Your dad sent me.

622
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,610
Change of plans.

623
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,750
Don't move!

624
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,980
- I said don't move!

625
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,020
Do you have Little B?

626
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,180
B!

627
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,110
- Freeze!

628
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,550
- You okay?
- Yeah.

629
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,660
Are you okay?

630
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,450
B!

631
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,190
Come, come.

632
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,040
Who the hell were those guys?

633
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,150
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

634
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,770
Okay, I got to get to Brian
and the kids...

635
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,040
Dom sent me to take him.

636
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,010
Remember that place
we said we'd go

637
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,250
if the world went to hell?

638
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,260
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

639
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah.

640
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,910
Okay, look.

641
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,330
Little B, you're gonna go
with Uncle Jakob.

642
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,640
Okay? You do whatever he says.
Yeah?

643
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,590
I'm gonna get you to your dad.
If that's okay with you.

644
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,700
Protect him with your life.

645
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,860
I love you, Jakey.

646
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,240
I love you, too, sis.

647
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,080
Let's do it.

648
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh, my God.

649
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,880
Yo!

650
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,710
It's not that one.

651
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:41,690
It's this one.

652
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,480
Yep.

653
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,610
Wait, but...

654
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,410
Hmm?

655
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,450
I'm looking for someone.

656
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,720
You boys look like
you could use a drink.

657
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,930
How about a round on me? Huh?

658
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,410
As a matter of fact,

659
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:33,190
I will buy as many rounds
as they can handle.

660
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,740
Shots? No?

661
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,690
Shots?

662
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,630
Beers. Two of 'em.

663
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,390
Thanks.

664
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,810
Cheers.

665
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,520
Queenie told me
I could find you here.

666
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,870
Belgian?

667
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,080
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

668
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,150
He did?

669
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,050
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

670
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,840
I came in from the cold.

671
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,710
Your dad kept the agency
in line.

672
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,160
Now it feels like
all the anchors have been cut.

673
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,540
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

674
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,480
You're right.

675
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,760
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

676
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,290
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming
for you with everything.

677
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,210
I'm buying you some time.

678
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:48,390
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

679
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,940
Look familiar?

680
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,320
God's Eye.
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,010
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

682
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,570
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

683
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,160
I pulled a screen grab

684
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,990
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

685
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,680
put it in God's Eye.

686
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,340
There was a hit in Rio.

687
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,130
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

688
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,480
- Reyes.
- Hernan Reyes?

689
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,460
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

690
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,210
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

691
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:21,640
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

692
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,920
Letty.

693
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,950
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

694
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,160
Then get her out.

695
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,810
Nobody can.

696
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,680
Nobody would.

697
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,160
Dom, I'm so sorry,

698
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,630
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

699
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,530
Nothing's impossible.

700
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:54,880
You just have to have faith.

701
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,190
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

702
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,470
full of aftershave,
that was a terrible idea, Roman.

703
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,470
Wait, I think
I lost my sense of smell.

704
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,480
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

705
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,240
Hey, man, I don't know
what y'all are talking about.

706
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,210
You know what I mean?

707
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,760
I smell magic.

708
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,140
I took a bottle for myself.

709
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,830
This is all thanks to you.

710
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,380
You know that, right?

711
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,870
No, see, you just got to follow
my "leat" as a "leater."

712
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:33,700
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

713
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,460
Where are we?

714
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,430
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

715
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,120
The city with the most
amount of surveillance cameras.

716
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,580
Perfect.

717
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,340
- Dad know you drive this thing?
- He should.

718
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,620
I raced him in it.

719
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,410
And just so you know,
in the '90s,

720
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,250
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

721
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,940
Like it or not,
it's still a 'Stang.

722
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,750
So, you know, respect.

723
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,990
You know what?

724
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,990
Traveling music.

725
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,880
I got this car when I was 13.

726
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,440
Did the repaint myself.
Rebuilt the motor, too.

727
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,170
Ah. Sometimes you just
can't help what you love, kid.

728
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,410
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

729
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,450
A place of mine your dad knows.

730
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,900
We're gonna meet him there.

731
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,400
So he's okay?

732
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,830
We'll meet him there.

733
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,020
This guy was an underwear model.

734
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,300
- What?
- : Yeah. Oh, yeah.

735
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,810
Here we go and...

736
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,370
Little B, bring it back.
It's a boomerang.

737
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,990
It's a boomerang, maybe.

738
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,300
Ah...

739
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,890
:
Oh! Look at you!

740
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,200
That's feeling it.

741
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,860
That's called
feeling the vibrations.

742
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,170
It's just energy, man.
It's energy. It's vibrations.

743
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,660
Feel it! Feel it!

744
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,320
You're clear, Director.

745
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,260
Fancy coat.

746
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,370
Expensive earrings.

747
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,590
Those got to hurt.

748
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,960
You really brought out
the big guns, huh?

749
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,730
I'm not here for the agency.

750
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,210
You could've confiscated that.

751
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,280
That scar on your left wrist,

752
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,380
you got it
the night you met Dom.

753
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,180
He said he was showing off.

754
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,320
I put an ultrasonic jammer
on the audio,

755
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,510
but the cameras
can still see us.

756
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,120
Look, I'm gonna
get you out of here,

757
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,290
but it's gonna take some time.

758
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:57,980
Time is what I don't have.

759
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,360
I need to get back to Dom.

760
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,470
I'm no good to anyone
in this cage.

761
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,200
I have a feeling you didn't come
all this way without a plan.

762
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,920
Game recognizes game.

763
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,480
If I make this move,
there's no coming back.

764
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,890
I like it already.

765
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,000
Okay. First, let's get you
out of this cell.

766
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,310
- It's gonna hurt.
- Hmm?

767
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,280
- Work with me.

768
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,490
Open the door!

769
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,490
- Knock it down!

770
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,560
Guards! Guards!

771
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,980
- Help!
- Let her go!

772
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,390
- Let her go!

773
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,160
Really?

774
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,540
Que surpresa!

775
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,570
Look at this.

776
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,430
None of this happens
without you.

777
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,360
Welcome home.
Good to see you, bro.

778
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,470
Diogo, good to see you.

779
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,370
Ah. Look at you.

780
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,710
So, uh, I hear you got
a little heat on you.

781
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,960
Nah, I'm just looking
for someone.

782
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,590
How can we help?

783
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,450
You already did.

784
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,780
I need you to meet somebody.
A GOAT.

785
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,140
A living legend, literally.

786
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,470
You must be in
the winner's circle tonight.

787
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,650
I see you put in a RB26
in that, right?

788
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:29,510
L24 would never handle
this much boost.

789
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,960
My boy back home would approve.

790
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,080
I'm not looking for
anyone's approval.

791
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,380
Before you get ahead
of yourself, look around you.

792
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,280
We're all looking for
a little validation.

793
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,730
- You racing or what?

794
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,040
Trust me,
you don't want that smoke.

795
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,330
I'm not here
for pink slips tonight.

796
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,810
- You and everyone here.

797
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,410
Yeah!

798
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,420
A million dollars
for whoever can beat me.

799
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,040
Diogo, here.

800
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,210
Yes.

801
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,920
Isabel.

802
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,180
There will be
a race tonight, yes?

803
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,570
Yeah, maybe.

804
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,840
- Pretty please, with me on top.

805
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,500
Dominic Toretto.

806
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,780
I knew you would come for me.

807
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,020
I'm sorry we didn't
get to meet in Roma.

808
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,230
We were both so busy.

809
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,420
I'm Dante. Enchanté.

810
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:43,410
And you were
fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.

811
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,350
He saved the Vatican.

812
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:46,560
Who does that?

813
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,830
Seriously. The Pope? God?

814
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,700
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

815
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,600
The ball through the city was

816
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,290
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

817
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,370
Except it was on fire.

818
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,500
You remember my father?

819
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,090
- Hernan Reyes.
- Yes.

820
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,440
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

821
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,990
But you know what happened?

822
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,100
I took him down.

823
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,620
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

824
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,350
You are absolutely right.

825
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,000
My father was a horrible man,

826
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,490
very bad daddy,

827
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,280
but I kind of liked him.

828
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,010
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

829
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,570
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

830
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,570
Well, that's what
I came here for.

831
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,230
To end that suffering.

832
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,400
Oh, and I didn't take
that money.

833
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,040
I burned it.

834
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,550
:
Uh-oh.

835
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,510
:
Well, Brazil is mine,

836
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,100
and I own this city.

837
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,330
Ooh.

838
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,880
You people think
you can buy everything.

839
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,700
But you can't buy the streets.

840
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,760
We stand with Dom.

841
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,230
Well, this is awkward.

842
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,510
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

843
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:21,510
and see what happens?

844
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:24,480
Or we race.

845
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,410
If you win, you take me in.

846
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,950
If you lose...

847
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,700
Don't lose.

848
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:35,230
You all came 'cause
you wanted to see a race.

849
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,220
Let's race!

850
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,570
Ouch.

851
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,400
Ooh.

852
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,740
Black on black look good.

853
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,230
I know what you're thinking,

854
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,370
and, yes, the carpet
matches the drapes.

855
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,590
Thank you.

856
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,200
I can't believe I'm gonna race
the great Dominic Toretto.

857
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,030
I have butterflies.

858
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,760
You're just so impressive.

859
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,690
You've won so many races.

860
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,220
Everyone loves you.

861
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,770
You've saved so many lives.

862
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,600
I know.

863
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,980
It's like you're a...

864
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,080
a saint.

865
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,410
Saint Dominic.

866
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:55,000
And I've been studying you.

867
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,410
And watching you.

868
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,990
I can't figure it out.

869
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,250
How...

870
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,080
How do you choose?

871
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,240
How do you choose
the ones you save?

872
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,460
" by Daddy
Yankee & Myke Towers playing]

873
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,110
Cheguei.

874
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,850
Yahoo!

875
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,410
Yeah!

876
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,570
I'm beating you, baby!

877
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,740
Oh.

878
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,190
You're too eager.

879
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,000
That's what I'm talking about!

880
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,430
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You shouldn't do that.

881
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,540
Dominic, who will you choose?

882
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,440
Who you gonna choose, Dom?

883
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,720
Are you gonna save her?

884
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,020
- Or are you gonna save him?
- Let's go, baby!

885
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,660
This race is mine!

886
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,730
Eeny, meeny, miny...

887
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,550
Looks like you made your choice.

888
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,740
Finally! Whoo!

889
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:36,400
Oh, no, Diogo!

890
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,880
Trick question. Everyone dies.

891
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,810
And one, two, three.

892
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,490
- Boom!

893
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,390
Yeah!

894
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,260
Yeah!

895
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,070
I win, baby!

896
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,660
Keep coming, Dom!

897
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,800
There's so much more fun
to be had!

898
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,160
Come on.

899
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,960
Good morning, sunshine.

900
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,620
Goddamn it.

901
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,280
And then he was like, "Boom!"

902
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,250
And I was like, "Blam!"
And she was like, "What?"

903
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,080
I was like, "Shut up."

904
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,320
And now I'm the best racer
in the world, so...

905
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,530
Do not touch that. Let it dry.

906
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,090
You guys look fantastic.

907
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:32,610
I know the black is
very slimming and very scary,

908
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,470
but the pastels, you know,
they're in season,

909
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,440
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

910
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,580
which we all need these days.

911
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,000
Did you know...

912
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,580
Listen to me.

913
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,070
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

914
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,420
Two minutes.

915
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,690
- Bob, pay attention.

916
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,760
And you know what I saw?

917
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,010
Nothing.

918
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,320
Not a goddamn thing.

919
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,570
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

920
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,480
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

921
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,360
Yeah, that's deep, right?

922
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,710
- You're absolutely right, Bob.

923
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,820
We should get back to work.

924
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,100
Such a stickler.

925
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,480
All right.  Let's see.

926
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,960
Should we take all their money?

927
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,350
:
You. You are evil.

928
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,180
- Thank you for listening.

929
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,970
So, mi casa, su casa.

930
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,140
Let these dry,
finish those mojitos,

931
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,630
and, um, someone's gonna come
and bury you guys soon.

932
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,630
I'm gonna go wash my hair.

933
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,630
No.

934
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:01,700
- What?

935
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,680
All right.

936
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:09,840
Whoa.

937
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,050
Cool. What is that?

938
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,400
That's a technical tool kit.

939
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,190
Don't worry, it's just
a bunch of awesome stuff

940
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:17,090
that you're never
gonna get to use.

941
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:19,650
- Okay.

942
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,820
Eyes open. Hold still.

943
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,200
Don't smile like that.

944
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,030
- It's unsettling.

945
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,310
Sweet.
Your new name is Chester...

946
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:30,030
- Chester? -...and you're
on a kayaking trip with

947
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,070
- your handsome,

948
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,000
ripped Uncle Roger.

949
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,940
All right.

950
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,180
Now, time to get you
some new clothes.

951
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,910
You know, something
a little more chic than

952
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,150
pj pants, all right?

953
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:43,980
- From a gas station?
- From a gas station.

954
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,260
See, I just don't understand.

955
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,160
Why would the agency
turn they backs on us,

956
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,130
after all we've done for them?

957
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,580
That madman pinned it all on us,

958
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,270
and now we're
public enemy number one.

959
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:01,860
Well, Dom is gonna meet us
at the rendezvous point.

960
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,650
But in the meantime,
we have to stay under the radar.

961
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,240
And we got to get ready
to fight.

962
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,450
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

963
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:11,180
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

964
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,660
What?

965
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,040
- We've been hacked.

966
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,630
Look. Every account.

967
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:20,020
Every dollar we made
over the last 20 years is gone.

968
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,260
He took everything.

969
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,780
We got heisted
during our own heist.

970
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,470
- Just decrypt the... Yeah.
- Decrypt the blockchain.

971
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:26,440
I'm on it. Then we can find
the transaction hash.

972
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,680
The transaction hash.

973
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,680
Gets us the receiving IPs.
Exactly.

974
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,780
English.

975
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,060
Following our money, genius.

976
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,270
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

977
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:33,550
The coding is next-level.

978
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,820
I've never seen
anything like this.

979
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,210
We need more computing power.

980
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:39,930
How are we gonna do that
if we broke?

981
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,570
What do you mean, "we" broke?

982
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,250
Wait, you holding out on us?

983
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,770
No wonder you've been so calm.

984
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,880
Bro, what-what d--
what do you think this is, bro?

985
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,980
You know what? Turn around.

986
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,090
"Turn around"? What do you...

987
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,400
What you mean, "turn around"?

988
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,590
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

989
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,550
- What-- N-- What are you doing?
Hey, Roman, do not.

990
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,060
Please tell me
you're not wearing Spanx.

991
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,270
Oh, this ain't Spanx.
These banks.

992
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:11,270
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

993
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:12,590
All right?

994
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:15,360
You know what I mean?

995
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,900
Yeah. That's for you.

996
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,870
That's for you.

997
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,110
Let me see.

998
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,530
Han, you always good
for the bag,

999
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,670
'cause the bag
always come back, you know.

1000
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:32,610
So what I need from
all of y'all, I need receipts.

1001
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,620
Who is you talking to?
Got your receipt.

1002
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,760
So where do we go
to shop off the grid?

1003
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,390
I know a place.

1004
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,500
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

1005
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,120
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

1006
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,530
The first rule of tradecraft:

1007
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,470
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

1008
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,850
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1009
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,330
I'll just-- Wait.
You know what, I'm just...

1010
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,440
We'll just--
If you want to, uh, go.

1011
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,920
Uh, we'll stay here.

1012
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,300
- You guys, you guys go around.
- Go around? Great.

1013
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,140
Go around.

1014
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,830
Sir, we just got a hit
on the boy and his uncle.

1015
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,480
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

1016
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,660
We're interfacing
with local authorities.

1017
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,250
Forget authorities.

1018
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,520
These people have been
outrunning the cops

1019
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,800
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

1020
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,660
Get word to
every snitch, smuggler,

1021
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,040
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

1022
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,630
Money talks and so will they.

1023
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,220
- We're getting an alert

1024
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,220
on Black Site A.

1025
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,530
Tess just visited Ortiz.

1026
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:41,200
They have a nice chat?

1027
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,880
Guess not.

1028
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,660
Run it back for me.

1029
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,770
Stop. Zoom in.

1030
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,240
Back-trace her flight path.

1031
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,900
Find out where she was
before this.

1032
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,770
That's where Dom is.

1033
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,400
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

1034
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,230
From the moment I saw you.

1035
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:22,070
Your sister smiled with her eyes
and led with her heart.

1036
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,030
Just like you do.

1037
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,960
We were nothing alike.

1038
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,480
She was the good sister.

1039
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,490
Always putting others first.

1040
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,950
Always doing what was right.

1041
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,920
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

1042
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,270
Why the good one and not me?

1043
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:59,230
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

1044
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,180
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

1045
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,000
A cop and a street racer.

1046
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,870
I'll tell you something.

1047
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,090
They travel down the same road
long enough...

1048
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:17,540
...and they realize
how much alike they really are.

1049
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,580
Trust me...

1050
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,170
...I know.

1051
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:36,180
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1052
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,220
She's still helping people.

1053
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,230
She's helping us.

1054
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,740
You know, Elena,

1055
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,190
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1056
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,840
After they killed her husband,

1057
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,640
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1058
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,170
I think I still have her files.

1059
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:06,030
Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear

1060
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,510
in the middle of London?

1061
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:09,130
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1062
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:16,000
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

1063
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,380
Would you look for
a black-market operation

1064
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:20,090
in a place like this?

1065
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,040
You've got mail.

1066
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,230
- Ooh, snacks.
- Get me a receipt, homey.

1067
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,430
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1068
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,810
How about you figure it out?

1069
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,500
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1070
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,920
:
I swear to God...

1071
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,020
What's up, Bowie420?

1072
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,660
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1073
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,370
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1074
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,270
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

1075
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,900
online black markets.

1076
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,900
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1077
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,490
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

1078
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,900
Well, desperate times.

1079
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,450
What kind of muffins are these?

1080
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:56,590
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1081
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,110
You have like four of them,

1082
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,770
you'll be in your underwear
watching Fantasia.

1083
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:01,010
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

1084
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:02,670
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1085
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,190
We, uh, we need transport.

1086
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,360
Weapons, cars, the works.

1087
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,780
And quietly.

1088
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,510
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1089
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:12,850
None of that crypto stuff.

1090
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,960
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

1091
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,650
- Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

1092
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,790
- Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

1093
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,790
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

1094
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:23,240
you know what I'm saying?

1095
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,280
How much we talking about, bruh?

1096
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,910
Just like a reasonable amount.

1097
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,400
How about that?

1098
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,350
That won't even cover
the muffins.

1099
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,600
Is this guy serious?

1100
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,600
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1101
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,860
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1102
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,120
Well, how about that?

1103
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,710
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

1104
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:44,610
Man, give me this.

1105
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,260
- Thank you.
- Are you serious right now?

1106
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,650
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1107
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,470
You should pay for everything.

1108
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:53,720
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1109
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,140
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1110
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,340
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1111
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,590
No, I'm tired of this.

1112
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,000
'Cause all he do is talk.

1113
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,380
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

1114
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,730
What are you saying, Tej?

1115
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,280
- Mean, what I'm saying?
Hey, guys.

1116
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,490
- This is a family environment.
- What? Really?

1117
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,390
- Really?
Take it outside, fellas.

1118
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:13,080
So, what we doing, bruh?

1119
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,330
Uh-oh.

1120
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:17,100
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1121
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,330
- Oh, not the vending machine.
Unbelievable.

1122
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,440
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1123
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,270
Let's go. Come on.

1124
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,390
Should we stop this?

1125
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,840
Hold on!
- Nah, let 'em bond.

1126
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,040
Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

1127
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:37,880
:
Huh?

1128
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,820
What the hell, man?

1129
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,370
Okay. All right.

1130
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,680
We doing stomachs now.

1131
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,230
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1132
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,890
- You've been wanting that
for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think

1133
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,150
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

1134
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,830
What the hell was that?

1135
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,970
He's like a ghetto magician.

1136
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:10,000
You know what it is, bruh.

1137
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,250
- I beat your ass.
- You just beat my ass?

1138
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,520
- Beat my ass, huh?
- My God,

1139
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,800
will you two just quit it?
Please.

1140
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,770
We don't have time for this.
You.

1141
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:18,360
- Get to work.
- Oh, I just need

1142
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,390
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1143
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,600
Oops.

1144
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,430
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1145
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:25,740
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

1146
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,500
like, all over the dark web.

1147
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,160
I mean, that reward is dope.

1148
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,990
- Ow. Hey.
- We have to move.

1149
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:33,580
- The agency's minutes away.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

1150
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,820
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
- What? Huh?

1151
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,890
- Oh!
Oh!

1152
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,100
I deserved that.

1153
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,720
- Are you okay, bro?
- Yeah, thank you, man.

1154
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,730
All right, so where to now, huh?

1155
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:50,010
- Jail?

1156
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:53,440
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

1157
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,700
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1158
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:24,560
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1159
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,330
It's a sick place, Letty.

1160
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,080
You're welcome.

1161
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,430
What did you do?

1162
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:36,540
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1163
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:40,020
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1164
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:43,040
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1165
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,340
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

1166
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:53,870
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1167
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,850
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1168
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,990
:
Shit.

1169
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,630
Seems like you got this covered.

1170
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,430
- What do you need me for?
- I have a plan,

1171
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,100
but it's a two-person job.

1172
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,590
Now, was that so hard?

1173
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:22,510
How much time do we have?

1174
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,620
I'd say about four minutes.

1175
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,790
It'll have to do.

1176
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,220
I'd stay down if I was you.

1177
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:42,910
You got to hit me harder
for that.

1178
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:44,740
You're gonna regret this.

1179
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,020
Dante Reyes.

1180
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,940
Born in Portugal.

1181
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,910
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

1182
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,910
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

1183
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:28,050
He bounced from juvie to prison
to mental wards.

1184
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,440
And each time, Daddy was there
to spring him out.

1185
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:34,160
After his father died,
he disappeared.

1186
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:38,790
Properties Reyes owned
before he died.

1187
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:41,410
Now all sold and repo'd.

1188
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,150
Except this one.

1189
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:46,760
The police station.

1190
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,010
It's been abandoned for years.

1191
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,470
And guess whose name
is on the deed.

1192
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,540
Dante Reyes.

1193
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:57,030
I'll find my answer there.

1194
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,690
I'm coming with you.

1195
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,210
I need you to stay safe.

1196
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,220
I would have won that race,
you know.

1197
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,310
So you want a rematch?

1198
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,830
- I'm demanding it.

1199
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,640
So I guess I'll see you soon.

1200
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,730
Guys, you don't want to do this.

1201
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,940
He needs a new watch, cop.

1202
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,460
Look, the watch was a gift.

1203
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,010
But I got 16 carats of
uncut diamonds in my jockstrap

1204
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:04,740
if you want to take a look.

1205
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,710
Now you really do need
a new watch.

1206
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,700
Damn it.

1207
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,590
B, you okay?

1208
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,080
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1209
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,430
I don't like planes.

1210
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:44,410
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

1211
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,860
You know, I used to be
scared of cars.

1212
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,540
After my dad died,
I guess I blamed myself.

1213
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,580
It was tough.

1214
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,100
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

1215
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,620
Heck, I took the bus.

1216
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,520
Yeah. I think I was just
so worried about making mistakes

1217
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,730
and not being
as good as my brother.

1218
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:05,180
- You?
- Uh, excuse me.

1219
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,010
Have you met your dad?

1220
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,010
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1221
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:14,600
Huh. Feeling better?

1222
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,740
- Yeah.
- Good.

1223
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,650
Me, too.

1224
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:25,380
Here's the drink
that you ordered, sir.

1225
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,610
You know her?

1226
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,760
Yeah, it's good to have friends
in high places.

1227
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:34,480
On the count of three,

1228
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,100
we're gonna get up
and go to the bathroom. Ready?

1229
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,500
- Three.

1230
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,660
Who were those guys?

1231
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:18,470
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

1232
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,600
Holy shi...

1233
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,060
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1234
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,470
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1235
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,890
Okay?
We're-we're too high to glide,

1236
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:40,100
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

1237
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,460
combustion, which means...?

1238
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:47,170
Oxygen and fuel.

1239
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,240
Alcohol.

1240
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,660
- Um...
- Huh?

1241
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:50,980
Oh.

1242
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,570
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1243
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:01,480
Long story.
But good initiative.

1244
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,130
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1245
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,870
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1246
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,010
Bowie tagged us.

1247
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,290
The agency is on our tail.

1248
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:32,670
We need to find gear

1249
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:34,840
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

1250
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,200
It's right here.

1251
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:39,360
You guys hold back.
Let me take care of this.

1252
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,570
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

1253
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:44,270
- I mean like Roman-level bad.
- What?

1254
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:45,340
What are you talking about, man?

1255
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,790
You heard what I said.

1256
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:48,960
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

1257
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,620
You know I got your back.

1258
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:51,800
We got your back.

1259
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,430
- I got to do this alone.

1260
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:18,470
I have something
to talk to you about.

1261
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,030
The only reason a dead guy
shows up at my door:

1262
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,390
revenge.

1263
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,120
Oh, shi...

1264
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,810
- Oh, shit.
- Shit. Han!

1265
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,180
Should have stayed dead.

1266
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:40,090
I can get in. I can get in.

1267
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:42,460
I don't like repeating myself.

1268
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,880
You ruined my snacks.

1269
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:51,610
Relax.
I don't want to fight you.

1270
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:53,800
Then this is gonna end quick.

1271
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,340
You bring more men to kill me?

1272
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,390
They're trying to kill me, too.

1273
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,450
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

1274
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:40,190
- You still drive?
- What do you think?

1275
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,490
Okay, just give me a second.

1276
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,880
Freeze!

1277
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:11,930
- Drop the laptop!
- Okay.

1278
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:39,560
- Guys, I'm in.

1279
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,740
No, no, no, no!

1280
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,390
Now we're even.

1281
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,310
You okay?

1282
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,520
Now, see, I understand all this.

1283
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,050
What the hell was that?

1284
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,910
You got scared. I saw that.

1285
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:36,030
- Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
- No, you were... he was scared.

1286
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,690
We have an unwanted guest.

1287
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:53,860
My family?

1288
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,520
They're safe for now.

1289
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,620
You're not afraid of anything.

1290
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,210
I don't care about dying.

1291
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:01,320
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

1292
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,490
Hold us in your heart

1293
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,080
and you will never
lose your way.

1294
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:05,490
You're not afraid of anything.

1295
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:07,080
Fear can be a great teacher.

1296
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,630
You're not afraid of anything.

1297
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,790
How do you like my place?

1298
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:28,170
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

1299
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:30,550
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

1300
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,000
But at least you know
how hard I've been working

1301
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,350
to get us to this point.

1302
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:37,110
Now I know you're a dead man.

1303
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:38,420
You mean resurrected.

1304
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,080
Thanks to you.

1305
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:41,800
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

1306
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,670
I'd never be the man
that I am today.

1307
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,710
You built such a beautiful life,

1308
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,740
filled with love and family.

1309
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:51,500
I never got that chance.

1310
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,470
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1311
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:56,960
This is your legacy.

1312
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,300
I'm your legacy.

1313
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,060
You know what
I can't figure out?

1314
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,000
How someone born so rich

1315
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,590
chooses the poorest path
through life.

1316
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,420
You got no honor.

1317
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:13,190
Without honor,
you got no family.

1318
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,230
And without family...

1319
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:20,360
...you've got nothing.

1320
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,330
I have nothing because of you.

1321
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,780
My future. My family.

1322
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,470
You stole that from me.

1323
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,230
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1324
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:32,820
piece by piece.

1325
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,310
Stop talking and face me.

1326
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:36,760
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1327
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,670
:
I adore them.

1328
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,800
But the game's not over yet.

1329
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,190
There's still
so many people to hurt.

1330
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,770
I'm coming for you.

1331
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:52,120
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

1332
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,290
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1333
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:56,190
No, you hang up first.

1334
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,360
Okay.

1335
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:08,930
Toretto, freeze.

1336
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:11,720
Time to face the music, Dom.

1337
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,320
You're playing
right into his hands, cop.

1338
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,110
:
Okay. Come on.

1339
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,850
Oh.

1340
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,340
Yeah.

1341
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:13,720
Great.

1342
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:16,030
Just great.

1343
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,940
Shit.

1344
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:27,020
Little chilly?

1345
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,730
Your plan still sucks.

1346
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,540
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

1347
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:36,510
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1348
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:46,370
- Oh, wow.

1349
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:47,750
Take a look at this.

1350
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:49,580
This should cover us
in the gear department.

1351
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,270
You are not to be trusted.

1352
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:55,070
Hey, you ain't
on my Christmas list either.

1353
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,660
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

1354
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:01,420
Make sure you get a receipt
from him, okay?

1355
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:02,760
I'd love to see that.

1356
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,420
Well, I guess Bowie

1357
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,560
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

1358
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,980
to complete our trace of Dante.

1359
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:10,500
He's been ten moves ahead of us
this whole time.

1360
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,950
How does he do it by himself?

1361
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:13,640
Uh, this isn't good.

1362
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,980
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

1363
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,160
And look
who they're registered to.

1364
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,850
Those are mercenary kill teams.
Real scum.

1365
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,680
He used our money
to buy an army.

1366
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,680
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

1367
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,990
He wants to erase us
off the planet.

1368
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,480
He's trying to tear us apart.

1369
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,550
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

1370
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,840
at the rendezvous point.

1371
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,640
You need to see this.

1372
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:40,280
They've been paid to target us

1373
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,890
and anyone who ever helped us
until now.

1374
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:48,200
Mum.

1375
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,870
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

1376
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:15,110
And where are you going?

1377
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:16,990
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1378
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,300
Mr. Nobody's golden boy,

1379
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,470
caught without
so much as a fight.

1380
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:33,130
That's no fun.

1381
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:34,990
It's like going
all the way to Everest

1382
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:36,790
and taking the elevator.

1383
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,900
You might want to buckle up.

1384
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,070
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

1385
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,940
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

1386
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,010
But it's a new day.

1387
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:51,440
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

1388
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:57,400
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1389
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,810
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1390
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:02,330
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

1391
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:07,270
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1392
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:10,030
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1393
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:12,890
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1394
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:15,690
Hell, the days of any man

1395
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,660
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

1396
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:21,970
What are you doing?

1397
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:24,600
Preparing for what's to come.

1398
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:26,610
Right.

1399
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:45,510
Go. Go. Go.

1400
01:40:02,690 --> 01:40:06,780
Dominic, I brought you back
to where we first met.

1401
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,500
And I have a surprise for you.

1402
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,270
Dom!

1403
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:39,480
I'm listening now.

1404
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:14,740
Dominic?

1405
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,050
Dominic!

1406
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,920
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1407
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:20,540
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1408
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,570
Oh.

1409
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:24,130
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1410
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,790
That little car stunt
you just did?

1411
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,860
That was pretty awesome.

1412
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,100
Wasn't it?

1413
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,440
:
It was so cool.

1414
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,650
:
But if you don't stop,

1415
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:34,760
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1416
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,240
Badly.

1417
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,250
There she is.

1418
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:45,820
- Hmm.
- Fashionably late.

1419
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,170
You got me.

1420
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,950
Mmm.

1421
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:53,360
- Off you go.

1422
01:41:55,010 --> 01:41:56,710
Family.

1423
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,110
Will you please get off my car?

1424
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,690
- Hmm.

1425
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,520
That is so disrespectful.

1426
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,310
You talk too much.

1427
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,290
Stop, stop!

1428
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:25,780
You don't know
your own strength.

1429
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:31,230
You butthole!

1430
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:33,490
Oh, hey.

1431
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,610
Do you like ballet?

1432
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,240
I adore Swan Lake.

1433
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,140
I feel like you're more of a--
kind of a Nutcrackerguy.

1434
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:43,240
And a one, and a two,
and...

1435
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,740
No!

1436
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,470
Wait for it.

1437
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,570
Oh, no.

1438
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:01,450
She's in peril.
What will you do?

1439
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,310
You know what your problem is?

1440
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,590
Family.

1441
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:12,350
You can't save 'em all.

1442
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,480
Five. Four.

1443
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,830
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1444
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:19,350
Go on.

1445
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:20,780
Two.

1446
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:34,470
You don't like ballet.

1447
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:36,160
I can feel it.

1448
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,120
May I please have the God's Eye?

1449
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,750
- Screw you.
- No?

1450
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:40,850
Pretty please?

1451
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:43,650
- Oh, there it is.

1452
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:45,940
Ooh. Gotcha.

1453
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:49,070
Good trade. Keep the car.

1454
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,910
Oh, Dommy!

1455
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:56,180
I told you,
you owe me suffering!

1456
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:58,700
Your legacy isn't money or power

1457
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,180
or the family you built
or the life you led.

1458
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:04,320
It's the life you made.

1459
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,810
And a father and his son...

1460
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:09,120
is everything.

1461
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:11,230
You killed my father
on this bridge.

1462
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:15,040
And now I know
where to find your son.

1463
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,250
Enchanté.

1464
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,730
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

1465
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:33,150
Kinda hurts.

1466
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,220
Your father would be proud.

1467
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:37,220
Yeah.

1468
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:39,750
You will stop him.

1469
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:42,620
Have faith.

1470
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,620
She needs a hospital.

1471
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:57,510
Mm.

1472
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,880
You're gonna be okay.

1473
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,360
I got her.

1474
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,070
Go save your son.

1475
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:25,380
My nephew.

1476
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:42,280
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

1477
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,630
Let's get your son.

1478
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,970
So, it used to be an old mine,

1479
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:21,700
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

1480
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:24,980
And I just, uh...

1481
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,500
repurposed the place.

1482
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:28,850
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

1483
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:32,230
And, of course,  have
a lot of time on your hands.

1484
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:34,830
You said we'd meet him here.

1485
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:41,040
Hey.

1486
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:43,520
You know your dad.

1487
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,930
He's got to make it safe.

1488
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:47,570
We'll just wait.

1489
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:52,990
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

1490
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:01,880
What's that?

1491
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,260
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

1492
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,620
You wouldn't be interested.

1493
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,870
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

1494
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,570
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

1495
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,670
Hey.

1496
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:30,910
Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

1497
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:33,390
Just been sitting here
thinking, man.

1498
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:34,810
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

1499
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:39,090
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

1500
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,890
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

1501
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,580
I guess this whole...

1502
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,720
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

1503
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,760
You took us to London
on a container.

1504
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:52,930
You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

1505
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:54,790
strapped to your ass,

1506
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:57,450
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

1507
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:59,450
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

1508
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:01,590
for something that we all wear.

1509
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:03,390
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1510
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:04,670
Nah, it don't sound stupid
at all.

1511
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:06,190
You know what
it sounds like to me?

1512
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,750
That sounds like a leader.

1513
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:19,890
Come on, man.
Get your ass up, man.

1514
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,270
I love you, man.

1515
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,550
I love you, too, bro.

1516
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,620
Sometimes we got to say,
"I'm sorry."

1517
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:29,420
I'm sorry for
whupping your ass, man,

1518
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:31,280
'cause I didn't really mean
to do that.

1519
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,250
- The whole thing, it would've
been a whole dif... -

1520
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,390
- You okay? What's wrong?

1521
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:37,600
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

1522
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,270
- Come on.

1523
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:45,220
Hey, go easy there.
You're gonna break that thing.

1524
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:47,090
- You all right?

1525
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,710
God's Eye was just used to send

1526
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:50,820
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

1527
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:55,630
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

1528
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,240
It was meant to help.

1529
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,550
This is bigger than just Dante.

1530
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:04,550
This is bigger than just us.

1531
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:07,570
We have to stop
this monster now.

1532
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,900
We got to go.

1533
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:45,420
Hold on!

1534
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:57,020
I got eyes on
Uncle Muscle and the kid.

1535
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,190
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

1536
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:01,470
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1537
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,230
No.

1538
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:04,440
No guns.

1539
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,620
I need this little shit alive.

1540
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,290
At least for a while.

1541
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:40,080
- You ready?
- Ready.

1542
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,720
Holy sh...

1543
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,880
Oh, no, you're good.
You're good.

1544
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,470
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1545
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:04,830
:
Yeah.

1546
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,000
Here we go!

1547
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,160
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1548
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:08,770
They got an army
down there, Dom.

1549
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,770
Your team's not far out.

1550
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,740
- Bring us down.
- I can't put her down here.

1551
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,640
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

1552
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,780
Okay, we'll meet you there.
Now open the back.

1553
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:19,830
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

1554
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,900
Who said anything about landing?

1555
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:43,130
Look.

1556
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm coming for you, son.

1557
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:01,560
What the...

1558
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,750
- Dad!
- Hey, son.

1559
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:35,720
Good to see you, big bro.

1560
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,450
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

1561
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:40,290
We're right behind you.

1562
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:44,320
I got you now.

1563
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:54,120
Aimes, we're on our way.

1564
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,090
Dom, I'll be touching down
five klicks west.

1565
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:58,830
But they're still on your tail.

1566
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:02,240
It's jammed.

1567
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,650
B, what are you doing?

1568
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:12,140
Careful.

1569
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:15,190
Okay, okay, okay.

1570
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:26,500
Shut the front door.

1571
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,100
Little B.

1572
01:54:35,050 --> 01:54:37,330
Uncle Jakob!

1573
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:39,380
I fixed it!

1574
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,720
B!

1575
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:47,360
:
Toodle-oo.

1576
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,550
- Help!
- Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1577
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:51,830
Damn it.

1578
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:53,900
You party? I party.

1579
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,920
- Whoa.

1580
01:54:56,950 --> 01:54:59,540
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

1581
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,340
Hey, Dominic.
Welcome to the big showdown.

1582
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:23,800
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

1583
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:26,630
- Dad!
- Who could've seen this coming?

1584
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:28,520
I mean, you know, except for me.

1585
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:48,420
Shit. Looks like
my fuel line's been shot.

1586
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,820
- I can't get to him, Dom.
- Jakob, stay with me.

1587
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:55,410
I'm out of this race.

1588
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:56,860
It has to be you.

1589
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,070
Hey, Dom!
Got a little surprise for you.

1590
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:12,430
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1591
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:15,620
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

1592
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:18,370
Thanks for showing me the light.

1593
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:19,710
Jakob?

1594
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:21,250
I'm gonna go clear the way.

1595
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:24,580
Go get your son.

1596
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,930
Jakob, don't!

1597
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:28,080
- Don't!

1598
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,280
Uncle Jakob!

1599
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:05,790
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be
coming to the next barbecue.

1600
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:07,900
Oh.

1601
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,600
I mean, it's very honorable.

1602
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,250
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

1603
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:15,060
It'll lead you
right to the airfield.

1604
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,240
You know how to beat your dad
in a street race?

1605
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:37,930
Take away the streets.

1606
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:39,740
- Dad!

1607
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,420
Amazing.

1608
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,610
Oh.

1609
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,490
We got it.
We got it.

1610
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,380
My turn.

1611
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,380
He's good. Your dad's good.

1612
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,070
Dom, you got one mile left.

1613
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:50,100
Son, I never break a promise.

1614
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:53,590
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

1615
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:55,080
Feel the car,

1616
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:56,940
find your line

1617
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:58,440
and fly.

1618
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:20,700
- Oh!

1619
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:37,200
- Now!

1620
01:59:50,830 --> 01:59:51,900
No.

1621
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:55,140
Take the service road now.

1622
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:05,320
- I'm wheels down.
- We're headed to you now.

1623
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,320
Your team is on their way.

1624
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,050
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1625
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,150
- You okay?
- I'm good, Dad.

1626
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:13,550
I'm real proud of you, son.

1627
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,170
:
Oh, Dommy boy.

1628
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:03,060
It's so good to see you again.

1629
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,580
Did you hit me with
a helicopter back there?

1630
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:07,070
Hmm.

1631
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:09,730
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

1632
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:12,140
You're showing off
in front of your son.

1633
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:13,520
But honestly,
did you really think

1634
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:16,530
it was going to be that easy?

1635
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:18,940
You're exactly
where I wanted you to be.

1636
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:20,880
Yes.

1637
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,710
Wait for it.

1638
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,950
I got a surprise for you.

1639
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:34,420
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

1640
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,800
Roman, get out of here.
It's a trap.

1641
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,080
Incoming!

1642
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,720
Yes!

1643
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:03,410
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

1644
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:08,730
Can't protect 'em all.

1645
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:15,210
Ooh!

1646
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:17,640
Oh, Dominic,
is that your new friend?

1647
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,930
:
Aw.

1648
02:02:20,130 --> 02:02:21,590
You are so predictable.

1649
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:25,010
You think everyone's gonna
end up on your side?

1650
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:28,250
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

1651
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:31,640
Now the work begins.

1652
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,260
And in there,

1653
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:36,340
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

1654
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:38,970
Let's get started.

1655
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:49,960
Well, looks like
our partnership's

1656
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:52,390
off to a fantastic start.

1657
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:58,080
You know, Dominic,
to become a real saint,

1658
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,840
you have to perform miracles.

1659
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,940
Or die a martyr.

1660
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:04,130
So what's it gonna be?

1661
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:16,130
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

1662
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:18,180
and I'm gonna take your family.

1663
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:20,310
And you're gonna die

1664
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,560
knowing that
you couldn't save your son.

1665
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,350
Dad.

1666
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:29,430
I have faith.

1667
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,650
You made one mistake.

1668
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:42,720
You never took my car.

1669
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:04,120
Oh!

1670
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:04,340
The suffering is over, Dom.

1671
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:12,040
It's time for you to die.

1672
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:13,380
No way.

1673
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:16,140
Still think my plan sucks?

1674
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:39,740
Howdy, partner.

1675
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:41,880
Do you like surprises?

1676
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:45,340
You've done some dastardly,
dirty deeds, Sheriff.

1677
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:48,620
You took the most important
thing in my life from me.

1678
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,980
Dom drove the car.

1679
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:01,350
- But you...
- Help me.

1680
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:03,950
...you pulled the trigger.

1681
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:06,980
And now I'm gonna
make you suffer.

1682
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:26,790
The devil is coming for you...

1683
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:29,310
lawman.

1684
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:33,760
Well, I ain't hard to find,
you sumbitch.
