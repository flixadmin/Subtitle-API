for doing this last job

No.

a public place and that is not allowed.

No.

Well, you know,
if it was me who had all them jewels,

334
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,480
I think I'd just sit with them,

Late at night.

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,680

sapphires into her body for pleasure,

-Yeah.

with sapphires inside of them.
