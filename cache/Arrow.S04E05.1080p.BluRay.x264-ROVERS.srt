1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,491
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,966
I'm gonna run for mayor.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,607
Mr. Palmer's last recorded statement
could shed some light on how he died.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,962
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,605
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,565
You need to feed this impulse.
Once you do, it will subside for a time.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,285
<i>I want you to bring my sister
back to life.</i>

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,481
<i>"MALCOLM". Even if Sara went into the Pit,</i>

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,170
<i>what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.</i>

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,327
<i>"LAUREL". Your daughter is alive.</i>

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,444
The most loving act you can commit
is to return Sara to her final rest.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,563
You are not gonna kill your own daughter.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,841
She's not my daughter!

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,280
Sara?

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,008
Damn it!

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,283
Hey, honey! Why don't you just
leave that right there?

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,005
Step off, bitch.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,686
Oh, my God! Thank you.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,244
<i>S. C. P. D.! Stay where you are.</i>

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,009
I cannot thank you enough for
coming on board, Alex.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,568
Well, then it is a good thing
you're paying me also.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,926
- Sorry for the wait.
- Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,930
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,565
Old enough to vote, Alex?

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,286
I owned a bar and I wasn't even
old enough to drink.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,931
I'm old enough to do both.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,810
Well, I'm glad that you're
joining the team,

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,801
but I don't entirely know why I need
a political strategist.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,683
Well, I guess the question then is,
do you want to take office

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,410
with 10% of the vote or 90?

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,489
After you win, you still need
to be able to govern.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,762
Well, what has you concerned?
My lack of experience?

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,200
No. We can spin that.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,448
No, I'm talking about the kind of
closet skeletons

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,004
that could cripple you on your first day
in office. Your personal Chappaquiddick.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,248
Wait, like that game from <i>Harry</i> Potter?

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,847
Um, Chappaquiddick was a scandal
involving a can't-lose candidate

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,646
whose campaign fell apart
when he was caught having an affair

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,606
after his vehicle went underwater
and the girl he was with drowned.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,484
Does that sound at all familiar?

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,131
Referencing the Queen's <i>Gambit</i>
and Sara Lance.

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,526
Yeah. Got it.

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,165
You're about to do your first
on-air sit-down, right?

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,327
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,729
Bethany Snow. Ten will get you 20
she brings up Sara and her sister.

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,610
Alex. All due respect,

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,128
I don't think that people care about my
friendship with Laurel Lance

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,405
and an eight-year-old scandal
when this city is disintegrating

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,808
and there are masked,
armed men helping it.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,650
Not to mention there's a woman
in Pennytown

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,524
that's just running around killing people.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,922
You're right. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,964
For a moment, I forgot how the electorate
always cares about the issues

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,844
and has zero appetite for scandal.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,568
You want this city united?

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,570
You can't do it as the rich-kid playboy
from the tabloids.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,003
And like it or not, Laurel Lance
is a constant reminder of that.

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,846
<i>So from this day forward,
when anyone brings up Ms. Lance,</i>

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,570
you distance yourself from her.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,730
Hey! Just in time. I was looking for you.

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,281
Why?

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,403
I wanna talk to you about
something you forgot.

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,761
What's that?

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,485
That how you wanna play this?

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,328
Fine by me, pal. Let's go.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,241
I don't appreciate the intrusion,
gentlemen.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,286
There's communications gear in here.
We've got ourselves a mole.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,249
And you believe it's Mr. Queen?

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,680
Look.

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,721
We've been on this island eight months
without a single problem.

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,201
He shows up.
Suddenly, two guys find landmines,

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>and a bunch of drugs go missing.</i>

73
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,363
Yeah. Conklin, you got me. I didn't wash
up on shore here after a boating accident.

74
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,404
I parachuted in on a secret spy mission.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,161
- You wanna die a liar, that's fine by me.
- That's enough.

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,091
Enough! There are more pressing
matters at hand.

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,966
Perhaps if you were focused more on
external threats rather than witch hunts,

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,771
you would've caught this man spying on us
in the fields.

79
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,962
I wasn't spying, mate.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,688
Any of you squabblers got a cigarette?

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,129
She mumbled something.
It sounded, I don't know, Middle Eastern.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,767
All right, um, we're gonna have you
sit down with a sketch artist, okay?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
Take care of that.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,931
- Dad. What happened?
- Hey.

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,561
You tell me. These two bodies
dropped by a woman.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,689
Probably the same woman
that's been linked to the murders

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,531
of three other skels in the past few days.
A blonde woman.

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,721
Dad, I...

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,126
I didn't know what to make of it
till tonight.

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,766
This woman says her suspect speaks
some kind of Middle Eastern language,

91
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,371
just like Sara.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,210
Is she still at your place?

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,965
I've been looking for her.

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,969
Why didn't you tell me, huh?
Did you tell Queen?

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,488
No. Because he would just see this
the same way as you.

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,523
Yeah, and how is that, huh? How is that?

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,964
That Sara is just a thing that
needs to be stopped.

98
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,366
This is my daughter.

99
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,370
Then why did I find you with
a gun pointed at her head?

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm not proud of that, Laurel,
but people are dying.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,843
And if I'd pulled that trigger,
maybe they wouldn't be.

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,522
I'm gonna go find Sara, and hopefully I do
before you or Oliver.

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,323
Curtis, I need you to do something for me.

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,006
Felicity, look at me.
Gym clothes, gym bag.

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,521
Do either of those suggest anything
to you?

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,246
Physical fitness. But then I remembered
you're a tech guy.

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,005
I'm also a bronze medal decathlete.

108
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,406
Bronze medal, huh?

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,681
Beijing, 2008.

110
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,121
Beijing. As in the Olympics?

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,889
Mr. Palmer's recording. Did you play it?

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,043
Yes, there's something off about it.

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,210
You sure it's not the fact that
it's a dying declaration from your ex?

114
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,246
I mean, that is some serious
Nicholas-Sparks-level stuff.

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,041
Don't judge. Man can write emotion.

116
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,526
No, not that. I mean, yes, there's that,

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,286
but there's still some artifacts playing
that shouldn't be there.

118
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,001
What about your workout?

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,009
Didn't seem to concern you 20 seconds ago.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,129
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault. I got...</i>

121
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,361
You hear that?

122
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,131
Like there's more to the recording.
Something overlapping with it.

123
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,324
I was hoping you could clean it up for me.
I mean, after your workout.

124
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,443
It can wait.
I'm glad you changed your mind

125
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,324
about hearing Mr. Palmer's final words.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
Thank you, Curtis.

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,085
Oh, thank you for coming.

128
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,282
Well, I think we both know I didn't
have too much choice.

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,131
No, certainly not since you literally
doubled the number of daughters

130
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,521
I have to hold over you.

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,888
Or did you take my advice
and return Sara to the grave?

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,963
You didn't take my advice. Pity.

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
What do you want?

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,648
A new beginning for the world,
a nice glass of merlot.

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,251
Not necessarily in that order.

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,762
And for you to do me a favor.

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,606
There's a federal server farm
30 miles outside of the city.

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,804
I want you to gain access and plug this
little baby into one of the computers.

139
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,530
How much this thing gonna do?

140
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,205
It's of no concern of yours.

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,682
But don't worry, it's not like it's gonna
destroy the city or anything.

142
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,726
Whatever that spa weekend did to
clear your head,

143
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,724
it also improved your technique.

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,010
You're effortless.

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,841
Yeah, well, you know how I love
my hot stone massages.

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,567
By the way, that political strategist
was a good call.

147
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,123
But his advice was a little harsh.
I mean, distancing yourself from Laurel?

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,044
I wasn't expecting that,
but he made a few good points.

149
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,810
What? Like kicking your friends
to the curb?

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,890
Well, my friendship with Laurel
is complicated.

151
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,725
We have been in each other's lives for,
like, forever.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,890
I mean, you have been in love with
Laurel and Sara.

153
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,240
And Laurel, she... She took me in at CNRI
when I was completely lost.

154
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,320
Even Captain Lance, okay? He has been
there for us since Mom died.

155
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,885
Okay. But your point?

156
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,369
My point is that pretending that you
don't know who your friends are,

157
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,249
it just doesn't feel very united.

158
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,365
<i>This is your overlord,
Felicity Smoak.</i>

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
We have a PA system?

160
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,202
Yet another decision
I might live to regret.

161
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,166
Hi! What's going on?

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,243
Code 47 at a nightclub on Ninth.

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,011
A blonde woman going cray-cray.
And since I'm down here,

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,402
it's probably the blonde woman
we've been looking for.

165
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,568
The woman who's killing people
in Pennytown.

166
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,125
- Suit up.
- Yeah.

167
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,281
Help!

168
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,771
Run!

169
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,284
Run!

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,086
You have got to stop this!

171
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,200
Sara?

172
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,610
Your sister's alive, she's out there
and she's hurting people.

173
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,571
How is she alive?

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
The Lazarus Pit?

175
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,851
Did you two spend your spa weekend
in Nanda Parbat?

176
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,687
It was the only place we could
get a reservation.

177
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,446
The bloodlust is worse with Sara,
isn't it?

178
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,091
Because you brought her back from death.

179
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,009
Yeah, and that's not the only problem.

180
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,691
Sara's not herself. She's changed.

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,121
Why didn't you come to me with this?

182
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,600
Come to you for what?

183
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,850
Your expertise with magical resurrection
or that judgmental look on your face?

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,641
For help finding her, Laurel, before she
gets hurt or she hurts anyone else.

185
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,649
And if I have a judgmental look on my face
right now,

186
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,446
it's because you played with forces that
you do not understand

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,802
and now people are dying because of it.

188
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,446
- Who's he?
- John Constantine.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,163
Says so right on the business card
your boss took from me.

190
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,011
He had this on his person as well.
Do you recognize these landmarks?

191
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,046
Yeah.

192
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,481
Good. Whatever it is Mr. Constantine
is looking for,

193
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,648
I want you to find it and
bring it back to me.

194
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,365
Oh, come on!
I'm telling you, you can't trust him.

195
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,971
Then you can follow him.

196
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,682
What are you doing? You actually praying?

197
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,045
No. No, these aren't prayers, mate.

198
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,730
Ah, ah, ah!

199
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,884
Unless you wanna redecorate your lovely
hut with his brains,

200
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,570
I suggest you drop your weapon.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,731
On the floor.

202
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,571
You won't escape this island.

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,001
I don't intend on leaving just yet.

204
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,011
Come on, you.

205
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,443
- You really know the place on that map?
- Yes.

206
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,246
- You do? Good.
- Yes.

207
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,088
You're gonna show me. Now drive.

208
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,131
We need to talk.

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,201
About Sara?

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,686
Laurel told you?

211
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,366
Not exactly.

212
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,085
You gotta admire her consistency.

213
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,886
Keeps her death secret from me,
her resurrection secret from you.

214
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,969
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

215
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,040
I think there are certain situations in
life where the word "okay" does not apply.

216
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,890
Well, we're working on finding Sara.

217
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,209
Good. 'Cause we got other problems.

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,606
FELICITYI It's a RAT,

219
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,643
a <i>Remote Access Trojan.
Basically,</i> a <i>computer virus.</i>

220
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,965
A polymorphic code designed to target
and erase certain pieces of data.

221
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,131
It's buried under three levels of
encryption. By the time I've cracked it...

222
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,561
Darhk could be wondering why
I haven't run his errand for him.

223
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,889
I'm not sending you to break into
a federal facility without backup.

224
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,565
I don't want Laurel knowing
about me and Darhk.

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,285
It wasn't suggesting Laurel.

226
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,724
Oliver tell you that Darhk works for
an organization? HIVE?

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,166
Yeah.

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,845
HIVE had my brother killed.

229
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,401
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,491
And now, Detective, you're telling me
that you were working with them.

231
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,481
For them.

232
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,761
It's a long story.

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,166
I've got time.

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,163
This city's been hurting.
This is nothing new.

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,489
Darhk comes to me.
He offers to help fix it.

236
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,682
<i>He's got powerful friends. He's got money.</i>

237
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,849
And this is months before the Ghosts,
all right?

238
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,770
I didn't see him as anything other than
a concerned citizen.

239
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,121
Okay. And then?

240
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,481
Well, then he's doing all this good stuff,

241
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,524
and then he asks me where the fire chief
is going on his vacation.

242
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,523
<i>So, I give him the address of his
summer cabin.</i>

243
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,006
Next day, the cabin blows up.

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,202
- You confront Darhk about this?
- Course I did.

245
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,681
And that's when he shows me pictures
of Laurel.

246
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,166
At work. At home. AA meetings.

247
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,721
So this thing with your brother,
is it gonna be a problem

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,885
for us working together?

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,365
No, Detective.

250
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,964
Because you being next to Darhk
is gonna help us take down HIVE.

251
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,968
<i>Any luck
connecting Sara's victims?</i>

252
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,205
Just that she's only killed muggers
and street thugs.

253
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,685
I still can't believe that it's Sara
we're talking about.

254
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,241
That she's alive. I mean, I know how
it's possible, but how is it possible?

255
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,363
The world is a much more

256
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,883
complicated place than most people
are comfortable believing.

257
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,560
I received an old message from Ray,

258
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,522
from the moment right before he died.

259
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,408
I almost didn't listen to it because,

260
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,767
you know, I didn't wanna feel
that grief again.

261
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,443
The threat of zombie apocalypse aside,

262
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,923
isn't it kind of nice not having to deal
with the pain of saying goodbye?

263
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,484
Only if it were that simple.

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,764
Not a day goes by
that I don't miss my parents

265
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,165
or Tommy.

266
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,962
Then I think about what I would

267
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,441
give just to spend
another minute with them.

268
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,286
But what's happening with Sara isn't

269
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,487
healing anyone's pain. It's just...

270
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,610
It's making it worse.

271
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,644
She almost killed those two girls.
I mean, why would she even go after them?

272
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,527
Her marble collection's a little
incomplete. Just guessing.

273
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,603
Or they have something in common.

274
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,291
Well, the waitress was Stephanie Dingess,

275
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,290
and the girl at the club was
Lindsey Poison.

276
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,642
- Oh, my God! Both these girls...
- They look like Thea.

277
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,921
Passing on the judgment for tonight.

278
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,966
Sara.

279
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,241
I just can't believe that Sara
would do something like this.

280
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,611
She's not Sara.

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,889
No, it...

282
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,605
That's not it.

283
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,889
Hey. Hey. How ya feelin'?

284
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,411
Sara, she...

285
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,807
No, I know. It's okay. You're safe.

286
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,441
She tried to kill me.

287
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,244
She's not in her right mind.

288
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,244
You've no idea.

289
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,890
This is the Pit.

290
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,281
She's going through the same thing I am.

291
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,408
Thea, I thought that you were better.

292
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,604
When I went to Nanda Parbat, I

293
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,124
killed two guys.

294
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,606
Malcolm served them up
on a platter for me and

295
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,125
helped keep my bloodlust at bay.

296
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,529
Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right.

297
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,125
Laurel, come with me.

298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,285
Is Thea okay?

299
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,646
No.

300
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,924
Not only is Thea hospitalized,

301
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,767
but she has Merlyn influencing her
to kill people.

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,126
What are you talking about?

303
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,483
Just another thing that happened on
your secret trip to Nanda Parbat.

304
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,729
Hey, I didn't tell you that I took
my sister to Nanda Parbat

305
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,724
because I knew that you wouldn't approve.

306
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,011
Why didn't you tell me you took Thea?

307
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,682
- What does that have to do with anything?
- It's the hypocrisy that I can't stand.

308
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,882
What? It's okay for you to do whatever
you have to for your sister,

309
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,003
but it's not okay for me to do
the same to mine.

310
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,522
Sara was dead. Thea wasn't.

311
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,849
Then why didn't you tell me about Thea
seven months ago?

312
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,843
Because you don't see me as an equal.

313
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,482
Come on. Laurel, of course,
I see you as an equal.

314
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,251
No, you don't. You never have.

315
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,245
- You never told me you were the Arrow.
- Keep your voice down.

316
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,249
You never supported me becoming
the Black Canary.

317
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,371
And you never would've told me that
there's a way to save my sister.

318
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,609
My sister, she's out of her mind
right now

319
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,841
because of something that I did,
a decision that I made.

320
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,364
Did you everjust stop and think
for one second

321
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,005
about what I might be going through?

322
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,567
I'm sorry about what happened to Thea.

323
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,882
I really am. I love your family,
I always have.

324
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,887
I just wish that sometimes you would
give a damn about mine.

325
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,925
Get out.

326
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,523
You sure this is the place?

327
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,604
It's the place.
What's going on? Who are you?

328
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,202
How much do you know about what your boss
is really doing on this island, eh?

329
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,050
Making drugs.

330
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,926
If only. Your friend Reiter,
he's the dangerous sort.

331
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,127
What's that supposed to mean?

332
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,324
It means there are things on this island
that bad people shouldn't have access to.

333
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,927
Says the guy with a gun pointed
at my head.

334
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,490
I'm not a bad guy.
A little hardscrabble sure, but, uh,

335
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,728
I'm on the side of the angels, mate,

336
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,930
at least when they're not busy trying to
screw me over.

337
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,929
You're right. This is the spot.

338
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,609
What? You never seen magic before?

339
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,650
Go on then, Alice.
Down the rabbit hole you go.

340
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,291
Nice job getting us in.

341
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,528
You learn how to do that
before or after working with Queen?

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,131
I'll save that for another story.

343
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,526
Yeah, I bet.

344
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,846
- Is this the access point?
- Yeah. Yeah, it looks like it.

345
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,166
All right.
Keep an eye out for rent-a-cops.

346
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,169
This wouldn't do my career prospects
too much good.

347
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,326
It working?

348
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,842
Yeah, I think so. Looks like the virus
is erasing files on people.

349
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,363
Which people? And why?

350
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,210
Both really good questions.

351
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,845
Hey-

352
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,566
Hey-

353
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,211
What are you doing here?

354
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,050
Waiting for you to wake up.

355
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,042
Thea, I owe you an apology.

356
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,729
No, no. There's no need for you
to apologize for anything.

357
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,723
Yes, I do. I brought Sara back without any
idea of how to control her.

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,083
And I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

359
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
That's why she's after me, you know.

360
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,566
This bloodlust she's consumed by.

361
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,726
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.

362
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,564
I don't understand.

363
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,566
Because the person that I'm driven
to kill,

364
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,121
the one who killed me, is already dead.

365
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,368
Thea, what're you talking about?

366
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,928
She kills me, she'll be okay.

367
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,086
If the only way to save Sara is to
kill you, then that's no cure at all.

368
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,963
- How much longer?
- Two minutes.

369
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,086
- Wait. Wait. What was that?
- What is it?

370
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,607
- I just saw my brother's name.
- What's that all about?

371
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,406
What'd you do?

372
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,251
Nothing. I just have to get
back to whatever it is this thing erased.

373
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,761
No, we don't have time.
Security's gonna be on their way now.

374
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,285
I'm not leaving.

375
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,004
Drop it! Drop it now!

376
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,925
Hey, hey, it's all right. Captain Lance,
Star City Police Department.

377
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,724
I just tracked this hacker here.

378
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,162
All right. Now, look.

379
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,244
Go get some back up, all right?
Call this in. Come on, go!

380
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
Go!

381
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,124
It's a good story. Just wish you would've
told me before you gave me a concussion.

382
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,965
Come on.
Then it wouldn't have looked real.

383
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,770
I didn't know you were still here.

384
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,809
Hey. Yeah, I just came to make sure
Thea was okay.

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,490
I didn't have a chance to before, so...

386
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,000
She sleeping?

387
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,321
TFYing to.

388
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,326
<i>Look.</i>

389
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,005
I know why you're here.

390
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,486
Okay, I get it.

391
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:44,528
I want you to know that it's okay.

392
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,364
And I want you to do it.

393
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,001
About what I said before...

394
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,890
You said some things that you meant.

395
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,080
Thea?

396
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,246
You sure you wanna be here?

397
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,408
I hated hospitals before tonight.
Just another excuse to stay away.

398
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,047
At the hospital, I looked Sara
in the eyes. She wasn't there.

399
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,531
What does that mean?

400
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,609
The Pit is not supposed to be used
on the dead.

401
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,047
It brought Sara's body back,
but all this is happening...

402
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,527
Because it didn't restore her soul.

403
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,562
We still need to find her. Okay.

404
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,563
Sara died long before you moved in
with Laurel,

405
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,240
and she knew exactly which hospital room
to look for you in.

406
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,522
What? You think Sara can sense
Thea somehow?

407
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,722
And here I was just about wrapping my mind
around metahumans.

408
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,042
Wait, we've both been in the Pit.

409
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,245
Maybe that gives us some type
of connection, a connection we can use.

410
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,729
Thea, you just got out of the hospital.
I don't wanna use you as bait.

411
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Well, I guess it's a good thing
you're not in charge anymore.

412
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,251
We'll have her back, Oliver. All of us.

413
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,969
I don't understand. How did you...

414
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,403
Well, that's the great thing about magic.
It can't be explained.

415
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,251
There are places in this world as old
as the world.

416
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,569
Places of nexus draw bad people to them.

417
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,289
This island is such a place.
It's no accident that you're here.

418
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,971
Let me guess. "Do not enter."

419
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,647
More like, "Only for the pure of heart."

420
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,125
That's not you, mate.

421
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,802
There you are, my pretty girl.

422
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,844
How do you know it's a girl?

423
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,683
I can do that trick, too.

424
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,005
Clever boy.

425
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,041
I'd usually be more artful,
but I'm on something of a clock.

426
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,686
No!

427
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,289
I'm not a bad guy, either.

428
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,848
- Mission accomplished.
- Well done.

429
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,648
Are you sticking around
for a cupcake or something?

430
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,845
This thing you had me do. I saw some of
the names you had erased.

431
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,041
All military.

432
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,163
And here I had you pegged for a Luddite.

433
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,805
Fast learner.

434
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,407
One of those names,
Sergeant Andrew Diggle.

435
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,361
What is he to you?

436
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,248
He died six years ago. Why are you erasing
the record of a dead man?

437
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,041
You know what? I'm gonna tell you.

438
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,727
And only because you completed your task
with such efficiency.

439
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,844
We hired an assassin to murder
Sergeant Diggle.

440
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,166
Why?

441
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,170
Afghanistan's an interesting place,
replete with opportunities

442
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,567
for an enterprising enlisted man
to engage in.

443
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,165
What are you talking about?

444
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,882
Drugs, weapons, murder.
Your Sergeant Diggle was an eager beaver.

445
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,886
Unfortunately for him, our organization
weaved itself into that part of the world,

446
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,844
and as you know, we don't play well
with others.

447
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,246
So you had him killed.

448
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,090
What is this guy? Your best buddy?

449
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,363
I don't see you associating yourself
with crime lords.

450
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,924
Present company excepted.

451
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,526
Now, are we done?

452
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,806
Set.

453
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,611
I have to say, it feels really weird
being back here right now.

454
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,042
<i>Don't worry.
E veryone's in position.</i>

455
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,130
It's nothing, okay? I don't think this
is gonna actually work.

456
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,724
Oh, God, I take that back.

457
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,611
Get her out of here!

458
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,322
Dad was right. There's nothing left
inside of you, Sara.

459
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,441
Tranq arrow.

460
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,962
No. No, you said it yourself.
She has no soul.

461
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,451
Laurel.

462
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,486
Let's get it back.

463
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,926
What?

464
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,125
- Oliver.
- John.

465
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,651
It's been a dog's age, mate.

466
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,882
More than. Do you remember that favor
you owe me?

467
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,844
I hardly expect you to let me forget that.

468
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,170
How quickly can you get to Star City?
I need your help.

469
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,691
So you're gonna perform some kind of
exorcism on my sister?

470
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,366
No, an exorcism is a removal of
demonic possession.

471
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,646
What your sister needs is a restitutionem,
the restoration of her soul to her body.

472
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,808
And you've done this before?

473
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,367
Once. Maybe a year ago.

474
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,369
But don't worry,
it's just like riding a bike.

475
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,649
I'm sure we have a lot of work to do to
prepare. I assume you brought a list?

476
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,007
Apologies, I didn't have time to translate
that from its original Aramaic.

477
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,806
You know, if I knew you were surrounded
by so many pretty girls, Oliver,

478
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,405
I would have stopped by sooner.

479
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,730
Where did Oliver find this guy? The Luxor?

480
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,570
I'm just glad that the latest person
from Oliver's past

481
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,410
is not another gorgeous woman.

482
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,011
I'm not even going to ask.

483
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,931
You got my message. I'm so happy you came.

484
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,769
I'm her father, too.

485
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,241
I hate to be the one to say this,
but what if something goes wrong?

486
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,968
Oh, don't worry. If things go wrong,
then we'll all be too dead to care.

487
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,202
Well then, now we just need a...

488
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,686
I think I got everything in here that
you wanted,

489
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,242
although I am not entirely sure what you
need a dead peacock feather for.

490
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,760
Ah.

491
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,083
Oh, nice one.
That's been bugging me for hours.

492
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,928
Now, I've only got enough juice to send
myself and two of you

493
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,770
to the other realm and back, so...

494
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,611
I think it should be me. Um...

495
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,771
I'm the reason why
she's like this right now.

496
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,930
No offense, love, but from what I hear,

497
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,448
you're not exactly bringing out
the best in Sara right now, are you?

498
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,650
Laurel. Do you trust me?

499
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Trust me when I tell you this will work.

500
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,447
Oh, there's, uh, one more thing.

501
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,646
Whatever's locked her soul away is not
gonna give it over without a fight.

502
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,691
So be ready.

503
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,808
All right then. On with the show.

504
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,291
Mmm.

505
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,051
Oliver!

506
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,209
Well, I've had worse hangovers.

507
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,490
So what are we supposed to do now?

508
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,727
<i>Help!</i>

509
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,325
Laurel, no!

510
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,531
- This is new.
- Well, new is why you brought me along.

511
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,047
<i>- Help!</i>
- No, no, no.No.

512
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,043
Well, I'm not gonna just stand here.

513
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,730
We need a tour guide.

514
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,726
Ah.

515
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,721
This way. Unless you want to be trapped
here for all eternity.

516
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,565
This is what
locked away Sara's soul.

517
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,961
- How the human mind perceives it, anyway.
- Help!

518
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,969
Get to the Pit. You need to work together
to get her out.

519
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,804
I'll take care of our new friend.

520
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,445
You want some, do you?

521
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,448
You know, any time today would be good.

522
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,126
Come on, Sara.

523
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,202
Laurel. You're all right.

524
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,811
You all right?

525
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,161
I don't know what happened. You okay?

526
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,807
What happened? What is she? Did we...

527
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,006
Sara.

528
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,841
Sara. Sara.

529
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,651
You're okay.

530
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,523
Thank you, John. I owe you one.

531
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,685
I believe I owed you one, mate.
How's about we just call it even, eh?

532
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,329
How about anytime, anywhere you need me,
and I'll be there?

533
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,726
I'll take that.

534
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,081
You know, the hair on the back of my neck
has been standing up

535
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,322
since the moment I got into town.

536
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,241
That is probably our current problem,
Damien Darhk.

537
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,762
Oh, you've heard of him.

538
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,006
You watch yourself around that one, mate.

539
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,010
He'll make what you saw in the other
realm look like a bloody gnat.

540
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,921
Any helpful advice?

541
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,767
Yeah, leave town while you still can.

542
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,727
Well, he's a very specific kind of yummy.

543
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,004
Oh! I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear you
just say that.

544
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,565
Are we okay? I mean, I just keep
waiting for you to blow up at me.

545
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,688
Because you lied to me about Nanda Parbat?

546
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,410
Yeah.

547
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,527
Thea, I don't have the right to be mad at
anyone for keeping secrets.

548
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,645
But I'm sorry that I made you feel as
though you had to. Come here.

549
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,487
So, mate, I owe you one.

550
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,449
What the hell is all this?

551
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,961
This is the Orb of Horus.

552
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,967
It's actually a grimoire,
an ancient spellbook. You asked.

553
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,641
And, uh, what are you gonna do with it?

554
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,926
Same as I do with all the other
mystical objects I find.

555
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,647
Keep them in a safe place, away from
the Baron Reiters of this world.

556
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,291
Remember what I told you about
this island, mate.

557
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,563
This Reiter bloke is not only here
for the narcotics.

558
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,247
But then again, it's not your problem,
is it?

559
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,607
Come back with me.
I've got a boat on the southern shore.

560
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,643
You saw those people at camp.

561
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,001
I can't leave them behind.

562
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,481
Well, aren't you the hero.

563
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,643
I also can't come back empty-handed.
Conklin suspects me enough as it is.

564
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,211
Fair enough.

565
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,806
Here.

566
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,011
Goons like Reiter, they're only interested
in the sparkly bits, anyway.

567
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,127
The real power is in the spell.
Here. Here. I'll show you.

568
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,043
Lift up your shirt, mate.

569
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,166
What?

570
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,249
What the hell did you just do?

571
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,642
I gave you some insurance against Reiter.

572
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,488
And when the time comes,
you'll know how to use it.

573
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,487
Now, I believe that concludes
our business.

574
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,046
Uh...

575
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,922
I need you to punch me in the face.

576
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,722
Right. My escape attempt
left a bruise, right?

577
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,164
All right. I must warn you,
I've got a hell of a right hook.

578
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,569
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks very much.

579
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,048
All right, so just stay on message.
Unity, united community.

580
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,840
- United. Got it.
- All right.

581
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,610
Hey! Laurel.

582
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,888
Maybe we need to work on your
understanding

583
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,445
of the phrase "distance yourself."

584
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,241
Only if you insist on continuing to use it
when it relates to my friends.

585
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,726
Okay.

586
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,522
It's your campaign.
You pay me whether you win or lose.

587
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,921
I am gonna go keep him from quitting,
but I'm very proud of you right now.

588
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,291
How's Sara?

589
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,891
Resting.

590
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,928
It turns out that getting your soul back
is exhausting.

591
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,451
Yeah.

592
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,601
Ollie, I don't know how I'm ever
gonna be able to thank you.

593
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,566
Just like that.

594
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,411
Well, thank you.

595
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,726
And thank you for inviting me
here tonight.

596
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,450
After what I said to you in the hospital,

597
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,921
I thought that I'd be the last person
you'd wanna see.

598
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,841
Well, you were right. I haven't always
been the best friend for you.

599
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,803
But I'd be grateful for the opportunity
to try and start to be.

600
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,004
How can I say no to the man that helped me
save my sister's soul?

601
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,520
Yeah.

602
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,680
<i>I've made mistakes,</i>

603
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,160
<i>mistakes that have
hurt people close to me.</i>

604
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,124
<i>But I'm not hereto run from the past</i>

605
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,284
<i>because the past has contributed
to making...</i>

606
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,485
I thought you'd be out celebrating
with Sara.

607
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,290
Yeah. There's enough time for that.

608
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,290
- Please.
- I figured I owed you something.

609
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,481
I asked Darhk about your brother.
He, uh, gave me something.

610
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,283
You don't have to read this.

611
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,288
You can remember your brother
how you knew him.

612
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,482
Are you sure about this?

613
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,205
Yeah. It's legit.

614
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,526
I'm very sorry.

615
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,850
Thank you, Detective.

616
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,887
Gut punch doesn't deserve a thank you.

617
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,844
I wanted to know why

618
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,371
HIVE had my brother killed,
and now I do, so...

619
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,688
Felicity! Welcome back!
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

620
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,325
How many of these have you drank?

621
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,841
It's "drunk," actually, and many.
But worth it.

622
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,491
You cleared up the rest of Ray's message?

623
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,002
I think so. The playback was rendering
when you came in. So, propitious timing.

624
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,010
You're not even allowed to say "energy
drink" while on company time ever again.

625
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,567
That's okay. I think I might be having
a cardiac incident, anyway.

626
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,410
So, check out the message.
I was just about to call you.

627
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,005
Wait, where's my phone.
Wait, did I call you already?

628
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,725
- Curtis!
- Wait.

629
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,008
<i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.</i>

630
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,240
<i>I got myself into this mess screwing
around with my exosuit and nanotechnology.</i>

631
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,404
<i>But recriminations probably aren't the
best use of this limited bandwidth.</i>

632
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,566
<i>What I need you to know is
I'm alive and I'm in trouble.</i>

633
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,801
