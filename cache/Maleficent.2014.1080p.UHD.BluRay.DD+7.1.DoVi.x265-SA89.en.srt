1
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,536
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,956
<i>and we will see how well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:41,376
<i>Once upon a time,
there were two kingdoms</i>

4
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,545
<i>that were the worst of neighbors.</i>

5
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,548
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:49,259
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,638
<i>or a terrible villain
might bring them together.</i>

8
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,016
<i>In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,</i>

9
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,478
<i>with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.</i>

10
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,064
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:05,275
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

12
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,779
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:12,991
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

14
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:16,286
<i>And they needed
neither king nor queen,</i>

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,996
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,253
<i>In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors</i>

17
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,713
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:29,758
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,345
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,348
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,711
There you go.

22
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,380
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,965
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,810
Good morning,
Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,687
- I love your cap!
- Oh.

26
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,153
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,612
Ahh!

28
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,576
Ha! You missed me!

29
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,204
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,464
Lovely work, girls!

31
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,509
Whoo-hoo!

32
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,816
- What's all the fuss about?
- The border guards have discov...

33
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,193
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

34
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,235
I want to!

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,362
There are rules, Flittle.

36
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,113
I tell this time, you tell next time.

37
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,615
No, you told last time,

38
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,450
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

39
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,202
Tell me what?

40
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,495
Fine!

41
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:22,954
Thank you.

42
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,873
Maleficent, the border guard...

43
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,333
The border guards have found

44
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,335
a human thief at the pool of jewels.

45
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:31,797
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,845
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

47
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,806
Humans, here.

48
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,516
I hope there's not another war.

49
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,405
I'm not afraid.

50
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,825
Besides, I have never
seen a human up close.

51
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:01,993
Come out!

52
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,247
No. They mean to kill me.

53
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,916
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

54
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,710
That's extremely rude.

55
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,338
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.

56
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,006
You're classically handsome.

57
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,177
It's not right to steal,

58
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,596
but we don't kill people for it.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,722
Come out.

60
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,599
Come out this instant!

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,613
Are you fully grown?

62
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,532
No.

63
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,785
I believe he's just a boy.

64
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:45,954
And you're just a girl.

65
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,165
I think.

66
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,249
Who are you?

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,251
I'm called Stefan.

68
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,044
Who are you?

69
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,754
I'm Maleficent.

70
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,801
Yes, right.

71
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,387
You have to give it back.

72
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,431
Give what back?

73
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,245
If I knew you would throw it away,

74
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,247
I would have kept it.

75
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,582
I didn't throw it away.

76
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,085
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

77
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,884
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

78
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,886
In the castle.

79
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,974
Where do you live now?

80
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:50,644
In a barn.

81
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,104
So your parents are farmers, then?

82
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,274
My parents are dead.

83
00:05:58,652 --> 00:05:59,778
Mine, too.

84
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,867
We'll see each other again.

85
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:08,537
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.

86
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,163
It's not safe.

87
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,668
And if I made that choice,

88
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,753
if I came back, would you be here?

89
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,798
Perhaps.

90
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,302
- Ow!
- What's wrong?

91
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:25,595
Your ring.

92
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:27,889
Iron burns fairies.

93
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,391
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:38,483
I like your wings.

95
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:44,030
<i>Maleficent thought of
how Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

96
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,700
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

97
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,743
<i>so that their hands might touch again,</i>

98
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:52,581
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

99
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:54,499
<i>Thus did the young thief</i>

100
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,917
<i>who had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

101
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,002
Maleficent!

102
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,504
<i>...steal something far more precious.</i>

103
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,506
Maleficent?

104
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,552
Maleficent!

105
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,600
After all these weeks,

106
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,476
look who came back.

107
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,480
I thought it worth the risk.

108
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,400
So, what do you do for fun?

109
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:24,529
Whoa!

110
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:34,122
<i>Stefan and Maleficent
became the most unlikely of friends.</i>

111
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:36,958
<i>And for a time it seemed as if,</i>

112
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,376
<i>in them at least,</i>

113
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,797
<i>the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.</i>

114
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:47,886
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

115
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,312
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

116
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,773
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

117
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,736
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

118
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,824
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

119
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,495
<i>As the years passed,</i>

120
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:16,706
<i>Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

121
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,585
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

122
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:24,214
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

123
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,258
<i>rose to become
the protector of the Moors.</i>

124
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:17,058
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

125
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:20,145
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

126
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,023
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

127
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,235
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

128
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,028
<i>For the human king</i>

129
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:32,073
<i>had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

130
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:35,076
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

131
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,974
Guard, halt!

132
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,560
Guard, halt!

133
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,198
There they are,

134
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:18,119
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture

135
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:21,539
for fear of the magical
creatures that lurk within.

136
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,125
Well, I say crush them!

137
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,231
Go no further!

138
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,567
A king

139
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:53,279
does not take orders from a winged elf.

140
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,327
You are no king to me.

141
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,211
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

142
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,800
Advance!

143
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,432
Arise and stand with me!

144
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,773
Hold the line!

145
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,038
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

146
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,645
Charge!

147
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,913
You!

148
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,417
To the king!

149
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:20,134
You will not have the Moors!

150
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,345
Not now, nor ever!

151
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,514
You...

152
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:05,013
When I ascended to the throne,

153
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:09,225
I promised the people

154
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,520
one day we would take

155
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,940
the Moors and its treasures.

156
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,609
Each of you

157
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:23,031
swore allegiance to me

158
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,282
and to that cause.

159
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,290
Your Majesty.

160
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,795
Defeated in battle.

161
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,466
Is this to be my legacy?

162
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,636
I see you waiting for me to die.

163
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:49,557
It won't be long. But what then?

164
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,018
I will choose a successor

165
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,855
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.

166
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,608
Who among you

167
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,319
is worthy?

168
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,323
Kill the winged creature.

169
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,075
Avenge me,

170
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:11,329
and upon my death
you will take the crown.

171
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,525
Maleficent.

172
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,569
Maleficent!

173
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:54,205
So, how is life with the humans?

174
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,294
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

175
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,213
They mean to kill you.

176
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,758
King Henry will stop at nothing.

177
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,556
Please, you have to trust me.

178
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,687
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

179
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,522
<i>and the years faded away.</i>

180
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:25,319
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

181
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,157
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

182
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,369
- You thirsty?
- Mmm.

183
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:09,655
Maleficent?

184
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,542
What is this?

185
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,922
I have avenged you, sire.

186
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,760
She is vanquished?

187
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,639
Oh, you have done well, my son.

188
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,434
You have done what others feared to do.

189
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,604
You will be rewarded.

190
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:53,319
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,

191
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,613
Your Majesty.

192
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,038
I've got you!

193
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,503
- You wicked bird!
- Into a man.

194
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,506
It's a...

195
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:30,893
It's a demon!

196
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,159
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

197
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,203
Would you rather
I let them beat you to death?

198
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,414
I'm not certain.

199
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,083
Stop complaining.

200
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,418
I saved your life.

201
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,714
Forgive me.

202
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,758
What do I call you?

203
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,760
Diaval.

204
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,263
And in return for saving my life,

205
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,597
I am your servant.

206
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,141
Whatever you need.

207
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,727
Wings.

208
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,314
I need you to be my wings.

209
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,670
I present to you the first of his line,

210
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,549
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

211
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,743
He did this to me so he would be king.

212
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:32,598
Now what, Mistress?

213
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,763
Her wings!

214
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,062
It's a girl!

215
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,897
It's a girl! It's a girl!

216
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,380
Well?

217
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,258
Well, I saw nothing.

218
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,594
But there's been a, um...

219
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,262
What?

220
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,932
Child.

221
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,687
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

222
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:47,858
Oh.

223
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,694
There will be a christening.

224
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:53,197
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

225
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:59,661
A grand celebration for a baby.

226
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:03,540
How wonderful.

227
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,810
<i>All manner of folk
came to the christening,</i>

228
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:24,478
<i>even a trio of fairies</i>

229
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,147
<i>who sought to foster
peace and goodwill.</i>

230
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,191
Oh, look, there's the baby!

231
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:30,526
I love babies!

232
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,277
Can you just concentrate, please?

233
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:33,737
- Oh!
- I'm not telling you again.

234
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,997
Greetings, Your Majesty.

235
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,625
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.

236
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,585
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

237
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,380
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.

238
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,424
They bring gifts for our daughter.

239
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,719
These are not just any old gifts,

240
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,305
for, you see, we're magic!

241
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,349
And very good with children.

242
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,938
Very well.

243
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,945
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

244
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,031
the gift of beauty.

245
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,790
My wish is that you will never be blue,

246
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:30,794
only happy, all the days of your life.

247
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,093
Sweet baby,

248
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,555
my wish for you is that you find...

249
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:05,329
Maleficent!

250
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,592
Well, well.

251
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,059
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

252
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,522
Royalty,

253
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,692
nobility, the gentry,

254
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,860
and...

255
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,447
How quaint.

256
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,701
Even the rabble.

257
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,543
I must say

258
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:58,173
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

259
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,134
You're not welcome here.

260
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,390
Oh.

261
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,687
Oh, dear.

262
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,564
What an awkward situation.

263
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:16,400
You're not offended?

264
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,153
Why, no.

265
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:26,410
And to show I bear no ill will,

266
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:30,747
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

267
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,582
No! We don't want your gift!

268
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,088
Stay away from the princess!

269
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,173
Yes, stay away!

270
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:41,883
Oh!

271
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,093
Ow!

272
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,180
Hmm...

273
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:52,853
Mmm.

274
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:59,401
Listen well, all of you.

275
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,945
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

276
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,532
The princess shall indeed

277
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,285
grow in grace and beauty,

278
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,997
beloved by all who meet her.

279
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,041
That's a lovely gift.

280
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,463
Don't do this.

281
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:36,354
But

282
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:43,278
before the sun sets on her 16th birthday,

283
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,530
she will prick her finger

284
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,657
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

285
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,410
and fall into a sleep like death,

286
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:55,499
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.

287
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,086
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

288
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,298
I like you begging.

289
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,010
Do it again.

290
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,488
I beg you.

291
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,158
All right.

292
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:39,292
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

293
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:42,671
but only by

294
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,882
true love's kiss.

295
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,887
This curse will last till the end of time!

296
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,057
No power on Earth can change it.

297
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,575
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

298
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:14,369
<i>to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.</i>

299
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,414
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,</i>

300
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,332
<i>that they might never be used,</i>

301
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:23,378
<i>and thrown into the deepest
dungeon in the castle.</i>

302
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,465
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

303
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,217
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

304
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,095
<i>who would take her
to a remote hideaway</i>

305
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,265
<i>for 16 years and a day.</i>

306
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:43,190
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

307
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,693
<i>while his soldiers rode far and wide</i>

308
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:49,362
<i>to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

309
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,991
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

310
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,703
<i>that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch</i>

311
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,788
<i>of any human.</i>

312
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,668
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow</i>

313
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,962
<i>that her curse had brought.</i>

314
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,636
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

315
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,681
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug
little cottage in the woods.</i>

316
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,976
Oh, no! Is this it?

317
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,312
Looks dreadful.

318
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,147
Come on.

319
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:26,983
Oh, we need a smaller...

320
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,193
Ooh! Baby.

321
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,986
Or bigger bodies.

322
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,657
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

323
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,075
What do you mean?

324
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,077
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

325
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,120
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

326
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,958
So, gather around, ladies.

327
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,003
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

328
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,593
Oh, that's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

329
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,596
Now, there will be no questions asked.

330
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,681
We are no longer fairies.

331
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,015
We are three peasant women

332
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,767
raising our orphan child in the woods.

333
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,186
- Yes.
- So, uh, no more flying.

334
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,897
- No flying?
- No, no, and...

335
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,399
...no magic.

336
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:08,900
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

337
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,110
It's in the middle of nowhere.

338
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:12,696
At least
no one will find us here.

339
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:23,123
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

340
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,208
Come on. There you go.

341
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,600
Hmm.

342
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:47,355
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

343
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,492
I hate you. Beasty.

344
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,710
<i>The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.</i>

345
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,130
Why is she crying?

346
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,548
I think she might be hungry.

347
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,259
Then feed her!

348
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,762
Oh.

349
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,683
<i>Hungry baby</i>

350
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:29,314
There you are.

351
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,899
There you go.

352
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,991
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.

353
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,672
It tickles.

354
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,451
What?

355
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,869
You're cheating.

356
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,454
I saw that!

357
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,790
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

358
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,918
Greedy, bloated goat!

359
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,964
'Bloated goat.'

360
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,177
Stop doing that.

361
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,721
I'm not doing anything.

362
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,016
Well, someone is.

363
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,393
It's not me.

364
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:52,021
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

365
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,941
Stop it!

366
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,828
Why...

367
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,210
No! Oh!

368
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,004
This is all your fault!

369
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:21,176
Oh...

370
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,058
Oh, come on. That's funny.

371
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,647
<i>As the days went on,
Stefan darkened,</i>

372
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,942
<i>further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.</i>

373
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,778
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

374
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,447
Flame!

375
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,242
Release!

376
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,861
Run!

377
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,125
You failed me.

378
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:42,131
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

379
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,514
Nothing is indestructible!

380
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,766
Not the wall!

381
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,976
Not Maleficent!

382
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,811
Not even her curse!

383
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,290
Bring me the iron workers.

384
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,389
Ow!

385
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,560
- Ow!
- Ow!

386
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:40,940
You!

387
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,245
Oh, look.

388
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:57,624
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

389
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,734
What?

390
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,213
Hello.

391
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:58,184
Go away.

392
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,103
Go.

393
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:01,854
Go away.

394
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,275
I don't like children.

395
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:10,655
Up, up.

396
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,883
Mmm. Go along. Go, go, go.

397
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:45,106
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

398
00:42:45,565 --> 00:42:49,318
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

399
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:54,282
Pretty bird.

400
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:57,744
<i>Far away from the lofty palace</i>

401
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,996
<i>that she remembered not.</i>

402
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,836
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

403
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:09,088
<i>so did she.</i>

404
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:24,145
Hello.

405
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:26,147
That's it.

406
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:33,362
There you go.

407
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:36,073
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

408
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:44,665
<i>and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

409
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:54,342
Hmm.

410
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:56,928
Curious little beasty.

411
00:43:57,762 --> 00:44:01,098
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

412
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,935
Shh.

413
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:05,645
Look.

414
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:10,316
Is that her? Is that Maleficent?

415
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,026
I don't know.

416
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,156
Bring them to me.

417
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:23,412
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

418
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:49,188
Steady.

419
00:45:17,592 --> 00:45:19,135
It's her!

420
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:50,333
Whoa!

421
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,263
Hmm.

422
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:24,825
How could you do that to me?

423
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,036
You said anything I need.

424
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:28,329
Yeah, but not a dog.

425
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:30,539
It was a wolf, not a dog.

426
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:32,833
It's the same thing.

427
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:36,379
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

428
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:37,546
Fine.

429
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,757
Next time I'll turn you into a mealy worm.

430
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,884
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.

431
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:43,386
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

432
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:54,772
I wonder.

433
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,809
Wow.

434
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:37,917
I know you're there.

435
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:39,877
Don't be afraid.

436
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:44,840
I am not afraid.

437
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:47,676
Then come out.

438
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,471
Then you'll be afraid.

439
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,515
No, I won't.

440
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:10,783
I know who you are.

441
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:13,577
Do you?

442
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:17,873
You're my Fairy Godmother.

443
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:21,752
What?

444
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:23,838
Fairy Godmother.

445
00:49:24,213 --> 00:49:26,549
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

446
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:29,218
I've always known you were close by.

447
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:31,846
How?

448
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:35,933
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

449
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:39,061
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.

450
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:44,066
I remember you.

451
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:45,901
Pretty bird.

452
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:48,904
This is Diaval.

453
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,035
Hello, Aurora.

454
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,957
I have known you
since you were a little one.

455
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,550
It's everything I imagined it would be.

456
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,427
Oh, it's just so beautiful!

457
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,929
I've always wanted to come...

458
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:02,978
Good night, beasty.

459
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:17,076
You mock me.

460
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:20,412
I know what you're doing.

461
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:24,291
I know exactly what you're doing.

462
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,376
Sire?

463
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,128
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

464
00:51:28,796 --> 00:51:29,838
Leave me.

465
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,132
Sire, she is not well.

466
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:36,053
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.

467
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,513
Shh.

468
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:43,060
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

469
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:54,613
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

470
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:56,198
And on that day,

471
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:58,242
I will be ready.

472
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,717
They're so beautiful.

473
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,252
I revoke the curse.

474
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:35,798
Let it be no more.

475
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:39,551
I revoke the curse.

476
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:42,638
Let it be no more.

477
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,558
I revoke my curse!

478
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:49,561
Let it be no more!

479
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:52,022
I revoke my curse!

480
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,901
Let it be no more!

481
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,906
Let it be no more!

482
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:12,501
<i>This curse will last till the end of time.</i>

483
00:54:13,544 --> 00:54:16,171
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

484
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:40,571
Do all the Fair People have wings?

485
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:44,658
Most do.

486
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:46,910
Then why don't you?

487
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,997
All the other fairies fly.

488
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:54,626
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

489
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:56,795
That's all I wish to say about it.

490
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:59,298
What color were they?

491
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,383
Were they big?

492
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:08,056
So big they dragged behind me
when I walked.

493
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,768
And they were strong.

494
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:14,855
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

495
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:17,941
And they never faltered,

496
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,194
not even once.

497
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:22,154
I could trust them.

498
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:51,934
She's coming. She's coming.

499
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:57,940
Where are your workers?

500
00:55:58,482 --> 00:55:59,733
Uh...

501
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,360
In their beds, Majesty.

502
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:04,029
Get them back to work without delay.

503
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:05,906
They're exhausted, sire.

504
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:08,784
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.

505
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:12,788
I need them back to work now.

506
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:14,581
It's the wee hours.

507
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,086
Aye.

508
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:21,797
Aye.

509
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,508
It is the wee hours.

510
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:28,679
So wake them up.

511
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:30,639
Sire?

512
00:56:31,682 --> 00:56:32,891
So wake them up,

513
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:34,810
and get them back to work now!

514
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,063
We're running out of time! Go, now!

515
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:08,885
Aurora?

516
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:11,471
Come here.

517
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:22,274
Sit.

518
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:28,530
There's something I need to tell you.

519
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:30,490
What is it?

520
00:57:32,534 --> 00:57:35,203
There is an evil in this world,

521
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:38,540
and I cannot keep you from it.

522
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:42,252
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

523
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:44,087
I can take care of myself.

524
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,173
I understand.

525
00:57:48,884 --> 00:57:50,010
But that's not what I have to tell you.

526
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:51,094
I have a plan.

527
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:53,597
When I'm older,

528
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,224
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

529
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:58,935
Then we can look after each other.

530
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:07,736
You don't have to wait until you're older.

531
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:09,154
You could live here now.

532
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,907
Then I will.

533
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,618
I'll sleep in a tree

534
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:16,662
and eat berries and black nuts

535
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:19,414
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

536
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,752
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

537
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,297
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

538
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:31,677
Until tomorrow.

539
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:33,804
Oh, I'm so excited!

540
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,281
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

541
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:55,659
I need a life of my own.

542
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:58,870
No. I love you very much,

543
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,248
but it's time to say goodbye.

544
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,500
You've been very good to me,

545
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,503
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

546
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:12,676
Hello.

547
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,305
I'm sorry to bother you,

548
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:18,974
but I'm on my way to King Stefan's castle

549
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:21,935
and I've become hopelessly lost.

550
00:59:22,269 --> 00:59:24,187
- Can you help me?
- Oh!

551
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:26,940
Oh, I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

552
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:35,031
Forgive me.

553
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,828
It's that way.

554
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,500
The castle.

555
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,674
What's your name?

556
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,426
It's Philip.

557
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:57,554
Hello, Philip.

558
00:59:59,014 --> 01:00:00,307
What's yours?

559
01:00:01,558 --> 01:00:02,893
Aurora.

560
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,229
Hello, Aurora.

561
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:13,069
Well, it was nice meeting you.

562
01:00:13,153 --> 01:00:16,823
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

563
01:00:18,825 --> 01:00:20,035
You're forgiven.

564
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:21,787
That's good.

565
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,208
I'd best be off, then.

566
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:29,252
Goodbye.

567
01:00:40,764 --> 01:00:42,766
Will you be back this way?

568
01:00:44,518 --> 01:00:45,894
Nothing could stop me.

569
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:49,231
Then I'll see you soon.

570
01:00:50,065 --> 01:00:51,399
Very soon.

571
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,654
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

572
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:07,374
Stop doing that.

573
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:14,256
Well?

574
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,258
That boy's the answer.

575
01:01:18,218 --> 01:01:20,095
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

576
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,931
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

577
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,058
True love's kiss?

578
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:27,143
Have you not worked it out yet?

579
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:30,021
I cursed her that way

580
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:31,940
because there is no such thing.

581
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,402
Well, that might be how you feel,

582
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:37,612
but what about Aurora?

583
01:01:39,823 --> 01:01:41,741
That boy could be her only chance.

584
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:44,744
It's her fate, anyway.

585
01:01:46,955 --> 01:01:48,123
Go ahead.

586
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,709
Turn me into whatever you want.

587
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:51,918
A bird, a worm.

588
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:54,170
I don't care anymore.

589
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:03,096
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

590
01:02:04,306 --> 01:02:06,182
We are not leaving tomorrow.

591
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:08,393
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

592
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,437
And Stefan
told us to take her back

593
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,480
the day after her birthday.

594
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:15,817
No. He said on her birthday.

595
01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:18,278
No.
The day after her birthday.

596
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:19,946
- On.
- After.

597
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,240
- On.
- After.

598
01:02:22,908 --> 01:02:24,743
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

599
01:02:26,328 --> 01:02:27,996
Oh, stop it!

600
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:30,332
Oh!

601
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,002
What?

602
01:02:36,171 --> 01:02:37,505
How could you?

603
01:02:41,593 --> 01:02:43,678
I need to talk to you about something.

604
01:02:43,887 --> 01:02:44,971
Oh, yes, sweetie, what is it?

605
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,314
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

606
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:56,942
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

607
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,110
Oh. Oh, yes.

608
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:08,954
I'm leaving home.

609
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,043
See here, young lady.

610
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:19,214
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

611
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:20,882
with these two imbeciles...

612
01:03:20,966 --> 01:03:23,802
Shush! So that you could
ruin it on the last day.

613
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:26,304
We are taking you back
to your father with...

614
01:03:27,222 --> 01:03:28,556
My father?

615
01:03:30,392 --> 01:03:32,394
You told me my parents were dead.

616
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:38,191
I think you better come and sit down.

617
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,498
Fairy Godmother!

618
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,209
I'm here.

619
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:00,422
When were you going to
tell me that I'm cursed?

620
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,761
Is it true?

621
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:11,016
It is.

622
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:16,396
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

623
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:19,274
I... I can't remember her name.

624
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:21,526
They said

625
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:23,737
it was...

626
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,613
Maleficent.

627
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,626
Is that you?

628
01:04:42,714 --> 01:04:44,674
Are you Maleficent?

629
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:49,262
No!

630
01:04:49,888 --> 01:04:51,514
Don't touch me.

631
01:04:52,057 --> 01:04:53,725
You're the evil that's in the world.

632
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,436
It's you!

633
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:06,654
Find the boy!

634
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:27,425
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

635
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:29,511
There should be no guards at the gate.

636
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:30,678
I want her to walk right in.

637
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:32,347
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

638
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:36,559
We found this urchin at the gate.

639
01:05:37,185 --> 01:05:39,229
She claims to be the princess.

640
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,319
Father.

641
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,404
It's me, Aurora!

642
01:05:59,332 --> 01:06:01,626
You look just like your mother.

643
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:06,214
They brought you back a day too soon.

644
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:08,258
I told those three idiots!

645
01:06:08,716 --> 01:06:10,552
Lock her up in her room.

646
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:12,178
Go.

647
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:15,473
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.

648
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:19,185
It's so good to be small again!

649
01:06:19,853 --> 01:06:21,312
Look at my feet!

650
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:23,773
I love my tiny little feet!

651
01:06:24,107 --> 01:06:26,818
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,

652
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:29,737
or the king will have our heads!

653
01:06:58,683 --> 01:07:00,935
<i>Aurora.</i>

654
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:12,822
Wait!

655
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:16,784
Princess?

656
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:26,044
I'm looking for a girl.

657
01:07:26,586 --> 01:07:28,254
Of course you are.

658
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,469
I need a horse.

659
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:55,657
<i>...into a sleep like death.</i>

660
01:08:00,662 --> 01:08:02,497
<i>Aurora.</i>

661
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:07,210
Come on, Diaval!

662
01:08:19,931 --> 01:08:21,474
<i>Aurora.</i>

663
01:08:55,675 --> 01:08:57,343
Faster, Diaval, faster!

664
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:02,265
<i>She will prick her finger</i>

665
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:05,059
<i>on the spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

666
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:07,645
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

667
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:12,066
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

668
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:16,487
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

669
01:09:35,048 --> 01:09:36,299
It's done.

670
01:10:06,662 --> 01:10:08,289
They pulled the guards.

671
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:09,791
He's waiting for you in there.

672
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:13,336
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

673
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,133
Then don't come. It's not your fight.

674
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:23,137
Huh.

675
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:25,306
Thank you very much.

676
01:10:25,848 --> 01:10:27,683
'I need you, Diaval.

677
01:10:27,767 --> 01:10:29,894
'I can't do this without you, Diaval.'

678
01:10:31,062 --> 01:10:32,605
I can hear you.

679
01:10:40,863 --> 01:10:42,031
Look at her.

680
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:45,701
Look at what you've done.

681
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:49,372
She's only sleeping.

682
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:55,586
She's only sleeping, you say?

683
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:01,509
She's only sleeping.

684
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:04,470
She's only sleeping

685
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:06,514
forever!

686
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:09,725
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

687
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,857
True love does not exist.

688
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:18,734
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

689
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,833
Mistress.

690
01:12:34,602 --> 01:12:35,811
Hmm.

691
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:40,316
What are we going to do?

692
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:42,818
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

693
01:12:43,069 --> 01:12:44,946
But we don't even know where to start.

694
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,698
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.

695
01:12:59,794 --> 01:13:01,796
Pardon me.

696
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:04,340
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.

697
01:13:04,674 --> 01:13:06,842
In King Stefan's castle.

698
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:11,806
This is where I'm meant to be.

699
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:14,559
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.

700
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:15,643
Why have you come?

701
01:13:15,977 --> 01:13:17,562
My father sent me to see the King.

702
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:18,646
Who is your father?

703
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,189
King John of Ulstead.

704
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:22,650
A prince!

705
01:13:33,786 --> 01:13:35,162
Aurora.

706
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:38,165
He knows her.

707
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,210
Why is she sleeping?

708
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:43,671
She's trapped in an enchantment.

709
01:13:44,005 --> 01:13:46,173
Isn't she beautiful?

710
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:49,885
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

711
01:13:51,178 --> 01:13:53,014
Do you want to kiss her?

712
01:13:54,932 --> 01:13:55,933
Very much.

713
01:13:56,392 --> 01:13:57,727
Go on, then.

714
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,105
I wouldn't feel right about it.

715
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:02,857
I barely know her. We've only met once.

716
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:05,234
Haven't you ever
heard of love at first sight?

717
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:06,902
Kiss her!

718
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,362
Go on.

719
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:13,534
An enchantment, you say?

720
01:14:13,868 --> 01:14:15,036
Oh!

721
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,746
Kiss her!

722
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:10,633
You didn't do it properly!

723
01:15:10,925 --> 01:15:13,427
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

724
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:15,012
I was certain he was the one.

725
01:15:15,137 --> 01:15:16,138
What are you doing?

726
01:15:16,222 --> 01:15:17,682
We have to keep looking.

727
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:26,107
I told you.

728
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:53,342
I will not ask your forgiveness

729
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:57,972
because what I have
done to you is unforgivable.

730
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:02,059
I was so lost

731
01:16:03,102 --> 01:16:05,438
in hatred and revenge.

732
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:10,484
Sweet Aurora,

733
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:15,072
you stole what was left of my heart.

734
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,451
And now I have lost you forever.

735
01:16:30,171 --> 01:16:33,299
I swear, no harm will come to you

736
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:35,509
as long as I live.

737
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:38,846
And not a day shall pass

738
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,807
that I don't miss your smile.

739
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:12,880
Hello, Godmother.

740
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:20,221
Hello, beasty.

741
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:34,568
No truer love.

742
01:17:48,249 --> 01:17:49,708
She's here, sire.

743
01:18:04,098 --> 01:18:05,933
Are we going back to the Moors now?

744
01:18:08,269 --> 01:18:10,020
If that is what you wish.

745
01:18:37,089 --> 01:18:38,132
We've got her!

746
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:45,222
- Stop!
- Get back!

747
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:04,742
No!

748
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,001
Into a dragon.

749
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,528
To the other side.

750
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:52,498
Run, Aurora!

751
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:08,305
Get back! Hold it steady!

752
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:10,557
Pull to the left! Pull!

753
01:20:13,978 --> 01:20:15,312
Hold the line!

754
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:21,944
Look out. Hold your line.

755
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:33,265
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

756
01:21:54,787 --> 01:21:56,163
Hmm!

757
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:02,169
Enough!

758
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,635
How does it feel, hmm?

759
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:13,597
To be a fairy creature without wings

760
01:22:16,642 --> 01:22:19,269
in a world where you don't belong?

761
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:09,486
Kill her!

762
01:23:10,154 --> 01:23:11,280
Kill her!

763
01:23:16,285 --> 01:23:17,744
Shoot!

764
01:23:28,255 --> 01:23:29,339
Ahh!

765
01:23:42,895 --> 01:23:44,146
Ahh!

766
01:23:46,023 --> 01:23:47,232
Shoot her!

767
01:23:47,524 --> 01:23:48,609
Take aim!

768
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:52,589
It's over.

769
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:04,977
Ahh!

770
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:15,380
<i>Maleficent brought
down her wall of thorns</i>

771
01:26:15,505 --> 01:26:17,799
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

772
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:22,763
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

773
01:26:22,846 --> 01:26:26,433
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

774
01:26:26,516 --> 01:26:28,769
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

775
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:32,105
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

776
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:37,652
<i>But that was not all.</i>

777
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,416
Oh, there she is.
Hurry up. They're waiting.

778
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,251
Wait for me!

779
01:26:54,127 --> 01:26:56,296
We present
this crown to our little Aurora,

780
01:26:56,797 --> 01:26:59,800
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

781
01:27:00,384 --> 01:27:01,760
Never mind.

782
01:27:06,932 --> 01:27:10,018
Our kingdoms have been unified.

783
01:27:11,853 --> 01:27:13,730
You have your queen.

784
01:27:15,982 --> 01:27:20,070
<i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>

785
01:27:20,654 --> 01:27:22,239
<i>and I should know,</i>

786
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:26,827
<i>for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

787
01:28:00,193 --> 01:28:03,989
<i>In the end, my kingdom
was united not by a hero</i>

788
01:28:04,072 --> 01:28:07,242
<i>or a villain, as legend had predicted,</i>

789
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:11,371
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

790
01:28:12,414 --> 01:28:15,959
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>

791
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:55,290
<i>I know you</i>

792
01:28:55,373 --> 01:29:02,088
<i>I walked with you once upon a dream</i>

793
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:07,552
<i>I know you</i>

794
01:29:07,677 --> 01:29:14,643
<i>That look in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam</i>

795
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:19,189
<i>And I know it's true</i>

796
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:25,820
<i>That visions are seldom all they seem</i>

797
01:29:26,571 --> 01:29:29,783
<i>But if I know you</i>

798
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:33,036
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

799
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,081
<i>You'll love me at once</i>

800
01:29:36,164 --> 01:29:43,129
<i>The way you did once upon a dream</i>

801
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:05,694
<i>But if I know you</i>

802
01:30:05,777 --> 01:30:08,905
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

803
01:30:08,989 --> 01:30:11,950
<i>You'll love me at once</i>

804
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:18,999
<i>The way you did once upon a dream</i>

805
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:31,469
<i>I know you</i>

806
01:30:31,553 --> 01:30:38,018
<i>I walked with you once upon a dream</i>

807
01:30:39,519 --> 01:30:43,356
<i>I know you</i>

808
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:50,363
<i>That gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam</i>

809
01:30:50,614 --> 01:30:55,493
<i>And I know it's true</i>

810
01:30:55,577 --> 01:31:01,541
<i>That visions are seldom all they seem</i>

811
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:05,920
<i>But if I know you</i>

812
01:31:06,004 --> 01:31:09,341
<i>I know what you'll do</i>

813
01:31:09,424 --> 01:31:11,926
<i>You'll love me at once</i>

814
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:18,975
<i>The way you did once upon a dream</i>
