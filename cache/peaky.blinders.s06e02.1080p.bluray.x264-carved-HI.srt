he says some, erm,

He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

from the middle to the left
and the right.

You have friends in Dublin,

who are actively fighting
for a fascist Ireland,

303
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:16,801
and you are acting
on their behalf, ain't you?

304
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,121
When Jack Nelson
comes to London,

305
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:25,081
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

306
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,921
and to fascist sympathisers

307

on both sides of the divide.

309
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,161
Fascism is quite the thing...

310
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,921
...among the very best people.

311
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:43,041
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

312
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,841
And you think this will allow
us to ship our merchandise

313
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,561
to Boston?

314
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,361
Perhaps.

There may be other benefits
for your cause.

All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

317
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,961
and talk to him about
a new golden age,

318
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,681
and let him put a pin
in the map of Ireland

...are you going to help me
change the world?

332
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:03,201
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

Never is.

Is that a yes or a no?

My answer's yes.

(SNORTS)
The answer's always yes.

337

The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

back home -

the syringe was empty.

He's sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

We will pull Arthur
through this.

I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you!

I heard everything
you were saying in there.

Ada, this will be the end
of it, do you hear me?

This is the way out
for all of us,

I will be doing good.

No, along the way,

a lot of fucking money.

I always thought that opera

I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

reminds me of the crying out

in Parliament Square.

492
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,201
The argument went on
for quite a while, actually.

493
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,321
It went into the night,

494
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:22,401
as his little voice echoed
all around

495

the Houses of Parliament

496
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,561
as he got more and more angered

497
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,201
Oliver Cromwell
was reluctant somewhat

498
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:31,881
to answer
his legitimate questions,

499
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:35,881
so angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

500
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,201
the statue on the nose

501
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:41,681
and broke his fucking hand.

502
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:46,201
And there it is, you know,
the Irish question, innit?

(INHALES SHARPLY)

How come
you can remember so much

505
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:52,561
about what happened
200 years ago,

506
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:54,081
but you just can't remember

507
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,001
what fucking happened
last night?

Tomorrow.

519
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,761
I came to say goodbye.

520
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:53,761
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

521

Block your fucking ears,
if you have to.

522
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,161
I'll be with you, Michael.

523
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,401
I've been thinking about you.

Only you.

525
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:14,481
And don't worry
about Tommy Shelby.

526
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,641
I have no interest
in a dead man.

527

Well, you tell Jack to wait.

Tommy Shelby...

It will be you.

531

I know.

532
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,561
I told Jack.

533
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:39,281
And Jack said, "OK.

"Let the kid do it."

535

Mr Mosley's constituency
borders my own.

in the past.

himself.

Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight?

583
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,321
No. I am simply here
to remind my friend, Mr Mosley,

584
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:25,361
that the way of the British
people is compromise.

He said,
"Wear a black fucking shirt."

I've fucking let you down.

I've fucking said sorry
a million times

and I'll say it again.
I'm sorry, all right?

at the state of him.

- Oh, shut up.
- Get me a fucking drink.

Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

- This is my fault.
- Yeah.

involved in the opium trade?

- You voted no.
- I said no.

Remember? I overruled you.

In his big, beautiful
fucking house.

And they have parties there,
in Belgravia.

Yeah?
And what do you give them?

- What the fuck?
- Rag and bone.

646
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,161
You fucking slapped me.

647
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,681
You slapped me.

648
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:59,881
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

649
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,161
Unresolved.
Unresolved in everything.

650
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,641
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade,

00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,081
If anyone takes my picture
in this,

655
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:17,321
they'll find their fucking
camera under my heel, Tom.

656
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,321
They are throwing petrol bombs
out there, Tommy.

657
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,241
I thought Ada was
taking care of you.

658
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,921
Ada's got decisions to make
about working with us.

659
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,961
She doesn't know
what she wants.

660
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,801
I'll speak to Ada.

661
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,721
Listen, I'm going home,
all right?

662
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,161
No, you stay there.

663
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,081
I have something for you.

664
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,521
Lizzie, you can go in
with Johnny.

665
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:36,041
Johnny, take Lizzie
to her seat.

666
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:37,721
But I don't have an invitation,
Tom.

667
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,457
Johnny, you're wearing
a fucking black shirt,

668
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:41,801
you can do what you like.
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

669
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,401
Go on, Dogs.

670
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,841
And get me a fucking drink
while you're there.

(ARTHUR GROANS)

672
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,241
I know, Tom. Look at me.

673
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:57,761
Arthur, before I went
to America,

674
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,281
I wrote a letter.

675
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,921
Yeah? Who to?

676
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,521
To Linda.

677
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,281
And in that letter, I wrote,

678
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:11,041
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

679
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,241
"do you believe
in forgiveness?"

680
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,241
And this is what I got back.

681
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:20,481
Two days ago. Have a look.

682

(FALTERING)
"As a Christian woman,

683

"I do believe in forgiveness."

684
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,521
Yeah, and the word <i>do</i>
is underlined.

685
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:42,841
Arthur, I'm no Christian.

686
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,161
But I also believe
in forgiveness.

687
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:50,401
So, get yourself clean,

688
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,961
stay clean for two weeks,

689
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,121
I'll write Linda
another letter.

690
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,161
Cos I know where she is.

691
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,521
First, I need you back.

692
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,281
I need my brother.

693
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:10,441
I have a lot to do.

694
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:12,721
Need someone
to do the real work.

695
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,441
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

696
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,441
Yeah. Look at your smile, Tom.

697
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,441
Look at your smile, brother.

698
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,721
It's been so long.

Come on. Let's see what this
bastard has to say. Come on.

- All right. All right.
- Come on.

Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

Oswald's most recent
and last-ever mistress.

739

This is my wife, Lizzie Shelby.

Beautiful earrings.

741
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,081
TOMMY: Oh, I stole them
from Tiffany's.

742
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:08,641
Actually, he bought
the earrings in Paris.

743
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,481
We were in Paris
on our honeymoon.

- God, I hate Paris.
- Hmm.

745

I hear you prefer Berlin.

Oswald and I are going to marry
there, aren't we, Oswald?

Hmm.

748
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,241
Mosley, I have business
to discuss.

749
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:23,801
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

750
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:27,681
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

751
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:30,001
that we men go off
and discuss business

752
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,361
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

(CHUCKLES) Goodness.

754
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,481
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

755
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:41,401
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

756
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,681
But, Mr Shelby,
if it's business,

757
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,161
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

758
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:48,201
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

759
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:51,401
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

760
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:52,921
I will join the meeting
as well.

But of course, you <i>must</i> come
as well, Elizabeth.

762
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,441
By the way,
I really don't like "Lizzie".

763
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,721
I prefer liberated "Elizabeth".

764
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:01,401
She must be part of this.

765
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,001
She's been
all the way to Paris,

766
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:04,761
so she is a woman of the world.
Bravo.

767
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:08,121
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you...

768
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:21,761
Only three...

769
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,681
...because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

770
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,561
Our friend in Berlin
doesn't either.

771
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:29,401
Well, they have <i>that</i> in common,
at least.

772
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,841
Oh, I imagine
they have lots in common.

773
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,121
Hmm.

774
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:36,321

775
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,561

Jack Nelson is in London

776
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,121
to buy import licences.

777
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,121
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

778
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,361
Well, as you can see
from this private letter...

779
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:54,601
...he is far
from a neutral point of view.

780
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,321
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

"Individually Jews are fine,
but as a race they stink."

Hmm.

783
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:09,481
Elizabeth, do you even know
why the bridge

784
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:11,961
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

785
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,561
Actually, no.

786
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,841
I don't really know much
about this business at all.

00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:29,121
so I know lots of things
about him.

790

Tommy, I'll be outside.

791
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:36,521

(TOMMY CLEARS HIS THROAT)

Do you people want
to meet Nelson or no?

794
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,521
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

795
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,081
If you like.

796
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,561
Of course we would.

And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

798

But, Mr Shelby,

799
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:58,201
before this <i>enterprise</i>
goes any further,

800
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,281
you really must do
something about your wife.

801
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,241
Mr Shelby.

802
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,641
Yes.

803
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:34,041
Mr Nelson.

804
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,521
I came early.

805
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,121
I wanted to come
and take a look

You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

808
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,721
I hoped that by suggesting
we meet in church,

809
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:51,081
it might make us both
more... cautious

Well, your hope
would be forlorn.

There ain't no-one listening
here.

813

You don't believe in God?

No.

00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,641
It was the way Catholics
were treated in my country

816
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,561
that made me angry.

817
00:47:10,881 --> 00:47:12,521
Made me what I became.

818
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,281
What made you angry?

819
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:24,121
Slowness... in anything.

820
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:28,801
I wanted to have everything
already.

821
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:34,841
Two working-class
Catholic boys.

822
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,041
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

823
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,241
Some man in the shadows.

824
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:47,121
I carried a screwdriver
and a blade,

825
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:50,841
and everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

826
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,521
And do you?

827
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,441
Yes, I do.

828
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,601
First man I killed
was a priest.

829
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:02,761
You?

830
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:05,921
A Prussian boy with green eyes.

831
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,001
He was already underground.

832
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,681
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

833
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:16,641
Four years ago.

834
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:20,961
His name was Thomas Shelby.

835
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:23,881
He drank whiskey.

836
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:30,641
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

837
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,321
and deal narcotics
that'll kill people?

838
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,041
You deal in whiskey, Mr Nelson.

839
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:44,561
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

840
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,241
which said that whiskey
disproportionately kills

841
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:50,041
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

842
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:53,401
whereas opium is the sedative

843
00:48:53,521 --> 00:48:57,401
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

844
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,241
In return,
there are people in England

845
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:03,561
who you think I should meet?

846
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:05,161
Yes.

847
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,601
Yes, like minds.

848
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:13,561
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

849
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:17,001
The booze
of the blue blood elite.

850
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:23,201
In America, we... we like
labels and aspiration.

851
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:27,681
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

852
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:29,761
You can add that
to your portfolio.

853
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:34,161
I hear Shelby labels are
favoured by the working class.

854
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:37,201
Indeed.
A fact of which I'm very proud.

855
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:40,681
They say you are a poet, too.

856
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:43,761
No, I only read it.

857
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:49,001
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

858
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:53,721
Fascists.

859
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:56,401
Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

860
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:58,481
The ones in tuxedos.

861
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:02,001
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

862
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:05,681
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

863
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:07,721
For many years now,

864
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:09,817
I have been working closely
with Winston Churchill,

865
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,601
in many different capacities.

866
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:13,921
I have his trust.

867
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,321
He's opposed
to the rise of fascism.

868
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:19,561
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

869
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,241
Well, I can give you
men of influence

870
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:25,161
who support your cause.

871
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:27,481
I can also offer you
a full report

872
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:29,841
on Churchill's strategies.

873
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:36,241
All this in return for access
to South Boston?

874
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:37,881
Alternatively,

875
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,081
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

876
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:42,881
without my intelligence,

877
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,521
and I can sell my opium
to the Jews.

878
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:52,921
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

879
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:57,321
A war hero, I hear.

880
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:59,681
Every war hero I ever met,

881
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,361
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

884
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,961
I'll think a great deal
about what you've said.

What are you doing, love?

891
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:09,601
I can hear voices...

892

...coming from up the chimney.

893
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:17,161
What voices?

894
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,721
The grey man.

898
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,761
Mr Speaker.
I was raised in a family

899
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:36,681
that endured living conditions
that would test

900
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:39,721
the morality of
even the most virtuous.

901
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:41,001
Indeed...

902
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:44,561
Indeed, even the best of us
would have our virtues trounced

903
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:47,041
and thwarted by life
in the meanness

904
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:50,121
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

905
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:52,841
What would you know
about virtue?

906
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,921
(SHOUTING)

Quickly, please.

908
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:06,081
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

909
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:08,841
a bill which will offer
radical reform

910
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,681
in housing policy
in this country,

911
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:13,721
in which slums are cleared,

912
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:15,921
new houses are built

913
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,361

in health and hygiene.
