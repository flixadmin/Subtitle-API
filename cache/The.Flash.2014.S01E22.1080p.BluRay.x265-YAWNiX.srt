1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,632
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,854
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,159
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,994
The Man in the Yellow, he took Eddie.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,747
Hi, Barry. Or should I say the Flash?

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,124
Observe, Barry marries Iris...

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,459
and not you.

14
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,461
- I've been having dreams.
- What happens?

15
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,338
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash...

16
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,714
and he kills me.

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,594
If this is Dr. Wells, then who
have we been working for this whole time?

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,805
A completely different person.

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,056
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,102
I don't wanna kill you, Barry. I need you.
We will face each other again.

21
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,979
Very soon.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,110
I want you to take a moment...

23
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,990
and think about all the things
that define your life.

24
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,244
All the people you love.

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,830
Your job...

26
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,374
your coworkers...

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,085
your home.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,884
And now imagine if, one day, in a flash...

29
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,221
all of that vanished.

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,147
Would you simply accept your new life
and continue on...

31
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,485
or would you do whatever it takes...

32
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,660
to get back what was taken from you?

33
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:04,124
Because I can assure you...

34
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:09,546
I will get everything that was taken...

35
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,674
from me.

36
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,777
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,697
What's all this?

38
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,116
Return labels for Eddie and me.

39
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,371
I ordered 200 to start,
but this afternoon, 2000 arrived.

40
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,206
I guess I ordered wrong.

41
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,918
I have so many now.

42
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,589
Iris, we're gonna find Eddie.

43
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,882
How?

44
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,677
You've searched everywhere.
More than once.

45
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,012
And you haven't found anything.

46
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

47
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,814
It's just...

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,399
You miss him, right?

49
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,568
Yeah, I do.

50
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,116
Look.

51
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,747
Wells took my mom from me.

52
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,627
I won't let him take someone from you too.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,885
It's Cisco. I gotta go.

54
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,554
Yeah, go.

55
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,146
I kept asking myself...

56
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,816
why would Wells pretend
to need a wheelchair?

57
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,068
- Sympathy.
- That's what I thought at first.

58
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,363
He's the Man in Yellow, the Reverse-Flash.
He's much smarter than that.

59
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,282
Sympathy can't be the only reason.

60
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,993
Misdirect.
Like everything else Wells has done.

61
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,079
I mean, the last person we'd suspect
to be the Man in Yellow...

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,332
- Is someone who lost the use of their legs.
- Exactly right, Joe.

63
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,335
Which is why I started messing around
with the wheelchair.

64
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,089
And that's when I found this.

65
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,845
Damn. You can't get that at RadioShack.

66
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,265
It looks like the tech inside Gideon.

67
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,144
I measured the output, and this
thing is kicking off serious juice.

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,105
I mean, we're talking enough
to power all of Central City.

69
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,191
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,027
What do you think Wells was using it for?

71
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,363
I think this thing is some kind of battery.

72
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,701
- Battery?
- As in Wells was using it to power himself.

73
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,369
To gain more speed.

74
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,581
And that's why he's so
much faster than you.

75
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,175
The accelerator, it's been reactivated.

76
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,636
- It can't be.
- How is that possible? It blew up.

77
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,972
It had to have been rebuilt.

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,224
Wells.

79
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,436
Even if he did rebuild it, how did
Dr. Wells turn the particle accelerator on?

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,313
He's here.

81
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,150
That's why we couldn't find him. He's
been inside S.T.A.R. Labs the whole time.

82
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,029
Stay here.

83
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,009
Cisco, what'd you bring
that orange soda for?

84
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,888
Whenever something happens with the
Reverse-Flash, liquid floats in the air.

85
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,682
You know, Barry's fish tank...

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,100
Wells's champagne...

87
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,893
Lance's coffee. Remember that?

88
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,523
If this does the same thing,
we'll know that Wells is in there.

89
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,110
Do it.

90
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,419
Man.

91
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,131
This is big.

92
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,637
Oh, God.

93
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,055
Guys.

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,602
Barry!

95
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,147
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do we do now?

96
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,525
Prisoner release protocol initiated.

97
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,360
Oh, no, no, no.

98
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,957
No!

99
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,755
Peekaboo.

100
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,515
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be stuck in that box?

101
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,942
Now you're the one
who's gonna go into a box.

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,027
In the ground.

103
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,051
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

104
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I will be...

105
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,690
thanks to Iris.

106
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,983
I'm glad you showed up.

107
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,568
How do you think she got out of there?

108
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,154
- Wells must have released her.
- Help!

109
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,532
Wait a sec. Did you hear that?

110
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,452
I checked all the containment cells.
Everyone's accounted for.

111
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,413
No, no. Listen.

112
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,373
Help!

113
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,292
Down here!

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,670
Help.

115
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,300
Eddie?

116
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,845
Oh, partner.

117
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,432
Oh, my God. I got you.

118
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,520
Oh, my God. Eddie.

119
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,772
- You okay?
- Let's get him out of here.

120
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,441
Come on.

121
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,317
Come on.

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,948
There you go. Go slow.

123
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,783
Go slow.

124
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,563
Your vitals are normal,
but you're just a little dehydrated.

125
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,942
The IV should help with that, but
drink some fluids and stay off your feet.

126
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,569
- Okay, Eddie?
- Thanks, Caitlin.

127
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,447
Wells got away.

128
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,074
Ahh. He was too fast.

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,034
He's always too fast.

130
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,120
- Eddie.
- We found him under that hatch in the pipeline.

131
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,582
I'm so sorry.
I thought I looked everywhere for you.

132
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,627
It's not your fault.
Sometimes you just can't see the clues...

133
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,796
even if they're right in front of you.

134
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,926
Um, well, you know, all that's
important is that we're all safe...

135
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,969
and back together, right?

136
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,555
Eddie, why'd he take you?

137
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,641
I don't know.

138
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,685
He said that we're family.

139
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,107
Said his real name is Eobard Thawne.

140
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,112
Eobard Thawne. It's just like in my dream.

141
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,531
Did he say anything else?

142
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,660
I mean, anything that could help us
figure out what he's really after?

143
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,705
He didn't say much.
Just kept working on some tube.

144
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,791
A tube? What did it look like?

145
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,837
Metallic and futuristic.
He said it was the key...

146
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,048
to him getting back
everything that was taken from him.

147
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,968
The key? I don't understand. What...?

148
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,513
I don't know. Look, I just wanna go home.

149
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,100
- Is that okay?
- Yes. Of course.

150
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,894
I'll make sure he gets some rest.

151
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,396
Okay.

152
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,195
What do you think Wells was talking about?
I mean...

153
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,121
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What?

154
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,957
What now?

155
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,960
Um, are you seeing this?

156
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,212
That's the tube Eddie was talking about.

157
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,841
It's some sort of power source.
That's what's charging up the accelerator.

158
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,134
Can you shut it down?

159
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,721
Do you see a power button
anywhere on this thing?

160
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,307
Dude, this thing is from the future.

161
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,102
It's beyond me.
I press or touch or cut the wrong thing...

162
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,979
I could bring the building down.

163
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,440
Okay, how long until it's fully functional?

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,027
Best I can tell, 36 hours.

165
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,362
That's when Wells will be back.

166
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,324
Why would Wells want
the particle accelerator to work again?

167
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,785
I don't know. It's not like it
was a success the first time.

168
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,873
- It made me the Flash.
- That's not all it did.

169
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,418
So, what happens
if the particle accelerator turns on...

170
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
while the metahumans are in containment?

171
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,963
They're toast.

172
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,091
We put them there. Now their
lives are in danger because of us.

173
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,678
Look, I think you all know I've never been
a fan of this arrangement here.

174
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,016
I thought the whole plan
was to rehabilitate them and set them free.

175
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,727
It was. We've been a little busy.

176
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,190
Well, if they stay in there, they die. And
if we let them go, they destroy the city.

177
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,318
- We're gonna have to move them.
- Move them where?

178
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,112
- Iron Heights can't handle metahumans.
- You're right.

179
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,530
But Lian Yu can.

180
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,492
What the hell's a Lian Yu?

181
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,536
Lian Yu's the island where Oliver
was stranded for five years.

182
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,914
A.R.G.U.S. built a
covert military prison on it.

183
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
It's where we sent Captain Boomerang.

184
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,253
Oliver keeps his worst criminals there.
They won't be able to escape.

185
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,421
More importantly, they won't hurt anybody.

186
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,839
Great.

187
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,176
So we ship them
from one illegal black site to another.

188
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,263
Yeah, I guess so. Yes.

189
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,350
How do we move them
to Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

190
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,310
I'll call him. Maybe he can help.

191
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,356
And, Cisco, if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

192
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,192
I might have a way
of getting them out safely.

193
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,860
All right, get on it.

194
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,196
Bar, this is insane.

195
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,614
Joe, we have to do this.

196
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,660
You don't think that if we start bussing
supervillains through downtown...

197
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,036
nobody's gonna notice?

198
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh, they'll notice.
That's where you'll come in.

199
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh.

200
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,421
Cecile.

201
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,716
Aw. Mwah. How's my favorite DA?

202
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,469
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

203
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,144
Hey. So, what can I do for you?
You sounded a little cryptic on the phone.

204
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,647
Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something.

205
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,026
These people with powers?
The metahumans?

206
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,154
Is that what they're calling them?
People love their labels.

207
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:47,076
Yeah. So let's say, hypothetically,
I know a prison, of sorts.

208
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,746
A place that can do
what Iron Heights can't...

209
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,623
where these metahumans, the bad ones...

210
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,251
are being locked up.

211
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,754
I'd be very concerned.

212
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,841
Especially if, hypothetically,
you had anything to do with it.

213
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,719
Why are you asking me about this?

214
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon...

215
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,392
and you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

216
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,563
Okay, what are you asking me to do?

217
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,108
I need to clear a route through the city.

218
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,237
- Barricades, police cars. The works.
- What am I to tell people? President's in town?

219
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,699
- I don't know. You think they'll believe you?
- No, Joe. They wouldn't.

220
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,204
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

221
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,206
Joe, those are very bad things.

222
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,085
These are some bad people, Cecile.

223
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,128
But their lives are in danger.

224
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,757
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

225
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:50,056
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

226
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,768
I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

227
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:08,282
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to Lian Yu.

228
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,661
- We need to get them to Ferris Airfield.
- Oliver Queen came through.

229
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,956
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in Nanda Parbat.

230
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,417
- What?
- Wherever that is. I don't know.

231
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,419
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

232
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,796
She's gonna hook us up.

233
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,215
So, what about C.C.P.D.
giving us an escort?

234
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,427
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the DA.

235
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,095
She was very clear.

236
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,432
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

237
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,809
We are protecting people.

238
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,772
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop. There's
a certain set of rules I need to follow.

239
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,483
And this year, I broke all of them.
Lying to my boss...

240
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,861
- I know.
- Ignoring the law.

241
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,364
At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

242
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,032
- We are way different.
- How?

243
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,785
We only break the rules to help people.

244
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,838
Give me another one.

245
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,756
Ice cold.

246
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,765
Well, well, well.

247
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,144
If it isn't the Scarlet Speedster.

248
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,438
We need to talk.

249
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,448
You want anything? Beer? Food?

250
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,409
Pickled eggs here are fantastic.

251
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,287
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

252
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:40,750
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

253
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,084
What do you need?

254
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,587
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

255
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,838
How many?

256
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,882
Five.

257
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,261
Five very bad, very angry people...

258
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,930
who have powers.

259
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,140
Powers, hmm?

260
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,768
So you want me to, what,
freeze the problem?

261
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,604
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

262
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,151
First rule of business,
always protect yourself.

263
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm not gonna help
usher your enemies out of town.

264
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,448
They're not just my enemies.
They're yours too.

265
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,075
I doubt it.

266
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,372
They will destroy Central City.

267
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,374
It's not my problem.

268
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,668
You said you love it
here. That this is home.

269
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,211
I do, and it is.

270
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,796
Well, guess what.

271
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,633
These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

272
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,554
You won't be able to rob anyone
if everybody's dead.

273
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,684
It's a compelling argument.

274
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,645
If I'm gonna help you out...

275
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,567
I'll need something in return.

276
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,986
- Like what?
- This.

277
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,077
No. This is impossible. I can't do that.

278
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,621
- Then I can't help you.
- There has to...

279
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,875
Snart, there has to be something you want
that I can get.

280
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,297
Let me think about it.

281
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,967
You're as cold as ice, I know.

282
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,011
You're as cold as ice.

283
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,225
Eddie.

284
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,311
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

285
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,521
Here, work.

286
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,191
You were kidnapped for two weeks, and
your first thought is to go back to work?

287
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,028
I just needed something
constant in my life.

288
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,404
I thought that was us.

289
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,865
Eddie, I miss you.

290
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,367
I love you. Hey.

291
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,622
I saw this when we found you.

292
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,208
This was for me, wasn't it?
When you took me to the waterfront...

293
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,337
and Dr. Wells abducted you,
you were going to propose.

294
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,505
I was.

295
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,257
But now you're not?

296
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,719
What did he do to you?

297
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,391
He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

298
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,561
What could he have shown you
that would make you change your mind?

299
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,229
The future.

300
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,191
He showed me the future, Iris.

301
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,942
We don't get married.

302
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,236
You and Barry do.

303
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,781
I gotta go.

304
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,249
Are you out of your mind? What do you mean
you talked to Leonard Snart?

305
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,501
I asked him for help.

306
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,544
Why would you do something so stupid?

307
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,089
Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.

308
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,593
Look, you tried the C.C.P.D. I tried
Oliver. I even tried Ronnie and Dr. Stein.

309
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,554
- The particle accelerator goes online in...
- Sixteen hours.

310
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,098
16 hours, Joe.

311
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,227
I'm not willing to let the metas die,
and we can't let them escape either.

312
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,854
So like it or not, Snart,
with his cold-gun...

313
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,942
Is the only one that can stop them
if Cisco's transportation does not hold.

314
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,779
Then lucky for you,
I figured out what it is you can get me.

315
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,115
Hello, detective. Nice to see you again.

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,117
Caitlin, Cisco.

317
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,869
I thought about your proposal.

318
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,454
You want my help...

319
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,790
this is what I want.

320
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,042
My fingerprints, dental records...

321
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,795
DNA, criminal records, family tree.

322
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:18,092
Everything there is in this world
concerning Leonard Snart...

323
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,219
I want it destroyed.

324
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,512
All of it.

325
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,683
At C.C.P.D., online, everywhere.

326
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,309
The brass on this dude.

327
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,146
You really think we'd do that for you?

328
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,481
I'll do it.

329
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,734
If it's the only way, fine.

330
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,653
You and me need to talk right now.

331
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,664
What is wrong with you? You can't
just erase Snart's criminal records.

332
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,041
Yeah, I can. And I'll do
whatever I have to do.

333
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,794
- Bar, there's gotta be a different way.
- What is it?

334
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,173
Tell me what it is, and we'll do it.
We're running out of time!

335
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,259
What is going on with you?

336
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,346
You working with that killer?
This isn't who you are.

337
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,226
Who I am is the guy
who's not fast enough to stop Wells.

338
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,354
He hasn't been one step ahead of us, Joe.
He's been a thousand.

339
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,315
I can't catch him. I can't beat him.

340
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,193
What I can do
is save those people down there.

341
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,195
Wells turned them into what they are...

342
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,407
and I'm pretty sure he does not care
if they live or die. I do.

343
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,551
Bye-bye, Leonard Snart.

344
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,560
I've deleted everything the C.C.P.D.,
A.R.G.U.S. and the FBI had on you...

345
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,272
and sent a virus to erase
every digital record of you online.

346
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:00,110
And this is every single piece
of physical evidence the police had.

347
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,445
Good.

348
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,996
I hear we're all going
to be working together.

349
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,666
That's right, sis.

350
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,334
Partners.

351
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,302
- Please tell me this is a joke.
- Oh.

352
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,264
You were right, Lenny. She is very uptight.

353
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,224
I am not uptight.

354
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,353
You can't call me uptight.

355
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,315
Look, guys...

356
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,901
we need their help
if we're gonna pull this off.

357
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,612
Why are you wearing your mask?
Snart knows who you are.

358
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,533
And I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
That includes my sister.

359
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,618
- Jerk.
- Train wreck.

360
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,791
Don't look so surprised, detective.
I am a man of my word.

361
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,211
Yeah, you better be, or I'll make sure
you're on that damn plane too.

362
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,468
Hey, Cisco.

363
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,806
Oh, hey, Captain Cold's evil sister.

364
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,351
Oh. You're not still mad at me, are you?

365
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,478
I really did enjoy kissing you.

366
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,939
You kissed her?

367
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,483
Under duress. Calm down.

368
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,278
You know, I've thought a lot about you.

369
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,447
Have you really?

370
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,660
Well, stop.

371
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,539
Because this right here...

372
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,750
it ain't gonna happen.

373
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,502
A girl can hope.

374
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,677
Really not enjoying
being one of the good guys this week.

375
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,638
- Really not.
- Hey, dude.

376
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,891
Have you figured out a way
to get the metahumans to the airport?

377
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,851
I have, actually.

378
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,227
And it's pretty dope.

379
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,731
This is cool. Where'd you get this?

380
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,152
My uncle owns it. His company hauls
frozen food cross-country.

381
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,031
Okay, so I retrofitted the cooling system
with the wheelchair's power source...

382
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,200
to create an energy damper.

383
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,410
Which means what, exactly?

384
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,664
The back of this rig is being flooded
with so much power...

385
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,876
it's creating a transient pulse strong
enough to disrupt the metahumans' powers.

386
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,755
We can get them to the airport and
on the plane without them getting fresh.

387
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,426
We need somebody with a Class A
Commercial Driver's License to drive this.

388
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
I can drive it.

389
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,182
What? I have a Class A CDL.

390
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,017
- You do?
- We can't all be doctors.

391
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:41,146
All right, well, let's do this.
Plane's gonna be here in two hours.

392
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,232
Hey! What the hell?

393
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,402
Hey! Hey!

394
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,246
It's done. They're all unconscious.

395
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,129
- The dampers are fully functional.
- All right.

396
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,799
I'll make sure the roads are clear.
Do not stop for anything.

397
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,300
Let's move out.

398
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,094
After you.

399
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,954
- We got traffic up ahead.
- I'm on it.

400
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,377
How's our cargo doing?

401
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,796
All quiet so far.

402
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,937
Don't bother.

403
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,815
Your powers don't work in here.
None of ours do.

404
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,359
- What the hell is going on?
- They're moving us.

405
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,072
- Where?
- Funny, I didn't get an itinerary.

406
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,659
Hey, tall, dark and handsome,
I said your powers are off-line.

407
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,329
All brawn, no brains.

408
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,082
I know you, don't I?

409
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,374
Kyle Nimbus.

410
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,086
Used to be a member
of the Darbinyan Crime Family.

411
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,631
- That's right.
- Weren't you executed about a year ago?

412
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,007
- It didn't take.
- Huh.

413
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:35,010
Darbinyans weren't known
for hiring the best and brightest.

414
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,512
You couldn't even die right.

415
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,350
So you're so stupid-mad right now, Mardon,
you're just gonna pick a fight with anyone?

416
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,770
- Guess so.
- If I had my powers right now...

417
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,065
I would gas you all out of existence.

418
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,527
And then you'd be standing in a container
with four corpses.

419
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,487
What would that get you?

420
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:54,822
Peace and quiet.

421
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,080
I don't know about you guys, but I don't need
my powers to fill this rig full of bodies.

422
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,999
Come on.

423
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,054
- What was that?
- Wherever they're taking us...

424
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,681
we're here.

425
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,563
Ferris Air?
I thought this place got shut down.

426
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,440
It did. One of their
test pilots disappeared.

427
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,609
Where's the plane? I want this over with.

428
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,069
Should be here any minute.

429
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,074
- Look, Joe, I know you don't agree with this...
- Save it, Bar. I just wanna get it done.

430
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,244
How come you haven't given me
a code name?

431
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,291
I heard you came up with Captain Cold.
What do you think I should be called?

432
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,585
Female inmate?

433
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,253
Come on.

434
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,632
You made my gun. Least you
can do is give me a bad-ass alias.

435
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,927
Please?

436
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,679
Fine.

437
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,600
Golden Glider.

438
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,478
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

439
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,860
Your A.R.G.U.S. friends aren't very prompt.

440
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,280
Maybe that's why they've never
been able to catch me.

441
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,907
Oh. There it is.

442
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,288
Turning on each other won't solve anything.

443
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,834
- Don't ever touch me.
- Wait.

444
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,587
Look.

445
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,554
Whoops.

446
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,225
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

447
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,477
That's not good.

448
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:52,981
Guys.

449
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,150
Guys, we have a problem.

450
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,820
The damper's fluctuating.
The rig's losing power. I don't know why.

451
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,697
- Can you do something?
- I'm trying.

452
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,743
Oh, God.

453
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,956
Mardon.

454
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,802
Trip's canceled!

455
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,765
Take your last breath.

456
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,411
I'm out of here.

457
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,131
Caitlin, get down.

458
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,889
You locked Ronnie in the pipeline
and you killed Ronnie!

459
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,766
- Caitlin!
- He killed Ronnie!

460
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,810
- What are you doing?
- He killed Ronnie!

461
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,251
Finish him, Simmons.

462
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,766
How about we call tonight a tie?

463
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,313
I'd power down if you don't want me
to melt your face.

464
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,774
Let's all go our separate ways.

465
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,693
My name is Leonard Snart.

466
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,821
- I know who you are.
- Always pleased to meet a fan.

467
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,617
Just remember who it was made sure
you didn't get thrown on that plane...

468
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,410
bound for nowhere.

469
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,746
You're just letting us go?

470
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,165
Why'd you shoot that guy?

471
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,459
He owed me money.

472
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,587
Hmm.

473
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,672
What? You want a thank-you?

474
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,591
Who doesn't like a thank-you?

475
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,053
Thank you.

476
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,640
You are so very welcome.

477
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,034
You sabotaged the truck, didn't you?

478
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,122
Why did you let them escape?

479
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,624
Because now they all owe me.

480
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,628
And something tells me they'll be a lot
more use to me as part of my Rogues...

481
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,464
than rotting away in
the North China Sea.

482
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,466
You gave me your word.

483
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:12,514
Heh, heh. It's true, I did. But here's
the thing: I'm a criminal and a liar.

484
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,851
And I hurt people and I rob them.

485
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,603
What did you expect me to do?
Not be what I am?

486
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,149
I saw an opportunity
to turn things to my advantage...

487
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:26,611
and I did.
Who you're really mad at is yourself.

488
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,698
This is on you, Barry.

489
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,742
Then why don't you just kill me?

490
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,914
Well, I guess you owe me one now too.

491
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,253
Good luck with all of this.

492
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,006
I'm actually really excited
to see how it all turns out.

493
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,384
Hey, hey, hey.

494
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,138
Bye, Cisco.

495
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,700
Hey.

496
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,744
Cisco told me you were in here.

497
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:16,953
How's Caitlin doing?

498
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,082
He used that light
thingy on her. She's fine.

499
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,834
Mostly embarrassed.

500
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,377
Yeah.

501
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,464
Thanks for not saying "I told you so."

502
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,050
But I did tell you so.

503
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,302
Repeatedly.

504
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,512
I just...

505
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,766
Man, I've seen the way
that Oliver does things...

506
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,477
and he's not afraid
to just do whatever it takes...

507
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,647
to get what he needs,
and I thought that I could do that too.

508
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:48,735
I thought I could just use Snart,
but instead he used me.

509
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,613
You're not the Arrow, Barry.

510
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,073
No.

511
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,243
That's not the kind of hero you are.

512
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,164
What kind am I?

513
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,918
The kind that cares about whether or not
those criminals lived or died.

514
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:12,050
I mean, whatever Mardon and Nimbus
and Shawna did, they're human beings...

515
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:16,179
and you knew letting Wells use them
as pawns was wrong.

516
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,099
You know the difference
between right and wrong.

517
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,811
And you weren't willing to blur the lines
between the two.

518
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,939
That's the kind of man you are.

519
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,859
And that's what makes you different
than the Arrow.

520
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,573
So please...

521
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,701
no more walks on the dark side.

522
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,081
- Agreed?
- Yeah.

523
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,961
- What the hell is that?
- Guys?

524
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,630
The particle accelerator
is fully charged and online.

525
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,466
Whatever Wells needs it for, it's ready.

526
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,605
- Iris, there really isn't anything else to say.
- Are you kidding me?

527
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,650
You're gonna end this relationship because
some lunatic from the future told you...

528
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,902
that I am destined to marry Barry?

529
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:17,449
Well, I don't believe that, okay?
I believe that we choose our own destiny.

530
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:21,286
I decide who I love, and I love you.

531
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:26,333
Whatever future Wells showed you,
it is not my future.

532
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,169
It's not our future.

533
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,504
Please, let me prove it.

534
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,674
This isn't about the future, Iris.

535
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,051
It's about here...

536
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,803
now, today.

537
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,641
Ever since the very beginning, there's
been three people in this relationship.

538
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,185
You, me and Barry.

539
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,519
That is not true.

540
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,273
You can deny it all you want,
but Barry knows it...

541
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,400
Joe knows it...

542
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,654
and if I'm gonna be completely honest
with myself...

543
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,281
I knew.

544
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,075
I always knew.

545
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:06,206
I guess I just thought
I could love you enough to change things.

546
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,794
I'm sorry...

547
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,674
but if you really do love me,
you'll let this end.

548
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,051
Fine.

549
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,722
Then it ends.

550
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,952
Barry, don't even think about it.

551
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,954
Bar, no.

552
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,872
You can't go out there by yourself.

553
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,834
Yeah, I can.

554
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,592
Well, I heard your prison transfer
didn't go so well.

555
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm so sorry.

556
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,887
All a part of your plan, I assume.

557
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,725
Actually, that didn't
factor into my plan at all.

558
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,976
But I'm impressed...

559
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,771
you went to such great lengths
to keep those people from harm.

560
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,357
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

561
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:18,278
- You've hurt enough people.
- II know. You see me as the villain...

562
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,364
but, Barry, if you were to look back...

563
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,826
look back carefully
at everything I've done...

564
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,120
every wheel...

565
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,789
I have set in motion,
you would realize...

566
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,793
I have only done what I had to do.

567
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,920
Nothing more...

568
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,339
nothing less.

569
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,717
And the particle accelerator?

570
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,095
- How does that fit into your grand plan?
- Why don't you go on inside?

571
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,266
- Let me show you.
- You know, I just learned the hard way...

572
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,059
not to trust the bad guy.

573
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:55,523
And yet I've shown you
time and time again...

574
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,400
you can't beat me, Barry.

575
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,114
- Ronnie.
- Firestorm.

576
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,871
Wow. You brought yourself a friend.

577
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,588
Welcome, Mr. Queen.

578
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,173
Hope we're not too late.

579
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,591
You're just in time.

580
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,426
I don't care how fast you are.

581
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,638
You can't fight all three of us
at the same time.

582
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,306
Oh, I can't?

583
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,811
Trust me, this?

584
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,271
This is gonna be fun.

585
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,292
Move, Barry.

586
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,379
Barry, move!

587
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,724
Come on.

588
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,520
Ronnie.

589
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,316
Nanites, courtesy of Ray Palmer.

590
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,070
They're delivering a high-frequency pulse
that's disabling your speed.

591
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,240
You're not gonna be running around
for quite a while.

592
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:08,865
The history books say
you live to be 86 years old, Mr. Queen.

593
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,995
Well, I guess the history books are wrong.

594
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,001
That's the spirit.

595
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,878
You can't stop me, Flash.

596
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,131
And you never will.

597
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,649
Now!

598
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,194
- Thanks, fellas.
- No problem.

599
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,447
Nice haircut.

600
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,700
I see we've abandoned
our traditional green.

601
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,618
Trying something different.

602
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,287
Look, I might need a favor from you.

603
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,914
Wherever, whenever.

604
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,344
I got you.

605
00:41:53,368 --> 00:42:01,368
