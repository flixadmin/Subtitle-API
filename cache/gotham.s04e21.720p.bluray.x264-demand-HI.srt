GORDON: <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,535
LEE: <i>What's your record for</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,747
<i>how many banks
you've robbed in one day?</i>

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,833
GORDON: <i>You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.</i>

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,213
LEE: <i>We all have our flaws.</i>

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,010
But you're still breaking the law.

7
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,093
JEROME: <i>I want you to throw me a wake.</i>

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,344
<i>- Dig me up!</i>
- (YELLING)

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,851
NYGMA: <i>I will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.</i>

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,598
Dead or alive.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,228
Jerome uses distractions.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,400
Got a plan for that?

13
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,023
Bruce?

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,274
Jeremiah?

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,946
Oh, God, no. He's still alive.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,657
JEREMIAH: <i>Jerome is dead.</i>

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,782
<i>Long live me.</i>

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,286
I could not have done any of this

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,998
<i>without your help.</i>

20
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,125
<i>Those generators that we built</i>

21
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,215
<i>work even better as bombs.</i>

00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,086
(ALARM BLARING)

23
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,559
<i>Sources tell us Captain James Gordon

00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,762

25
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,063

00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,482
<i>what could've caused

27
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,188
Harvey.

28
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,271
I just got off the phone
with Search and Rescue,

29
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,448
whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker
was catastrophic.

30
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,650
There are no signs of life.

31
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,779
Tell them to keep looking.

32
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,953
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen, Jim found his way out.

33
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,075
Understand?

34
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,578
<i>Gotham City Police Department has
dispatched an investigative unit,</i>

35
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,159
<i>which is currently canvasing the area,</i>

36
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,666
<i>looking for any traces
of Captain Gordon.</i>

37
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,496
(SHOUTING) Screw that. And screw her.

38
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,627
Listen, in two minutes,

39
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,674
Jim Gordon's gonna come
walking through that door

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,171
and chew all your asses out

41
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,595
for standing around
and not doing your job.

42
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,339
Now, first responders are on the scene,

43
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,299
I want CSIs out there pronto.

44
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,433
And I want everyone looking for
Jeremiah Valeska and Bruce Wayne.

45
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,390
That's who Jim was looking for
when this whole thing went blooey.

46
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,270
- You ain't the captain.
- The captain ain't here.

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,521
I'm ranking detective.

48
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,730
Last time we followed you,
the Pyg slaughtered us.

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,578
All right, look, enough.
Jim trusts him, okay?

50
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,746
So, everybody get back to work.

51
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,409
ALVAREZ: Harvey.

52
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,248
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't inside
the bunker when it blew.

53
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,583
How do you know?

54
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,133
'Cause he's outside,
and he's not alone.

55
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,429
What the hell?

56
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,472
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers as I've given them

57
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,803
something of a makeover.

58
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,015
But I assure you they're as loyal
to me as they ever were to him.

59
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,443
More so, 'cause I accomplished
something my brother never could.

60
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,938
Killing James Gordon.

61
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,399
- ALL: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
- You're a liar.

62
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,907
Not so fast.

63
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,704
I have bombs planted around this city.

64
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,704
Just like the one
that killed Jim Gordon.

65
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,036
ALL: Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

66
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,549
All you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

67
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,842
Gotham's blown back to the Stone Age.

68
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,757
If I pull this trigger,

69
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,011
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

70
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,304
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

71
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,640
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

72
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,146
except mine is a bit more advanced.

73
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,354
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

74
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,657
and then boom, boom, boom.

75
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,076
Boom.

76
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,949
Now, if you won't do what I say...

77
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,288
- You're more sick than your brother.
- (CHUCKLES)

78
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,751
Don't compare me to that
shortsighted psychopath.

79
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,795
He just wanted to destroy things.

80
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,964
Me, I'm a builder.

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,667
I'm going to create
a new Gotham in my image.

82
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,629
But every artist
needs a blank canvas.

83
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,007
So, all of this has to go.

84
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,847
I detonate the explosives
in six hours,

85
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,724
I want this city empty when I do.

86
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,183
You need us to evacuate Gotham
in six hours? That's impossible.

87
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,189
Then everyone who dies screaming,

88
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,147
who watches their loved ones
crushed before them

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,357
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

90
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,026
Look,

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,112
nobody has to die.

92
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,457
Well, except for these people.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,919
I know seeing is believing,
and I do want you to believe me.

94
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,121
So...

95
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,204
(BEEPING)

96
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,506
(PEOPLE SHOUTING AND SCREAMING)

97
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,547
- Oh, my God.
- (CAR ALARM BLARING)

98
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,339
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

99
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,719
Six hours, Detective.

100
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,230
The clock is ticking.

101
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,319
BARBARA: Shame. I liked the clock tower.

102
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,365
Jim took me there on a date once.
Now they're both up in smoke.

103
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,625
Good riddance.

104
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,668
He always did want to die a hero.

105
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,917
PENGUIN: And that was Jim's problem.

106
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,425
Me, I'd rather live.

107
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,387
And live well.

108
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,805
(SCOFFS) If it isn't little Penguin.

109
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,049
Oh, and Butch's corpse.

110
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,644
- Hey, Tabby.
- Butch.

111
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,685
The man responsible for the recent
fireworks is Jeremiah Valeska.

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,732
Twin brother of our old associate.

113
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,613
He has plans for Gotham.

114
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,113
Plans we learned about,
courtesy of this gentleman.

115
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,783
- They ripped out my fingernails.
- (LAUGHS)

116
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,115
I believe that this is a golden
opportunity for cash and glory.

117
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,668
Normally, I would keep
both of them for myself,

118
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,499
but I find myself a bit short
of the necessary manpower.

119
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,669
- Or woman-power, if you will.
- Hmm.

120
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,301
I'll go 50/50 on the take.

121
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,975
An alliance with you. I'll pass.

122
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,769
Pity. With the money
we were going to make,

123
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,724
I'd hoped to finally be able to
cure Butch of his condition.

124
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,436
Wait, what do you mean?

125
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,364
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

126
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,905
Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

127
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,909
Hugo Strange can fix Butch,
but it won't be cheap.

128
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,033
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

129
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,040
Don't look at me like that.

130
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,593
I almost got killed fighting
your ex-boyfriend's rotting corpse.

131
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,261
I think it's time to return the favor.

132
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,047
Fine.

133
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,305
But swamp boy keeps his funk
ten feet from me at all times.

134
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,219
What did you have in mind?

135
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,610
Evacuate this city in six hours?

136
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,653
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

137
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,824
because this maniac has
bombs hidden all over Gotham.

138
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,526
Think of how many lives are at stake.

139
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,284
And every minute you hesitate
means fewer people get to safety.

140
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,991
- We'll need police.
- We are police!

141
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,373
We're here to help. Harper,
please, will you help the mayor?

142
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,829
HARPER: You got it.

143
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,666
Holy Mother of God. Bruce Wayne.

144
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,999
Hey.

145
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,461
Bruce, are you okay?

146
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,342
I'm fine. I heard about Jim.

147
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,882
- Is it true?
- As far as I'm concerned,

148
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,389
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,
and waiting for us to find him.

149
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,062
Detective, don't lie to me.

150
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,731
It's not looking good, kid.

151
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,484
I was hoping you could help me.

152
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,653
Did you see Jim?
How did you get out of the bunker?

153
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,196
Jeremiah and I had
already left the bunker.

154
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,070
Jerome sprayed him with a gas
that drove him insane.

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,776
I'm so sick of that freaking family.

156
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,829
Did you hear about
Gotham Clock Tower? Huh?

157
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,747
This guy's got these massive...

158
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,950
- It's my fault.
- What?

159
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,961
Jeremiah had plans to create
next-generation generators.

160
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,748
I funded him.

161
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,298
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?

162
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,508
Listen,

163
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,638
the schematics for the battery

164
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,515
should be in the Wayne Enterprises
R&D lab.

165
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,515
Lucius can take a look at them and
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

166
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,349
- I'm going to go get them now.
- No, you're going home.

167
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,560
- No, I have to do this.
- (SHOUTS) Look, I know you feel guilty,

168
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,694
but Jim Gordon was...
Is important to all of us.

169
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,239
And it's my job. So, go home,
be with Alfred, be safe.

170
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,035
It's what Jim would want.

171
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,038
Lucius.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,866
- (SIGHS)
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

173
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,207
Alfred, where have you been?

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,087
JEREMIAH: <i>No, not Alfred.</i>

175
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,174
I hope you didn't
catch a cold in my brother's grave.

176
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,382
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

177
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,092
What have you done? Where's Alfred?

178
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,979
Such anger.

179
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,103
Some people, not me, of course,

180
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,277
might consider that ingratitude
considering all I've done for you.

181
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,480
<i>All I'm still doing for you.</i>

182
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,860
You mean lying to me?

183
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,575
Using my company to build bombs?
Trying to kill me?

184
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,529
Bruce, let's get something straight.

185
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,073
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

186
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,033
I'd have put a bullet through your brain

187
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,335
and left you to rot in that grave.

188
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,288
But I meant what I said.

189
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,550
You're my best friend. And today,
I'm going to prove it to you.

190
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,889
You are insane.
And you killed Jim Gordon.

191
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,474
<i>And if you don't want
your man-servant to die, too,</i>

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,768
<i>you will follow
my instructions to the letter.</i>

193
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,521
71 Welling Avenue,
be there in an hour.

194
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,223
Tell the police and I'll know.

195
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,567
Just like I know
that's where you are right now.

196
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,350
(GROANS)

197
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,395
Well, well,

198
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,406
Jim Gordon, back from the dead.

199
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,206
Where am I?

200
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,291
The Narrows.

201
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,713
I was in Jeremiah's bunker.
There was a bomb.

202
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,085
Ed had you followed.

203
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,459
His people found you after the blast.

204
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,670
I'll have to thank him
when I arrest him.

205
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,852
I'm surprised you didn't kill me.

206
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,849
I am, too, actually.

207
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,435
What do you plan to do with me?

208
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,361
I don't really know.

209
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,524
Lee, I have to get back to the GCPD.

210
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,404
Jerome's brother Jeremiah...

211
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,451
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

212
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,450
The city's being evacuated.

213
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,783
I have to... (GROANS)

214
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,868
It's just a painkiller.

215
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,209
Does make you easier to handle.
You're not going anywhere.

216
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,887
My jacket... In my jacket.

217
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,971
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

218
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,936
They may give us
some clue as to what he's planning.

219
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,272
Please, let me take them to Harvey.

220
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,449
Oh, Jim, you still think you're
the only one who can save this city.

221
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,569
- Wait.
- Get some rest.

222
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,410
Doctor's orders.

223
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,207
(DOOR LOCK RATTLING)

224
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,341
Jeremiah's followers must have taken
Alfred while I was at the cemetery.

225
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,960
I bet he put up a fight.

226
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,763
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

227
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,636
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

228
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,467
I know it's asking a lot.
So I just really appreciate...

229
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,850
Bruce, I'm going to be here
whenever you need me.

230
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,858
Okay, that's the address.

231
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,110
I don't see anyone though.
That could be a trap, right?

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,190
I don't know.

233
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,239
Jeremiah could have killed me
at the cemetery.

234
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,821
He wants something out of me.

235
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,781
Like what? To be your best friend?

236
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,997
Trap or not, if Alfred's in there,
I need to find out.

237
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,903
BRUCE: Alfred?

238
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,446
- (SCREAMING)
- Alfred! Alfred!

- Alfred!
- (SCREAMING)

242
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,966
You want to help Jim Gordon?
Have you lost your mind?

243
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,465
You brought him here because
you thought it would give us leverage

244
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,764
- with the GCPD.
- Yes, by holding him hostage.

245
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,467
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

246
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,100
We solve it, and we trade
the information for clemency.

247
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,521
Perhaps.

248
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,483
Or, perhaps there's
something more going on.

(SIGHS)

250
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,111
What happened between Jim and I is over.

251
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,081
I'm trying to protect
what we've built.

252
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,873
I still like my plan better.

253
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,920
Ed, if this maniac
levels half the city,

254
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,421
it's going to disrupt food
distribution, water supply, power.

255
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,467
The people of The Narrows
will suffer the most.

256
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,887
We can prevent that,
while at the same time

257
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,465
helping us out of this mess we're in.

258
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,094
Please.

259
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,598
Fine.

260
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,061
If this is what you want,

261
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,064
I will do it.

262
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,908
For you.

263
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,411
Do it for us.

REPORTER: <i>After the mayor's
evacuation orders,</i>

<i>the new Trigate Bridge

266
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,924
HARVEY: Where are we at
with the evac?

267
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,550
Bridges and tunnels
are bumper to bumper.

268

National Guard is
bringing in the choppers.

269
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,219
Look, we're talking about evacuating
hospitals, nursing homes, jails.

270
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,678
Some people just don't want to leave.

271
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,934
<i>We are seeing
the same levels of panic</i>

272
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,231
<i>on every bridge
and tunnel out of Gotham.</i>

273
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,058
God, what a mess.
Just make it happen.

274
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,394
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

275
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,735
LUCIUS: I got the schematics from
Wayne Enterprises R&D.

276
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,987
The Wayne kid said
the bombs were batteries.

277
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,694
A series of network
self-perpetuating generators.

278
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,121
But when supercharged,
they contain enough energy

279
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,243
to level a city block.

280
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,869
Got it, battery bombs from hell.

281
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,452
Just tell me this will
help us find and disable them.

282
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,580
Disable, yes. Find, no. But...

283
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,927
Look. Look here. Because they were
created to be networked together,

284
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,588
Jeremiah would have to send a signal.

285
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,140
A centrally-located core relay
in order to blow all the bombs

286
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,014
- from a single detonator.
- Lucius, just English, please.

287
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,892
Sorry, the bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

288
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,816
The core relay is the brain.
We find that, we destroy that.

289
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,437
We can stop the bombs from going off.

290
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,645
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

291
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,980
How do we find this brain?

292
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:05,126
Oh, Bruce, you are about to have
a very transformative experience.

293
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,336
I envy you.

294
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,224
Call our friends.

295
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,095
Tell them to kill the butler.
He is no longer necessary.

296
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,185
Oswald Cobblepot.

297
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,900
Barbara Kean.

298
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,903
In my stronghold.

299
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,328
Not one step closer, Mr. Valeska.

300
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,620
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

301
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,417
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

302
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,707
- PENGUIN: Indeed, it is.
- (SHUDDERING)

303
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,371
Huh.

304
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:53,336
Well, it seems you have
the upper hand.

305
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,379
Undoubtedly.

306
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,097
And now,

307
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,469
we have our own demands.

308
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,317
$50 million. That's what you want?

309
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,198
It's a nice, round number.

310
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,118
I don't quite have that
on me right now.

311
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,413
You gave the mayor
six hours to evacuate Gotham.

312
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,991
An impossible task.

313
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,578
Let him buy another hour.
He will save thousands of lives.

314
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,084
$50 million will seem cheap.

315
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:34,589
I see. I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

316
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,718
I get you the money,
you give me back my core relay.

317

That is usually
how a hand-off works, yeah.

You drive a hard bargain,
but I'll see what I can do.

319
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,980
Just like that?
After knowing your brother,

320
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,686
I expected something more...

321
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,941
Insane?

322
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,113
I'm nothing if not sane and reasonable.

That's why I'll be successful
where he failed.

325
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:09,124
Well, that and being
vastly more intelligent.

This is Jeremiah Valeska.

328
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,464
I'd like to speak to the mayor.
I have additional demands.

329
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,382
Yes, really.

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,355
50 million, unmarked bills.
I'll tell you the location.

331
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,852
We're not going to just
hand this thing over

332
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,353
and let him destroy Gotham, are we?

333
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,730
Of course not.

334
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,062
Once we get the money,
we kill Jeremiah and his people,

335
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,148
give the core relay to the police,

336
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,450
split the 50 million and are
hailed as the heroes of Gotham.

337
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,696
And we cure Butch.

338
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,451

something Jongleur never knew about.

- Yeah, don't really care.

Thank you, gentlemen.

383
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,735
I want to make one thing very clear.

384
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,788
If Gotham becomes a rock pile,
I mind zero percent.

385

I'm only helping you
because I'm with Lee now.

00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,619
Fine, whatever.

387
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:42,383
Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.
It's almost convincing.

388
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,586
Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening
to destroy half the city.

389
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,887
You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

390
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,384
into thinking
you and Lee are a couple?

391
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,725
You see?

392
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,635
That is my point.

393
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,308
You don't believe that
Lee could actually love me, do you?

394
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,731
Honestly? No.

395
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,849
Hmm.

396
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,776
You're a psychopath and a murderer.

397
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,856
And the fact that you need me
to validate your crazy fantasy

398
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,532
means that
you don't believe it either.

399
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,825
That doesn't matter.

400
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,699
What matters is stopping Jeremiah
from killing thousands of people.

401
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,825
So, can we...

402
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,744
Yeah, we're going to settle this.

403
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,167
- Ed...
- No, Jim!

404
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,789
This isn't the GCPD.

405
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,245
Here, I make the rules.

406
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,455
So, we're not going to do this

407
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,085
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

408
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,918
Lee's changed. I accept that.

409
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,672
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew. Fine.

410
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,633
- But she is not who you think she is.
- (SCOFFS)

411
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,560
The fact that she is with you
in whatever way she's with you...

412
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:40,016
Oh, Jim, she's with me in every way.

413
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,687
Means that
she wants something from you.

414
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,782
So, when it's done,
she'll get rid of you.

415
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,447
So, you're saying that she
wouldn't be with a killer and yet,

416
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,415
she was with you.

417
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,500
And you, Jim, are 10 times
the killer that I ever was.

418
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,965
You have a point.

419
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,177
Maybe that's why she's not with me now.

420
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,848
Can we do this?

421
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,552
Why not?

422
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,351
Just try to keep up.
I'll speak slowly.

423
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,108
So most labyrinths
are constructed as contiguous lines

424
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,026
along concentric circles.

425
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,775
One way in, one way out.

426
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,106
But this one's different.

427
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,691
Undoubtedly.

428
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,700
Those red rectangles,

429
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,536
they're unbound on one side,

430
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,120
and they overlap black lines which
would lead out of the labyrinth.

431
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,917
So maybe we're not looking at plans,

432
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,078
but the end result.

433
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,999
<i>Voilà.</i> Look familiar?

434
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,433
So, this is Wayne Enterprises.

435
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,138
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

436
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,193
These are the buildings Jeremiah's
planning to demolish with his bombs.

437
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,396
Once those buildings are blown,

438
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,606
they collapse and create

439
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,110
the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

440
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,909
Jeremiah lived his entire life
in a maze.

441
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,954
Now he's trying to remake the city
into the place he feels most safe.

442
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,906
It's actually rather elegant.

443
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,210
- I need to get to the GCPD.
- (CHUCKLES) No, sorry.

444
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,753
You're not going anywhere until
we get this information to the mayor.

445
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,583
Lee and I have some
legal knots we need untangled.

446
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,219
Yeah, before we spend
the rest of our lives together.

447
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,589
So you're going to use this
to hold the city hostage?

448
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,719
Time is running out.

449
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,552
Well, then the mayor would be wise to
forgive Lee and I our indiscretions.

450
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,721
Ed. Wait.

451
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,848

452
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,186
One, be a little kind to yourself.

453
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,610

you made a mistake right there.

I find your fickleness

quite hurtful.

Well, that is disappointing.

647
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,013
You know, if you had asked me
this morning

648
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,845
how many people I was gonna kill today,

649
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,729
I would have been way off.

650
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,020
Perhaps the outcome
was not what we had hoped,

- but it was worth the risk.
- BARBARA: Ozzy,

if I were you, I would limp

Fine.

- Let's go, Butch.
- Nope.

655
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,535
I'm done.

656
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,615
Ever since we teamed up,
everything's gone to crap.

Hell, we don't even know
where Strange is.

Except, I do know where Strange is.

659
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,831
(SHOUTING) You mean to tell me you've
known where he is the whole time

660
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,915
and never told me?

- (CHOKING) I just got word.
- No more excuses.

He fixes me now!

663

Gordon must have stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

Well, I appreciate the offer,

I can conquer Gotham on my own.

Because, my boy,

686
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,471
all this is not just about Gotham.

687
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,557
This is about Bruce Wayne.

688
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,617
You here to arrest me?

689
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,612
To thank you.

690
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,082
And to present you with an offer.

691
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,867
Leave Gotham.

692
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,958
Start a new life somewhere else.
Alone.

693
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,720
And if I don't?

694
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,853
I know we can't change the past.

695

What we've done...

696

We've done to each other.

697

I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

698
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,203
But whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

699
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,119
I care about you.

Lucius, call the mayor.

702
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,115
Tell him not to lift
the evacuation order

703
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,322
until all the bombs
are under lock and key.

704
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,706
And I want every cop out there
to keep looking for Jeremiah Valeska.

Thank you. No, come on.

00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,131
Right. Well, I'm going to take
a very long and a very hot shower.

712
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,254
And then I'm going to make us
a legendary fry-up.

Will you be joining us, Miss Kyle?

00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,181
- I've got no plans.
- Excellent.

Okay, then.

00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,322
Thank you again.

You're welcome.

Why do you think
he's so obsessed with you?

Jeremiah said, "All it takes is one
bad day to drive a person insane."

722
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,256
I wonder if my parents dying
made me a little insane?

723
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,344
Maybe he sensed that.

724
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,714
Maybe he wanted to bring it out.

725
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,430
Well, you proved him wrong.
