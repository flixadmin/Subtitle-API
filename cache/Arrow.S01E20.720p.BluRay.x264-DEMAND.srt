1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,129
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,449
For five years, I was stranded on an island,
with only one goal...

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,611
...survive.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,091
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,769
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish
to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,804
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,651
To do this, I must become someone else.
I must become something else.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,927
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,930
- So you met up with the Hood guy?
- He's contacted me before.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,050
You're a murderer.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,171
You were my best friend in life,
but now it's like I don't even know you.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,367
I quit.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,648
Listen, Lyla,
Lawton is a very dangerous man.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,285
What do you know about him?

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,006
Everything you need to locate
who's giving Deadshot targets.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,329
- This Lawton kick his dog or something?
- He killed his brother.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,327
I can't move on with him still out there.
I thought if anybody got that it'd be you.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,484
- You two have unfinished business.
- Where do we start?

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,685
- You feel better?
- I'll feel better once we end Deadshot.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,485
- Welcome to Germany, Mr. Ambassador.
- Henrik, you're looking great.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,362
We have to end this guy before he makes
any more widows out of wives.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,525
We Will.

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,044
Diggle, we'll stop him.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,164
I promised you I'd help take him down
and I keep my promises...

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,887
- ...but he's on another continent.
- Not anymore.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,131
Thought it'd be helpful
to track A.R.G.U.S.'s manhunt...

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,126
...for Floyd Lawton a.k.a. Deadshot,
so I decrypted their communication logs.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,569
Which means,
I just hacked a federal agency.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,688
Makes me a cyber-terrorist,
which is bad.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,167
I don't see myself
fitting in at Guantanamo Bay.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,880
Don't worry, Felicity,
they don't send blonds there.

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
I dye it, actually. I keep your secret.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,484
Hey, what'd you find?

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,401
Deadshot is scheduled to meet with
a potential new client here in Starling City.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,889
Except the potential contract is bogus.
Your friend Lyla is setting a trap for him.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,441
- Lawton took the bait.
- Great, I'll talk to Lyla...

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,168
- ...see if I can suss out any details.
- Good. I've gotta have lunch with Laurel.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,127
So when did you become, uh,
lunch dates with Laurel?

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,322
Look, we're just...

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,405
- We're friends.
- Friends are good.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,967
- But?
- Couldn't you be friends...

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,925
...with someone less complicated
than your ex-girlfriend...

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,606
...who's your ex-best friend's
current girlfriend?

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,203
I wear a hood and I put arrows into
criminals, so when it comes to complexity...

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,963
...I grade on a curve.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,527
Rescuing your father and stopping Fyers
is not gonna be some walk in the park.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,763
They're not gonna allow us
to just stroll on into their camp.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,604
Which is why we'll need cover.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,247
If both of us are infiltrating,
who'll provide that?

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,689
He Will.

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,688
- Me?
- Ha-ha-ha.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,643
- The assault rifle is flushed. It's useless.
- We have a bow, arrows.

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,531
And no one capable of shooting them.
No offense, kid.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,205
I was gonna say the same thing.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,129
I think we should be spending our time
trying to devise a plan...

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,800
...not lower our already slim chances
of survival.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,527
He'll hit his mark by sundown.
If not, we'll do it your way.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,169
- Lyla?
- What is it, Johnnie?

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,926
Came by to see how your Deadshot
investigation is going.

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,287
- Anything new come up?
- Funnily enough, it did.

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,529
I was curious why you, a bodyguard,
were so keen on taking down...

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,128
...such a high profile assassin,
so I did some reading up on Lawton.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,327
Lyla, listen--

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,126
Did you think I wouldn't find out
he killed your brother?

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,930
That you were using me. Me.

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,840
To what? Draw him into the open
so you could take him down yourself?

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,850
I will not let you use my agency
to settle your blood feud.

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,769
Lyla, I need to see this guy in a bag.
You of all people should get that.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,722
Stay away from Lawton, Johnnie,
or so help me, I will have you arrested.

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,210
You doubt me?

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,890
Never have.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,770
- Hi.
- Did you get my voice-mail?

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,287
- No.
- Things got a little crazy around here...

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,803
...back-to-back meetings,
I am so sorry, rain check?

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,328
Sure. I could definitely catch up
on some club paperwork.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,289
I'm way behind since Tommy left.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,086
I'm still shocked that he went
to go work for Malcolm.

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,562
You know, you were really understanding
to let him take this opportunity.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,286
- Tommy said you were cool with it.
- Why wouldn't I be?

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,448
He's my friend. Like you.

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,723
- I'm sorry, are we early?
- No, not at all.

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,491
Uh, Oliver, this is Eric Moore
and his wife, Nancy.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,927
I'm prepping them
for a deposition for tomorrow.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,002
- And this must be your bodyguard?
- This is our son, Taylor.

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,443
Well, you're in very capable hands.
It's nice to meet you.

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,927
Eric, Nancy, I wanna make sure
that you guys are up for this.

87
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,482
Edward Rasmus isn't known for playing
with kid gloves, so this could get rough.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,723
We invested our entire life savings
with Rasmus and he stole it.

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,642
Our retirement. Taylor's college fund.
He stole our future, Ms. Lance.

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,649
We want it back.

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,611
Well, then let's go get it.

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,640
- Hello?
- Mr. Moore.

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,121
I have some documents
for you from Ms. Lance...

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,681
...related to tomorrow's deposition.

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,641
What a nice home you have here.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,248
You can really feel the love.

97
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,849
Sorry about the mess.
This works better if it looks like a break-in.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,367
- Is it done?
- Parents, yes.

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,364
I'm afraid there's been a variable.
The child got away.

100
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,048
- Got away? Did he see you?
- No, Mr. Rasmus.

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,445
What he saw was the face of the man
who will reunite him with his parents.

102
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,808
Starling City is expected to be host...

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,928
...of this year's Festival of Lights exhibition.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,841
In other news, the bodies of Eric and
Nancy Moore were found early this morning.

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,487
The couple were being represented
by attorney Laurel Lance of CNRI...

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,769
...in a lawsuit
against financier Edward Rasmus.

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,251
Miraculously, their 7-year-old son, Taylor,
survived the horrific attack.

108
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,406
This isn't your fault, Laurel.
You shouldn't feel guilty.

109
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,049
I don't feel guilty. I'm angry.
This wasn't some random break-in.

110
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,086
- Edward Rasmus is involved, I know it.
- Listen, our guys are looking into this.

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,608
But you need to stay out of it, okay?
Because if Rasmus is behind this...

112
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,689
...he's clearly not messing around.

113
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,089
If you'd like to say goodbye to Taylor,
I will be taking him over to Child Services.

114
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,841
- Doesn't he have any other family?
- Grandparents are in Melbourne.

115
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,326
We're tracking them down...

116
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,490
...but until then, he's gonna be
a temporary ward of the State.

117
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,161
He can stay with me.

118
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,489
As his attorney, I am assigning myself
temporary guardianship.

119
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,803
- You'd still need a judge's order.
- I'll have it to you in an hour.

120
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,122
Well, have it your way.

121
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,569
Okay, look, I'm gonna park
a patrol car outside your place.

122
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,451
- Fine.
- And you.

123
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,201
- You look after them.
- I spend most nights at you daughter's.

124
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,806
There was probably a better time
to tell you that.

125
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,803
Probably not.

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,961
Hi. So you're gonna come
stay at my house, okay?

127
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,644
- What are you doing here?
- I heard.

128
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,049
- I wanted to make sure Laurel was okay.
- You could have just called.

129
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,727
I met Laurel's clients
and their son yesterday and I felt badly.

130
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,605
You met them?

131
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,411
Yeah, when I was picking up Laurel
for lunch.

132
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,161
- Which she didn't tell you about.
- Tell you what?

133
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,845
Nothing.

134
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,363
It's settled.
Taylor's coming home with us tonight.

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,528
- Well, if you need anything--
- We're fine.

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,242
- Okay.
- We should really get going.

137
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,925
Here.

138
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,968
Set your sight.

139
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,764
Hit the tree.

140
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,247
Probably hit a tree.

141
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,088
Set your sight.

142
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,881
Hit the tree.

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,770
Steady your anchor point.

144
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,807
I hope you're getting closer.

145
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,648
At teaching him
how to be a better marksman.

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,725
It's not as though our lives depend on it
or anything.

147
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,485
'TW again.
- Qkay_

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,123
What's this?

149
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,085
Lyla's mission profile on the trap
they've set for Deadshot.

150
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,126
Lawton is set to meet his new employer and
get his assignment tomorrow at 8 p.m.

151
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,689
Only, his new employer
will be an A.R.G.U.S. agent.

152
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,051
Lyla will then swoop in with her team
and arrest him.

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,929
Do you want Lawton arrested?

154
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,251
No.

155
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,003
Then tomorrow night, we cross
Floyd Lawton's name off your list.

156
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,490
There is something else
we need to look into.

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,201
Two of Laurel's clients
were murdered last night.

158
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,966
- Their 7-year-old son barely escaped.
- That's terrible.

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,647
Edward Rasmus, the financial advisor
Laurel was taking to court...

160
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,680
...may not have pulled the trigger,
but he probably called in the hit.

161
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,770
I want you to get into his corporate accounts,
phone records...

162
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,361
...anything that may link him
to the killer, okay?

163
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,849
Where are you going?

164
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,482
- Laurel's.
- Another friendly meal?

165
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,726
- My daughter is secure at her place?
- So far, all quiet.

166
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,167
All right, let me know
if there is any movement.

167
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,330
- Yes, sir, roger that.
- I'm heading over there right now.

168
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,405
What did you steal this time?

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,090
- You got a minute?
- No.

170
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,327
It's about the Hood.

171
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,283
When my men found you on
that subway car after you were kidnapped...

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,245
...you told me you didn't know anything
about the vigilante.

173
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,323
- Something you forgot to tell them?
- No.

174
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,689
I just wanna see him brought to justice
like everyone else.

175
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,729
Don't worry, kid. We'll get him.

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,129
Just keep making sure
I don't have a reason to get you.

177
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,361
Taylor? Sweetheart? Are you hungry?

178
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,522
You know, I make
the world's best macaroni and cheese.

179
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,042
It's the only thing she knows how to make.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,401
I miss my mom and dad.

181
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,685
When I was your age, my mom tucked me
into bed at night before going out.

182
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,043
Then the next thing I knew,
there was a police officer at my door.

183
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,886
He said that she was gone
and that I would never see her again.

184
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,202
But you know what?

185
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,611
- He was wrong.
- You saw her?

186
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,245
Mm-hm.

187
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,563
Every time I close my eyes, I can see her.

188
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,810
Every time I go to bed,
I see her in my dreams.

189
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,805
Really?

190
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,287
Yeah. Try it, close your eyes.

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,449
I see them.

192
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,364
Whenever you are sad or scared...

193
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,286
...just remember
that they will always be there.

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,609
You constantly surprise me, Merlyn.

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,930
I'll get it.

196
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,925
Ms. Lance? It's Lieutenant Kessel, S.C.P.D.

197
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,851
Your dad asked me to check in.

198
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,368
Lieutenant, can you hold your badge up
to the door, please?

199
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,489
Okay, great. Just one sec.

200
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,248
- What?
- His badge number begins with a zero.

201
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,209
Lieutenant's badge numbers
begin with a one.

202
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,961
It was the badge that gave me away, right?

203
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,363
You know, my father's a cop.

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,048
And that's not all he taught me.

205
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,091
Feeling like it might be time
for you to move.

206
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,486
Dad, whoever Rasmus hired is gonna
keep coming until he finishes the job...

207
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,008
...otherwise Rasmus will
just hire someone else who will.

208
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,403
Listen, I want the three of you
in protective custody immediately...

209
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,285
...and don't even think about it.
He killed two of my men.

210
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,131
The Hood just saved our lives.
We can trust him.

211
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,924
He won't let anything happen to me.

212
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,730
Even if I was comfortable with the idea...

213
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,242
...of him watching over you 24/7,
which I'm not...

214
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,284
...something tells me
he's got better things to do.

215
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,561
What about Oliver?

216
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,762
Sorry, you got another friend
named Oliver?

217
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,491
The Queens have more security
than the president.

218
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,843
They've got cameras everywhere,
bodyguards in every wing...

219
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,010
...and no one goes in or out
without being accounted for.

220
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,606
We both only want
what is best for Laurel.

221
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,005
And right now that is to stay
close to Oliver. Trust me.

222
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
This is Mr. Robbins.

223
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,442
Where you go, he goes.
You'll be very well protected, Ms. Lance.

224
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,807
- Thank you.
I hand-selected these men myself.

225
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,281
The house and the grounds
are completely secure.

226
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,283
Please make yourself at home.

227
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,206
You must be Taylor. How about I show you
where I hide the good cookies?

228
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,730
Mr. Queen, whenever you're ready, I can
take you to your next appointment, sir.

229
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,326
- The Lawton meeting?
- Yes.

230
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,484
I just need to swing by the club
and pick up my good suit.

231
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,365
- So I'll meet you there.
- Of course, sir.

232
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,727
You're leaving?

233
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,810
There's something else
I need to take care of. It's important.

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,729
More important than what's here?

235
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,321
No offense to Oliver,
but I think we need Mr. Robbins...

236
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,329
...and his men more than him.

237
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,162
You are the reason why we're here.
Trust me, that wasn't easy to admit.

238
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,608
You'll be fine. I promise.

239
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,045
- You know, chewing might help.
- Not dainty enough for you?

240
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,046
I can eat you under the table, Roy Harper.
Don't forget that.

241
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,201
Yeah.

242
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,170
All units, code 10-80. Starling City port--

243
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,691
What is that?

244
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,531
Suspected vigilante activity,
requesting all available units.

245
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,206
Do you have a police radio
in your pocket?

246
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,569
No, I'm just happy to see you.
Got to run.

247
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,610
Oh, wait.

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,804
Heading on East Gary.
We're 20 minutes out.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,207
Nice evening, huh?

250
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,088
Hey, I think you got something
that belongs to me.

251
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,408
You set this up,
just to get your radio back?

252
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,010
Well, I do love that radio. Come on.

253
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,085
I'm uploading a satellite overview
of the plaza to your phone.

254
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,208
- I know the place.
- Dig was specific...

255
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
...about where you should perch.
You know...

256
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,362
...what position gives you
the best shot at Lawton. I think.

257
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,927
He used a lot of military jargon.

258
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,644
So you're sniping a sniper.
Kind of ironic, don't you think?

259
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,924
Me neither.

260
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,207
What's that?

261
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,569
I had a remote access trojan
scouring the Internet for Edward Rasmus.

262
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,843
His name just popped up
on a flight manifest, 8:15 to Shanghai.

263
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,327
- He's running.
- That's good, right?

264
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,842
If he's leaving town, he won't be
after Laurel and the child anymore.

265
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,368
But if you did wanna stop him,
looks like it's now or never.

266
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,161
Deadshot or Rasmus. Your choice.

267
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,044
Trap 1, this is Harbinger.
Wait for Lawton to enter and make contact.

268
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,163
Then we take him down.

269
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,082
Damn it, Oliver.

270
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,243
Just until this CNRI mess dies down.

271
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,122
Wontons and no extradition treaty. Ha, ha.

272
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,529
Hey, hey, I thought I was paying you extra
not to stop at the reds.

273
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,566
Trap 1, possible target acquisition.

274
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,891
Get ready.

275
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,486
Stand down.

276
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,568
Maybe Lawton didn't take the bait after all.

277
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,609
We're blown. Take cover.

278
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,324
Lyla?

279
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,371
On your knees. On your knees.

280
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,722
Hands behind your head.

281
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,886
I saw you coming a mile away.
Thanks for tipping me off.

282
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,122
I'll kill you for what you did to Andy.

283
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,041
I'd be pulling these triggers right now,
except there's nobody paying me.

284
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,801
There's space for you right here,
right next to your brother.

285
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,162
You'd do best to remember that.

286
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,445
What happened?

287
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,528
You didn't show, things didn't go well.

288
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,204
Rasmus was skipping town
and I had to reprioritize.

289
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,722
Thanks to your new priorities,
four agents are dead, Oliver.

290
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,684
You could have stopped this guy,
ended this maniac once and for all.

291
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,089
Lawton got away?

292
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,523
You seriously think
a man who goes by the name Deadshot...

293
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,963
...was going down without a fight?
I needed you there, man.

294
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,088
Taylor Moore was relying on me, Diggle.

295
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,450
This was never about that kid. He is safe
under armed security at your house.

296
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,008
- This is about Laurel.
- Diggle, I made a choice.

297
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,444
I know. You chose Laurel. Always her.

298
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,444
Everybody else be damned.

299
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,451
- Something to say, Felicity?
- Nothing you wanna hear.

300
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,009
TW again.

301
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,567
- You're thinking too much.
- Nobody ever accused me of that before.

302
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,526
Show-off.

303
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,484
I see my target in the distance,
I feel the variation in the wind.

304
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,287
I hear the bowstring tighten
and I let go.

305
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,205
Give in to your senses, don't think.

306
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,967
You're right, this is definitively
not the time or place.

307
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,044
No, it's just there's, uh...

308
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,328
There's someone.
And it's a mile past complicated, but I can't.

309
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,849
Does she know how much you love her?

310
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,327
I suspect right now she doesn't.

311
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,044
But as soon as I'm home, she will.

312
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,044
You looked so beautiful that night.

313
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,084
I remember Oliver telling me once...

314
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,251
...that he wished your father would let him
come over to your house more often.

315
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,685
That being there made him feel less like
Robert Queen's son and more like himself.

316
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
I liked who my son was
when he was around you.

317
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,206
Thank you.

318
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,285
Hey.

319
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,408
The police just called.
Edward Rasmus was arrested.

320
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,128
- Really? What happened?
- Apparently he confessed to everything.

321
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,884
He's going to prison a long time.

322
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,883
Won't be able to hurt anyone ever again.

323
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,362
- Why would he confess?
- The vigilante was involved.

324
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,721
Good for him.

325
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,291
- So I guess it's over.
- Yes. Yeah.

326
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,920
- Great, I'll go wake up Taylor.
- No, Tommy, please.

327
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,565
He's sleeping, he's been through a lot.
Now, you all are welcome to stay.

328
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,564
We certainly have enough room.

329
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,091
It's your call.

330
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,321
Thank you, Mrs. Queen.

331
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,007
- I guess we'll stay, then.
- Good.

332
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,481
Your lawyer's here.

333
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,006
I'd like to discuss loose ends.

334
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,848
You didn't get my message?
Forget about the Moore boy.

335
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,440
I already confessed. That freak show
in a hood told me he'd kill me if I didn't.

336
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,523
We need to make this meeting
appear legitimate.

337
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,806
Lawyer stuff.

338
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,887
- Sign here, please.
- Am I clear? You leave the boy alone.

339
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,123
I wish I could, but he's seen my face.
Just like you.

340
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,964
If you put pressure in just the right areas
above the forearm...

341
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,286
...like I did to you, an embolism will form
in the medial antebrachial vein.

342
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,765
When the air pocket reaches your heart
in give or take 15 seconds, you'll die.

343
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,171
It's relatively painless.

344
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,806
Oh.

345
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,849
Nothing personal.

346
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,491
We're done here.

347
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,208
Excuse me, hi,
I'm looking for my boyfriend.

348
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,204
He's kind of a regular around here.

349
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,842
Piercing blue eyes and may or may not
have stolen a police radio.

350
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,566
Yeah, that's him. Behind you.

351
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,330
Well, that's a nice look.
What were you thinking?

352
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,285
Well, if it isn't the wonder twins.

353
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,569
He's very sorry for stealing the radio
and he won't ever bug you...

354
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,922
...or steal anything from you guys
ever again.

355
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,408
Both of you. Come with me.

356
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,886
What are we doing here?

357
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,725
Well, your boyfriend is so interested
in the Hood...

358
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,043
...I thought he might like to meet someone
who's already made his acquaintance.

359
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,690
Oh, God.

360
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,802
- Who was he?
- Well, that's the thing.

361
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,122
When you're alive, you get a name.

362
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,881
When you wind up down here,
you get a number. Meet 26.

363
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,040
See, your pal the Hood,
he's already sent 26 stiffs down here...

364
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,691
- ...since he started his little one-man war.
- Maybe this guy deserved it.

365
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,003
Maybe he did.
But that's not how justice works.

366
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,329
You see, the vigilante, he doesn't have to
answer to anyone but himself...

367
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,086
...and that's a very dangerous power
to give to any one man.

368
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,605
He saved my life.

369
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,369
How do you know tomorrow
he won't just as easily take it?

370
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,607
- Get out of here.
- Let's go. Come on.

371
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,888
He's safe now, Laurel.

372
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,566
With a hard road ahead of him.

373
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,971
Well, he's lucky to have you in his life.

374
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,244
I know the feeling.

375
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,643
When you first got home,
I didn't think that you had changed much.

376
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,802
But you have...

377
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,651
...and it's nice to see.

378
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,164
Thank you.

379
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,923
GUARD". I have a delivery van coming in
for Ms. Lance. His ID checks out.

380
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,003
Thanks for the heads up.

381
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,686
For Ms. Lance.

382
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,611
What a beautiful home.

383
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,044
Hmm. Such pain here.

384
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,724
A sense of loss and regret, you can feel it,
down to the wood paneling.

385
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,044
Tommy.
Okay, you two stay here with Taylor.

386
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,406
Where are you going?

387
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,408
It's an old house, fuses blow all the time.
It's probably nothing. Just, please, come on.

388
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,086
He's here.

389
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,970
Where's the child?

390
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,085
This house is quite large and I don't
particularly care to check every room.

391
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,048
Very well. Have it your way.

392
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,131
- Laurel. Laurel, don't.
- No, Ollie is still out there.

393
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,681
- What happened to you on that island?
- Let's go. You're about to find out.

394
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,806
Death by poker. That's a new one.

395
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,561
He was gonna shoot me.
And then, uh, Mr. Robbins...

396
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,043
...he grabbed the poker and saved my life.

397
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,486
Mr. Robbins was a real hero.

398
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,682
- If it weren't for him, we'd all be dead.
- I've got enough details for my report.

399
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,201
I'll clear my boys out of here.

400
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,524
Let's go.

401
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,210
Come on, Taylor.

402
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,441
- You still love her. Don't you?
- Doesn't matter how I feel.

403
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,401
Because of what I do...

404
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,329
...I could never be with her.

405
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,645
So you don't have anything
to be afraid of. She is never...

406
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,931
- ...ever going to know my secret.
- It doesn't matter if she knows.

407
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,042
I know. And I don't know how to be
with Laurel knowing the entire time...

408
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,447
...that if she ever found out
who you really are...

409
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,764
...she would choose you.

410
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,610
Thank you for everything you tried to do
for Eric and Nancy.

411
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,121
And for keeping Taylor safe.

412
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,009
Come here.

413
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,004
You keep being a good boy, okay?

414
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,809
Tommy, I really need to talk to you.

415
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,326
What's that for?

416
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,040
It's my stuff.

417
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,486
What's going on?

418
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,966
I'm not sure that I'm ready for the kind
of commitment that you're looking for.

419
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,606
- I don't wanna hurt you in the long run, so--
- Wait.

420
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,250
We both almost lost our lives and I'm
emotional too but you can't be serious.

421
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,164
This is me serious, Laurel.

422
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,683
But it doesn't make any sense,
I mean, why? Why now?

423
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,451
- Why even at all?
- I thought that I wanted this. You.

424
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,607
And the other night made me realize I don't.

425
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,086
You're lying.

426
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,051
I am not a liar.

427
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,886
If you've changed
and I know that you've changed...

428
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,523
...then you would--
You would never do this.

429
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,362
Then I guess I haven't changed
as much as we all thought, then.

430
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,882
I know. You think I'm an idiot.

431
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,889
I always thought you were an idiot.
Now I think you're brain dead.

432
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,084
Yeah, you're probably right.

433
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,210
Look, I don't understand this, Roy.

434
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,768
Why is finding the Hood
so important to you?

435
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,409
I can't stop replaying that night
in my head.

436
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,683
The night I got kidnapped by that psycho,
I just... I thought I was gonna die.

437
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,360
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, because of him.

438
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,122
- You don't owe him anything.
- You're wrong, I owe him everything.

439
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,005
I can't go back to the way things were, Thea.
I can't just go back to being nothing.

440
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,086
You're the one that keeps telling me
that I can be better than who I am...

441
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,647
...and this is my chance to be.

442
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,809
I can't explain it.
It feels like my life is connected to his.

443
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,642
So let's find him.

444
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,124
I can tell this means the world to you.

445
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,451
And you mean the world to me.

446
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,166
So let's find him.

447
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,927
You and me. Vigilante, here we come.

448
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,322
Was hoping you'd be here.

449
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,201
I want us to get back on the same page.

450
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,685
Oliver, we're not even in the same book,
you and me, not anymore.

451
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,685
I just did what I thought I had to.

452
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,851
Just like I'm doing what I have to.

453
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,161
We're done.

454
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,886
Don't do this.

455
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,642
The only thing you have to stop me
from going out that door is an arrow.

456
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,404
Hey.

457
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,649
Where's he going?

458
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,483
So how did our Robin Hood do?
As expected?

459
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,047
So back to the drawing board we go.

460
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,563
- Yao Fei.
- Ba!

461
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,730
How did you escape?

462
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,241
I didn't.

463
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,769
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey.

464
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,291
Your time on this island is at an end.
