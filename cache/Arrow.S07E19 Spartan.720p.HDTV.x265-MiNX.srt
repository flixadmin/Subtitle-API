1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,349
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:03,873
Galaxy One has us
outmanned and outgunned.

3
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:05,206
You want to even the
odds, you get out there

4
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:06,814
and you fight the hell back.

5
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,294
Hyah! Hyah!

6
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:10,602
Uh!

7
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:16,626
Dinah sent you.

8
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,127
Give this to Felicity.

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,747
You military types
are like Swiss watches.

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,721
Youse are always on time. Show me.

11
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:39,649
Show me what you got.

12
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:58,815
Where's Emiko?

13
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,448
Well, if I told you that, Mr. Queen,

14
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,201
she'd have me head. Ha ha!

15
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,799
And, frankly, that's a
part of me I'd like to keep.

16
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,587
- Uh!
- Yah!

17
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,234
That Virgil is damn slippery.

18
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,637
At least now we know what
he's trying to acquire.

19
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,846
A.R.G.U.S. vault drive,

20
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,129
triple-level encryption
for eyes-only documents.

21
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:51,912
If someone at the agency's leaking

22
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:53,676
classified intel to the Ninth Circle...

23
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,876
Right. But if we have some indication

24
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:56,559
as to what they're planning finally,

25
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,802
it might help me find Emiko.

26
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,511
And you said you didn't need any backup.

27
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,846
Yeah. Well, we lost Virgil,

28
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:05,421
but we got what he was after.

29
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,477
This drive feels like our
best lead at finding Emiko,

30
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,853
at least until Archer's back up.

31
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:10,522
Alena is pulling all-nighters

32
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:11,730
to get Archer back up and running,

33
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,595
and once it is, we will
be able to find Emiko.

34
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:16,897
And finally tell her that
Dante killed her mother.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,917
And, hopefully, she'll
come to her senses

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
about the Ninth Circle.

37
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,008
Well, that would be enough for me to

38
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,763
turn myself against
the evil organization

39
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,240
that raised me as a child.

40
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:27,261
- Crap!
- What's that? What's wrong?

41
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,571
The drive has a security fail-safe

42
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:29,883
that fried all the
files, probably to prevent

43
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,256
someone like me from trying to do

44
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,175
what I am trying to do.

45
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,828
But these aren't
A.R.G.U.S.-encrypted protocols.

46
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,168
Someone else must've written the
security program for this drive.

47
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,768
Wait. If it's not A.R.G.U.S., who is it?

48
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,036
Well, I have hacked enough
government servers in my day

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,368
to know that this is the
Department of Defense.

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,240
Not that I do that anymore,
because I work with the SCPD.

51
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:46,650
But this branch is the D.I.A.

52
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:47,800
What would the Ninth Circle want

53
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,408
with the defense Intelligence Agency?

54
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,586
We need to find out.

55
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,902
You're married to the A.R.G.U.S.
Director. Maybe she can help.

56
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,489
Yeah, well, any inquiries to
A.R.G.U.S. will send up red flags,

57
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:58,369
paint an even bigger target on
Lyla's back than there already is.

58
00:02:58,372 --> 00:03:01,331
I think I might have an
old contact at the D.I.A.

59
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,092
A General.

60
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:05,452
The General will be
right with you, gentlemen.

61
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,596
Hey. What's... What's going on?

62
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,993
You're acting like we're being sent

63
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,086
to the principal's office.

64
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:16,384
This guy can be a real hard-ass.

65
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:18,256
Just let me do the talking.

66
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,150
Okay. How do you know him?

67
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:23,779
Ah. I must say, I was surprised
to hear from you, John.

68
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:26,598
Well, sir, I wouldn't have made the call

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,198
unless it was very, very important.

70
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,604
No, I imagine you wouldn't have.

71
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,744
You must be Oliver Queen...

72
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,316
The legendary Green Arrow.

73
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,986
I'm General Stewart.

74
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,622
A pleasure to meet you, General Stewart.

75
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,836
Thank you for taking the time.

76
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,490
I'm not gonna lie, son.
I wasn't always a fan.

77
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:46,367
But since you got out of prison,
you seem like a changed man,

78
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,299
- and I respect that.
- Thank you, sir.

79
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:49,517
Sir, we made the call
because we were hoping

80
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,343
you could tell us what was on this.

81
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,766
Ah. Where'd you get it?

82
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,628
We intercepted a handoff
between an A.R.G.U.S. agent

83
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,390
and a man that works for a
group called the Ninth Circle.

84
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,008
The terrorist financiers.

85
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,343
I heard they were just a rumor.

86
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,154
No, sir, they are very real.

87
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:07,639
And we have reason to suspect
they are planning something.

88
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,733
We were hoping you had
intel that you could give us

89
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:11,004
and the SCPD.

90
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,494
I'm afraid I can't. Heh!

91
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:16,239
But even if I did, John, you know

92
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,704
I can't just hand over classified intel,

93
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,151
not without proper clearance,

94
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,570
which you no longer have
since you left A.R.G.U.S.

95
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,479
Of course. But, sir, we
were still hoping that maybe

96
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:25,657
you could, uh...

97
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:28,117
You were on a path
destined for the Pentagon,

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,421
maybe even a post with the joint chiefs.

99
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:31,663
Now where are you?

100
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,822
Working with the cops,
playing vigilante?

101
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,126
That's no career. That's a dead end.

102
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,244
No offense.

103
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,763
I wasn't even sure you
were keeping tabs on me.

104
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,900
Sir, I had my reasons
for leaving A.R.G.U.S.

105
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,567
You left to protect your wife.

106
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,335
I know you better than you think.

107
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:49,553
And I'm sorry to say you lost your way.

108
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,790
I didn't leave A.R.G.U.S. for my career.

109
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,135
I left to protect my family.

110
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:59,041
And that's not something you
would understand, is it, sir?

111
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,586
John, we should probably go.

112
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,703
Again, thank you for your time, General.

113
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:15,248
I always have time for my family.

114
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,844
Excuse me?

115
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,504
Oh, John didn't tell you.

116
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,271
I'm his stepfather.

117
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:31,816
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

118
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:36,227
Frak! Ugh!

119
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,737
Well, I guess I don't have
to ask how this is going.

120
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,664
Well, as glad as I am that
you both got to meet Laurel,

121
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,254
her cry really did a
number on this helmet.

122
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:47,089
How did it go at the bunker?

123
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,758
Good. The bombs we stole from
Galaxy One are now secure.

124
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,952
Roy and Dinah are setting up a perimeter

125
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,157
in case they ever come looking for them.

126
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,323
And William is making sure
they can't be detonated

127
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,123
unless, well, we say so.

128
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,390
Although maybe he'd be more useful

129
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,627
helping you out with this?

130
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,798
The helmet is inlaid

131
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,491
with this highly advanced circuitry mesh

132
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:05,439
and retinal display,
and I will not be able

133
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:07,239
to figure out why until
I get it up and running.

134
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,349
What do you think you'll find?

135
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,322
Hopefully, whatever Galaxy
One has planned next,

136
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,695
if they haven't stopped from
making the city go boom-boom.

137
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,610
Well, can't we just ask
our man on the inside?

138
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,039
No. We can't come in contact with Rene

139
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,575
until we get the go-ahead from Zoe.

140
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,770
They're at Glades City Hall now,

141
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:21,407
and we don't want to blow their cover.

142
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,983
Okay, so how do we get this
piece of junk up and running?

143
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,410
The power module is comprised

144
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:27,611
with an alloy proprietary to Galaxy One.

145
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,447
I've been trying to work around it,

146
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,059
but I can't without the real thing.

147
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,092
Wait. I thought this helmet was
a one-of-a-kind prototype.

148
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,544
As far as we know. But
the power module is not,

149
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,288
which means we need to find one.

150
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,368
All right, public enemy
number one, sit tight.

151
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:41,000
I know where to go. Be back in an hour.

152
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:42,585
Anyone dealing in secret weapons tech

153
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:43,887
won't be friendly.

154
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:44,963
You need backup.

155
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,817
Better safe than sorry.

156
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,956
Keep up.

157
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,804
Felicity Smoak now entering Smoak Tech.

158
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:57,016
Ohh. I have missed your sweet voice.

159
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,840
You know she's not a real person, right?

160
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,044
Of course she's not.

161
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,905
No. I am just so glad that we were able

162
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:04,649
to start building the program out again.

163
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:06,808
It feels wrong confining
Archer to just one tablet,

164
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:07,911
even temporarily.

165
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:09,585
She deserves to spread her wings

166
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:12,179
right after we find
Oliver's evil half-sister.

167
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,310
Speaking of spreading wings, um,

168
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:16,652
I think I've found a way to
help Smoak Tech really soar.

169
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,815
Oh, yeah?

170
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,255
Yeah. There's someone
interested in buying the company.

171
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,494
It's just you, me, and Archer.

172
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:21,925
I mean, who would be interested in that?

173
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,352
Dr. Will Magnus.

174
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:28,673
What? Huh. The Dr. Will Magnus?

175
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,763
- Mm-hmm.
- The world's foremost authority

176
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,774
- on robotics engineering.
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:35,022
When I was CEO of Palmer tech,

178
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:36,641
he wouldn't even return my calls.

179
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,852
My friend at Magnus
Labs says that Archer

180
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:41,457
could really help Doc Magnus with
these new A.I.S he's building.

181
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,021
I could set a meeting.

182
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,615
Magnus Labs is the gold standard

183
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,252
in tech R&D.

184
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,580
Oh, my god. With their backing,
we could expand Archer to be

185
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:50,834
more than just a genetic tracking system

186
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:51,869
or surveillance for the SCPD.

187
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,070
I mean, it could be a bigger and
better Overwatch system. I mean...

188
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:55,958
It's a chance to change the world.

189
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,243
Uh-huh.

190
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,637
Warning. Intruder alert.

191
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,640
Warning. Intruder alert.

192
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:08,243
Tick-tock, lads. In and out.

193
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,822
Look for the device
drawing the most power.

194
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,958
Ohh. Ohh.

195
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,571
Hidden on a tablet. Ha! Crafty.

196
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,158
Put the tablet down, call your men off,

197
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,094
and I'll let you live.

198
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,105
Felicity!

199
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:53,674
Sorry, love. No can do.

200
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:56,298
Pistol beats keyboard, darling.

201
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,261
Who the hell are these guys?

202
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,759
You're safe now.

203
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,993
They weren't after me.

204
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,958
Oh, my God. She's gone.

205
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,312
They couldn't have
gotten her, could they?

206
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,085
The Ninth Circle has Archer.

207
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,710
Then this crazy Irish
guy came busting through,

208
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,313
and Alena and I tried to fight them off,

209
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:33,590
but then the D.I.A. came crashing

210
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,380
through the ceiling
and took them all out.

211
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:37,057
- What about Archer?
- Virgil made away with it.

212
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,222
We'll get it back. I'm glad you're okay.

213
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,719
How did they find out about Archer?

214
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:42,953
I'll give you one guess... Emiko.

215
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,491
I'm sorry my men weren't
there sooner, Ms. Smoak.

216
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:51,235
It seems the Ninth Circle was
a step ahead of us as well.

217
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:53,154
You must be General Stewart,

218
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:57,107
A.K.A. the stepfather that John
hasn't told his closest friends about.

219
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,832
So this is where you people work.

220
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,230
Impressive.

221
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:07,085
How did your men end up
at Smoak Tech, General?

222
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,937
Several months ago, the D.I.A. got wind

223
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:10,930
of Ninth Circle mole inside A.R.G.U.S.

224
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,367
Since then, we've made it a point

225
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,269
of tracking their activity, including

226
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:16,282
the theft of that drive, which led us

227
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,308
to your friend Virgil.

228
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,948
Wait. Wait. Wait. I thought you
said you didn't know anything.

229
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,267
I said I couldn't tell you anything.

230
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,647
A lie of omission is
still a lie, General.

231
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,650
I'm sorry, John, but it was classified.

232
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:32,961
What was on the drive?

233
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:35,321
A list of assets we have in the field...

234
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,212
Special operatives with
high-level security clearance.

235
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,784
That's why Emiko took Archer,

236
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:40,927
so that she could hunt them down

237
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,453
and then gain access to what they know,

238
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,880
which she could pretty much do

239
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,361
with anybody now that she has their DNA.

240
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,960
It's only a matter of time before
they find everyone on that list.

241
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,887
We need to make sure
those assets are secure.

242
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,314
We have protocols in place.

243
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:54,224
I'll call my assets to a safe house.

244
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:56,926
This is General Stewart. We
need to start evacuations.

245
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:58,570
Uh...

246
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,765
Oliver, before you get started,

247
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,602
I'm fine, man.

248
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:09,081
The second time that you've
broken the chain of command

249
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,608
with a 4-star general.

250
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:11,667
That's not like you, John.

251
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,610
You expect me to say
"yes, sir" to that man?

252
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:18,173
I... you know, I... I'd
like to know why you won't.

253
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,257
And...

254
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:23,511
I would like to know why you never...

255
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:26,205
Never mentioned that
you had a stepfather.

256
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,874
I didn't see much of a need to.

257
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,557
That man has not been in my life

258
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,762
since I left home and
joined the military.

259
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,271
Ok. I just met him.

260
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,877
All I have is my first impression,

261
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,338
and my first impression is that

262
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:39,191
he doesn't seem like that bad of a guy.

263
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:41,938
Oliver, when I first met the general,

264
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,533
he was a lieutenant,

265
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:48,704
my father's CO on a covert military op

266
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,706
to quell an insurgency in Vlatava.

267
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,146
The op went bad.

268
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,951
The unit was pinned down

269
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:57,045
with heavy gunfire from insurgents.

270
00:11:57,047 --> 00:12:01,407
My dad stayed behind to hold them off.

271
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,535
Saved the whole unit.
Stewart made it out.

272
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,265
My father didn't.

273
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,542
So do you blame him
for your father's death?

274
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:13,943
It was his op. He
should've stayed behind.

275
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,005
Six months later,

276
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,216
he's coming by the house for dinner.

277
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,592
Six months, Oliver.

278
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,666
I didn't know.

279
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,255
It was bad enough that, uh,

280
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,666
he just appeared in our lives, but...

281
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:26,724
Once he and my mom got married,

282
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,744
he had me and Andy running

283
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:32,063
spartan survival drills he
learned as a recon marine.

284
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,148
I mean, how long could
we be out in the cold

285
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,442
trying to find our way out of
the woods without a compass.

286
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:37,836
He called it "tough love."

287
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,240
Said he didn't care
how we felt about him

288
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,896
as long as it made us strong.

289
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,044
I don't know. If he was so strong,

290
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:49,122
how could he just abandon
the first rule of the corps

291
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,933
and leave my father behind?

292
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,858
- Thanks. Owe you one.
- You got it.

293
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,260
You get a lead?

294
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,304
Finally, someone not afraid to talk.

295
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,765
There's a guy here trading Galaxy merch.

296
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,142
The only problem is

297
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,103
he's in Deathstroke territory.

298
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,457
Well, that won't be a problem. Trust me.

299
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,887
Trust you?

300
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,165
Funny.

301
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,166
Okay. Are you ever gonna
let me off the hook?

302
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,778
Huh. Doubtful.

303
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,323
Great. Well, you should
let me handle this.

304
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,326
You're backup, remember?

305
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,453
So back me up.

306
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:33,444
Hey. There's a vendor back
there we need to talk to.

307
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,679
And I'm just gonna
let you in because why?

308
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,938
'Cause I'll kick your ass if you don't.

309
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,300
Okay. That won't be necessary.

310
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,802
I got the mark.

311
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:48,306
- From who?
- Your boss.

312
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,117
Check it.

313
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,499
How you know JJ?

314
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,501
You just need to know that I do.

315
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,086
We good?

316
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:07,509
Hey.

317
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,085
Who the hell was JJ?

318
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,537
He's my brother... John Jr.

319
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:15,064
Ha ha! John Diggle has
one son in Knightwatch

320
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,686
and another who's leader
of the Deathstroke Gang.

321
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,596
That must make family
dinners interesting.

322
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,339
Well, he grew up hating my parents,

323
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,097
and the expectations they put on us.

324
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,624
That's why I'm glad that
you finally figured out

325
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:26,310
the truth about your family.

326
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:29,698
Look, I've wanted to tell you
the truth for a long time.

327
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,108
What else don't I know about you?

328
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,161
How long you got?

329
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,389
I don't think that gun's gonna
get any cleaner than that.

330
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:44,022
I just want to be prepared.

331
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,955
I can't slip up with the Ninth Circle.

332
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,366
- And Emiko?
- What about her?

333
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,881
Well, I know you two were close,

334
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:52,120
and you haven't said a thing
about her since she went all evil.

335
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:55,173
I'm not so sure she's all evil.

336
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:57,133
When we were at the airfield,

337
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,135
there was a moment when Emiko and I

338
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,828
were alone, and...

339
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:03,831
She had the upper hand.

340
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,001
I thought I was dead.

341
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,726
I mean, I should have been dead,

342
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:09,387
but she let me go.

343
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,171
And that tells you what?

344
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:14,088
I don't know, but it can't be as simple

345
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,320
as her being all bad.

346
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:16,823
I mean, we've all gone through paths

347
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:18,251
where we've come to regret.

348
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:20,187
Hell, if Laurel can redeem herself,

349
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,066
then maybe Emiko can do the same.

350
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,127
We got a problem, people.

351
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,388
What's going on?

352
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,496
I just got off the
phone with intelligence.

353
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,335
All of our assets have been
accounted for, except one...

354
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,742
An undercover agent by
the name of Julian Sison.

355
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,030
He should be at a safe house,

356
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,796
but there's been no response
since the call came in.

357
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,899
Where is the safe house?

358
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,335
30 miles northeast of here.

359
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,418
We'll get into it.

360
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,433
I'll check with the other
assets, see if there's been any...

361
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:43,647
I'll come with you.

362
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:47,591
Somebody needs to keep an eye on you.

363
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:50,353
You think I'm trying to mislead you?

364
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:52,972
"Fool me once," right?

365
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:55,066
That's not very fair, John.

366
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:58,161
It's okay. You can come.

367
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,746
Follow my lead.

368
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:08,629
This place is a pigsty.

369
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,207
Either he's messy as hell...

370
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,317
Or someone made it that way.

371
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,378
Overwatch, any sign of our guests?

372
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,123
I'm getting 3 heat sigs further in.

373
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:23,812
Come on, people!

374
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,397
What the hell's going on?

375
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,214
- Are you Julian Sison?
- Yeah.

376
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:29,667
Then why didn't you
answer your transponder?

377
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:35,449
'Cause I'm in the middle of an op,

378
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,284
and you three just blew it.

379
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,046
Overwatch, there is no sign of Emiko

380
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,523
or the Ninth Circle.

381
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,918
If this guy isn't the
target, then who is?

382
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,300
Those are my assets.

383
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,706
Overwatch, we have men down.

384
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,425
The Ninth Circle knew we were coming.

385
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,810
Uh!

386
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,284
General, we've been looking for you.

387
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,558
I'm trying to track John's
spartan helmet, but it's offline.

388
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:29,917
Clearly this was an elaborate
play to draw General Stewart.

389
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:32,284
We need to find he
and John, and quickly.

390
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,142
I'll put a bolo out for both of them.

391
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,325
I'll put the word out around The Glades

392
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,226
in case Emiko shows up in the old 'hood.

393
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:39,279
Or we just find Emiko and end all this.

394
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,564
We will. We have found
people without Archer before.

395
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,366
We will find John and his stepdad,

396
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,960
and then we will find your sister.

397
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,501
Kidnapping a 4-star
general is a risky move

398
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:48,788
for the Ninth Circle,

399
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,548
especially if the Pentagon's on to them.

400
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,366
So why? Why do it?

401
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:54,199
I don't know. We need to
find out more about who he is,

402
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,411
what makes him so important.

403
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:58,205
I'd imagine his files are
really, really classified.

404
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,152
"Really, really classified"
sounds really, really fun.

405
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:01,643
I'm on it.

406
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:11,886
General?

407
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,764
John, are you all right?

408
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,015
Yeah. You?

409
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,559
I've taken worse hits than this.

410
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,102
Where do you think we are?

411
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,322
I don't know.

412
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,325
Maybe a Ninth Circle
safe house. I don't know.

413
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:29,070
They must've found out
I was looking into them.

414
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,081
Agh! We got to get the hell out of here.

415
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,786
You're not going to will those
things into breaking, John.

416
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,988
Do you not remember
anything I taught you?

417
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,356
How could I forget?

418
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:45,795
I know I was hard on you, son,

419
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,314
but I wanted you to be prepared.

420
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,834
It paid off.

421
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,481
Look at you now.

422
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:57,139
Really? We're captured,
probably gonna die in here.

423
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:59,642
We're not dead yet.

424
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,936
Uh! Uh!

425
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,863
What about your helmet?

426
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,314
Yeah. Yeah, that could work.

427
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,811
If we could get to it, I could
send a signal to the others,

428
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,236
tell us our location.

429
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:25,972
Time for us to have a
little chat, General.

430
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,215
- Hey.
- Yeah.

431
00:19:46,906 --> 00:19:48,713
- Oh, good work.
- Thanks.

432
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,387
All right. Anything in the file

433
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,653
that will help us find them?

434
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,501
No. But, uh, plenty on why the
Ninth Circle would want him.

435
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,198
Okay.

436
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:58,801
Thrice-decorated commander
of the 1st recon battalion

437
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,512
during the Khandaq conflict, after which

438
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:02,938
he was appointed commandant
of the marine corps,

439
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,207
then chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff.

440
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,976
I mean, the guy is a real
bona fide American hero.

441
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:10,546
Not to John. John blames General Stewart

442
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:14,175
for his father's death during a mission

443
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,027
they were both on in Vlatava.

444
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,937
Oh, yeah. That would
be enough to alienate

445
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,606
someone like John, and why he
wouldn't have told us about him,

446
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,728
but it's not true.

447
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:24,152
Which part?

448
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:25,554
According to the
Pentagon's official account,

449
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:27,111
the vlatava mission
was so successful that

450
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,039
the general was actually,
for a stint of time,

451
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,399
appointed head of DARPA.

452
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,029
But if... if the mission was a success,

453
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,401
why would he lie to John about it?

454
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:37,921
To protect him?

455
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:43,722
It's been a long time since we've
seen each other, Agent Diggle.

456
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:44,914
Go to hell.

457
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,280
Hold that thought.

458
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:48,417
I want the codes to project Cygnus X-1.

459
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,879
My name is General Roy Stewart.

460
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,452
Serial number 498003145,

461
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:55,829
United States marine corps.

462
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:59,571
Yes, yes. The military's
trained you well,

463
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:03,408
but you'll break eventually.

464
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:07,770
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

465
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,156
Now let's try it again, General.

466
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,233
The codes, project Cygnus X-1.

467
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,919
My name is General Roy Stewart.

468
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:18,498
Serial number 498003145...

469
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,565
Enough! I guess we're
gonna have to do this

470
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:22,552
the hard way.

471
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,473
Leave him alone.

472
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,099
This has nothing to do with him.

473
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:29,735
Give me the codes or...

474
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,677
Don't tell him anything.

475
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,260
Stop. Stop it! I'll tell you. Stop.

476
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:43,114
5693016.

477
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:45,617
Now, was that so hard?

478
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,626
You all right, John?

479
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:56,711
Why did you give him the code?

480
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:01,489
A thank you would be good enough.

481
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:03,574
What the hell is Cygnus X-1 anyway?

482
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:06,009
Something we don't want the
Ninth Circle to know about.

483
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:07,515
Now, let's get out of here.

484
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,342
There's a box cutter on the table.

485
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:13,229
I got something better.

486
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:22,895
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:25,490
You really don't remember
anything I taught you, do you?

488
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:28,860
With enough pressure
applied at a steady pace,

489
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,872
a shoelace can saw through plastic.

490
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,900
Damn. There's no power.

491
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,238
How about we give it a boost?

492
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:06,939
John's helmet just came back online.

493
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,558
Morse code... SOS. Location?

494
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,130
Warehouse in the meatpacking district.

495
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,358
Call the team.

496
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,208
Clear.

497
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:24,457
You know, you could be court-martialed

498
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:26,448
for giving up that info to Dante.

499
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,138
It was a necessary risk.

500
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:29,929
You don't leave a man behind.

501
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:36,284
Sooner or later, they're gonna
send someone looking for us.

502
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:07,438
Let's get you the hell out of here.

503
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,150
That's got to sting.

504
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,005
Yeah, I've been through worse.

505
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:17,549
What'd the Ninth Circle
want from you, General?

506
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,398
Access to an experimental
weapon I oversaw

507
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:21,603
during my tenure at DARPA...

508
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,763
Cygnus X-1.

509
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:26,273
The project was shelved
because it was too dangerous

510
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:28,035
and unstable.

511
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:30,779
The goal was to genetically
engineer bacteria

512
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,424
to consume the by-product
of nuclear fission.

513
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:34,525
So it's a biological weapon

514
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,861
that can literally eat through anything.

515
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,485
That's terrifying.

516
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:39,542
A weapon like that falls in the
hands of the Ninth Circle, we're...

517
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,198
It won't. We're gonna stop them.

518
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,576
The problem is I don't know where it is.

519
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:45,690
Archer.

520
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,162
Great.

521
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,797
They are going to use

522
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,558
the intel they get from the assets

523
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,044
to locate the DNA of the
people involved in Cygnus X-1.

524
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,458
That DNA can lead them

525
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,213
to exactly where that weapon is.

526
00:24:57,658 --> 00:25:00,034
If I can piggyback off Archer's signal,

527
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,718
I'll be able to...

528
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,228
Lead us right to them.

529
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,096
It's like we're tracking
the DNA of a DNA tracker.

530
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:07,151
This is so meta.

531
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:08,980
We need to be ready the
moment they reactivate Archer.

532
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,682
It's the only way to
locate her signature.

533
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,846
Yeah, like one of those FBI movies

534
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,643
where you have to keep the kidnapper
on the line to trace the call.

535
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,559
Yeah, except the kidnapper
is the tech I invented,

536
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,473
which almost makes me wish I hadn't.

537
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,402
What happened to Archer
putting Smoak Tech on the map?

538
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:20,662
Well, that was before I realized

539
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,081
all the bad that she could do.

540
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:24,011
I wanted to invent something
that would help save the city,

541
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:26,450
and instead I made something
that can destroy it.

542
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:30,233
Oh, my God. I'm a mad scientist.

543
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:32,003
Oh, my God, no. It's
so much worse than that.

544
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm my dad.

545
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,877
I am your friend who has
some real-life experience

546
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,550
working with evil geniuses,

547
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:39,472
and you need to trust me on this one.

548
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,350
You are not one of them, okay?

549
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,185
Okay.

550
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:46,304
You gonna tell me what's
really bothering you?

551
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:51,123
I love Team Arrow, but it is not enough.

552
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:52,875
I need to do something separate.

553
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,185
I need to do something separate

554
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:55,146
that can still do good,

555
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:56,587
and that's what Archer
was supposed to be.

556
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,255
You know, my way of making
my mark on the world,

557
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,868
and not as Overwatch.

558
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,129
As me.

559
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:03,330
Well...

560
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:06,116
It can still be that.

561
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:07,659
We just need to get Archer back,

562
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:09,494
and when we do, you
just need to figure out

563
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:12,473
how to make sure that
your beautiful creation

564
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,433
is used exactly the way you intended.

565
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:18,729
You got this, Smoak.

566
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:26,043
Normally I'm the one off by myself

567
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,988
staring into nothing.

568
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,437
That's usually true.

569
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,847
Usually I'm the one with
the father-son issues.

570
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,872
Oliver, people's lives are in danger

571
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,000
because my stepfather
couldn't be honest with me.

572
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:44,154
It j... it just surprises me
that you don't see his position.

573
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:47,057
You know, he's at the top
of the chain of command.

574
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,510
The John Diggle that I know,

575
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:51,327
he would have done the exact same thing.

576
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:53,514
Oliver, it sounds like
you're on his side, man.

577
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:57,259
I'm on your side, but I'm
looking at a guy over there

578
00:26:57,261 --> 00:27:00,499
who cares for you, who
was trying to protect you.

579
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:03,190
Frankly, he deserves a
little bit more of your trust.

580
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:09,720
What is this?

581
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,281
Those are the unredacted files

582
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:14,535
from the Vlatava mission.

583
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:18,372
Your father didn't die saving his unit.

584
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:22,751
According to that, he died
because he was negligent.

585
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,547
And he took two marines with him.

586
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,858
The only reason that
anyone got out of there was

587
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,231
General Stewart.

588
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,025
That's not possible.

589
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,463
It's all in there.

590
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:37,057
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, John.

591
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:48,217
One Galaxy One power module.

592
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,737
I guess there are perks to having

593
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,572
a gang leader black sheep brother.

594
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,807
Hmm. Sounds like my kind of people.

595
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,486
When do I get to meet him?

596
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:59,437
I don't know. I haven't
seen JJ in a year,

597
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,064
maybe more.

598
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,927
Funny thing is he used
to be my best friend.

599
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,237
What happened?

600
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,450
Ah, he and my dad started butting heads.

601
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:14,002
Guess I got caught up in the middle.

602
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:15,829
And this Deathstroke thing,

603
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:18,006
that was just a way to rebel.

604
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:21,793
I just thought one day, he'd outgrow it.

605
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:24,003
But I tried to reach him.

606
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,774
In the end, I think I just reminded him

607
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:30,056
of everything my mom and
dad expected him to be.

608
00:28:32,304 --> 00:28:33,929
I'm sorry.

609
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:35,649
Ain't your fault.

610
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:38,268
No. I just...

611
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:41,338
Got so mad at you for
lying to me that I...

612
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,225
I never thought about

613
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,477
how much it must've sucked for you,

614
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,280
and not having anybody
to share things with.

615
00:28:50,282 --> 00:28:52,991
You know, this life.

616
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:55,594
It was unfair to both of us.

617
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,214
Hey.

618
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:01,183
JJ has a message for you.

619
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,485
Hey!

620
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,546
This way. Run!

621
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:26,166
Get back!

622
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:38,823
Ahem. It's time to go.

623
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,014
Hey, guys, we found the weapon.

624
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,499
Well, technically, the Ninth
Circle did using Archer.

625
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,619
Felicity and I rode their coattails

626
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,517
right into the secure facility,
where it's being stored.

627
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,711
Yup, that's definitely
a secret weapons depot.

628
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:51,045
Okay, well, now that we
know where we're going,

629
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:52,601
we just have to figure
out how to get past Archer.

630
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:54,027
The moment you set foot on-site,

631
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,604
the Ninth Circle will
know that you're there.

632
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:56,679
So we lose the element of surprise.

633
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:57,700
I'll call my team.

634
00:29:57,703 --> 00:29:58,961
No. Wait.

635
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:05,280
We got this.

636
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,457
Copy that.

637
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:11,378
Let's move.

638
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,000
Perfect.

639
00:30:43,003 --> 00:30:45,182
Perimeter breach detected.

640
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:48,132
Scanning intruders' DNA. Identifying.

641
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:50,374
It's your brother and his friends.

642
00:30:50,377 --> 00:30:51,611
Stop them.

643
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:55,572
Overwatch, do you have a bead on Emiko?

644
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:56,825
I'm hacked into the exterior cameras,

645
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,194
but she must already be inside.

646
00:30:58,197 --> 00:31:00,353
Without Archer, it's
like I'm flying in blind.

647
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:01,993
Isn't that what these boosters are for?

648
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,939
Yes. Once you've planted
the signal boosters,

649
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,740
I will be able to take back
control of Archer and find Emiko.

650
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:07,858
Go find your sister.

651
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:09,461
We'll plant the boosters.

652
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,266
Oliver, you have company.

653
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,262
Archer has our positions locked.

654
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:28,931
Where are we with the boosters?

655
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,008
Boosters are in place and activated.

656
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,360
Good to go, Overwatch.

657
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:37,681
We have uplink.

658
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,225
It's not working.

659
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,757
I can't get through their firewall.

660
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,332
Wait. They locked you out
of your own program? How?

661
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,975
I don't know, but whatever they did,
I can't get back control of Archer.

662
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:47,327
Get down!

663
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:53,381
We need an exfil route now! Now!

664
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,923
Most black-level facilities
follow the same blueprint.

665
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,094
There should be a
door near your position

666
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,680
that leads to an access tunnel.

667
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:05,635
Are you sure?!

668
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,684
Trust me.

669
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:09,439
Let's move! Move!

670
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,112
We're clear, General. Thanks.

671
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:27,634
Emiko is headed to the
parking garage with the weapon.

672
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:30,196
What the hell are you doing?

673
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,477
I'm infecting it with a
self-destruct protocol.

674
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:33,922
Those boosters were the only reason we

675
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:35,114
were able to access Archer.

676
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:36,617
If the Ninth Circle
gets their hands on it,

677
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,324
we may never be able
to access Archer again.

678
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,687
Well, what about all your
hard work, your legacy?

679
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,711
I guess I'll just have
to build a new one.

680
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:02,365
Archer's gone down.

681
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,635
It doesn't matter. We
got what we came for.

682
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:06,162
Take the weapon and go.

683
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:08,164
Me and my brother have
unfinished business.

684
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,614
Emiko!

685
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,508
You need to listen to me.

686
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:35,465
You need to hear this.

687
00:33:35,468 --> 00:33:38,060
Dante's been lying to you.

688
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,896
He killed your mother.

689
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:42,240
Liar.

690
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,928
Aah. Ugh.

691
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,105
Hyah!

692
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,645
Listen to me.

693
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,051
He set all this in motion.

694
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:23,439
He used the Ninth Circle's
resources to cover it up.

695
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:28,251
He misled you. He
doesn't care about you.

696
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,124
I do.

697
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:46,053
Emiko.

698
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:47,491
I told you to go.

699
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,630
And I told you I won't leave you.

700
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:04,008
We're currently in a tie
between good news and bad news,

701
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,335
the good news being
that I destroyed Archer,

702
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,545
which I can't believe
I'm counting as good news.

703
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,046
The bad news is the Ninth Circle

704
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:12,118
got away with a very
dangerous biological weapon.

705
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:14,245
How did things go with Emiko?

706
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,223
I told her that Dante killed her mother,

707
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:17,997
and it didn't make any difference.

708
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,769
I guess bad news wins this round.

709
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,602
We need to plan our next move.

710
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,763
What is our next move?

711
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:25,469
Start by figuring out

712
00:35:25,494 --> 00:35:28,276
what the Ninth Circle
intends to do with Cygnus X-1.

713
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:31,112
I should take this to the D.I.A. brass.

714
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:33,698
Thank you.

715
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,492
I'll walk you out.

716
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,250
Hey.

717
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:43,866
I know how much you wanted
Oliver's plan to work.

718
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:45,869
Maybe I should be
grateful that I can finally

719
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,593
get to see Emiko for who she really is.

720
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:48,617
Maybe.

721
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,281
It doesn't make it hurt any less.

722
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,296
Hey, I, um, ahem,

723
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,885
wanted to say thank you.

724
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:57,471
I know this...

725
00:35:57,474 --> 00:35:59,123
I know I haven't made it easy for you.

726
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:02,397
This is the most time
we've spent together

727
00:36:02,422 --> 00:36:03,634
since you turned 18.

728
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:06,050
As hard as it may be to believe,

729
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:08,014
I'm grateful for it.

730
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,307
Yeah, I'd prefer a round of golf

731
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:14,305
to kidnapping and... And torture.

732
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:17,826
I know you might not feel the same way,

733
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:23,267
but you will always be a son to me.

734
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,242
Oliver told me the truth about Vlatava,

735
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:29,745
about my father.

736
00:36:29,747 --> 00:36:32,284
Why did you let me believe a lie?

737
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:34,940
You let me hate you.

738
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:40,423
Every child deserves to believe

739
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:42,541
that his father is a hero.

740
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:45,353
And believing it, you became one.

741
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:49,131
If he could see you today,

742
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,283
I know he would be so proud of you.

743
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:00,785
If I'm a hero...

744
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:05,154
It was all because of you...

745
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:08,877
Sir.

746
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,537
- John.
- Yes, sir.

747
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,191
Call your mother.

748
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:36,678
I figured out the silver lining

749
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:39,932
to the whole torpedoing
our only viable product is

750
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,892
that we are gonna save
so much money on servers

751
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:44,094
because Archer was a power suck.

752
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,521
Not even a chuckle.

753
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:47,844
I guess I'm not really in the mood

754
00:37:47,846 --> 00:37:49,319
for the whole dark humor thing,

755
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:51,327
what with our only viable
product being destroyed and all.

756
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:54,071
I'm sorry I destroyed our golden goose.

757
00:37:54,073 --> 00:37:56,969
Golden egg. Goose?

758
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:58,866
You know, we could rebuild.

759
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:03,005
Make it better, less stealable.

760
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,624
Heh.

761
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:09,179
When you were uploading
the self-destruct code,

762
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:12,423
I copied Archer's root code.

763
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:18,780
But with that and your
notes, we could start over.

764
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:21,816
No. I appreciate that.

765
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:23,927
But as long as Archer's out there,

766
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,695
it could fall into
the wrong hands. And...

767
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:28,030
I don't know what my
legacy's going to be,

768
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:29,940
but it can't be that.

769
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:31,150
Well, that sounds like someone

770
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:32,651
who hasn't heard Doc Magnus' offer.

771
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,965
Relax. I know.

772
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,824
Legacy trumps payday.

773
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,683
Oh, I'm really glad you're
the CTO and not the CFO,

774
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,292
because the CFO wouldn't be so chill

775
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:44,973
about me deleting our only, only asset.

776
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:47,291
I have a question. Do we have a CFO?

777
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,251
No. Quick question, do we need one?

778
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,012
Hmm, I think we should probably focus

779
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:52,814
on coming up with our next project,

780
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,724
one that makes us a lot of money.

781
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,726
Yes. One that can help people

782
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:59,511
but also not lead to mass destruction.

783
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:00,794
Ohh, if we have to.

784
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,523
Yes, we do. We must.

785
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:06,793
Hey, for what it's
worth, being Overwatch

786
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:08,479
won't be your only legacy.

787
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:12,755
It'll be whatever you do
next here at Smoak Tech.

788
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:16,528
Because it's not Archer that
was destined to change the world.

789
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,507
It's you... Felicity Smoak.

790
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:20,758
Thank you.

791
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,617
Heh.

792
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,436
All right, madame helmet,

793
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,563
let's see what you're hiding.

794
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:38,151
Here goes nothing.

795
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:43,621
It seems like it worked.

796
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:44,793
That's not possible.

797
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:45,916
What is it?

798
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,141
This helmet is a satellite
to a much larger network.

799
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:49,871
Galaxy One was able to expand Archer.

800
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:52,449
Hold on. I know big
brother getting bigger

801
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:56,197
isn't exactly great, but isn't
Archer just a surveillance program?

802
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:57,292
No, not if you weaponize it.

803
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,889
Wearing one of these would be like
wearing an A.I. powered sixth sense.

804
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:02,730
Pair that with tech-enhanced
strength and agility.

805
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,658
One of those troopers
was able to take out

806
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,184
half the Canaries.

807
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:09,790
A whole army of them,
they'll be unstoppable.

808
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,416
Acquiring that weapon
was a great victory,

809
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,752
but Oliver Queen is still a threat.

810
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,200
You need to deal with your
brother before he jeopardizes

811
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:27,820
the last phase of the plan.

812
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:31,718
I couldn't agree more.

813
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,021
But first things first.

814
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,184
You lied to me, you betrayed me,

815
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,220
and you killed my mother.

816
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,364
No.

817
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,944
Emiko, you don't understand.

818
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,538
Stop lying...

819
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,773
- Uh!
- And tell me why.

820
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:56,750
She was the last reminder
of your former life.

821
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:59,300
Your mother was making you weak

822
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:00,831
just like your father did.

823
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,572
And I needed you strong

824
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:06,076
to lead the Ninth Circle.

825
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,705
She was the only family I had.

826
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:10,373
No, we are your family.

827
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,585
Don't you see? I did it for you.

828
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:16,546
Uh!

829
00:41:16,548 --> 00:41:21,402
This is for my mother.

830
00:41:21,404 --> 00:41:23,153
Rot in hell.

831
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:39,982
