1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:06,087
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,166
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,218
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,796
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,219
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,097
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,682
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,146
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,774
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,196
<i>Twelve markers, twelve metas.</i>

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,025
Your body's deteriorating
faster than the chair can handle.

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,576
I didn't just take Dominic's body,
I took his ability.

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>Sylbert Rundine
can shrink objects</i>

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,788
<i>and return them to original size.</i>

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,490
<i>Deacon controls technology.</i>

17
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,496
<i>Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck.</i>

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,747
<i>There was nothing keeping him</i>

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,045
<i>from going in the meta-wing
and absorbing the powers.</i>

20
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,544
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,624
How's this?

22
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,505
<i>- I believe you're looking for me.</i>
- It's Ralph.

23
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,712
<i>Barry Allen is hereby
released immediately.</i>

24
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,014
He only wants the bus metas,
he wants their powers.

25
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,057
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm a dead man?

26
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,324
Addie, hey, what's going on?

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,327
- I think you should talk to Cap.
- About what?

28
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,495
Just go see him, Allen.

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,660
Okay.

30
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,751
<i>...will no longer tolerate</i>

31
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,753
<i>the behavior that the previous
administration practiced.</i>

32
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,004
Addie said you wanted to see me.

33
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,380
- Yeah. Shut the door.
<i>- I promise you.</i>

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,838
<i>We will root out all corruption
at all levels...</i>

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,265
<i>...and restore your faith
in public servants.</i>

36
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,308
<i>The name Van Buren is a name
that has always stood for integrity.</i>

37
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,809
<i>I may be the mayor...</i>

38
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,350
We've got a problem
that I'm not sure how to fix.

39
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,560
All right.

40
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,645
Some people don't think
you should be back on the force.

41
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,859
- Because of DeVoe?
- Hmm.

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,402
I was cleared of all charges.

43
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,738
I didn't do anything.
I mean, he is alive.

44
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,071
I know, and he's been cooperating.
Coming in, answering questions.

45
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,372
So, what's the problem?

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,042
Look, people nowadays
will believe anything.

47
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,828
Fake news, social media.

48
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,130
Allegations are treated as facts.

49
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,132
But DeVoe being alive,

50
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,678
showing up in the courtroom
at your appeal hearing?

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,547
Some people in Central City
don't buy it's actually him.

52
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,891
- Who do they think it was?
- Who the hell knows?

53
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,809
But we live in a city
full of meta-humans.

54
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,808
It's a conspiracy theorist's dream.

55
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,768
So, what does this mean?

56
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,432
Are you firing me?

57
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,851
Not firing.

58
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,776
But I have been asked to request
that you take a leave of absence.

59
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,191
By whom?

60
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,447
Thinks it will be easier for everyone.

61
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,283
Restoring the faith and all that.

62
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,413
For how long?

63
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,618
Indefinitely.

64
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,498
Look, Barry.

65
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,623
If you want me to fight
this thing, I'll do what I can,

66
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,128
but this new mayor, she's got a lot
to prove since the Bellows' debacle.

67
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,005
When do you think I can come back?

68
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,054
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,851
It's not permanent, is it?

70
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,689
Well, he said it was indefinite.

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,897
They wouldn't have given you
your ID back if it was for good.

72
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,982
I mean, maybe this is
for the best, Barry.

73
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,159
I mean, you need to prove
that DeVoe is still alive

74
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,952
and you can do that now as the Flash.

75
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,199
Yeah, maybe.

76
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,780
How are we doing with him by the way?

77
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,617
We know that we still have
four bus-metas left to find.

78
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,327
And that DeVoe has absorbed the powers

79
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,755
of Kilg%re, Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm and Dwarfstar.

80
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,957
Fallout is safe with Tracy.

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,167
But the Weeper is MIA.

82
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,342
DeVoe must have him.

83
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,636
Well, that just leaves Ralph.

84
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,339
Ralph is safe with us,
but the other four metas aren't.

85
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,224
DeVoe will absolutely kill them
and take their powers.

86
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,642
But why does he need their powers?

87
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,186
I can't figure out his endgame.

88
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,605
I don't know. I just know that
these last four metas are the key.

89
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,104
- That's why we need to find them.
- Find them we will.

90
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,976
Where have you guys been?

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,653
A little home away from home,
otherwise known as the bus depot.

92
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,276
Thought I'd show Cisco here

93
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,359
an old PI trick I learned
from my mentor, Columbo.

94
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,575
Lost and found box from meta bus 405.

95
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,780
Question for the room.

96
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,617
How did I get stuck doing
the buddy-system thing with Ralph?

97
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,669
It's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

98
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,418
Yeah, it's the best way
to keep Ralph safe, Cisco.

99
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,250
Oh, clearly, you've never had
to stay over at an apartment

100
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,087
that uses neon beer signs for lamps
and a kitchen sink for a shower.

101
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,594
Ralph, I love you,
but you sleep on a futon.

102
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,799
Futon is not that bad.

103
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,100
It is when it's damp.

104
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,176
Why is it damp?

105
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,931
I sweat a lot when I sleep.

106
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,311
You're nasty.

107
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,390
Huh.

108
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,568
Hey, my retainer.
I've been looking for this.

109
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,686
Retainer.

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,980
Okay. You've made your point.

111
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,862
Not that the point needed to be made.
I'll take the next shift.

112
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,159
You're a good man, Barry Allen.

113
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,153
Really, who uses CDs anymore?

114
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,748
A musician trying to catch their break.

115
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,918
Izzy Bowin.

116
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,256
Ugh.

117
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,718
Country. Music's tone-deaf step-child.

118
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,761
All right. You remember anyone
on the bus with a fiddle?

119
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,715
There was a guy with a cowboy hat on
sitting behind me.

120
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,886
Maybe it was him?

121
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,717
Boy, I sure wish we had
a way of finding out.

122
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,439
Izzy Bowin.

123
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,529
Izzy, you wanna give us
a little mic check?

124
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,874
<i>Check one. Check, check one, two.</i>

125
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,829
Okay, well, it's a her, not a him.

126
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,085
And she's playing
a gig at The Busted Saddle.

127
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,167
All right. Ralph, let's go.

128
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,423
No, no way. I hate country music.

129
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,013
Well, buddy system.
It's my turn. Come on.

130
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,715
If you insist.

131
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,739
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

132
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,831
She's good.

133
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,966
She's improving,
but she lacks refinement.

134
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,764
So you're not impressed by her at all?

135
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,261
The resting face of my current visage

136
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,143
may be more pleasant
than the one I used to display.

137
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,191
But I assure you,

138
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,111
this is not the look of a man

139
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,984
awed by symphonic greatness.

140
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,532
Clifford. Clifford.

141
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,571
This body, it's deteriorating.

142
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,196
Rapidly.

143
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,824
The additional dark matter
in your system

144
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,377
from each of your new powers
is wearing down your host.

145
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,206
It's draining too much
of this body's new energy.

146
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,592
Then I must move into the next one.

147
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,044
But you said that
Izzy Bowin wasn't ready,

148
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,470
that we needed to find another.

149
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,260
We don't have time.

150
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,012
We must act now.

151
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,515
We may be too late.

152
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,900
- Izzy Bowin?
- That's me.

153
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,156
My name is Barry Allen.
I'm with C.C.P.D...

154
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,699
Is that a label?

155
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,788
- Um...
- Maybe on another Earth.

156
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,588
Okay. Well, you want an autograph
or a phone number or something?

157
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,713
Uh... No, no, nothing like that.

158
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,591
Okay. If it ain't business,
and it ain't pleasure,

159
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,173
then we got nothin' left
to talk about now, do we?

160
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,715
Oh.

161
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,602
- Do it again next week. Great work.
- Thank you.

162
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,687
Okay, I'm sorry. Let me explain. Um...

163
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,978
Uh...

164
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,611
Someone very smart

165
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,327
and very dangerous is coming after you.

166
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,403
Me?

167
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,697
Yeah.

168
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,793
Okay, now, why in the name of God

169
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,166
would anybody dangerous
be coming after me?

170
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,589
Because you have powers.

171
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,627
Four months ago, you were
on Central City bus 405.

172
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,800
That bus got showered with dark matter

173
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,471
and made everyone on it a meta-human.

174
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,510
Now the person responsible for doing
that wants those powers for themself.

175
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,979
Okay, and let me guess.

176
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,852
You boys are here to protect me?

177
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,683
Something like that.

178
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,569
Look, we can explain more later,

179
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,771
but now, we just need you
to come with us.

180
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,773
Oh, no. That's not necessary.

181
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,826
My daddy bailed,
Mama bailed not long after.

182
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,325
I have been looking out
for myself my entire life.

183
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,949
This time, it's different. You can't.

184
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,750
Please, we need to go.

185
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,202
I ain't going anywhere
with either of you.

186
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,832
I think you should reconsider that.

187
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,085
I don't give a damn what you think.

188
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,426
I guess now we know what her power is.

189
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,937
- What?
- What?

190
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,932
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

191
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,687
You two are lucky.

192
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,525
Barry, your ear's almost healed.
And Dibny, yours just stretched.

193
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,572
I still can't hear all that great.

194
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,662
Consider that a blessing in disguise.
Less twang in your future.

195
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,955
Give it an hour, you'll be fine.

196
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,704
So, Izzy Bowin can control music.

197
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,080
More like sound waves.

198
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,627
Soundwave. That's a great name.

199
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,372
It would be, if it wasn't already
taken by a Transformer.

200
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,456
Mmm.

201
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,710
Okay, well, it looks like billions
of tiny shrapnel ripped through this.

202
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,923
Exactly. Sound is just the force
of billions of tiny gas molecules

203
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,348
colliding into one another.

204
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,721
So if you can harness
an amplified kinetic energy, you get...

205
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,019
Molecular shrapnel.

206
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,678
Okay. We've got to keep searching.

207
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,809
If we can't track her down soon,

208
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,515
she's gonna fall right
into DeVoe's hands.

209
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,812
Speaking of tracking people down,

210
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,644
when is Harry getting back from Earth-2?

211
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,446
DA Cecile Horton.

212
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,824
Harry, hey. When did you
get back from your Earth?

213
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,780
Just got back. I'm getting
myself a little pick-me-up.

214
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,035
You and me both, kid.

215
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,451
- Okay. Good talk.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,713
Actually, I don't think
that pregnant people

217
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,789
are supposed to consume caffeine.

218
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,005
Uh, yeah. Doctor says
one cup a day is fine.

219
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,678
And Lord knows I need it...

220
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,301
I need it more than
you can possibly imagine.

221
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,886
Apparently. Must be exhausting.

222
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,684
It is. He's keeping me up all night.

223
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,597
He? I thought Allen said
you're having a girl.

224
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,148
Yeah. I'm not talking about the baby.
I'm talking about Joe.

225
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,770
Joe is keeping me up.

226
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,486
Harry, come here.

227
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,402
My newfound ability
to hear people's thoughts.

228
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,821
- Yeah. I can hear...
- Oh. I thought...

229
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:09,333
Joe, his thoughts. I can hear them
while he's asleep, all night long.

230
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,955
- You hear his dreams.
- Yup.

231
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,001
And they're crazy and fast
and, oh, so very loud.

232
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,209
It is like living in the middle
of an action movie, Harry.

233
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,380
I love Joe West with all my heart,
but I'm telling you I just can't...

234
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,305
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,224
I can't take it anymore.

236
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,302
Yeah, that sucks to hear, Cecile Horton.

237
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,137
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

238
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,565
Actually, I might be able
to build something

239
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,732
that could help you with that.

240
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,152
- Yeah.
- Oh, Harry, thank you.

241
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,906
Satellite's been running all day,

242
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,451
but it's still not picking up
any irregular sound variances.

243
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,704
I checked the city. I can't find her.

244
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,201
- Babe, you checked the whole city?
- Yeah.

245
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,619
Look, we have to find her
before DeVoe. Her life's on the line.

246
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,204
She had another gig this week.
I doubt she'd skip town.

247
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,506
How would Dibny PI suggest we find her?

248
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,461
Well, since you asked.
Has anyone checked her website?

249
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,171
"Has anyone
checked her website?"

250
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,177
Dibs, of course,
we've checked her website.

251
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,895
No one has checked her website? Iris!

252
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,849
Yeah, I'm on it. I'm looking now. Um...

253
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,855
Guys, she's still in town.

254
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,812
"I just picked up
the first run of my next single.

255
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,693
Love the geniuses at Saloon Sounds."

256
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,987
All right, Ralph. Take two.

257
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,489
- Cisco, we might need Vibe's help.
- Giddy up.

258
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,780
Come on. Let's go, we're in a hurry.

259
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,624
Izzy Bowin?

260
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,917
We need you to come with us.

261
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:34,993
Flash?

262
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,620
You're in danger.

263
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,542
I know. Everybody keeps telling me that.

264
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,795
You're gonna keep hearing it
until it sinks in.

265
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,000
You just have to trust us.

266
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,927
We're not gonna hurt you,
but we know someone who will.

267
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,546
Who is gonna hurt me?

268
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,926
I am.

269
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,605
You all came to warn me about her?

270
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,565
DeVoe.

271
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,728
Hello, Flash.

272
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,150
You're gonna leave Izzy alone.

273
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,152
You know, you really don't learn
from our past encounters, do you?

274
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,782
You're not smart enough to stop me
from getting what I want.

275
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,206
And what I want now is her.

276
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,500
That's not gonna happen.

277
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,128
It's three against one, genius.

278
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,963
Check your math, Vibe.
It's three against six.

279
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,426
Though, I doubt I'll need to use
all of my powers against you.

280
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,276
You stay away from me!

281
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,248
You just hurt DeVoe.

282
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,583
Who the hell is DeVoe?

283
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,678
So you're telling me
that this three-foot tall chick

284
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,810
that tried to kill me is actually this

285
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,732
Clifford DeVoe?

286
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,851
Yeah, 100% dude.

287
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,523
Mmm-hmm. DeVoe is transferring his
consciousness to the other bodies

288
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,403
of all the other people
who were on the bus

289
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,859
and got their powers with you.

290
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,989
Wait. This little girl wants my body?

291
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,949
It's why we were trying to protect you.

292
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,957
DeVoe has already taken
most of his targets.

293
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,787
No. This ain't happening. Not now.

294
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,626
I only got my powers recently.

295
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,008
And now it's like
I've got a deeper connection

296
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,131
to my music than I've ever had.

297
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,635
I'm about to record
the rest of my new album...

298
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,091
Izzy, your album can wait.
This threat is real.

299
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,976
So is my big break.

300
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,223
Do you have any idea
how hard I've had to work for this?

301
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,106
I left my home.

302
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,564
I lost friends and good men.

303
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,398
And I have put up with more crap
than you could imagine,

304
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,232
so that one day I'd get my dream.

305
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,321
And now you're telling me

306
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,621
that some pint-sized lunatic
is just gonna take it all away?

307
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,416
Which is exactly why we want you
to stay here at S.T.A.R. Labs.

308
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,336
Why? You're all gonna
protect me or something?

309
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,122
We're gonna train you.

310
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,628
- We are?
- We are?

311
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,968
Guys, her powers weakened DeVoe.

312
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,220
Izzy, that makes you
our best shot at stopping him.

313
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,218
No, no. This is all too much.

314
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,803
I don't even know who you people are.

315
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,927
We don't have time for this.

316
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,594
Flash!

317
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,141
You're that guy from before.

318
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,646
Yeah. Barry Allen.

319
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,477
And so are you, aren't you?

320
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,899
Yeah. Ralph. Ralph Dibny.

321
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,406
I'm Cisco. Cisco Ramon.
It's nice to meet you.

322
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,239
Okay, thank you.
Look, look, I don't need training.

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,332
Especially from you.

324
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,910
All I need is my life back.

325
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,375
I don't know, guys.

326
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,708
I kinda feel like if I just
followed her into that hallway

327
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,464
and just gave her one of those
"hey, look" inspirational talks,

328
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,795
I could probably get her to stay.

329
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,554
Then what are you still doing here?

330
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,091
Sorry, I don't know if you drew
straws for this stuff or something.

331
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,642
- No, go!
- Okay.

332
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,808
I'd watch out if I were you.

333
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,940
Sometimes, killer robots
come out of there.

334
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,821
Keep walking, Stretch.

335
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,991
I don't talk to creeps in dark hallways
dressed in purple leather.

336
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,944
It's actually more of a mauve.

337
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,158
And I'm not a creep.

338
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,241
Look, Izzy, I know how you're feeling.

339
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,044
The day you got your powers,
I was on the same bus.

340
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,591
So that evil chipmunk,
she wants to kill me, too.

341
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,712
Please. I think I'd remember
seeing you on my bus.

342
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,347
Actually, I was kind of
big-boned back then.

343
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,979
I was on a strict diet of gin,
doughnuts, and regret,

344
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,689
but I got another shot at it.

345
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,107
And I worked my tight butt off,

346
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,856
and now I'm the hottest
superhero in town.

347
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,019
Please.

348
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,898
My life, it's never been better.
Kinda like yours.

349
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,280
Yeah, but aren't you
afraid of losing it all?

350
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,952
Yeah, I am.

351
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,371
Which is why I'm a part of this team.

352
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,245
You said that your family bailed on you,

353
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,999
so I can understand why you wouldn't
trust someone to look out for you,

354
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,921
but, Izzy, I can tell you firsthand

355
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,755
that these amazing weirdos,
they won't bail.

356
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,795
They created a buddy system for me.

357
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:43,182
And if you'll stay,
they'll keep you safe.

358
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,054
I promise.

359
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,907
So, who's gonna be my buddy then?

360
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,618
I may have to pull some strings,
but I will see if I'm available.

361
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,621
Subject 9's sonic powers

362
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,298
accelerated the deterioration
of your internal organs.

363
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,173
She merely disrupted
my atrial flutter and bradycardia.

364
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,550
This body is nearly drained anyway.

365
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,883
Its palliation is a waste of time.

366
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,970
I need these biometric scans
to fully assess your ailments.

367
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,056
Then you should have
built this to work faster.

368
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,026
I'm doing all I can.

369
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,196
Yet, you achieved precisely

370
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,523
the opposite!

371
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,990
I couldn't idly stand by
and watch you be injured.

372
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,786
Your plan was failing.

373
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,079
Is it possible that
the repeated transference

374
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,831
has affected your cognitive functioning?

375
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:58,052
There is nothing wrong with my mind.

376
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,730
Next time, I will keep a level head.

377
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,653
Izzy, this will help
focus your powers.

378
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,155
Well, this ain't much help in a fight
unless you're dueling the devil.

379
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,486
Don't think of it like a weapon.

380
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,951
Just do what you've
always been dreaming to do.

381
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,449
Make your own sound.

382
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,586
You my new target, Stretch?

383
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,592
Yeah, 'cause I don't break so easy.

384
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,971
Please.
You're built like a twig.

385
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,342
DA Cecile Horton, you look tired.

386
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,095
Yeah. That's 'cause I am tired.

387
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,720
This thing, it doesn't work.

388
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,803
It works because I built it,

389
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,762
and "this thing," as you
so inelegantly put it,

390
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,689
happens to be a mental activity dampener

391
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,392
that is 10 pounds of cerebellum-proof,

392
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,775
anti-telepathy somno-steel.
Thank you very much.

393
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,784
Yeah, that's the problem.
It is 10 pounds of that stuff.

394
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,819
- So?
- Okay.

395
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,867
Okay.

396
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,161
And?

397
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,877
I can't sleep like this,

398
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,175
Harry, does this look
comfortable to you?

399
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,342
I was pulling state-of-the-art
technology out of my ass

400
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,843
to help you with your problem.

401
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,676
I forgot to make things
"comfortable" for you.

402
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,682
Are you kidding me?
You know what else I forgot?

403
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,762
I guess I also forgot,

404
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,597
while I was coming up
with generational breakthrough

405
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,432
in vibrational brainwave theory,

406
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,438
that I was working
for the Princess and the Pea.

407
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,771
Stop it! Stop. Put it down.

408
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,154
Harry, put it down.

409
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,700
Okay, just...

410
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,742
What the hell is wrong with you?

411
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,914
I'm frustrated.

412
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,747
- You're frustrated?
- Yes.

413
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,878
You start yelling at me
and throwing things.

414
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,048
It's like every awful thought
that you have

415
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,848
just comes pouring out of your mouth.
Totally unfiltered. I don't even...

416
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,929
Is this normal behavior for you?

417
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,392
Sometimes behavior.

418
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,730
Okay. If I wanna hear
a grown man scream like a child,

419
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,561
I will go home
and listen to Joe's stress dreams

420
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,112
about showing up naked to math class.

421
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,941
- Ew.
- Just take your thing, Harry.

422
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,776
- See you later.
- It's heavy.

423
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,703
You missed. Again.

424
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,961
Well, what do you expect, Ralph?
I've been doing this all day.

425
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,132
I need a water break.

426
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,681
- Maybe we should call it a night.
- Not yet.

427
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,804
She's barely landed
another shot on Ralph.

428
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,226
She needs more time, Bar.

429
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,771
She held her own against DeVoe.
Totally on raw instinct.

430
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,190
Beginner's luck?

431
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,480
I mean, it took months to train Ralph.

432
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,560
We don't have months.

433
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,944
Look, this is our chance
to get ahead for once.

434
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,740
If DeVoe shows up again,

435
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,318
we have to be ready.

436
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,164
All right, Ralph. I'm taking over.

437
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,667
Uh, thanks, Bar, but we kinda
got this covered over here.

438
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,537
Gotta push her, Ralph.

439
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,499
All right, Izzy. I wanna see
if you can hit a moving target.

440
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,127
- Okay.
- You're ready?

441
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,594
Nice.

442
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,637
Take it up a few notches.

443
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,946
Ow!

444
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,786
Barry!

445
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,029
Whoa.

446
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,758
How's Izzy?

447
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,103
She just needs a couple stitches,
and she'll be okay.

448
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,682
Ralph won't leave her side.
I think he might really like her.

449
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,813
Ralph shouldn't be bothering her at all.

450
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,860
I mean, she needs to stay focused.

451
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,108
Izzy might be scrappy,

452
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,986
but, you know,
it's her first day training

453
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,692
with powers
she's had for a little while.

454
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,947
I know.

455
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,536
Barry, don't you think
you're being a little hard on her?

456
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,830
No. I'm trying to teach her
how to protect herself.

457
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,411
No. It seems like you're trying
to turn her into a hero.

458
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,835
And that path just
isn't meant for everyone, Barry.

459
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,334
I mean, Izzy's just trying to survive.

460
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,540
Well, she's not going to,
if I don't push her.

461
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,259
You think this is the only way
to fight DeVoe?

462
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,715
It's not just about that.

463
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,506
Iris, you weren't at Iron Heights.

464
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,435
I saw up close what DeVoe did
to Becky. To all of them.

465
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,511
They...

466
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:46,850
And I couldn't do anything except
just stand and watch it happen.

467
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,898
DeVoe is ruthless.

468
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,865
He is not gonna stop until he's
taken her powers and her life.

469
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,281
He's not gonna go easy on her,
so neither can I.

470
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,123
I'm so sorry that
you had to experience that,

471
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,750
but Barry, we can't be
ruthless like DeVoe.

472
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,042
He is willing to sacrifice
anyone and anything.

473
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,505
Just remember that the next time
you're pushing too hard, okay?

474
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,429
You, of all people, know that
heroes aren't made overnight.

475
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,526
Joe's not here.

476
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,894
Why would I want to talk to Joe?

477
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,606
I kinda figured after
our last conversation

478
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,566
you would never want
to speak to me again.

479
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:37,984
That's fine.

480
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,950
You do know
I can hear your thoughts, right?

481
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,030
Right.

482
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,411
No, Harry, I'm not gonna
yell at you again.

483
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,958
Okay. Good.

484
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,869
Here.

485
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,541
- That's a...
- Mental activity dampener.

486
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,881
Sorry version 2.0.

487
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,758
You have to adhere it
to your supraorbital ridge.

488
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:58,838
It will block West out.

489
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,389
Look, I'm sorry about...

490
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,894
You know, I just recently
can't seem to stop DeVoe.

491
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,687
Can't stop my daughter Jesse
from hating me.

492
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,981
Can't seem to stop blowing it

493
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,979
when I'm trying to befriend
someone who's my own age.

494
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,438
Did you just say "befriend"?

495
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,236
That's what you've been trying to do?
You've been trying to befriend me?

496
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,189
Well, yes, through transitive property.

497
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,404
I respect West, West respects you, so.

498
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,987
Harry, that was borderline sweet.

499
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,196
Thank you.

500
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,283
- Okay, we'll talk.
- When?

501
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,793
- Now.
- Okay.

502
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:29,915
Okay.

503
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,084
- I'm not much...
- Come on, Harry.

504
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,048
Okay.

505
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,006
What do you wanna talk about?

506
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,384
Oh, okay. I'll start. Um...

507
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,680
You wanna tell me how this thing works?

508
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,976
Does it keep Joe's brainwaves
blocked out?

509
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,179
Does it keep my mind
reading waves locked in?

510
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,559
Mostly disrupts
the inbound brain activity,

511
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,188
but I suppose actually,

512
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,270
if you were to reverse the polarity.

513
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,948
Wow. That is interesting.

514
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,986
- Also...
- Yes. Harry, you have to do that.

515
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,696
- Right.
- Right now.

516
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,407
- Okay, good chat.
- Okay.

517
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,963
Should be good to go.
Might leave a little scar though.

518
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,169
Wouldn't be my first, doc.

519
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,126
Probably won't be my last.

520
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,882
It will be
if I had anything to do with it.

521
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,009
Why would you have
anything to do with it?

522
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,051
I am gonna go.

523
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,769
What are you doing?

524
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,852
The way I see it,
I've got more hurt here

525
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,277
than I ever did fighting DeVoe.

526
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,946
So I'm not going to spend
another second training.

527
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:42,150
Okay, that is a really bad idea.

528
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,452
I've already hurt Devoe

529
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,159
by myself without y'all.

530
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,664
I can do it again.

531
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,836
Izzy, the only way for you to
stay safe is for you to stay with us.

532
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,381
It's the buddy system, right?

533
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,633
You're not my buddy, Ralph.

534
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,420
Hey, hey, hey.

535
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,390
Don't do this.

536
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,895
Sorry, Ralphy.

537
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:24,405
Initially, I envisioned
the mental activity dampener

538
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,407
as just disrupting
inbound brainwave broadcast,

539
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,830
but I talked to DA Cecile Horton,
and we had the idea

540
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,534
to invert the polarity,
allowing this to disrupt

541
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,583
outbound brainwave
broadcast as well. So we...

542
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,665
- We could use this against DeVoe.
- "We could use this against DeVoe."

543
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,124
That's brilliant.

544
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,380
I'm totally on board
except mental activity dampener.

545
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,223
Ramon, the name's no good.
Which is why, drum roll please,

546
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:52,054
I've decided to rename
this the cerebral inhibitor.

547
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,062
<i>This is where we came up</i>

548
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,017
with the cerebral inhibitor
to use against DeVoe.

549
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,316
What's that? What are you guys doing?
What are those faces?

550
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,240
When Savitar came to S.T.A.R. Labs,

551
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,285
he said that we would build
a device to use against DeVoe.

552
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,703
The cerebral inhibitor.

553
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,496
I wish I had known that
before I spent all this time

554
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,789
trying to come up with a second name.

555
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,911
Naming is hard.

556
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,742
Okay. So we can use this on DeVoe

557
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,419
to keep him from projecting
his consciousness into new bodies?

558
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,372
- Precisely.
- How does it work?

559
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,049
Just fix it to his forehead,
it activates. Simple as that.

560
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,047
I'll make a few adjustments,
you'll be good to go.

561
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,127
All right.

562
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,804
Okay, when Harry's done,
we go after DeVoe.

563
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,803
I mean we have Izzy's powers,
the cerebral inhibitor.

564
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,634
We have everything that
we need to stop him.

565
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,475
Except that we don't. Izzy's gone.

566
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,888
What? What happened?

567
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:36,973
What did you say to her?

568
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,308
- Me?
- Yeah.

569
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,735
Rookie, homeslice
hit the road because of you.

570
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,146
She's convinced she can
take on DeVoe by herself.

571
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,572
That's what she's gone to do.

572
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,951
You kept pushing and pushing.
You pushed her right out that door, man.

573
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,072
Okay, that's not fair.

574
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,449
No, it's all right. I did.
I pushed her too hard.

575
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,870
It's my fault she's out there, but
if DeVoe gets to her before we do...

576
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,576
That cannot happen.

577
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,835
Cisco, you gotta use your E.S.P.N.
and find out where she is.

578
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,914
Give me that.

579
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,097
Hey, blondie.

580
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,264
You want trouble? Here I am.

581
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,435
Well.

582
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,269
Look who finally decided
to show her sorry face.

583
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,450
Nobody likes a Peeping Tom.

584
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,495
Goodbye, Mr. Ramon.

585
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,787
Cisco, are you okay? Can you hear me?

586
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,622
She's at the warehouse district.

587
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,165
DeVoe is there.

588
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,542
I can't go with you guys.
I gotta take care of Cisco.

589
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,252
Okay, Ralph, it's just me and you.
Come on.

590
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,016
Bravo, Miss Bowin.

591
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,313
Of all my subjects, you're the only one

592
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,812
to mount a credible defense against me.

593
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,361
Darlin', you talk too much.

594
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,826
A modicum of bad luck
at a time like this.

595
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,782
How unfortunate.

596
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,618
You're quite the fiddler.

597
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,123
The Fiddler.

598
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,706
Mr. Ramon might say, "Nailed it in one."

599
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,968
Ralph?

600
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,509
You came after me.

601
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,680
We all did.

602
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,220
All right, Ralph, I'll keep DeVoe busy.
You just get the inhibitor on.

603
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,562
Hello, Mr. Allen.

604
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,766
DeVoe, you're not getting her.

605
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,363
Flash!

606
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,168
Poor Dominic.

607
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,247
He didn't know he could
affect minds as well as read them.

608
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,426
Now I have taught you
what a brain aneurysm feels like.

609
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,671
Get out of here.

610
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,312
Aw, crap!

611
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,820
Thank you, Mr. Rundine.

612
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,121
That will teach you
to mess with a country girl.

613
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,662
Cerebral inhibitor is attached.

614
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,914
- Is it working?
- It's working.

615
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,090
How did Mr. Deacon put it?

616
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,671
Ah, yes.

617
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,346
Call me Kilg%re.

618
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,272
What the hell?

619
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,600
Did she hack the inhibitor?

620
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,683
No, that's impossible.

621
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,861
There's a kill-switch microchip that
prevents the patch from networking.

622
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,573
I can hear your radio signal, Mr. Wells.

623
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,491
You told me once
I wasn't as smart as I thought.

624
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,115
<i>Wrong again.</i>

625
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:28,913
Izzy!

626
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,724
- Ralph?
- Hey.

627
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,760
Get her out of there!

628
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,061
<i>Ralph, we can't.</i>

629
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,180
Get her out!

630
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:49,892
We can't.

631
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,118
Izzy, just look at me.

632
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,303
Izzy, keep looking at me.

633
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,202
Much better.

634
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,083
Please inform Mr. Ramon

635
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,585
that while I had no need for all

636
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,132
<i>six of my powers,</i>

637
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,004
<i>I now have a seventh.</i>

638
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm afraid I'm gonna be busy
with my wife this weekend, Ralphy.

639
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,923
No.

640
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,307
- How's Ralph?
- Not great.

641
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,727
This shouldn't have happened.

642
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,138
DeVoe wasn't supposed
to walk away from this.

643
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,315
Yeah, well, he did. Because of me.

644
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,937
We all tried to protect her.

645
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,314
I built the inhibitor, Snow.

646
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,525
If it failed, it's my fault.
I don't even know why.

647
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,982
Maybe I overestimated
the microcombustion infrastructure.

648
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,568
Maybe I underestimated
the amount of time

649
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,903
between each synapse router.

650
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,487
Or maybe it didn't malfunction at all.

651
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,829
Guys, Savitar said that we would use
the cerebral inhibitor against DeVoe.

652
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,205
Yeah. He didn't say it was gonna work.

653
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,002
Or it didn't work because...

654
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,919
I'm not smart enough to make it work.

655
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,585
- Harry, where are you going?
- Out.

656
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,005
- Guys, we have to find DeVoe again.
- How?

657
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,637
Cisco tracked down DeVoe in his Vibe
state and almost got himself killed.

658
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,807
Actually,

659
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,679
we might have a different
way of pinpointing him.

660
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,472
Check this out.

661
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,482
Space.

662
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,351
The final frontier.

663
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,194
Now you see it.

664
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,147
Now you don't.

665
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,734
That's exactly what it looks like
when DeVoe disappears.

666
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,202
That is the warping signature

667
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,123
of someone moving into
a pocket dimension.

668
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,410
Does someone wanna explain
what that means?

669
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,539
Einstein postulated

670
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,622
that it was theoretically possible
for a region specific fold

671
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,129
in the space-time to exist between

672
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,005
the four dimensions
that we typically think of.

673
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,548
Yeah, that doesn't help.

674
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,381
It's another dimension.

675
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,843
One that you can enter or exit
at any location in the world.

676
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,724
Like how DeVoe captured me
in that alley,

677
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,056
but then he brought me back out
just somewhere above the city.

678
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,309
Are you saying that DeVoe's lair
is in a pocket dimension?

679
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,144
- Cisco, that is great.
- Can we track him?

680
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,396
That I'm still working on.

681
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,480
Okay. Work faster.

682
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,611
Just do your best, all right?
Let's find him.

683
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:29,987
All right.

684
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,118
- I'm gonna go check on Ralph.
- All right.

685
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,543
You were right.

686
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,498
As much as I want to get DeVoe,
and get back to our lives,

687
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,458
I can't rush this.

688
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,169
It's gonna be
a little hard for a speedster.

689
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,380
Especially an unemployed speedster.

690
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,556
Don't worry.
You're gonna find something.

691
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,099
And until then?

692
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,060
You can start by kissing your wife.

693
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,811
- Someone looks busy.
- Yeah.

694
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,990
I have a little bit of work.
Why don't you have it, okay?

695
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,658
- Harry.
- Yes.

696
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,077
- I wanted to say thank you.
- For what?

697
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,871
The M.A.D. 2.0, it worked like a charm.

698
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,994
I am rested.
If you could just do something

699
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,541
about these swollen
pregnant ankles of mine.

700
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,789
Edema is a normal thing.

701
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,836
You drink lots of water.
Don't cross your legs when you sit.

702
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,131
Okay. Thank you for the info.

703
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,628
It's the least
I could do after all the...

704
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,009
Mmm.

705
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,882
Rage. I have a problem with rage.

706
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,430
Apparently, it tends to crop up
when I make mistakes.

707
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,633
Makes it tough to be human.

708
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,387
The humans are a tricky species.
Anyway, I apologize.

709
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,017
Apology accepted.

710
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,772
- You just needed somebody to talk to.
- Yeah.

711
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,893
Yeah, I guess you're...

712
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,441
Are you doing that thing
where you're reading my mind?

713
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,522
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

714
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,366
Maybe. Yeah.

715
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,318
Yeah, I am. You should call her Harry.

716
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,404
Jesse's on a different planet,
DA Cecile Horton.

717
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,034
But this problem
isn't gonna just go away.

718
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,114
What if she...

719
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,917
What if she doesn't come?

720
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,295
You're not gonna know
unless you invite her.

721
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,769
That was beautiful.

722
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,274
And a welcome change
from the derivative pablum

723
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,400
this body subjected us to before.

724
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,444
Our plan is back on schedule.

725
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,527
Indeed, it is.

726
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,201
Only a few more subjects left to locate.

727
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,139
Hey, man.

728
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,231
- I can come back.
- No, it's okay.

729
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,108
Look, um, I totally understand

730
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,033
if you need some time
away from the team.

731
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,999
I mean, to lose someone
right in front of you.

732
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,293
Especially
someone you care about.

733
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,374
Izzy was very special.

734
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,249
Yes, she was.

735
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,753
But, now,

736
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,094
DeVoe is still out there.

737
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,218
And until that threat's over,

738
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,604
you gotta keep this buddy system going.

739
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,600
I thought
you might say that, Allen,

740
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,736
which is why I got you this.

741
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,443
You want me to be your partner?

742
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,697
Oh, hey, come on.
This Turner don't need no Hooch.

743
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,831
But I do know what it's like
to get fired from C.C.P.D.

744
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,832
when you didn't even
really break the law.

745
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,712
You absolutely broke the law.

746
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,667
And I remember after I lost my job,

747
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,836
I felt like I lost
a piece of my identity.

748
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,047
And now, you won't have
to deal with that problem.

749
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,175
So the next time we're out in the field

750
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,804
and somebody asks you who you work for,

751
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,012
you won't have to get all stammery.

752
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,097
You like me.

753
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,728
You really like me.

754
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,821
Don't go getting
all soft on me now, rookie.

755
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,322
You and I, we gotta stand up
and we gotta fight back.

756
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,112
- Just like Izzy would want it.
- That's right.

757
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,741
There's three more people
out there who need our help.

758
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,418
And we need to find them
before DeVoe does.

759
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,412
And after we do that,

760
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,290
I'm gonna take DeVoe down.

761
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:59,314
