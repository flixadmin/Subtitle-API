2
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:04,932
I find any communication

3
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:08,733
of a non-mathematical
nature very difficult.

4
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:15,141
Because I don't talk much, people think
I don't have anything to say,

5
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,150
or that I'm stupid.

6
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,358
And that's not true.

7
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,275
I have lots of things to say.

8
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,275
I'm just afraid to say them.

9
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,233
I know that I'm strange in lots of ways.

10
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:41,275
I think I see the world
in a different way to other people.

11
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,775
I've always been like that.

12
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,358
Would you like to play with it?

13
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:05,608
Are you scared it will eat you?

14
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,483
No.

15
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,650
Is it because it's a toy?

16
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,442
No. Because stegosauruses
aren't carnivores.

17
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,900
So, Nathan, what do you like?

18
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,400
I imagine there's things
that you don't like.

19
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:27,567
Maybe, say, when meal times change?

20
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:31,192
Yes. Yes, he is fussy about his food.

21
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,942
Nathan?

22
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,275
Nathan?

23
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:39,650
I... I like patterns.

24
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:42,692
And what does it feel like
to see a good pattern?

25
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:44,775
Nice.

26
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,942
They're pretty colours.

27
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,650
So, it's positive.
Nathan is certainly on the spectrum.

28
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,432
Traits of autism combined
with synaesthesia,

29
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,775
sensitive to a change in light and pattern.

30
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:03,974
These can be gifts, of course, but they
do come with some big challenges,

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,733
socially and emotionally, which will
stay with Nathan all of his life.

32
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,275
But there is no question;
That he's a unique young man.

33
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,016
Give Mum a wave. Bye, Mum.

34
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,317
Bye.

35
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,650
Bye.

36
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:37,025
You know what I was thinking?

37
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,891
You know, sometimes it might seem like

38
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,775
we don't always understand
what it's like to be you.

39
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,141
It's like you've got these special powers,

40
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,859
like a wizard.

41
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:55,234
And we're just Muggles
that don't understand how you do it.

42
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,067
It's like a different language to us.

43
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,525
But even though we don't always
understand each other, Nath,

44
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:10,359
it doesn't mean that any of us
ever stops loving each other.

45
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,567
Does that make sense?

46
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,442
Nathan, look at me.

47
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,234
But you shouldn't be afraid.

Just hold my hand.

59
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,266
Please, Nathan.
Nathan, just hold my hand. Just this once.

60
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,984
It's okay. We'll do this together.

61
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:42,984
Come here, darling. Darling, come on.

62
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:46,442
Nathan. Please, don't. No, Nathan!

63
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,484
Hey.

64
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,859
Gosh.

65
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,400
That looks complicated.

66
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,900
That's not schoolwork then?

67
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,275
Wait, why don't you try
and explain it to me?

68
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:19,775
I might be able to help you.

69
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:21,525
Hmm?

70
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,150
You can't.

71
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,442
Why not?

72
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,525
You're not clever enough.

73
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,192
So, Nathan, this is the big school.

74
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,433
When you're older,
you'll go here every single day.

75
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,025
Watch out.

76
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,567
We're just gonna start things early.

77
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,692
It's nothing to be frightened about.

78
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,025
Don't run in the corridor.

79
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,567
Excuse me.

80
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,650
Excuse me!

81
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,442
There you go.

82
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,942
Oh, that's subtle.

83
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,891
- Ah, really subtle.
- What? We're not... We're not doing anything.

84
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,933
"We're not... We're not...
We're not doing anything."

85
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,192
Give me that now!

86
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,525
Is this drugs?

87
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,692
Go on, piss off.

88
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,734
We're so lucky.

89
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,683
- Mr Humphreys.
- Yep.

90
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,442
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,484
How old are you? Five?

92
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:02,150
No, Nathan is nine.

93
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,683
His mum got in touch because
of Nathan's rather advanced interest

94
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:09,349
in numbers and patterns and his primary
schoolwork was no longer testing.

95
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,400
Mmm, I can see why, yeah. Bit of algebra.

96
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,734
Mmm, distance geometry.

97
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,525
Where'd you learn all this, mate?

98
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,266
Mr Humphreys just joined
our maths department.

99
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:24,224
He was a bit of a maths whizz
when he was young, Nathan.

100
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:27,099
- Not really, it was a long time ago.
- No, no, no.

101
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,567
He competed in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

102
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,275
- Olympiad?
- Olympiad, yes. The IMO.

103
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,567
Did you know you could win
medals for maths, Nathan?

104
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:43,317
Just like sport, only for people who
are really, really strong up here instead.

105
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:48,400
Mrs Ellis, if Mr Humphreys is willing

106
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:53,525
I think that we can absolutely begin offering
Nathan some special advanced tuition.

107
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,025
Can't we?

108
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,317
Okay, yeah.

109
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,275
Why don't you walk properly?

110
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:17,317
That's very direct of you.

111
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,192
I've got multiple sclerosis.

112
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:25,400
What about you?

113
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,275
Why are you weird?

114
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:32,609
- I've got special powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,775
Can you fly?

116
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,151
Can you turn things to ice?

117
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,891
Are you really good at maths?

118
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,058
Ah, yeah. Ah, fair play.

119
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,151
Well, listen, I should tell you,
I'm not a very good teacher.

120
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,183
I barely encourage myself
to get out of bed,

121
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,058
let alone inspire some kid
with special powers

122
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,725
who wants to spend
all his spare time doing maths.

123
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,234
So as long as we're clear.

124
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:55,350
What's that for?

125
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,766
It's to give it a shake.
It's my hand, isn't it?

126
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,683
- It's what men do when they agree.
- I don't like doing that.

127
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:03,016
Yeah, well, we all have
to do things we don't like doing,

128
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,359
but we fucking do them, don't we?
So give it here.

129
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:08,192
What does "fucking" mean?

130
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,317
All in good time, son.

131
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:12,600
Right then.

132
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,817
We'll start with some
probability, shall we?

133
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,901
Like what's the probability of me
remembering any of this shit.

134
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,141
I can't hear you.

135
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:26,692
I said, let's do tree diagrams, shall we?

136
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:28,725
Mr Humphreys?

137
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,442
Yes, Mr Ellis.

138
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,817
What was the Olympiad like?

139
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,942
Mind your own business, nosy.

140
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,692
Boom.

141
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,151
Do you know what this means?

142
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,766
Go on, Sir Nod-A-Lot, tell me,
what does it mean?

143
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,026
A toss.

144
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:46,776
Toss?

145
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,567
How dare you?

146
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,276
Yeah, the coin toss. Well done.

<i>of triangles FAB, BCD, DEF respectively.</i>

163
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,225
Nathan! Breakfast!

164
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:05,016
<i>And let P denote
the perimeter of the hexagon.</i>

165
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,526
Nathan! Breakfast!

166
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:13,683
<i>Prove that RA plus RC plus RE</i>

167
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:17,817
<i>is greater than or equal to P over 2.</i>

168
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,109
Here.

169
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,609
- It doesn't matter if you don't get in.
- Of course it matters.

170
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,984
Got twisted. Okay? Good.

171
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,109
Good luck.

172
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,891
- Get a job.
- You get a job.

173
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:41,558
- I'm trying. I've handed CVs out.
- You've got a CV?

174
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,308
Yeah, obviously. I don't wanna
sit on me arse all day, you know.

175
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,975
- And even If I do, you're sat next to me.
- No, I'm not.

176
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,766
Yeah, you are.
Joined at the friggin' hip.

177
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,817
Are you listening to our conversation? Eh?

178
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:54,276
- No.
- What?

179
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,651
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure about that?

180
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,651
- Better not be.
- No.

181
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:31,391
- You're late.
- Sorry, mate.

182
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,317
I had a quick look at it first. Shh.

183
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:36,484
It's a piece of piss, really.

184
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,526
Well, not really, but...

185
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,234
You know, just do your best.

186
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,526
It's the biggest day of
your life, mate, innit?

187
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,817
Don't feel any pressure.

188
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:48,975
I'm a bit nervous.

189
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,317
Are you nervous?

190
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:52,058
- A little bit.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

191
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,391
Because you're brilliant.

192
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,651
Are you ready?

193
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,100
Yeah.

194
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,359
Yeah?

195
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,651
On your marks, get set...

196
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,401
Come on, my son.

197
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,817
I'll just be over there, out the way.

198
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,558
<i>Question one.</i>

199
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,201
<i>Are there infinitely many pairs of
positive integers 'mn', such..."

200
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,350
<i>Question one.</i>

201
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,891
<i>Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers 'mn'</i>

202
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,859
<i>such that both m divides
n squared + 1 and...</i>

203
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,350
<i>Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers 'mn'</i>

204
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:40,859
<i>such that both m divides n squared + 1
and that n divides m squared + 1?</i>

205
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:51,475
When will we find out?

206
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:53,776
Uh, about a week, probably.

207
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:58,567
It's all right, mate. Relax to the max.
Take a chill pill.

208
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:02,567
Talking of which, this hill's a killer.

209
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,484
Do you mind if we take the weight off?

210
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,151
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hang on.

211
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:14,192
Go on then, hit me.

212
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,734
- Hit you?
- Ask me the fucking question!

213
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:24,484
Why did things go wrong for you,
at the Olympiad?

214
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,317
There's lots of reasons, really.

215
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,776
My "thing" was kicking off
around that time.

216
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:36,651
My ailment.

217
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,151
Cutting me down in the prime of my life.

218
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,234
I just sort of lost it.

219
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,026
I can't lose it.

220
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:52,026
Nathan, you haven't gotta
prove anything, all right?

221
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:57,234
What's important is that you enjoy
doing it--maths. And you do, don't you?

222
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,600
So whether you get on the team or not,

223
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,109
you're gonna do amazing
things in the future.

224
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:06,234
You haven't.

225
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:09,401
Well, thanks a lot.

226
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,609
You charming little bastard.

227
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:18,984
Hi. Hi.

228
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:22,141
Um, can I order number 47, please,

229
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,975
with, um,

230
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,734
seven prawn balls
and a small chips, thank you.

231
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,317
It come with six balls, number 47.

232
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,651
Yeah, I know. Usually...

233
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,142
Sorry, are you new?

234
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,475
It's just we come here all the time

235
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,225
and it's usually just fine,
you give us an extra ball.

236
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,767
Number 48 is a large prawn ball meal.

237
00:17:44,768 --> 00:17:47,600
You get nine balls, large
chips and crackers.

238
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:48,850
Yeah, I know.

239
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,475
No. Sorry.

240
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:51,558
Sorry.

241
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,850
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers
and he likes to have a small chips.

242
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,526
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

243
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,725
My son, he's quite picky

244
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:05,017
and he needs the meal number
to be a prime number

245
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,267
and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

246
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:09,475
And, um,

247
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:13,100
if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

248
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,100
and number 48 isn't...

249
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:16,933
Isn't... Isn't a prime...

250
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:19,484
Is it? Is it? I don't know. Yes, I do.

251
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,276
Um, yes, no, I'm right.

252
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,318
47.

253
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,818
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

254
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,776
There we go. A big fat "well done".

255
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:48,234
It's all spilt out.

256
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,901
Oh.

257
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:56,267
No, no, it's fine.
Nathan, Nathan, don't get upset. It's fine.

258
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,350
- No, Mum, it's not fine.
- It's fine.

259
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,401
- You don't do anything right.
- I'm sorry?

260
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:01,183
Everything you do is wrong.

261
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:03,933
Oh... Oh, well, I'm sorry, okay?

262
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,443
Thank you so much!

263
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:13,901
Sorry.

264
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,859
That doctor didn't know his
herbivores from his carnivores, did he?

265
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,734
And do you know why?

266
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:33,151
Because he's not as smart as you.

267
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,234
Is there someone else you know
that has what you have?

268
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,443
Einstein.

269
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,776
Okay.

270
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,568
But...

271
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,276
I just want you to know

272
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,943
that you're fine the way you are, Nathan.

273
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,392
So do you want one of them
ice cream things for dessert or what?

274
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:06,600
- Dad!
- What?

275
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,725
Oh, no! Not again. Ah!

276
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,600
- What do I do? Do I lean forward?
- No, back!

277
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,401
Back? Oh, no, this is a disaster.

278
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:16,151
I know. I know. Give me this.

279
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:37,318
As promised, I come bearing news.

280
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,984
Are you sure it's okay if I stand out here?
I don't wanna put you out.

281
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,484
- Yeah.
- Invite me in, Nathan.

282
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,443
- Come in.
- Thank you very much.

283
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:56,526
Put the kettle on, then.

284
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:00,901
- Put the kettle on what?
- It's okay. I'll do it.

285
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:03,475
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi, Mr Humphreys.

286
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,651
- How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

287
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,642
- Thanks for coming round.
- I got it.

288
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Is that what I think it is?

289
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,734
I hope so, otherwise it would have
been a wasted journey.

290
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:15,642
Um, you open it.

291
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,943
- You want me to open it? All right then.
- Yeah.

292
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,484
“Dear Mr Ellis, I am writing to let you
know that unfortunately...

293
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:32,017
"you have successfully earned a place
on the United Kingdom maths squad!"

294
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:34,350
Oh, my goodness! Oh, Nathan, darling.

295
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,892
- Well, that's good news, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh!

296
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,901
- Well done, mate.
- Oh, well done.

297
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,308
Why is that unfortunate?

298
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:40,475
No, I was having a joke, mate.

299
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,308
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

300
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:44,767
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

301
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:47,109
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

302
00:21:47,643 --> 00:21:48,901
But...

303
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,984
I should study.

304
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,318
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan.

305
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,276
He doesn't mean that.

306
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,484
Probably, yeah.

307
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,151
- Okay.
- Well...

308
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,443
- I'm gonna go and study.
- Okay.

309
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:05,142
Well done, mate.

310
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,484
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

311
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,850
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

312
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:13,517
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

313
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:14,600
Would you like...

314
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,183
I should probably shoot off.

315
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay, no, that's fine.

316
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:19,443
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

317
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:29,776
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

318
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,725
To join us next month,

319
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,276
take him to the airport.

320
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,359
I know that would make Nathan happy.

321
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,818
I should probably tell you before they...

322
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:48,276
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

323
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,850
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

324
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:53,318
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

325
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:55,943
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,017
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

327
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,975
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

328
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:01,433
Really?

329
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:03,568
Yeah. I mean, if that's
all right with you?

330
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,475
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

331
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:09,193
Oh! Jesus Christ!

332
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,651
Oh, my God!

333
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,859
That's a bit of a weird one.

334
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:19,234
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

335
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:21,850
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

336
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,892
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

337
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:25,651
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

338
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,901
We were just talking, Nathan.

339
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,776
I was looking at Jupiter.

340
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,068
I didn't do it on purpose.

341
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:49,109
It was just...

342
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:54,359
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

343
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,443
For once. For me.

344
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,526
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

345
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:10,109
Okay.

346
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:38,350
What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

347
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,068
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

348
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:47,017
353!

349
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,350
Whoa!

350
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:50,017
Just in time.

351
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,225
Perfect timing.

352
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:53,193
Fireworks night again, is it?

353
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,267
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

354
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:57,693
The sparkler helps.

355
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:59,443
Come on, Nathan.

356
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,276
It's time to change the fish.

357
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:04,975
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

358
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,850
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

359
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:08,350
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

360
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:10,392
- You're lucky I'm here, that's all.

361
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:12,651
- I'm lucky.
- Yeah, you get me.

362
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:26,735
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

363
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,017
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

364
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:30,642
I told you, you're not getting...

365
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,193
Ice cream, Julie!

366
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,151
Nathan?

367
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,235
Jesus.

368
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,401
Nathan!

369
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:50,017
Oh!

370
00:25:50,018 --> 00:25:51,526
Nathan, It's okay.

371
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,350
Nathan, I'm not angry.

372
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:55,642
Nathan!

373
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:58,276
Michael? Michael?

374
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:17,934
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

375
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:20,184
I'm quite looking forward to this
in a weird sort of way.

376
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:21,443
Yeah, I know.

377
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,610
Little trip down memory lane.

378
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,401
- Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

379
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:28,776
This is for you.

380
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:33,943
Nathan...

381
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:35,943
What do you say?

382
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,225
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

383
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:40,600
so they're probably cursed.

384
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,975
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

385
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,475
- Very lovely of you.
- Right then.

386
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:47,267
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- Yep. Let's go.

387
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,526
Nathan?

388
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,392
Can you get in the back with me?

389
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:55,068
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

390
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:57,267
It's okay, darling.

391
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:59,276
Darling, darling, it's okay.

392
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,235
I'll drive carefully.

393
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:03,735
No, It's all right.

394
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:07,110
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

395
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,485
Christ!

396
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:29,943
It's Tricky Dicky, look out!

397
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,485
All right, Richard?

398
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,860
Oh!

399
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,600
Martin Humphreys. '95.

400
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:40,225
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

401
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,860
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

402
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,610
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

403
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:48,434
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

404
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:51,142
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

405
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:52,943
Wasted opportunity, this one.

406
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,350
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

407
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:59,725
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

408
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:02,151
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

409
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,318
Ah!

410
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,443
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

411
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,318
The dragon. Ah!

412
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:09,809
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

413
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,350
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

414
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,610
He's mine.

415
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,309
I mean, I'm his...
Um, I've been teaching him.

416
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,642
Ah, the plot thickens!

417
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:21,892
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

418
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:24,151
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

419
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:27,026
Oh, well, Nathan, darling.

420
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:28,610
Um...

421
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:31,600
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

422
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:32,860
Yeah.

423
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:35,901
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

424
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,943
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

425
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,276
Sorry.

426
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,485
Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

427
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:05,360
Mingle. Mingle.

428
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,360
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

429
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:16,526
Hey. How do you do?

430
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:19,568
How do I do what?

431
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:22,526
I mean, what's your name?

432
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,610
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

433
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:29,193
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

434
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,068
Best thing is just to dive in.

435
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:33,485
Come. Sit down.

436
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:35,475
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

437
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:37,850
They won six golds again last year.

438
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:42,350
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

439
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:45,725
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
"to possibly change".

440
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:48,017
Which I believe I technically am now.

441
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:50,809
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

442
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,684
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

443
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:57,517
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

444
00:29:57,518 --> 00:30:00,642
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

445
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,559
Don't worry, he's always like this.

446
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,892
Everyone, this is Nathan.

447
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:06,850
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

448
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,110
Hi, I'm Pav.

449
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,892
Paf?

450
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,818
P-A-V, Pav.

451
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:15,360
Pav is from India. Pav.

452
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:16,850
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

453
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:20,350
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

454
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,434
before we open that little Pandora's box.

455
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:24,401
Oh, dear!

456
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:30,110
Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

457
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:34,901
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

458
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:37,776
Right, away you go, driver.

459
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:44,360
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

460
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,642
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

461
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:51,434
or whatever the insult 'du jour' might be.

462
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,568
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

463
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,017
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

464
00:30:58,018 --> 00:31:02,443
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

465
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:06,401
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

466
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,818
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams in Taiwan.

467
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,934
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

468
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:16,443
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

469
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:19,184
Now we should, of course, be cordial

470
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:23,100
as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, in Cambridge.

471
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,443
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

472
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:30,318
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

473
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:35,017
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

474
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,193
who does not win a medal.

475
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:42,860
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

476
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,318
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

477
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:52,943
55,89, 144,

478
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:56,277
233, 377,

479
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,392
610.

480
00:31:57,393 --> 00:32:03,193
987, 1,597, 2,584.

481
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:07,443
I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

482
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,443
Invaluable for music compositions.

483
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:12,818
So you're new.

484
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:14,443
Fresh meat.

485
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,277
How's that going?

486
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:22,568
Okay, so you're the shy type.

487
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:26,402
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

488
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:30,735
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

489
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:33,277
What?

490
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:35,152
Nothing.

491
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:37,652
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

492
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:42,402
They do all seem good at maths, though.

493
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:44,443
Yeah.

494
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:49,277
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, I'm afraid.

495
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,152
You are painstakingly average.

496
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,559
Post-Olympiad of course,
I'll need to branch out into

497
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,559
modern theoretical physics if I'm going
to describe a unified field theory

498
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,902
for the four fundamental forces of nature.

499
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:39,777
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

500
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,601
No.

501
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,985
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

502
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,610
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

503
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,860
Here we are. Maths camp, Taipei.

504
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,652
Your home for the next two weeks.

505
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,360
Right, everybody out.

506
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,309
Don't forget your umbrellas.

507
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,193
There's a typhoon coming.

508
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,892
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Taiwan.

509
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,684
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Richard.

510
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:34,767
My name is Jason.

511
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,601
Nice to meet you, Jai-Jen.

512
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,184
- Jason. Yeah.
- Jason. I'm sorry.

513
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:39,267
Jason. It was the accent.

514
00:34:39,268 --> 00:34:40,351
Hello. Nice to meet you.

515
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:42,902
Right, come on, get your bags. Chop-chop.

516
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:45,735
Can someone help the man, please?

517
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,443
It's not the days of the Empire.
Thank you.

518
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,235
Oh!

519
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,277
Here comes the typhoon!

520
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,318
Batten down the hatches.

521
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,351
Taiwanese.

522
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,142
Currently below us in the rankings,

523
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:07,735
but they're our hosts,
so we should be gracious.

524
00:35:09,602 --> 00:35:11,402
Here's the real competition.

525
00:35:13,018 --> 00:35:14,318
The Chinese.

526
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,101
Guys, check out the board.

527
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:19,527
Is she messing around
with the Goldbach Conjecture?

528
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:20,934
Maybe it's what they do for fun.

529
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:24,017
Mmm, I love cracking unprovable theorems
in my free time.

530
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:26,017
No one has proven that it's unprovable.

531
00:35:26,018 --> 00:35:29,027
Right, come on. They won't bite.

532
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,892
Ah! The enemy!

533
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:35,360
Surrender or die!

534
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,184
Deng Laoshi.

535
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,726
Dear Richard, welcome.

536
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,517
- Such an honour to have you here.
- Thank you.

537
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,902
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

538
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,318
Students, hello.

539
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:49,027
I hope you are ready for some mathematics.

540
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,860
Now, pay attention, Team UK.

541
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,652
Deng Laoshi and I have decided
to pair you up with a Chinese buddy

542
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,309
and you should make the most
of this opportunity,

543
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,892
or, more to the point, you should
spy on your Chinese counterpart

544
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,985
and bring their trade secrets to Blighty.

545
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,068
Very funny, Richard.

546
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:20,818
Uh, Luke Shelton.

547
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:23,360
Zhang Zhi.

548
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,735
Hello. My name is Zhang Zhi.

549
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,277
Luke.

550
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,735
Nathan Ellis.

551
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:37,443
Zhang Mei.

552
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,693
Nice to meet you. My name is Zhang Mei.

553
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,110
Pavinder Kamdar.

554
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,443
This is Xiao Tong.

555
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:17,985
- Nice to meet you.
- Ni hao.

556
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,152
And you know my uncle.

557
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:25,068
Nathan. The lucky one
learning from my niece, huh?

558
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:30,277
We have high expectations for her.

559
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,642
And for you, of course.

560
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:35,152
High expectations all round, I say.

561
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:38,527
Zhang Mei.

562
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:40,485
Oh.

563
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:46,309
Yes, of course, though it may be
the world's fastest developing nation

564
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,443
some of the cuisine doesn't seem
to have advanced quite so quickly.

565
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,267
- Careful. Careful.
- Oh, look at this.

566
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:57,277
- Thank you. Uh, sh... zh...
- Xie xie. - Shie Shie.

567
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,476
- You put this in there?
- You put the raw food in this.

568
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,934
- In the peanut sauce?
- Oh...

569
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:04,193
- No.
- Okay, okay, I'll do that.

570
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,568
You don't use them... like that.

571
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,443
Hold it like this and
pinch it like a lobster.

572
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:16,110
Yeah.

573
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:21,235
So, Nathan, what was your score
on the mock IMO paper?

574
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,142
Zhang Mei got the full seven marks
on questions one to three.

575
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:28,360
Though her combinatorics
is her weakest area.

576
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,277
I'm really not... not that good.

577
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:35,944
No, but you soon will be.

578
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,902
Nathan, are you okay?

579
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,902
*I'm just hot.

580
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,902
*You can speak Chinese?

581
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,202
*-I learned on my own from a book.
*-Oh, great!

582
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,202
*-My Chinese is not as good as your English.
*- Oh, no.

583
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:38,360
Almost everyone on the camp speaks English.

584
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:40,485
It is expected of us.

585
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,393
You speak it very well.

586
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:45,152
Thank you.

587
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:46,860
So do you.

588
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:48,985
Chinese, I mean.

589
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:52,860
You don't say a lot in English at all.

590
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:15,860
This room seems reasonably symmetrical.

591
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:18,027
Apart from the window.

592
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:20,434
I don't know about you,

593
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:23,819
but I don't appreciate this
forced proximity to each other.

594
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:29,360
I'll take this side.

595
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,402
I'm going to the bathroom.

596
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:16,235
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

597
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,277
Go on, then.

598
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,735
Oh, my God, that is absolutely disgusting.

599
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,819
Boom! Wanker.

600
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,277
Yeah?

601
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,194
- Yes. Who's this?
- It's...

602
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,069
Nathan? Is that you?

603
00:41:36,935 --> 00:41:39,018
How are you doing? How's
it going out there?

604
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:42,777
Everything's different
and everyone's cleverer than me.

605
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:46,944
Look, Nathan, it's your
first night away and...

606
00:41:47,977 --> 00:41:51,194
And first nights away
are always really, really shit.

607
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:54,569
I mean, it's only a fortnight, innit?

608
00:41:54,644 --> 00:41:56,652
That's 14 days. And what's 14?

609
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:02,643
- A positive integer.
- Positive integer.

610
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,402
So think positively.

611
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:06,485
What is it the square root of?

612
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:08,851
196.

613
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,444
Whose prime factorisation is?

614
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:13,944
Two squared by seven squared.

615
00:42:14,894 --> 00:42:16,152
See?

616
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:45,610
<i>One, two, buckle my shoe</i>

617
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:47,944

624
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,277
Strong squad this year?

625
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:20,652
Testing my team for weaknesses, Richard?

626
00:43:20,977 --> 00:43:23,694
You should relax more,
not take it so seriously.

627
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,652
It's all right for you, you got
the best in the world to choose from.

628
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:31,402
But having your niece on the team, Deng?

629
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,110
I mean, really?

630
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,444
You'll see.

631
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,268
Luke, I don't care.

632
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:45,518
Civilizations have used 10, not 12,
digits to count for millennia.

633
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,143
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have 10 digits on our hands.

634
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:51,768
My argument is that if we use base 12

635
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:54,768
it is an infinitely superior system,
and more logical.

636
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,268
It takes 12 months for the Earth
to orbit the sun,

637
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,809
there are 12 hours a night
and 12 hours a day,

638
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,309
and each of those hours there
are 12 five-minute increments.

639
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,027
And what do you think, Nathan?

640
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,527
You a member of the Dozenalist Society?

641
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,152
Uh, I don't know.

642
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,777
Sorry.

643
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:14,194
People disagreeing with my opinion
is one thing, but no opinion?

644
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:16,735
You might as well not be here.

645
00:44:19,685 --> 00:44:20,726
The vertices of a regular 72-gon.

646
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,101
The vertices of a regular 72-gon

647
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:25,643
are each coloured red,
green or blue in equal amounts.

648
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:30,268
Show that we can always choose four red,
four green or four blue vertices

649
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:34,309
such that each monochromatic set
form a congruent quadrilateral.

650
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,018
Yes, so, of course, the whole question can
be trivialised by Ramsey Theory.

651
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:40,527
No, sorry, Luke.
There were other hands up before you.

652
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,309
Well, I've already answered it now.

653
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,319
Really? You think so?

654
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,809
Is anyone here convinced by Luke's answer?

655
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,934
It's interesting you ask,
“is anyone convinced?"

656
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,018
rather than "is anyone not convinced?"

657
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:54,277
- I'm not convinced.
- I'm not convinced.

658
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,851
Nathan, would you join in, please?

659
00:44:57,852 --> 00:44:59,319
This isn't a holiday.

660
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,902
Do you have a proof to share?

661
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,569
That's a disappointment.

662
00:45:07,602 --> 00:45:08,944
Ben?

663
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:13,319
Muirhead's inequality
and Schur's inequality?

664
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:19,277
It's interesting stuff, Nathan,
but you do over-complicate everything.

665
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:22,893
Things can be much simpler
than they initially appear.

666
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:25,027
Did Mr Humphreys not tell you that?

667
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,610
Mind you, he never did quite live up
to his potential, that one.

668
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,985
It's because his illness was getting worse.

669
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,777
His illness?

670
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,694
Is he still using that excuse?

671
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:39,319
Stephen Hawking has done
all right on far worse.

672
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:42,976
No, I'm afraid it wasn't
Mr Humphreys' body that failed him,

673
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:45,027
it was his character.

674
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:47,611
He just couldn't stay with it.

675
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,486
♪ <i>If you must wait</i>

676

677
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:42,527

678

- That's fine.

679
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,810
- No sugar?
- No sugar, sweet enough for me.

680
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,111

- Never better.

685
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,736
So, as well as your cycle of amitriptyline,

686
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:27,277
you were prescribed glucocorticosteroids
for your latest relapse.

687
00:47:27,352 --> 00:47:29,060
You can't have got through
all of those already.

688
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:30,143
I wouldn't have thought.

689
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:31,810
Someone broke Into my car.

690
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,069
Unfortunate.

691
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,976
- Mention it to the police?
- No, there's no point, is there?

692
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:39,018
Because they only stole
the pills and some CD's.

693
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:41,601
Bee Gees' greatest hits.
Which I was gutted about

694
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:44,310
because I bloody love
those squeaky little bastards.

695
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,518
So to be clear, these are not
anti-depressants, Mr Humphreys.

696
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,694
I mean, that's good
because I'm not depressed.

697
00:47:50,186 --> 00:47:51,601
You know, maybe you wanna
change your mind

698
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,277
about going to one of those groups
I mentioned?

699
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:58,726
What, sit in a circle and listen
to how crap everybody else's life is?

700
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:03,236
- You know, sharing your issues might help.
- Sharing my issues?

701
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:06,726
Like how I hate wobbling about like a twat,

702
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:09,726
how I've started to lose control
of my bladder and it won't be long

703
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,268
before I lose control of my arse
and start to shit myself.

704
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,351
So, be careful,
'cause I could go at any second.

705
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:16,652
And then, to top it all off...

706
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,819
My dick doesn't work.

707
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,518
Is that the sort of thing
you think I should be sharing?

708
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:24,777
Yeah.

709
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:26,777
Perhaps.

710
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:30,444
No, but what I really want, Martin,
is for you to

711
00:48:31,102 --> 00:48:32,361
not give up.

712
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:41,569
I should probably take this
because it's my crack dealer.

713
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:46,361
- Hello?
- Hello, Martin.

714
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:49,685
It... It's Julie. Yes.

715
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:51,527
That's right. Julie Ellis.

716
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:57,986
- Hi. Hi.
- Hiya.

717
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,310
- Thanks for coming round. It's...
- It's all right.

718
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,319
- Yeah.
- You sure you're ready for this?

719
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:04,694
Absolutely.

720
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:07,935
Okay, then.
Let's begin at the beginning, shall we?

721
00:49:07,936 --> 00:49:09,194
Mmm-hmm.

722
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:13,476
It's all right. It's like anything.
It's scary at first.

723
00:49:13,477 --> 00:49:16,185
But then when you get your head
round it, you'll be all right.

724
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,444
Uh...

725
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,277
Has he, um...

726
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:23,726
Has he rung you again?

727
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,319
- Nathan? No.
- Yeah.

728
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:29,268
Now, look, I'm sure he didn't mean
anything by it, calling me.

729
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:31,101
It's just he doesn't think
sometimes, does he?

730
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:34,652
Oh, well, no, he does think a lot.
Just mainly about maths.

731
00:49:35,602 --> 00:49:37,319
Which is fine, you know.

732
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,893
He just thinks I'm a bit of an idiot
because I failed at maths at school.

733
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,101
I mean, I got everything else,
it was just, you know...

734
00:49:43,102 --> 00:49:44,476
Mmm.

735
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:47,652
It's why I wanna do this really,
you know, get into his head more.

736
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:52,060
- I'm not making sense. Shut up, Julie.
- No, you're making perfect sense.

737
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:53,819
- Not really.
- No, you are.

738
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,601
I mean, the thing about maths,
as with any subject,

739
00:49:57,602 --> 00:50:01,310
I think if you have an inspirational
teacher, um, then you'll be away.

Okay, then.

- Okay.

00:50:11,602 --> 00:50:14,143
- Uh, can you say that word?
- Hypotenuse.

746

747
00:50:16,769 --> 00:50:18,986

Well, it's good that you

790
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:49,444

00:54:54,478 --> 00:54:55,944
You know, without...

793
00:55:01,686 --> 00:55:03,028
- Michael.
- Michael.

794
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:05,768
- Sorry. Dickhead.
- No.

795
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,028
- Me, not... Not Michael.
- I know.

796
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:14,111
Well, I mean, but you're...

797
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,528
You're the same. It must be the...

798
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:22,278
I mean, you're not with anyone.

799
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,069
- No. No.
- Are you? No.

800
00:55:25,894 --> 00:55:28,903
My passion's my work, you see.

801
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:32,569
Sorry.

802
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,194
- You all right?
- Yeah.

803
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,778
Sometimes I wonder if Nathan
will ever find anyone, you know?

804
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:42,986
Nathan's nothing like me.

805
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,977
If you're worried that Nathan's
gonna end up like... You shouldn't.

806
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:49,528
- I wasn't. It would be a good thing.
- You shouldn't.

807
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:56,236
- I might just pop off to the toilet.
- Okay.

808
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:19,778
Uh, I got crisps.

809
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:32,694
<i>Oh...</i>

810
00:56:33,061 --> 00:56:35,153
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

811
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:41,435
- Sorry, are you a bit stiff?
- No, what?

812
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:43,319
I mean, your back.

813
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:59,060
Oh...

814
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:01,477
- Shit. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
- It's okay. Are you all right?

815
00:57:01,478 --> 00:57:03,486
No. It's okay.

816
00:57:03,936 --> 00:57:06,227
- You all right?
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

817
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:08,153
- It's okay.
- I, um...

818
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:10,194
I just want to say that, um...

819
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:12,268
- You don't...
- For me... No, I do.

820
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:17,819
In this sort of situation there's only
so far that I am able to, um, go.

821
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,861
And I don't want to make you disappointed.

822
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:27,569
You... You couldn't. I wouldn't... Sorry.

823
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:32,236
Yeah, I understand.

824
00:57:33,061 --> 00:57:35,736
Do you mind if we get up?
I think I'm sat on a set square.

825
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:28,403
I think it's funny that your favourite
English food is Chinese.

826
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:33,185
Do you always like
to have everything the same?

827
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:36,653
Because I change
my favourite things all the time.

828
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:40,278
I don't usually like change.

829
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,352
- I like it here, though.
- Do you?

830
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:47,227
I mean, the Chinese approach to maths.

831
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:48,569
Yes?

832
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,278
Look.

833
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:57,111
This is called The Nine
Chapters of Mathematical Art.

834
00:58:57,436 --> 00:59:00,736
This took more than 1,000 years to write.

835
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:06,653
In China, mathematics is more than numbers.

836
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:09,653
Um, It is like art.

837
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:15,778
Here.

838
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,694
There are... There are
eight prawn balls. I...

839
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:29,861
It needs to be a prime.

840
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:47,445
So... 20 random cards
are placed in a row all face-down.

841
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:53,070
A move consists of turning
a face-down card face-up

842
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,611
and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

843
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:02,320
Show that no matter
what the choice of cards to turn

844
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,986
this sequence of moves must terminate.

845
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:11,320
Nathan, hiding in the back won't help you.

846
01:00:11,561 --> 01:00:13,445
Would you like to come up and show us?

847
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:22,653
Go on, Nathan.

848
01:00:57,311 --> 01:01:03,278
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

849
01:01:03,353 --> 01:01:05,028
As numbers.

850
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:10,070
We can call face-down cards...

851
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,320
One.

852
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:17,653
Face-up cards... Zero.

853
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:22,977
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

854
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:28,695
But after a while it would look
something like that.

855
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:33,278
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

856
01:01:34,395 --> 01:01:38,102
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

857
01:01:38,103 --> 01:01:41,611
and the card immediately to the right of it

858
01:01:42,603 --> 01:01:46,486
could be that a one followed by a one,

859
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:50,320
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

860
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:57,227
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

861
01:01:57,228 --> 01:02:01,111
turning into a zero followed by a one.

862
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,570
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

863
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,445
And that means?

864
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:16,945
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

865
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:18,769
Because?

866
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,310
Because you can't keep taking away
from a positive integer

867
01:02:21,311 --> 01:02:25,153
- without it turning negative.
- No, you can't.

868
01:02:25,728 --> 01:02:28,019
You definitely can't. Good work;.

869
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,195
Everyone. Good work.

870
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:08,403
Uh, hello. My name's
Martin Humphreys and I'm an alcoholic.

871
01:04:08,936 --> 01:04:11,144
No, not really. Well, a little bit.

872
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:13,894
Um, I've got MS, that's why I'm here.
I got that group tomorrow.

873
01:04:13,895 --> 01:04:15,810
Uh...

874
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:20,445
No, seriously, thank you for
everybody who's, uh, shared and stuff.

875
01:04:20,811 --> 01:04:25,111
Because there's definitely things
that I can identify with

876
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:26,820
and that I definitely recognise;.

877
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:28,986
Uh...

878
01:04:30,853 --> 01:04:35,195
So, there's this person I like, but I know

879
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:38,111
how bad I'm gonna get

880
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:43,153
and it's very difficult to imagine
any sort of a rosy future

881
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:49,611
or anyone wanting to be
a part of that future with me.

882
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,195
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um...

883
01:05:09,603 --> 01:05:11,320
Because you...

884
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,486
This is ridiculous.

885
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:25,278
Because in a few years' time I might not...
I might not even be able to hold hands

886
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,278
or have a little cuddle.

887
01:05:30,728 --> 01:05:32,153
And...

888
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,611
That really, really scares me.

889
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:57,727
We should ask the others to suggest
a variety of trigonometric identities

890
01:05:57,728 --> 01:06:01,769
to simplify the expressions,
which could include, say, coversine

891
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:06,977
or possibly covercosine or versine
or excosecant and so on.

892
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:09,060
Luke, we're trying to think of
fun questions for each other,

893
01:06:09,061 --> 01:06:11,727
we're not trying to prove how many
trigonometric identities we know.

894
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:16,486
Well, then I really don't see the point.
We are competing with each other.

895
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,060
You can pretend you're everyone's
best friend all you like, Isaac,

896
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:21,394
but I'm here to get on the team.

897
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:24,111
Sorry, when have I ever tried
to be your best friend, Luke?

898
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:30,519
Nathan, this is a democracy,
yours is the casting vote.

899
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,477
Yes. Democracy in the true Chinese
sense of the word. Forget it.

900
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:36,987
- We'll just do your question...
- Are you gonna sulk?

901
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:39,487
Boo-hoo-hoo, poor Luke.

902
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:50,320
Sorry.

903
01:06:50,978 --> 01:06:54,061
- I've come across people like him before.
- Definitely autistic.

904
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:57,112
He seems to have picked up all the
bad traits and none of the good.

905
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:59,653
- What bad traits?
- Obsessive.

906
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:03,070
- Socially incompetent.
- That sort of thing.

907
01:07:07,895 --> 01:07:09,903
It's about adaptability, Nathan.

908
01:07:11,937 --> 01:07:15,903
Sometimes we have to change our shape
so that we fit in.

909
01:07:20,062 --> 01:07:21,186
That was you pushing the cage.

910
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:25,820
- I did not!
- Yes, you did! Polly!

911
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:29,070
Polly Parrot, wake up!

912
01:07:29,978 --> 01:07:31,403
Polly!

913
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:34,362
Now that's what I calla dead parrot.

914
01:07:38,145 --> 01:07:42,153
I love this. It's stinky tofu.

915
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,153
Stinky?

916
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,487
Oh, that's horrible.

917
01:07:48,645 --> 01:07:51,987
It stinks but it tastes
really, really good.

918
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:54,144
Oh, look.

919
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:58,528
I used lo play this when I was small,
in my hometown, as a child.

920
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,278
A sweet.

921
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:06,394
- It's sticky.
- It's stuck in my teeth.

922
01:08:06,395 --> 01:08:09,320
You have a funny face.

923
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:13,987
You don't like it? I'll eat it.
And you can have this'.

924
01:08:18,437 --> 01:08:21,278
We should, uh... We should probably go.

925
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:22,769
Aren't you...

926
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:24,528
Aren't you worried about the exam?

927
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:29,320
Well, it is good to have a break.
Clear your mind.

928
01:08:30,478 --> 01:08:35,602
Don't worry. We will both get into
the Olympiad in Cambridge. The IMO.

929
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:39,894
And I will meet your family
when I come and stay with you.

930
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:41,945
My cultural exchange.

931
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:44,445
Ah!

932
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,903
Look at this.

933
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:54,778
You're a bit like a turtle, aren't you?

934
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,487
In your shell.

935
01:09:00,145 --> 01:09:01,653
Come on.

936
01:09:11,978 --> 01:09:16,237
In China, do boys like me get bullied?

937
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:19,112
"Bullied"?

938
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,820
You know, like when people treat you
badly because you're clever.

939
01:09:24,187 --> 01:09:25,820
Why would they do that?

940
01:09:27,103 --> 01:09:29,811
I wish England was more like China.

941
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:32,487
I wish China was more like here.

942
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,653
In China we have to succeed for the family.

943
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,987
Especially for Uncle Deng.

944
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:47,570
Some people say that I am only here
because of him.

945
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,653
That's not true. No, you're really clever.

946
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:54,320
Thank you.

947
01:09:55,812 --> 01:09:57,862
And you're very nice.

948
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,862
Prawn ball. Turtle boy.

949
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:54,570
Alternate team seating.

950
01:10:54,853 --> 01:10:57,811
UK team member, Chinese team member.

951
01:10:57,812 --> 01:11:01,737
Alternative seating.
UK team member, Chinese team member.

952
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:09,362
IMO conditions apply.

953
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:13,778
White card if you request some paper.

954
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:17,028
A blue for water.

955
01:11:18,312 --> 01:11:20,445
Green if you need to go to the toilet.

956
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:26,028
Yellow to ask a question
but only in the first half-hour.

957
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:31,820
And red if you've left the gas on at home
or something and you need to leave.

958
01:11:32,437 --> 01:11:37,737
The six of you who score highest will
represent Team UK, no ifs, no buts.

959
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:44,445
- Hao, keyi kaishi, le.
- You may begin.

960
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:02,445
<i>Each integer is coloured
either red, yellow or green.</i>

961
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:07,320
<i>Show that there always exist A, B, C,</i>

962
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,903
<i>such that A, B, C.</i>

963
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:16,237
<i>A + B, A + C...</i>

964
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:22,278
<i>A + B, A + C, B + C
and A + B + C</i>

965
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:24,403
<i>are all the same colour.</i>

966
01:12:57,562 --> 01:13:03,403
*-I didn't do well on the test.
-You worry a lot.

967
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:17,519
Right! No point in
dilly-dallying, I suppose.

968
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,570
I'll pin your scores up on the board
in a second.

969
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:23,227
The five outstanding students

970
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:27,278
guaranteed a place at the IMO
in Cambridge this year are...

971
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:30,028
Isaac,

972
01:13:30,562 --> 01:13:32,112
Lee Jing,

973
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,070
Rebecca.

974
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,862
Pav and Ben.

975
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,353
The last place was very tight
between Nathan and Luke.

976
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:48,412
Both scores somewhat disappointing, but
one of you will have to go to Cambridge.

977
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:52,320
So, by the smallest fraction of a point,

978
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,862
the last place on the team goes to...

979
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,279
Nathan.

980
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,561
The six of you will be hosting
the Chinese team at your own homes

981
01:14:05,562 --> 01:14:07,894
and I'll see you all in
Cambridge next week.

982
01:14:07,895 --> 01:14:09,945
Onward, Christian soldiers.

983
01:14:32,354 --> 01:14:35,279
A real Taiwanese last supper!

984
01:14:35,854 --> 01:14:40,436
As the old proverb say:
“Slowly, slowly, catchy prawn."

985
01:14:40,437 --> 01:14:44,487
Now, you put your bait on the hooks
and you put your hooks in the water.

986
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:49,279
Don't worry, Nathan.
I only just made the team myself.

987
01:14:51,395 --> 01:14:52,904
We should be celebrating!

988
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,654
Okay.

989
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:00,561
He's so strange.

990
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,570
At least we don't
have to see him again.

991
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:06,404
What a dick.

992
01:15:08,812 --> 01:15:10,695
- Ah! Ah!
- What do I do?

993
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,237
Yes!

994
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,154
I'm sorry.

995
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,394
- How's it going?
- Good.

996
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,999
These two are tender?

997
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,436
Not yet. I have this all under control,
thank you very much. It's fine.

998
01:15:30,437 --> 01:15:32,737
Okay, okay. You're the expert.

999
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:36,070
I think these ones... Can I get a plate?

1000
01:15:40,645 --> 01:15:41,945
Smells good.

1001
01:15:45,687 --> 01:15:49,779
Have you seen this?
"Now that's what I call a dead prawn.

1002
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,561
"This prawn is definitely deceased.

1003
01:15:52,562 --> 01:15:55,019
"When I bought it half-hour ago,
you assured me

1004
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,279
"that its lack of movement was due to
it being tired and shagged out."

1005
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,987
Oh, my God.

1006
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:02,529
Say, “No, no, it's resting."

1007
01:16:03,604 --> 01:16:06,987
- What?
- Say, "No, no, it's resting."

1008
01:16:09,062 --> 01:16:10,311
No, no, it's resting.

1009
01:16:10,312 --> 01:16:14,195
"All right, then.
Well, if it's resting, I'll wake it up.

1010
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:18,612
"Hello, Prawny. Prawny, wake up!

1011
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:22,561
"This prawn wouldn't wake up
if I put 4,000 volts through it.

1012
01:16:22,562 --> 01:16:25,186
"It's bleedin' demised.
It has ceased to be.

1013
01:16:25,187 --> 01:16:27,353
"It's expired and gone to meet its maker.

1014
01:16:27,354 --> 01:16:29,612
"This is an ex-prawn!"

1015
01:16:33,895 --> 01:16:36,362
Seriously, Luke, what are you?

1016
01:16:37,895 --> 01:16:39,737
Well, what are you, Isaac?

1017
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:43,811
“I find everything so easy
and I have everything.

1018
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:47,362
"And I'm gonna go out of my way to make
sure that you're not happy at all.“

1019
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,894
<i>Remarkable bird,
the Norwegian Blue. Beautiful plumage.</i>

1020
01:16:58,895 --> 01:17:01,894
<i>The plumage don't enter into it.
It's stone-dead.</i>

1021
01:17:01,895 --> 01:17:03,945
<i>No, no, no. It's resting.</i>

1022
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:07,862
<i>All Right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.</i>

1023
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:13,436
<i>Hello, Polly! I got a nice Cuttlefish
for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!</i>

1024
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:15,570
<i>- There, it moved.
- No, it didn't.</i>

1025
01:17:26,562 --> 01:17:28,029
Nathan.

1026
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:29,945
Nathan...

1027
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,112
It's fine.

1028
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,362
I've done it before.

1029
01:17:36,645 --> 01:17:39,279
Just got a bit carried away this time.

1030
01:17:42,854 --> 01:17:45,070
How did your mum and dad explain it to you?

1031
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:48,237
When they found out.

1032
01:17:51,062 --> 01:17:52,904
I presume you've been diagnosed.

1033
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,279
Mine said it made me unique.

1034
01:18:01,437 --> 01:18:04,445
No one wants to be ordinary, they said.

1035
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:10,570
It's all right being weird

1036
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,445
as long as you're gifted.

1037
01:18:16,187 --> 01:18:18,862
But if you're not gifted, then...

1038
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,237
That just leaves weird.

1039
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,654
Doesn't it?

1040
01:18:27,145 --> 01:18:28,820
You are gifted, Luke.

1041
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,862
I don't even enjoy it.

1042
01:18:35,104 --> 01:18:36,529
Maths.

1043
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:40,362
Isn't that stupid?

1044
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:47,445
What's the point?

1045
01:19:10,687 --> 01:19:12,654
Right, away you go.

1046
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:20,237
Your chariot awaits.

1047
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:24,445
Nathan, can I have a word?

1048
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:39,154
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1049
01:19:40,437 --> 01:19:45,070
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1050
01:19:45,854 --> 01:19:49,487
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1051
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:53,654
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

1052
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:55,445
No?

1053
01:19:57,604 --> 01:20:01,195
There is rare beauty in your work, Nathan.

1054
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:06,695
But you are unpredictable and inconsistent.
Which worries me.

1055
01:20:07,604 --> 01:20:10,945
You need to focus
if you're gonna win a medal.

1056
01:20:11,354 --> 01:20:13,529
And don't be distracted
by your Chinese guest.

1057
01:20:48,562 --> 01:20:50,279
<i>Oh, cai hang!</i>

1058
01:20:51,062 --> 01:20:54,446
- Uh, the rainbow.
- Yeah, rainbow, cai hang.

1059
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:56,853
- Cai hang.
- Yeah.

1060
01:20:56,854 --> 01:20:58,779
- Cai hang.
- Cai hang.

1061
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:02,946
So beautiful.

1062
01:21:22,604 --> 01:21:25,279
- Welcome home. Hi, darling.
- Hey!

1063
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:27,571
- Hi, darling... Hi!
- Welcome back.

1064
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:32,529
Hi! Hello, sweetheart.

1065
01:21:32,812 --> 01:21:33,936
- Hi.
- Hi.

1066
01:21:33,937 --> 01:21:36,436
- How do you pronounce your name?
- Uh, Zhang Mei.

1067
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:39,571
- Zhang Mei. Julie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1068
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,436
We put a little... Wait,
it's coming round now.

1069
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:44,895
Cambridge, here we come!

1070
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:47,404
Whoo-whomwhoo-whoo!

1071
01:21:48,562 --> 01:21:50,237
Why did you get my train set out?

1072
01:21:51,937 --> 01:21:53,779
Um... Nathan...

1073
01:21:56,146 --> 01:21:57,571
Sorry.

1074
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:03,279
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

1075
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:10,228
Nathan.

1076
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:13,446
Nathan, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry about the train.

1077
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:21,571
So that's Zhang Mei, is it?

1078
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,279
What's she like?

1079
01:22:24,521 --> 01:22:26,612
She's... She's clever.

1080
01:22:28,562 --> 01:22:30,112
And she's nice, too.

1081
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:34,279
Sounds to me like you quite like her.

1082
01:22:34,812 --> 01:22:36,446
Of course I like her.

1083
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:41,853
No I mean, uh, like more than you...

1084
01:22:41,854 --> 01:22:43,571
normally like things. Like...

1085
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:48,612
Ice cream. Or...

1086
01:22:49,854 --> 01:22:51,446
Or maths.

1087
01:22:51,646 --> 01:22:53,821
I don't like anything
more than I like maths.

1088
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:59,362
Nathan, darling, I wish
you'd just called me.

1089
01:23:00,854 --> 01:23:03,696
Let me know that you're okay, you know?

1090
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:06,446
Why?

1091
01:23:07,229 --> 01:23:10,196
Well, because, darling...

1092
01:23:12,146 --> 01:23:13,946
I like you...

1093
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,821
More than I like ice cream.

1094
01:23:26,604 --> 01:23:28,404
I said she could have my room.

1095
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:32,946
That's very gentlemanly of you.

1096
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:35,571
Isn't that the right thing to do?

1097
01:23:36,646 --> 01:23:37,987
Yes.

1098
01:23:39,021 --> 01:23:41,862
So, I'm... I'm blowing this up
for you then, am I?

1099
01:23:43,146 --> 01:23:46,279
Yeah. But, uh, can I have it in my room?

1100
01:23:48,937 --> 01:23:50,571
Zhang Mei's in there.

1101
01:23:51,812 --> 01:23:53,279
We might want to study.

1102
01:24:00,812 --> 01:24:06,321
So, that man today, he is not your father?

1103
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:12,279
No, he's my teacher. My father died.

1104
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,987
I'm sorry, Nathan.

1105
01:24:17,437 --> 01:24:18,987
It's not your fault.

1106
01:24:20,896 --> 01:24:24,946
I mean, I feel sad for you.

1107
01:24:26,396 --> 01:24:30,779
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1108
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,103
You think it'll work?

1109
01:25:10,104 --> 01:25:13,237
100%? I hope so.

1110
01:25:15,437 --> 01:25:18,946
We did it! It actually works.

1111
01:26:07,312 --> 01:26:09,404
Right-oh, observers. It's time to assemble.

1112
01:26:11,354 --> 01:26:13,353
Panama hats, Richard? Really?

1113
01:26:13,354 --> 01:26:15,520
Yes, it was a consensus decision.

1114
01:26:15,521 --> 01:26:18,487
I discussed it with myself
and I decided it would be a good idea.

1115
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:21,520
Are you sure you're not
too rusty for all this?

1116
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:24,061
I can manage a bit of shepherding.

1117
01:26:24,062 --> 01:26:26,987
Been Nathan's teacher for seven years,
I wanna see this through.

1118
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:29,279
He's a very sensitive kid.

1119
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:33,279
Yeah, yeah, I suppose children
are like animals.

1120
01:26:34,021 --> 01:26:35,946
You get attached to them after a while.

1121
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:45,946
Oh, my gosh!
Is this where you're staying?

1122
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:48,112
Oh, wow.

1123
01:26:49,646 --> 01:26:50,987
Oh...

1124
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:56,071
Well...

1125
01:26:56,229 --> 01:27:00,061
So, um, you've got your phone on you
and you know you can call me any time.

1126
01:27:00,062 --> 01:27:01,529
So...

1127
01:27:03,812 --> 01:27:05,936
I'll be thinking of you.

1128
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:07,946
Okay. Well, goodbye.

1129
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:11,529
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1130
01:27:11,687 --> 01:27:13,020
- Bye.
- Bye.

1131
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,321
Bye, darling.

1132
01:27:20,979 --> 01:27:25,029
- What are you doing?
- I was taking your hand.

1133
01:27:25,896 --> 01:27:27,362
Come on!

1134
01:27:30,271 --> 01:27:31,478
You let go!

1135
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:34,738
Isaac Newton. G.H. Hardy.

1136
01:27:35,188 --> 01:27:38,279
Ramanujan. Bertrand Russell.

1137
01:27:38,813 --> 01:27:41,821
They all began their
mathematical journeys here.

1138
01:27:42,354 --> 01:27:45,770
Trinity alumni have accumulated
thirty two Nobel prizes

1139
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:48,654
and no less than four Fields Medals.

1140
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,437
Although Russell did go off the rails
somewhat later in his career.

1141
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:55,770
But nevertheless,
this is the most prestigious place

1142
01:27:55,771 --> 01:28:00,029
to study mathematics on the planet.
And you are here.

1143
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:04,363
Because they are the past
and you are the future.

1144
01:28:05,021 --> 01:28:06,654
So don't let me down.

1145
01:28:11,188 --> 01:28:12,654
Ladies and gentlemen,

1146
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:15,645
I would like to welcome; You!
To the 59th International.

1147
01:28:15,646 --> 01:28:18,446
Mathematical Olympiad in Cambridge.

1148
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:24,571
Please welcome Australia.

1149
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,779
A warm welcome for Bangladesh.

1150
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:43,904
Canada.

1151
01:28:46,438 --> 01:28:49,113
The People's Republic of China.

1152
01:28:56,854 --> 01:28:59,946
A round of applause for United Kingdom.

1153
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:28,154
- Nathan?
- Yeah?

1154
01:29:31,313 --> 01:29:32,904
I can't sleep.

1155
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:39,196
You can, uh, stay here if you want.
Like... Like at home.

1156
01:29:43,396 --> 01:29:44,904
What are you reading?

1157
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:51,821
It's the Ten Years of
Mathematical Challenges,

1158
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:54,446
'97 to '06 edition.

1159
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:08,529
Oh.

1160
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:11,613
I'm sorry.

1161
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:38,238
Is that right?

1162
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:39,821
Yes.

1163
01:30:54,938 --> 01:30:56,613
Are you okay?

1164
01:31:17,896 --> 01:31:21,529
I am glad I am here with you.

1165
01:31:23,604 --> 01:31:25,113
Me, too.

1166
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:44,113
*What do you two think you're doing?

1167
01:31:48,604 --> 01:31:50,483
*We're not doing anything wrong!

1168
01:31:50,484 --> 01:31:53,737
*Is that what you think?
You're a disgrace to our family.

1169
01:31:53,738 --> 01:31:57,199
*I'm here for a math test.
What's that got to do with our family?

1170
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,099
*What's that got to do with our family?

1171
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,999
*You're not doing enough.

1172
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,733
*Not enough?
Uncle, I'm always studying.

1173
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:06,674
*What else you want from me?
Besides, I've proved my skills

1174
01:32:06,675 --> 01:32:09,059
*Not enough. You didn't do enough.

1175
01:32:09,305 --> 01:32:12,037
*What have you proved?
Your skill with boys or in math?

1176
01:32:12,038 --> 01:32:15,046
*Are you here to make out
or to compete?

1177
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:18,509
*We have replacements in the team,
you know that.

1178
01:32:19,938 --> 01:32:22,045
*Child, you've been a disappointment to me.

1179
01:32:22,046 --> 01:32:24,570
*If I'm not really good enough

1180
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:27,929
*and I'm just here because I'm your niece,
then I'd better just go.

1181
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:30,313
*Don't you dare!

1182
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,463
*You can't walk away.

1183
01:32:37,355 --> 01:32:39,738
*Sorry.

1184
01:32:57,729 --> 01:33:01,446
I can't be here with people
thinking I don't deserve it.

1185
01:33:01,896 --> 01:33:04,613
Why don't you just stay
until the end of the competition?

1186
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:06,279
No, Nathan!

1187
01:33:07,053 --> 01:33:10,269
*Don't ask me to do
what I don't want to do.

1188
01:33:11,438 --> 01:33:13,863
Nathan...

1189
01:33:14,938 --> 01:33:16,821
Just because...

1190
01:33:18,563 --> 01:33:21,904
Just because I'm going, it...

1191
01:33:24,854 --> 01:33:27,154
It does not mean that...

1192
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:33,029
I don't find myself liking you.

1193
01:34:15,229 --> 01:34:17,187
Excuse me. Sorry.

1194
01:34:17,188 --> 01:34:19,696
Nathan? Um...

1195
01:34:21,021 --> 01:34:23,488
Did you get into trouble? About Zhang Mei?

1196
01:34:25,563 --> 01:34:29,770
I think I might have accidentally

1197
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:32,946
sort of mentioned something to someone.

1198
01:34:34,313 --> 01:34:37,946
I didn't mean to hurt anyone. It's just...

1199
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,196
Anyway...

1200
01:34:44,813 --> 01:34:46,446
I'm sorry.

1201
01:34:53,063 --> 01:34:54,312
Oi! Oggy!

1202
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:56,354
- Oi!
-  Oggy, oggy, oggy!

1203
01:34:56,355 --> 01:34:57,988
Oi, Oi, Oi!

1204
01:35:03,355 --> 01:35:04,895
Hello, Nathan.

1205
01:35:04,896 --> 01:35:09,562
I know, I know, I know. I know you said
not to bother you, but I just, um...

1206
01:35:09,563 --> 01:35:12,280
Well, I just wanted to...
I wanted to cheer on Team Nathan.

1207
01:35:13,146 --> 01:35:14,780
Go, Nathan!

1208
01:35:15,313 --> 01:35:18,613
Anyway, um, I'll be
waiting outside and, uh...

1209
01:35:19,105 --> 01:35:20,405
Best of luck, darling.

1210
01:35:20,938 --> 01:35:23,155
There's no such thing as luck.

1211
01:35:24,938 --> 01:35:26,238
No.

1212
01:36:08,021 --> 01:36:09,446
Nathan.

1213
01:36:09,813 --> 01:36:13,696
I'm gonna be circling, so I'll try and
slip you some of the answers, all right?

1214
01:36:13,938 --> 01:36:15,446
That's cheating.

1215
01:36:16,146 --> 01:36:17,780
You know I was joking.

1216
01:36:19,313 --> 01:36:20,905
You're gonna be all right.

1217
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:34,321
Four hours and 30 minutes.
You may begin.

1218
01:36:43,021 --> 01:36:47,905
<i>4 n squared trains
are arranged in a 2n by 2n square</i>

1219
01:36:48,063 --> 01:36:51,062
<i>and each is painted with
one of four colours.</i>

1220
01:36:51,063 --> 01:36:56,238
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.</i>

1221
01:36:58,355 --> 01:37:01,071
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains...</i>

1222
01:37:01,813 --> 01:37:05,520
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.</i>

1223
01:37:05,521 --> 01:37:07,738
<i>Prove that the trains...</i>

1224
01:37:09,438 --> 01:37:13,854
<i>Prove that the trains on
the corners of the 2n x 2n square</i>

1225
01:37:13,855 --> 01:37:15,738
<i>are painted with different colours.</i>

1226
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:07,530
<i>It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.</i>

1227
01:38:46,605 --> 01:38:48,405
What's the matter, mate?

1228
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:01,113
Nathan?

1229
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:02,738
Nathan!

1230
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,405
Nathan!

1231
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,946
Open the door. Martin, open the door!

1232
01:39:16,313 --> 01:39:19,071
Open the door, Martin. Martin!

1233
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,030
Martin!

1234
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,446
Nathan?

1235
01:39:27,896 --> 01:39:29,321
Nathan!

1236
01:39:32,438 --> 01:39:34,363
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1237
01:39:35,146 --> 01:39:37,479
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1238
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,988
And I'm sorry,
I didn't wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1239
01:39:43,105 --> 01:39:44,696
It's okay.

1240
01:39:53,813 --> 01:39:55,280
Nathan?

1241
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,113
Nathan?

1242
01:40:29,396 --> 01:40:32,071
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1243
01:40:33,105 --> 01:40:34,530
Right.

1244
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:36,946
That's a...

1245
01:40:39,021 --> 01:40:40,696
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1246
01:40:44,021 --> 01:40:46,988
And do you... Do you think that you might

1247
01:40:47,146 --> 01:40:51,196
have those kind of feelings, too?

1248
01:40:52,355 --> 01:40:54,446
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

1249
01:40:55,146 --> 01:40:58,113
I've been trying to work it out. But...

1250
01:40:59,605 --> 01:41:03,446
I found a formula. I just
can't understand it.

1251
01:41:05,271 --> 01:41:08,738
Well, as far as I know, Nathan,
no one ever has.

1252
01:41:10,396 --> 01:41:14,280
I know that when... When I'm around her,

1253
01:41:15,146 --> 01:41:17,738
my brain works differently.

1254
01:41:19,021 --> 01:41:24,905
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1255
01:41:25,938 --> 01:41:27,696
Why it matters?

1256
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:31,030
It matters because...

1257
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,530
Well, when...

1258
01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:38,072
When somebody loves you,

1259
01:41:39,772 --> 01:41:44,280
it means that they see something in you...

1260
01:41:46,147 --> 01:41:49,947
That they think is worth something.
So it sort of...

1261
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,655
It adds value to you.

1262
01:41:58,063 --> 01:41:59,780
But it can be hard...

1263
01:42:01,563 --> 01:42:05,271
You know,
when you love someone and they...

1264
01:42:05,272 --> 01:42:09,238
They show no sign that
they love you back, then it's...

1265
01:42:09,647 --> 01:42:12,655
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1266
01:42:14,772 --> 01:42:17,697
When... When someone you love...

1267
01:42:22,313 --> 01:42:24,655
ls subtracted from you...

1268
01:42:27,897 --> 01:42:32,697
Then it feels like, you know,
that your value is less than it was.

1269
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,280
Does that make sense?

1270
01:42:42,563 --> 01:42:44,655
Why did he have to go?

1271
01:42:46,063 --> 01:42:47,780
I don't know.

1272
01:42:49,022 --> 01:42:51,488
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1273
01:42:53,522 --> 01:42:56,905
It never will. It was an accident.

1274
01:42:57,688 --> 01:42:59,979
Things made sense when I was with him.

1275
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,780
But why? Why...

1276
01:43:03,022 --> 01:43:05,655
What did he do that I don't?

1277
01:43:06,563 --> 01:43:10,113
How did he make sense of things for you?

1278
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:18,363
Nathan?

1279
01:43:19,772 --> 01:43:23,863
I don't know,
he made me laugh and...

1280
01:43:25,813 --> 01:43:28,030
He stuck chips up his nose.

1281
01:43:28,855 --> 01:43:30,238
What?

1282
01:43:32,772 --> 01:43:35,113
He stuck chips up his nose?

1283
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:42,655
Oh, okay, well, I'll
stick a chip up my nose.

1284
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:47,488
Talk to me now?

1285
01:43:53,647 --> 01:43:55,113
Nathan?

1286
01:43:58,063 --> 01:43:59,530
Nathan.

1287
01:44:00,688 --> 01:44:03,363
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1288
01:44:05,522 --> 01:44:07,072
It hurts.

1289
01:44:08,397 --> 01:44:10,655
I know, darling. Me, too.

1290
01:44:15,813 --> 01:44:17,396
Come here.

1291
01:44:17,397 --> 01:44:19,197
It's all right.

1292
01:44:20,397 --> 01:44:24,280
It's all right, it's all right, good boy.
It's okay.

1293
01:44:43,355 --> 01:44:45,322
Hey, hey.

1294
01:44:49,605 --> 01:44:51,572
Where is Zhang Mei now?

1295
01:44:52,813 --> 01:44:55,530
She... She's gone to the station.

1296
01:44:56,813 --> 01:44:58,280
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1297
01:45:00,522 --> 01:45:01,822
Yeah.

1298
01:45:01,855 --> 01:45:04,197
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1299
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:14,197

1300
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:17,238
