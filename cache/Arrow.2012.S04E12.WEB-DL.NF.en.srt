213
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,083
I was going over the schematics
of the two pieces of stolen tech,

trying to figure out where Roy
was going to hit next...

Uh, no, I mean not at first.

217
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:40,259
Uh, a capacitor bomb and a network mapper,
that's like... Ceiling fan and broccoli.

218
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,385
Sounds like a messy combination.

219
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,594
Combination being the breakthrough.

220
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,514

what the two pieces of tech had in common

221
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:48,225
{\an8}and started working on what would happen
if they were combined somehow.

222

Depends on your definition of "good."

225
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,024
But I'm pretty sure that
AmerTek's network mapper

226
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,569
and Cadmus' capacitor could theoretically
be used to create a web-nuke.

Last year, Roy
could barely spell "computer."

Even assuming he did
build this device, I...

233
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,043
Why hasn't he used it yet?

234
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,544
Because it's incomplete.

In times long past, the people

We keep fighting until
one of us drops from exhaustion.

Or we lay down our swords,

This tiny piece of plastic

If you wanna make a statement,
you don't take down the system.

Well, I... I've been thinking about
what would happen

00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,131
if he used the web-nuke
to take down the Internet,

426
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,926
but if you used it right,

427
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,344
overloading the electrical grid,

428
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,514
shutting down hospital equipment,
causing water main breaks...

everyone in the city.

So, a web-nuke needs to be
deployed somewhere.

-Why do you always ask me that?

she nursed you back to health

presenting the Power Cell to the board?

It was a spectacular failure.

wheelchair makes her doubt herself.

It's not like he's gonna be
willing to help me.

This isn't either of our decisions.

Of course not.

I wanna put a knife in her hand
and force her to slit someone's throat?

I've come this close to dragging someone
in here for her to kill.

And the reason I haven't is because that
would be about my feelings and not Thea's.

00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,405
I don't understand.

625
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,698
There's a darkness inside of me

626
00:35:19,074 --> 00:35:21,911
that I've been trying to escape
for the longest time.

627
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:27,250
And I think that I found a way but
first I need to earn your forgiveness.

628
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,626
For what?

629
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,671
I didn't know that Vlad was your brother.

630
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,386
There are reasons
but they don't matter.

631
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,887
They don't change what I did.

632
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,349
I killed your brother.

633
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,144
(SOBS) No.

634
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:49,104
(SOBBING)

635
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,494
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

636
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,414
(SOFTLY) I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

637
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,041
You are gonna be great. Break a leg.

638
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,252
Sorry.

639
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,088
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

640
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,843
Welcome.

641
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,182
This is a day I have
looked forward to for a very long time.

642
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,603
Because today, I "stand"...
(CHUCKLES)

643
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,230
(ALL CHUCKLE)

644
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,357
...on the shoulders of many giants.

645
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,734
Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison,

646
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:39,197
Ray Palmer and, of course, Curtis Holt.

647
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:44,327
Their work has always been about
making this world a better place.

648
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,911
And today,

649
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,540
we get to take another step
towards that goal.

650
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,002
As you know, battery technology has
been at a virtual standstill

651
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:56,631
for decades, with batteries lasting
nor charging any faster

652
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,341
than they did in the 1970s.

653
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,886
Until now.

654
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,725
Today, Palmer Tech is pleased to
introduce the Power Cell.

655
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,520
A 100% recyclable battery.

656
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,564
It can charge an electric car
for thousands of miles.

657
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,652
And right now, it is, single-handedly,
not only

658
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,280
powering this entire presentation but...

659
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,241
This entire building.

660
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,909
(APPLAUSE)

661
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,379
She's something else, isn't she?

662
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,423
You have no idea.

663
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:42,843
(ROY SIGHS)

664
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:49,559
(CHUCKLES) Now you should be a nurse
in your new life. You're a natural at it.

665
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,604
Only problem is, I am a one-patient man.

666
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,689
(CHUCKLES)

667
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,274
And I am already committed to you.

668
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,151
(CHUCKLES) Is that why you're leaving?

669
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:01,195
You know, I get it.

670
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,615
Star City is filled with too many people
who can recognize you.

671
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,036
You know, I thought about staying anyway.

672
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
For you.

673
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,876
You know what you could do? For me?

674
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,046
Go live an amazing life.

675
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,091
(VOICE BREAKING) Get married,

676
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,386
have a couple kids.

677
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,554
Yeah.

678
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,098
And get a minivan.

679
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,478
Just go be normal.

680
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,484
There's nothing in this world
that would make me happier than that.

681
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:40,985
(SNIFFLES)

682
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,114
You know, if I could do
all of this over again...

683
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,369
I would do every single one
of those things with you.

684
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,830
Me too.

685
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,042
(INHALES DEEPLY) I love you, Thea Queen.

686
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,671
I love you, Roy Harper.

687
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,600
You were amazing out there.

688
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,853
(CHUCKLES) Thanks. How's Thea doing?

689
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,438
I'm gonna go check on her now.

690
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,065
I'm just gonna debrief with Curtis
but text me how she's doing, okay?

691
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,359
Okay.

692
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,365
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

693
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,163
Oh, my God.

694
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:37,332
Dad?

695
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,675
How is she?

696
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,553
Resting. Where's your new BFF, Damien?

697
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:53,098
I don't know. Like you said,
this is Thea's decision, it's not mine.

698
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,436
Oliver, I know it feels wrong,
but you did the right thing.

699
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,397
However it feels,
I couldn't have done it without you.

700
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:03,568
Malcolm, thank you. For everything.

701
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:09,198
Oliver. It's Thea.

702
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,748
How long will she be in a coma?

703
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,544
Right now she's barely
a three on the Glasgow scale.

704
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,632
(SIGHS) The prognosis
isn't good. I'm sorry.

705
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,439
Thea, please don't go.

706
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,739
There's only one way to prevent that.

707
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,367
My father once told me
of an elixir known as the Lotus.

708
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,203
Capable of countering the effects
of the Lazarus Pit,

709
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,623
a secret weapon developed
by the League's enemies.

710
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,040
Do you have it?

711
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,961
I do. And I will freely
give it to you on one condition.

712
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,632
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.
