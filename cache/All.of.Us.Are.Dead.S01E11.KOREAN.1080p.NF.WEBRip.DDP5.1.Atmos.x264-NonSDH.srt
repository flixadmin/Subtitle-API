1
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,251
Oh, Dad.

2
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,169
You…

3
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,890
Let me see you.

4
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,184
Get out!

5
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,868
Damn it.

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,329
Not here.

7
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,372
Who are you?

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,874
How did you get in?

9
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,878
I heard something.

10
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,132
I thought it was in here.

11
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,302
Out of my way.

12
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,893
Where were you? Is it okay there?

13
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,104
It's okay everywhere. I love it.

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
The school is heaven.

15
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,445
-Later.
-Where are you going?

16
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,738
You'll die if you go out.

17
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,866
Don't go out, asshole!
Do as I say.

18
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,003
Are you hungry?

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,422
What?

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,014
You…

21
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,433
hungry?

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,227
I'm starving.

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,191
I'm full right now.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,570
So you get to live.

25
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,698
Count yourself lucky.

26
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,745
What is that smell?

27
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,045
Why do you smell like them?

28
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,047
What? What do you smell?

29
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,091
Let go of me.

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,677
You were with Cheong-san, weren't you?

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,970
Who's that?

32
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,723
-Where is he?
-What are you talking about?

33
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,975
You wanna know?

34
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,689
Are you okay?

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,399
Are you hurt, On-jo?

36
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,151
What took you so long?

37
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,694
I kept waiting for you.

38
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,408
And you kids, are you okay?

39
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,413
Yeah.

40
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,331
Good.

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,086
Cheong-san.

42
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,089
Mr. Nam.

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,644
Okay. Are you all able to run?

44
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,604
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,732
Good.

46
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,445
Okay. If you go straight
through the tennis courts

47
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,281
and pass the construction site,
you'll hit the mountain.

48
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,824
If you cross the mountain…

49
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,284
…and get to Yangdong--

50
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,452
Mr. Nam!

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,374
Dad, no!

52
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,340
Kids. Run!

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,800
Shit.

54
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,846
GYMNASIUM

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,139
Hurry!

56
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,643
Come on.

57
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,353
Run! Go! Run!

58
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,730
To the tennis courts!

59
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,732
Hurry up!

60
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,238
Go! Go! Get in.

61
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,781
Get in.

62
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,498
Get in! Get in!

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,005
Run!

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
Hey, hey, hey. Wait.

65
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,101
We can't go out there.
We can't go anywhere.

66
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,270
-What should we do, Dae-su?
-Damn it.

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,647
What do we do?

68
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,070
-Oh, shit!
-What now?

69
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,812
Step back.

70
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,773
Let's go.

71
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,110
Hurry.

72
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,614
Hurry.

73
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,284
Cheong-san…

74
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,410
Take On-jo with you.

75
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,661
But why?

76
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,413
Dad, where are you going?

77
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,539
Dad. Dad!

78
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,541
Dad!

79
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,587
Dad, no!

80
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,550
Dad, come back!

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,978
Dad, come back!

82
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,272
Run!

83
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,693
Get out! Get out now!

84
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,570
Get out!

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,869
Mr. Nam!

86
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,040
Go. Go! Get out!

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,417
Hurry. Go.

88
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,133
Why are you?

89
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,594
Dad?

90
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,764
On-jo, look at me.

91
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,474
Go.

92
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,562
Run! Go.

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,650
-Go!
-Dad.

94
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,193
Go!

95
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,155
Go!

96
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,199
On-jo! Go…

97
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,869
Run.

98
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,957
Dad…

99
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,251
Go, On-jo!

100
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,795
Run!

101
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,966
Dad!

102
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:03,024
CONSTRUCTION NOTICE

103
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,025
Hurry!

104
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,821
Stop!

105
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,324
Why, why, why?

106
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,416
Go upstairs. Go!

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,043
Hurry! To the second floor!

108
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,086
Hurry!

109
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,350
Where do we go?

110
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,772
There's no way out. It's blocked.

111
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,065
There's nothing here.

112
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,191
Go through this way!

113
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,570
-Can we go?
-Let's go out this way.

114
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,988
Get back.

115
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,245
Hurry up.

116
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,459
Shit.

117
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,635
DO YOUR WORK STEP BY STEP
HASTE CAUSES ACCIDENTS

118
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,844
Careful.

119
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,520
Stay away from the edge.

120
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,729
Uh-huh.

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,569
-Here. Come here.
-Quiet.

122
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,738
Don't make any noise.

123
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,461
On-jo! Go!

124
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,338
Dad!

125
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,585
It's okay.

126
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
Just cry.

127
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,220
<i>It's better to just die.</i>

128
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,395
<i>This virus changes</i>
<i>a person into a different being.</i>

129
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,189
<i>The person I loved</i>

130
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,858
<i>becomes a monster.</i>

131
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
You can forget someone who dies…

132
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,911
but it's hard to forget someone
who has changed.

133
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,153
To think that's the very last image
of the people…

134
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,282
I loved the most.

135
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,555
Remember now?

136
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,143
I don't know anyone
named Cheong-san, you freak.

137
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:55,107
Everyone went to the assembly hall,
and I got out by myself.

138
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,609
The hall?

139
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,361
I don't know who Cheong-san is.

140
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:06,494
We went with some juniors. That's all.

141
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,080
That means the others are still there.

142
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,758
You're fucking brave.

143
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,765
You'd better run.

144
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,642
Or I'll eat you.

145
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,263
I told you to run. Why didn't you listen?

146
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,902
Damn it. Nothing is working out.

147
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,320
We keep hitting dead ends.

148
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,780
Would you just be quiet?

149
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,491
It's your fault Joon-yeong died.

150
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,201
Dae-su. Don't.

151
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,579
If you hadn't bitched at him
and just shut up,

152
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,289
he would never have jumped out there.

153
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,793
Okay. It is my fault. Happy?

154
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,545
Are you happy, asshole?

155
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,963
You give it a rest too.

156
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,506
Dae-su.

157
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,302
What does it matter who's responsible
for someone's death?

158
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,929
What does living
and dying even mean?

159
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,180
I don't know.

160
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,892
If we make it out,
will it really be living?

161
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
Hey, you know our friends died.

162
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,147
And our parents too.

163
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,191
What's the point?

164
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,985
Do you wanna die?

165
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,737
Then will you die?

166
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,364
Try being a senior.

167
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,617
Then you'll really wanna die.

168
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,285
Yeah, big deal, you're a senior.

169
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,412
You try being one.
You'll see what it's like.

170
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,997
You kids.

171
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,919
You better survive till next year
and see what it's like being seniors.

172
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,423
Survive until next year
and tell me which is harder,

173
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,841
zombies or senior year.

174
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,010
Hey.

175
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,890
Your father, he…

176
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,978
He saved all of our lives, you know.

177
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,941
I'll never forget what he did.

178
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,652
None of us ever will.

179
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,573
If many people remembered someone,

180
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,241
that person…

181
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,163
is sure to go to heaven.

182
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,917
Mm-hmm.

183
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,013
Mi-jin.

184
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,098
Let's go.

185
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,140
Where? Why?

186
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,268
Let's look for a good spot
where we can jump off.

187
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,186
We're the oldest.

188
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,688
Sure. Whatever.

189
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,523
It's not like we get any respect.

190
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,483
I'll go this way. You go that way.

191
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,988
She's so cool.

192
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,200
I'll go.

193
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,576
Stay down, kid.

194
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,911
It's okay.

195
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,999
You little…

196
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,458
Get away.

197
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,592
Oh, shit.

198
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,392
I hope no one steps up anymore.

199
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,522
Whatever ends up happening…

200
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
I hope no one sacrifices themselves.

201
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,825
It's too hard living for someone.

202
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,370
When there's nothing
you can do for them at all.

203
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
It's like you have
to live extra heart for them.

204
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,918
It's too selfish.

205
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,298
You can't die and…

206
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,634
if you don't have the courage to live.

207
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,848
Let's…

208
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,559
talk a little later, okay?

209
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,190
Tomorrow or the next day.
Or maybe even next week.

210
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,736
Let's eat, take a bath
and then we can talk about it.

211
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,323
That's what we agreed to do, right?

212
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,169
That side.

213
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,464
What?

214
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,633
You probably don't remember.

215
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,676
What?

216
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,761
Cheong-san, hold on.

217
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,768
Is it better like this?

218
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,770
Or like this?

219
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,150
Look close. Like this? Or like this?

220
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,611
That side is better.

221
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,696
Left.

222
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,741
What do you mean by that?

223
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,412
I'll tell you tomorrow.

224
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,923
Cheong-san.

225
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,008
ONE HEART

226
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,694
That moron became a zombie.

227
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:24,181
Watch as we raised the frequency to 24kHz.

228
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,448
Based on tests
that we ran previously in Hyosan,

229
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,784
they respond most at 24kHz.

230
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,836
Let's begin the briefing.

231
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,756
We plan to emit sounds using drones

232
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,092
to lure the infected
into target locations.

233
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,511
This will allow us
to maximize the resulting impact

234
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,096
with minimal explosion.

235
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,264
The targets…

236
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,267
Hyosan Intersection, the sports complex,

237
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,228
Hyosan High, Hyosan Future College.

238
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,729
A total of four.

239
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,189
Expected damage.

240
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,860
Out of 170,000 residents,
110 are in various quarantine camps.

241
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,029
Sixty thousand casualties estimated.

242
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,074
Among them,
we estimate 50,000 are infected

243
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,576
and 10,000 are uninfected or asymptomatic.

244
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,455
We'll send soldiers after the explosion
to evacuate whoever is left.

245
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,751
Play the evacuation warning nonstop
until the explosions are detonated.

246
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,486
<i>Eat him.</i>

247
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,910
<i>It's okay. Eat him.</i>

248
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,041
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

249
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,799
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

250
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,452
It's okay.

251
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,789
It's not okay.

252
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,123
Yes, it is.

253
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,876
If it happens again,

254
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,003
bite me instead.

255
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,719
If you bite me, I'll end up like you.

256
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,408
I really think that
that's the only way out.

257
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,578
No. It drops into
the basement on that side,

258
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,580
and there are exposed steel bars.

259
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,332
No way we can jump.

260
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,710
That side faces the school,
so there's no point trying it.

261
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,297
The ground is filled with zombies,
we'll die if we go down.

262
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,092
There's a door on the first floor
that leads to the mountain.

263
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,802
We have to go that way.

264
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,304
But it's full of zombies in there.

265
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,605
Can't we reach the roof
if we use that and the windows?

266
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,235
If someone goes to the roof and screams,
the zombies will follow them.

267
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,613
Then I'm pretty sure it'll empty out
in there, and the rest can escape.

268
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,781
I think it can work.

269
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,824
No.

270
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,327
-If that's the only way--
-I said no.

271
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,913
Please stop sacrificing yourselves.

272
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,874
Yeah, I agree with you.

273
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,793
We said we'd all survive together.

274
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,212
Me too.

275
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,840
I feel the same.

276
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,010
I'm with you guys too.

277
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,804
Then we should just wait for now.

278
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,014
And then what?

279
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,891
Do you have a plan?

280
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,977
Maybe if it rains again,
they won't be able to hear us.

281
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,604
Who knows when it's gonna rain?

282
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,441
Don't worry. My knees are throbbing.
It's gonna rain soon.

283
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,400
You'll see.

284
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,447
It's way too clear.

285
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,495
Hear that?

286
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,332
What?

287
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,668
They're saying to take cover.

288
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,004
Who is?

289
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,381
This is a public announcement.

290
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,384
Explosives will be detonated
at the sports complex,

291
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,554
<i>Hyosan High School, Future College,</i>
<i>and Hyosan Intersection.</i>

292
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,849
If you hear this, take shelter
in subways and underground garages.

293
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,018
We need to take cover.
There will be explosions.

294
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,770
What do you mean explosions?

295
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,063
Are you sure about that?

296
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,693
Hyosan Intersection,
Future College…

297
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,572
…and also our school will be blown up.

298
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,910
Hey, are those fucking soldiers
gonna shoot missiles at us?

299
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,161
When is it gonna happen?

300
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,454
I can't really tell.

301
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,456
They're just saying to evacuate right now.

302
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,750
Shit. Where are they expect us to go, huh?

303
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,253
When are they gonna bomb
this whole place, huh?

304
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,089
<i>Initiate operation.</i>

305
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,734
Activate the sound.

306
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,801
Send in all the drones.

307
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,972
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN
CHICKEN AND BEER

308
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,937
Won't we all die if we just stay here?

309
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,690
Do they say where to flee to?

310
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,610
They say that we should hide underground.

311
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,405
What if they drop a nuclear bomb?

312
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,075
Korea doesn't have nukes.
What are you saying?

313
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,534
-Huh?
-Whatever.

314
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,537
They're gonna blow up our school.

315
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,791
Where are we supposed to take cover?
There's nowhere to hide.

316
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,628
Cheong-san!

317
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
What?

318
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,386
It's Gwi-nam.

319
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,262
That asshole never dies.

320
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,806
Who's that?

321
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,850
Maybe we heard wrong?

322
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,519
It's quiet now.

323
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,448
Here you are.

324
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,741
-What the hell?
-Cheong-san!

325
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,919
Cheong-san! No!

326
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,923
Cheong-san!

327
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,015
No.

328
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,520
Cheong-san!

329
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,862
Help! Hurry!

330
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,448
Come on. Shit.

331
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,584
-Cheong-san!
-Don't!

332
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,165
Sir, they've all arrived at the targets.

333
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,333
Execute.

334
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,377
Let me confirm the order, sir.

335
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,462
Fire now!

336
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,354
It's okay.

337
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,857
It's not what you think. It's okay.

338
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,402
Do you hear me?

339
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,945
Don't do it.

340
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,864
You're going to be fine.

341
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,407
On-jo.

342
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,660
No one's dying.

343
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,247
Not here. Not today.

344
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,249
I just…

345
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,710
Just don't say anything.

346
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,297
Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Mm-hmm?

347
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,195
LEE CHEONG-SAN

348
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,991
You hold on to it for me.

349
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,289
And I'll hold onto this.

350
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,125
LEE CHEONG-SAN, NAM ON-JO

351
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,180
Su-hyeok, go to the first floor.

352
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,225
Cheong-san!

353
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,894
Hey!

354
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,271
All of you.

355
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,941
Come after to me!

356
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,610
Today I am…

357
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,614
…the happiest guy in this school!

358
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,788
Hey!

359
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,082
Hey!

360
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,339
Come on, everyone. This is it.

361
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,258
We have to go.

362
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,510
Nam-ra, let's go.

363
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,970
Come on.

364
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,475
Can you climb up?

365
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,939
Okay. Come down.

366
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:46,733
Hurry.

367
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,693
Hey!

368
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,037
Hey!

369
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,247
Hey!

370
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,710
Hey!

371
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,379
-Hurry. Hurry, hurry.
-Let's go faster. Come on.

372
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,381
Hey!

373
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,725
CAUTION, RISK OF ACCIDENT

374
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,573
Come at me now.

375
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,867
All of you!

376
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,066
{\an8}WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

377
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,028
Come on, come on.

378
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,864
Go, go, go.

379
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,643
You know,

380
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,105
I thought it was gonna be super fun
to kill you.

381
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,901
But not anymore.

382
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,820
I'll kill you even if it isn't fun.

383
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,572
Stop acting tough.

384
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,909
What do you think? You look cool?

385
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,286
Nobody thinks that way.

386
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,707
You're just scared
because you'll get caught

387
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,334
for killing the principal.

388
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,922
You're still a coward and a loser.

389
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,853
I have nothing to fear.

390
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,775
I'm not scared of you, either.

391
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,203
I'll gouge out your eye.

392
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,569
Run away.

393
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,200
I'll let you live if you run.

394
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,390
The Sports complex. Bombing complete.

395
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,565
Hyosan Intersection. Bombing complete.

396
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,198
Future College. Bombing complete.

397
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,681
Ah, shit.

398
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,521
Ha-ri!

399
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,607
Are you okay?

400
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,828
Commander.

401
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,381
Commander. Operation, complete.

402
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,052
Sure. Okay.

403
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,891
Send in the troops in the early morning
to take care of the rest.

404
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,059
You're in charge now, officer.

405
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,645
You want me to?

406
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,981
You'll do a good job.

407
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,860
I need a sleep.

408
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,987
I've been up for too long.

409
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,310
You're here to chat?

410
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,653
Or you came to watch?

411
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,701
I came to tell you,
Hyosan was bombed last night.

412
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,872
What was that?

413
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,043
Forty percent of the population
of Hyosan has perished.

414
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,922
You're a murderer.

415
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,676
You should be ashamed of yourself.

416
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,642
I thought about it.

417
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,978
Could anyone…

418
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,148
offered comfort to the people
of Hyosan now?

419
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,902
That is why I came to see you.

420
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,864
Please tell the people of Hyosan…

421
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,450
that I'm truly sorry.

422
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,095
{\an8}JIN SEON-MOO

423
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,240
This morning,

424
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,412
I watched the final video
of Lee Byeong-chan,

425
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,790
the man who created the virus in his lab.

426
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,961
<i>He tried to save his wife and son</i>

427
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,381
<i>who had already been infected</i>
<i>by the virus,</i>

428
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,299
<i>but he failed.</i>

429
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,135
<i>What he did was his last resort.</i>

430
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,520
Jin-su.

431
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,732
Honey…

432
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,321
<i>Please stop!</i>

433
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,532
<i>I respect the decision he made.</i>

434
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,413
{\an8}<i>Lee Byeong-chan was a father</i>
<i>and a husband.</i>

435
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,374
<i>I'm sure he couldn't kill anyone.</i>

436
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,962
However, I am a soldier.

437
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,798
So today,

438
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,968
I ordered the bombing
of the city of Hyosan.

439
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,304
No one else has instructed me to attack.

440
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,724
No one ordered me to do anything.

441
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,770
It was my decision and mine alone
as the martial law commander.

442
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,900
I take full responsibility.

443
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,260
WIFE

444
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,931
Hi, it's me.

445
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,267
Did you eat?

446
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,353
Look at the time.

447
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,022
How come you haven't eaten dinner yet?

448
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,733
And the kids?

449
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,444
Mm-hmm.

450
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,406
It's not a big deal
if they miss school a few times.

451
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,866
Better to stay healthy, right?

452
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,535
Yeah.

453
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,121
Well, I guess
we can just look for a tutor.

454
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,790
Mm-hmm.

455
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,709
It doesn't matter if it is expensive.

456
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,256
Okay, well. Maybe not too expensive.

457
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,592
Mm-hmm.

458
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,263
Well, honey.

459
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,683
I miss you.

460
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,645
Hmm?

461
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,731
I'm so sorry.

462
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,033
I love you.

463
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,305
WIFE: I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU
I LOVE YOU TOO

464
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,932
WIFE: WHEN CAN YOU COME HOME?

465
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:37,182
NAM ON-JO
