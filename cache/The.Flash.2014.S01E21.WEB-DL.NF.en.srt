00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,899
Five years ago, Eiling and Wells
were working on a project...

229
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,735
...to expand soldiers' cognitive abilities
during battle.

230

We didn't realize that Eiling was trying
to create soldiers with psychic abilities.

What do you mean, psychic?

232
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:55,496
Eiling was trying to create these super-soldiers
with telepathic and telekinetic capabilities.

233
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,958
When Wells found out about
the terrible experiments Eiling was doing...

234

...he shut down the project.

So he could've been affected

Eiling injected him with could've activated.

His brain is lit up in the exact same way.

So Grodd and Eiling
are connected somehow.

253

neural signals to Eiling's primary motor cortex.
