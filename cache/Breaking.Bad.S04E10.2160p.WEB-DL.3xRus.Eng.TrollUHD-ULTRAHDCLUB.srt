1
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,478
You can do this.

2
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,314
{\an8}<i>You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name</i>

3
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,818
{\an8}<i>number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.</i>

4
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:36,906
{\an8}<i>Third try.
Walt, if you're there, please pick up.</i>

5
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,536
{\an8}<i>I really wanted to do this together,
but I can hear him getting up.</i>

6
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,622
<i>It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.</i>

7
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,668
{\an8}So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and I...

8
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,546
{\an8}I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
without you.

9
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,425
{\an8}So call me.

10
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,850
{\an8}- Hey.
- Hey. Happy birthday, sweet 16.

11
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,976
{\an8}Thanks, Mom.

12
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,730
{\an8}Of course,
I thought you might sleep through it.

13
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,485
{\an8}So since it's almost, oh, noon

14
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,989
{\an8}I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

15
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,911
{\an8}- Pancakes?
- Pancakes it is.

16
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,621
{\an8}Oh, could you do me a favor?

17
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,499
{\an8}I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab it for me?

18
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,542
{\an8}- Sure.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
Surprise.

20
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,979
{\an8}It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty slick, huh?

21
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:56,361
{\an8}Yeah. Thanks, Mom. It's... It's great.

22
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,530
I really did a lot of research,

23
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,908
{\an8}and, I don't know,
this car just really stood out to me.

24
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,704
{\an8}It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

25
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,708
{\an8}It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

26
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,128
And, of course,
it is safe because I'm still your mother.

27
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,838
{\an8}And it has a CD player,

28
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,841
{\an8}so you can listen to tunes
while cruising around.

29
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:24,681
{\an8}So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

30
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,059
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

31
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:33,856
{\an8}Yeah, okay. Well, let's...
Let's get those pancakes going.

32
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,445
<i>Saul, he's here.</i>

33
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,117
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

34
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,868
<i>Saul?</i>

35
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,747
Send him in.

36
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,421
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

37
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,674
{\an8}Hey. Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,759
{\an8}Have a seat, please.

39
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,262
{\an8}I...

40
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,514
{\an8}I don't understand why I'm here.

41
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,184
{\an8}- Something to do with my creditors?
- Creditors? No.

42
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,273
I'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
I have some bad news.

43
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,109
{\an8}Nothing but lately.

44
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,820
{\an8}Your great-aunt Birgit passed away.

45
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,989
I'm sorry, who?

46
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,869
{\an8}Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

47
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,455
{\an8}And this was... Wow, eight years ago.

48
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,083
I just assumed you two were close,
given that...

49
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,462
Well, maybe this is good news.

50
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,423
{\an8}Birgit left behind a sizable estate

51
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,052
{\an8}of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

52
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,261
What?

53
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,139
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting

54
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,102
{\an8}while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

55
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,983
Well, I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg.

56
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:02,236
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

57
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,531
Well...

58
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:12,622
{\an8}Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,249
{\an8}They traced the inheritance
to your father.

60
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,253
- But having passed... My condolences.
- -you are the next in line

61
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:26,260
to the tune of $621,552.33.

62
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,148
He's asking if you're the chemist.

63
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,524
I'm one of them.

64
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,058
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

65
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
They synthesize their own.

66
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,240
What?

67
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,536
I don't do that.

68
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,750
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

69
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,087
That's how I know how to do it.

70
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,273
- What's he saying?
- We're working it out.

71
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,451
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product

72
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,956
he's gotta do it my way.
The right way.

73
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,588
I speak English.

74
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,757
So you understand what "asshole" means.

75
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,762
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

76
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,182
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

77
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,061
I don't know. I have no idea.
Several hours, at least.

78
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,274
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

79
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,735
Don't you have standards?

80
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
I mean, this place is disgusting.

81
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,910
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

82
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:25,750
We clean up every possible source
of contamination. And then we cook.

83
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,633
Who do you think you are?

84
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,722
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

85
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,059
And if this is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

86
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:48,397
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen

87
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:54,987
I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what I say.

88
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name</i>

89
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,530
<i>number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.</i>

90
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,702
<i>Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?</i>

91
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,247
<i>I know you're home, your car is here.</i>

92
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.</i>

93
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:38,633
<i>I... I'm gonna have to call 911.
I don't know what else to do.</i>

94
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,562
Dad?

95
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,236
Come in, if you're coming in.

96
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,077
What happened to you?

97
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,207
What happened?

98
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,631
I got into a fight.

99
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,969
What do you mean, a fight?
Like...? What fight?

100
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,931
Are you gonna talk to me here?

101
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,143
What are you doing?

102
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,687
- I'm calling Mom.
- Don't do that.

103
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,190
Look, I...

104
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:41,029
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but I'm fine.

105
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:53,833
Just do not call your mother.

106
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,711
Why not?

107
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,590
Because

108
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,052
I was gambling.

109
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,725
If you tell your mother, I just...

110
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,895
I will never, never hear the end of it.

111
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,731
So please.

112
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:26,240
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

113
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,870
Just... Just keep it to yourself.

114
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,083
I don't understand.
How'd you get into a fight?

115
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,919
And with who?

116
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,685
I made a mistake.

117
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,362
It's my own fault.

118
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,370
- I had it coming.
- Dad

119
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,580
it's okay.

120
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,294
It's all my fault.

121
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,090
I just...

122
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,843
I'm sorry.

123
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,890
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,559
Dad.

125
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,270
Come here.

126
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,941
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

127
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,944
No. Hey, hey, no.

128
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,115
- It's okay. Come on, please. It's okay.
- No.

129
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,700
Look at me. Look at me.

130
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,037
It's okay. It is. Come on.

131
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,165
Come on.

132
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,587
Come on.

133
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,133
It's... It's okay.

134
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,556
Hey.

135
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,101
How was your birthday?

136
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,688
Good. Get some rest.

137
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,815
Okay.

138
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,777
The new car

139
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,989
did you drive it here?

140
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,158
Yeah.

141
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,038
That's good.

142
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,249
You like it?

143
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,589
Sure. I do.

144
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,926
It drives great.

145
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,803
That's good, Jesse.

146
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,984
Yes.

147
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,819
- Yes.
- Well done.

148
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,367
The first of many.

149
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,205
Yeah? What's that mean?

150
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,875
You're staying.
You belong to the cartel now.

151
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,928
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognizable.

152
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:45,059
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

153
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,063
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

154
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,607
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

155
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,734
- Okay?
- What is it?

156
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,905
Well, I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

157
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,617
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

158
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,579
Yes, but it is better than prison,
correct?

159
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,333
Marginally. Which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

160
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,626
All right, good.

161
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,212
Yeah. I can't believe
he actually bought it.

162
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,006
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

163
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,593
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes

164
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,805
- it's like highway hypnosis.
- So, what's the problem?

165
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,892
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-colored glasses

166
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,103
where Johnny Fabulous is concerned.

167
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,981
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts,
and pulled his credit report.

168
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,276
If you would, note the time on that.

169
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:43,158
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

170
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:48,205
- Three hours after leaving my office.
- He bought a Mercedes SL550.

171
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,916
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4500 down.

172
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,918
He's gonna pay 1830 a month.

173
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,130
Fully loaded.
He even got the heated steering wheel.

174
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:00,300
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

175
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:05,514
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

176
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,188
Where is he now?

177
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,956
Hey.

178
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,212
How you doing?

179
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,341
Good.

180
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,684
How are you?

181
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:38,022
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

182
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,526
I called her last night.

183
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,654
Oh, God.

184
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,741
I told her
I was spending the night at Louis'.

185
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,620
It's cool. So...

186
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,873
How are you?

187
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,379
I'm fine, son. I...

188
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,259
I...

189
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,595
Well, I...

190
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,933
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery,

191
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,769
and I made the brilliant decision

192
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,314
to wash them down with a couple of beers.

193
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,069
Not my most sterling moment, I admit.

194
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,364
But I'm fine.

195
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,702
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

196
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,663
- This shouldn't be on your mind.
- It's okay.

197
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,872
No, it's not okay.

198
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,670
I'm your father,
and I don't want last night to be...

199
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,924
I mean, you really

200
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,138
can't think of me like...

201
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,640
Like what?

202
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,355
I don't understand.

203
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,077
My father died when I was 6.

204
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,997
- You knew that, right?
- Yeah.

205
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,628
He had Huntington's disease. It's...

206
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,924
It destroys portions of the brain

207
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,010
affects muscle control

208
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,639
leads to dementia,
it's just a nasty disease.

209
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,390
It's genetic.

210
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,186
Terrified my mother that I might have it,

211
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,982
so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid, but I came up clean.

212
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,612
My father fell very ill when I was

213
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,947
4 or 5.

214
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,825
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

215
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,411
My...

216
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:03,794
My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

217
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,047
She would talk about him all the time.

218
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,509
I knew about his personality

219
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,427
how he treated people

220
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,846
I even knew how
he liked his steaks cooked.

221
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,640
Medium rare.

222
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,475
Just like you.

223
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,772
I knew things about my father.

224
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,440
I had a lot of information.

225
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,152
It's because people
would tell me these things.

226
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,614
They would paint this picture

227
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,075
of my father for me.

228
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,956
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

229
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,626
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

230
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:49,423
In truth, I only have one real

231
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,759
actual memory of my father.

232
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:58,014
It must have been right before he died.

233
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,100
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

234
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,938
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

235
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,858
It was as if they used up

236
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:12,988
every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

237
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,492
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

238
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,329
There was this stench
of Lysol and bleach.

239
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,207
I mean, you could just feel it
coating your lungs.

240
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,087
Anyway, there lying on the bed

241
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,255
is my father.

242
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,135
He's all...

243
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,888
He's all twisted up.

244
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,100
And my mom

245
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,562
she puts me on her lap.

246
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:50,358
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

247
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,738
But really, he just scares me.

248
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,911
And he's looking right at me,

249
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,625
but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

250
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,091
And your grandmother is talking

251
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,428
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

252
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,224
but the only thing I could remember...

253
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,353
is him breathing.

254
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,690
This...

255
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,737
This rattling sound.

256
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,533
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

257
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,792
Like there was nothing in him.

258
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,006
Anyway...

259
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,889
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

260
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,606
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

261
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,114
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

262
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,910
Remembering you that way

263
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,415
wouldn't be so bad.

264
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,296
The bad way to remember you
would be the way...

265
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,883
The way you've been this whole last year.

266
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,345
At least last night you were...

267
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,391
You were real, you know?

268
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,234
- Bye.
- Bye.

269
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,265
Somewhere you should be?

270
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,396
Well, basically
it was a temporary hiatus.

271
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:37,108
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

272
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,570
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

273
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,157
- Hi.
- Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

274
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,077
Okay. You bet.
Say hi to the kids for me.

275
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,245
- Hey.
- Hi.

276
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,666
Nice surprise. What's up?

277
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,382
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

278
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,923
Well, things are...
Things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.

279
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,174
Oh, yeah?

280
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,241
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

281
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
Some very good news,

282
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,724
and I'm getting the business going again.

283
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,270
I figure we haven't been down long,

284
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,732
so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

285
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,026
Oh, thank you. That's...

286
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,238
Gosh, that's...

287
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,198
That's wow.

288
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,742
How is that even possible?

289
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:34,290
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

290
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,293
I guess someone's looking out for me.

291
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,045
I guess so.

292
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,175
Is that yours, outside?

293
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,678
Yeah, well, you know

294
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,847
I can't be driving a piece of crap.

295
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,064
You got to present that successful image.

296
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:56,062
Right. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

297
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,814
Yeah, it's in progress.

298
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,190
So you paid them?

299
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,526
Well, not yet, but I will.

300
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,570
When?

301
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,573
Well, it's not that simple.

302
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:11,870
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

303
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,246
So I was thinking

304
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,292
I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

305
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,545
There will never be a better deal, Ted.

306
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,048
The deal is you pay your back taxes

307
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,176
you pay your penalty,
and you don't go to prison.

308
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,345
That's a good deal. So...

309
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,346
Let's keep our priorities straight.

310
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,352
Well, my priority
is getting my business back.

311
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,982
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay their mortgages.

312
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,444
Right. But I think
your employees would agree

313
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,781
that you need to get
your financial situation in control

314
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,075
before you can help them.

315
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,660
Boy, the IRS got you on commission?

316
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,371
I'm just saying that,
though I really understand

317
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,541
the temptation to restart the business

318
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,658
maybe the universe is telling you

319
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,296
that you need to pay what you owe.

320
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,634
Skyler

321
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,677
this is my money.

322
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,142
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

323
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,646
A decision you made, by the way.

324
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,108
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

325
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,001
- Ted, this affects both of us.
- No it doesn't.

326
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,780
I'm telling you to drop this.

327
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,616
You need to use that money
to pay your bill.

328
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,243
By the end of this month.

329
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,329
Which you promised
the IRS in writing that you would do.

330
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,290
It is that simple.

331
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,876
Okay.

332
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,879
Okay, duly noted.

333
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,631
What does that mean?

334
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,343
Does that mean yes? Because
I really need a yes here, Ted.

335
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,680
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means. It means

336
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,683
in the most respectful way possible,
there's the door.

337
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,352
And I'm inviting you to, you know...

338
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:02,772
And thank you for your concern,
but I'm done talking about this.

339
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,805
From whom exactly do you think
you got that 600,000, Ted?

340
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,518
Great-aunt Birgit?

341
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,521
That was you?

342
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,274
Yeah.

343
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,522
What is this shit?

344
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,441
I don't get a vote?

345
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,068
I'm supposed to just
stay down here forever?

346
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,822
I promise you this:

347
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:38,160
Either we're all going home
or none of us are.

348
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,079
Now, settle down.

349
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,753
On your feet.

350
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,521
Gustavo.

351
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,917
This is your new employer.

352
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,294
You address him as Don Eladio.

353
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,713
It's a term of respect.

354
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,814
Gustavo.

355
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,197
Welcome to Mexico.

356
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,951
Now you say:

357
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,118
No. No, no, I don't...

358
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,264
Gustavo.

359
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,852
Gustavo

360
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,733
Miguel!

361
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,071
Make yourself useful. Find a gun.

362
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,284
I hope to hell that works.

363
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,119
Take him.

364
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,103
Keys.

365
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,190
No. No.

366
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,568
Okay. Okay.

367
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,450
Hey. Hey, you still with us?

368
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,077
Go.

369
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,308
Kid, get us out of here, kid.

370
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,812
Come on.
