Seung-wan, you have to be quiet.

[Seung-wan grunting softly]

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,209
You can't make a sound, all right?

11
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,461
[muffled] Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,298
I need your help, Seung-wan.

13
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,091
I can't do this without you.

14
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,970
Me? Uh… Uh… help you, Chief?

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,305
Uh-huh.

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,473
Well…

17
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,017
I'm ready to do anything
at your bidding whenever you'd--

18
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,602
Thank you.

19
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,603
Thank you so much.

00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,015
Uh, the thing is…

[metal cabinet clanks]

31
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,814
[Dong-jun] It wasn't a defect, sir.

32
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,816
Someone deliberately cut the wires.

33
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,279
The door to the level-one basement
was locked during the blackout.

34
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,366
[In-hwan] Who's in charge of the keys?

35
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,160
[Dong-jun]
Sergeant Bang and Chief Ji, sir.

36
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,162
As I'm sure you recall,

37
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,623
both Chief Ji and Sergeant Bang
were present at Central Plaza that day.

38
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,251
Why would someone do this?

39
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,129
They have something to hide.

40
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,714
[Dong-jun] Sir?

41
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,801
Whoever's responsible likely
used the blackout to their advantage.

42
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,553
[Dong-jun] But who, sir?

43
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,360
But, ma'am, are you, uh, sure
I can help you?

44
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,030
I mean, there are more
qualified technicians out there after all.

45
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,948
I've spent most of my days studying,

46
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,409
so I'm not very handy with tools.

47
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,121
Seung-wan.

48
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,331
Yeah?

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,749
Do you like it here?

50
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,167
Oh, you know, I'm only alive

51
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,960
because I don't have the guts
to kill myself.

52
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,087
But I've got used to living here.

53
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,757
Oh, I must've grown quite attached to it.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,508
[Chief Ji chuckles]
Is that so?

55
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,137
The monsters have taken over
every part of the world, and…

56
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,183
in this place, I feel like…

57
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,769
I'm still in touch with humanity.

58
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,773
So, Chief Ji,

59
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,108
what do you want me to…

60
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,026
Right.

61
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,779
Could you come and take a look at this?

62
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,784
Uh, what is this?

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,410
[Chief Ji] This is our living area.

64
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
Pretty cramped when you see it
in context, right?

65
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,373
So I'm thinking of expanding a little.

66
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,626
Oh. I didn't know.
I assumed what I saw was all of it.

67
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,920
Not everything is what it looks like.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,421
[inhales deeply]

69
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,424
I expect Sergeant Tak
to try to stop me, though.

70
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,968
Why would he?

71
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,262
Because…

72
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,432
symptomatic people would use it
as another place to hide.

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,185
Oh.
[nervous chuckle]

74
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,937
Yeah, all right.

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,939
Isn't that good to hear?

76
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,818
Uh, I mean, if you can't keep
everyone under control,

77
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,861
wouldn't this place be more dangerous?

78
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,571
But you're fine, aren't you?

79
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,323
What?

80
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,659
[groans]

81
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,743
What was that for?

82
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,620
You said you would help me, right?

83
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,415
That's why I'm trying to return the favor.

84
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,666
What favor?

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,960
I knew something was off with this.

86
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,169
I'm telling everyone!

87
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,087
Go for it.

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,426
But who exactly would you tell?

89
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,095
The Crow Platoon?

90
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,930
Sergeant Tak?

91
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,599
Do you even have the guts?

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,479
After all,

93
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,774
you have symptoms, Seung-wan.

[Ye-seul grunts]

- Come on!
- Seriously?

100
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,360
What?

101
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,821
What's this about?

102
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,990
Someone needs their beauty sleep,
you know that.

103
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,202
What if my skin breaks out?

104
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,662
That should be the least
of your worries right now.

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,583
[Dong-jun]
This belongs to you, doesn't it?

106

[tense music]

107
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,965
No, it doesn't.

108
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,133
Whose is it then?

109
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,636
Why?

110
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,387
I'm telling you, it's not mine!

111
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,848
I've never seen it before, I swear!

112
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,683
Come on, why won't you believe me?

113
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,353
Excuse me, sir. It's Seung-wan.

114
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,687
He's not in his bunk.

115
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,817
He's usually afraid to use the bathroom
alone at night, so this is odd.

116
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,984
Please look around again.

117
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,861
And get back to us
if you still don't find him.

[Ye-seul grunting]

119

Come on. It really hurts, okay?
Please let me go.

120

Working late, I see.
Thank you for your hard work.

121
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,377
From the monster incident
to the blackout, Sergeant,

122
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,379
this day feels like
it's dragged on forever.

123
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,801
I've purposely avoided
getting in your way until now.

124
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,304
Because I deemed you
to be a necessary asset for our safety.

125
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,973
[Chief Ji] And?

126
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,350
A light bulb went off in my head.

127
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,228
What if I was wrong about her?

128
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,819
You don't think I'm a threat
to this place's safety, do you?

129
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,113
We'll find out soon enough.

130
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,173
[Ye-seul] You have the wrong person!
I'm telling you, it's not me!

131
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,841
For fuck's sake, let me go!

132
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,556
[In-hwan] You've seen it first hand,
therefore, no explanation is needed.

133
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,101
Someone went and cut the wires
in the control room, and…

134
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,355
in there, we found a ring
that belongs to your daughter.

135
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,108
I told you, I didn't do it!

136
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,319
I told you to let go of me!

[Ye-seul] Mom.

138

00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,453

[gasps]

142
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,087
I knew nothing about this.

00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,673
Well, I'm glad.

Mom…

145
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,179
Mom, why are you doing this?

146
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,181
Come on, don't do this. Mom!

147
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,641
Let go! No!

148
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,476

you won't be treated poorly
or sent into exile.

152
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,417
After the whole incident
with Jun-il's mother,

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,045
they changed their treatment of infectees.

00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,131
So, what now?

I… I thought you wouldn't come back
for me, Chief.

161
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,861
I was so scared and all.

162

I told you I'd come back, didn't I?

Yes. Yes, you did.

Uh, I'd like to apologize
for doubting you before.

Thank you.

00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,387
Uh, Chief, what is this place, by the way?

169
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,223
- Seung-wan.
- Yes?

Why, Chief? Please, Chief Ji, help me.

00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,166
Why are you doing this?
[groans]

176
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,169
Why on earth did you wake up, Seung-wan?

177
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,715
I wanted to make this painless!

178

What are you talking about?

I… I want to get out. I want to get out.

- Please, let me out, Chief.

I won't cause you trouble.
I'll be good. Please.

Is your radio not working?

196
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,608
Check the beacon.

197
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,944
What about Yong-seok's location?
Is it coming through?

198
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,154
I got nothing, sir.

199
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,410
Sir, is Yong-seok even here?

200
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,663
What if Sergeant Kim had all of it wrong?

201
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,292
What if we fucking die here
for nothing? Goddamn it.

202
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,755
I would've come for any one of us.

Even for you, you bastard!

204

Isn't that what families do, huh?

205
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,557
Sir, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,600
I let the fears get to me.
Like I'm some wuss.

207
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,893
Of course, it's terrifying.

208
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,104
I totally understand that.

209
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,814
But let's see this through to the end.

210
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,275
We have to find Yong-seok, man!

211
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,152
That's what we're here for.

00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,863
Jong-hyun, got that?

213
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,947
Come on.

214
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,885
The signal is feeble, sir.

215
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,595
It must be because of the monsters.

216
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,599
They're probably
just hiding out somewhere.

217
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,808
What should we do then?

218
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,270
First, we're gonna find Jeong and Min
in the research lab.

219
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,106
Then resume the search for Yong-seok.

220
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,942
Can we leave Dr. Lim unsupervised, sir?

221
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,403
I'm just worried about him.

222
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,738
I've warned him enough.

223
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,241
If he's in danger, he'll radio us.
So listen closely.

224
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,284
Yes, sir.

- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

What's strange, sir?

The picture's too perfect.

What kind of person were you?

Did you have a family?

and people like me
get to keep living as humans.

What's it like to be a monster?

Is it better?

264
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,994
I guess there's no way of telling
unless I experience it for myself.

Will I kill him if he's a monster?

Sir, you told me to do
whatever feels right.

Uh, not anymore.

Isn't it dangerous
because of the monsters?

304

The monsters don't come in here.

305
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,986
Did you see somebody
in a military uniform like us?

306
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
He was probably here not long ago.

00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,742
- Yes, I did.
- Are you sure?

308

Where is he now?

309

What happened to her?

A fire started where she was staying.
I think there was no way out.

314
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,544
She was already unconscious

by the time I made it in.

316
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,215
It's carbon monoxide poisoning.

317
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
Something like a small gas tank
should be lying around.

318

What is it?

It's out of oxygen.

Don't say that
unless you've tried everything.

If you don't want to help, get out.

334
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,336
Cha Hyun-su, help me carry her.

335
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,838
Let's get her to the stadium.
We have to leave now.

336
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,925
I said help me carry her!

God, you're so pathetic.

00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,464
You're ugly on the outside,

342
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,843
but you're even uglier from the inside.

343
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,141
You're cowardly.

344
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,811
You're a liar.

[scoffs]

348
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,781
Why keep me around
if you hate people so much?

349
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,117
What makes me so different?

350
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,793
By the way, those guys…

351
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,172
It was almost like they were shining.

[Ha-ni chuckles]

Isn't it funny?

354
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,263
I really had butterflies, though.

355
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,933
Even that foxy bitch
looked hot, didn't she?

356
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,061
They were full of life.

357
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,359
I wanted that for myself.

358
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,573
But all that remains of me
is a hollow husk.

359
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,036
You wanna know how you're different?

360
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,038
Hmm?

361
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,791
I liked how you were empty inside.

362
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,795
I liked how you didn't shine at all.

363
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,343
That way, I won't worry
you'll be a monster.

364
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,058
I could care less if you're just
a hollow shell of a human being.

365
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,894
What matters is that

366
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,355
you're still alive.

367
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,156
So where do we go now?

368
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,410
Some place free of humans and monsters.

369
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,121
[scoffs]
Sounds like a complete buzzkill.

370
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,070
Are you feeling better now?

We did the best we could.

373
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,541
Are you comfortable with this?

374
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,545
Is leaving her to die like that
really the right thing to do?

375
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,132
Now that I think about it…

376
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,262
I think it's what she wanted.

377
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,972
What?

378
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,975
Her boat was deliberately burned.

379
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,478
But she chose to stay aboard.

380
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,525
[Eun-yu] Why, though?

381
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,112
Why would Yi-kyung do that?

382
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,661
I wanna ask you something.

383
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,754
How's everyone doing?

384
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,682
[Eun-yu sighs]

385
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,560
Hye-in and Su-yeong are dead.

386
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,646
And Yoon Ji-su, too.

Just like that, they're all gone.

Now let me ask you a question.

SURVIVORS, TURNING, DEAD

391

LEE EUN-HYEOK

393
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,099
Were you the last one…

394
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,269
to see Lee Eun-hyeok that day?

395
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,355
You met, right?

396
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
How was he?

397
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,862
He was the same as always, you know.

398
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,244
And I didn't notice
anything off about him.

Then you…

403

you don't know, I guess…

404
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,349
what happened to him either.

405
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,226
Whether he became a monster or…

406
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,361
Thank you, though.

407
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,409
You still came back to me.

408
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Excuse me.

409
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,305
I know we just met, but…

410
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,223
you're resisting it, right?

411
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,100
Yeah.

412
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,393
Sorry about that.

413
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,063
I didn't mean to be rude,
but I had to check.

414

It's okay.

415

The person Eun-yu was looking for…

416
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,863
are you really him?

417
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
No.

418
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,076
At least I don't think so.

419
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,331
There's someone that means more to Eun-yu.

420
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,253
Please take good care
of Yi-kyung and Eun-yu.

[Hyun-su] I have to find someone.

423

We need to talk.

Yi-kyung is very sick.

428
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,160
She could die any moment.

429
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,416
Just tag along.

430
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,103
What does it mean to die?

431
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,523
It means to say farewell.

432
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,237
She'll never be around anymore.

433
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,947
I'm okay with that.

434
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,245
Hyun-su, you just don't get it.

435

Mom hates me.

436

She wished I just disappeared.

437
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,920
So I won't go see her.

438
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,799
No, you're the one who doesn't get it.

439
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,014
You may accept it for a while…

No.

445
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,130
Then why not save her life?

446
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,133
[Hyun-su] That would be nice.

447
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,763
But that's not an option.

448
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,642
Am I supposed to do anything?

449
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,145
No, you don't have to do anything.

450
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,359
You just…

451
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,572
stay by her side to the end.

That's the monster
that killed Mr. Kim, right?

It gets on my nerves
when you use the word "kill."

00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,865
Well, nonetheless,
that's how it went down.

because she opened the stadium to us.

[Yong-seok] Seok-chan.

Those things…

667
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,621
have no intention of letting us go.

668
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,290
Run away.

669
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,959
Get the hell out of here!

670
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,587
[clanking]

671
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,769
What's going on?

672
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,440
We need to talk.

673
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,610
Well, I think you owe me an explanation.

674
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,993
I'm the one you should be talking to.

675
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,164
What's your business here?

676
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,376
We're taking the soldier
in the isolation area.

677
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,089
Sir, if you just don't get in our way,
we'll leave as quietly as we can.

678
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,175
No. I won't allow that.

679
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,468
I don't need your approval.

680
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,933
[coughs]

681
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,729
Let's try again, I guess.

682
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,027
Isolating symptomatic individuals
is protocol.

683
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,613
We follow the same rules as you soldiers.

684
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,073
[Yeong-hu] Cut the crap.

685
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,908
You knew he had no symptoms, right?

686
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,495
I don't know what the fuck
you're doing to innocent, healthy people,

687
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,455
but I'm not gonna play your sick games.

688
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,501
We were giving him a chance.
An opportunity.

689
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,921
We tried to mold him
into becoming like us.

00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,556
were lab rats here.

Are you going to hit me with that?

713
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,481
Bring him back.

714
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,775
Bring Cha Hyun-su back now.

715
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,069
He's hurt, you know.

716
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,405
Let him rest a bit.

717
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,991
I only came to help him
because the pain was killing him.

718
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,326
So don't be like that.

719
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,809
This is all your people's fault, you know.

720
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,905
I thought Hyun-su was in control?

721
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,116
I'm also Cha Hyun-su.

722
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,326
You're a monster. I need the real Hyun-su.

723
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,287
We agreed to help each other out.

724
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,997
I can't exactly have Cha Hyun-su

dying on me, you know.

726
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,918
Why don't you leave him be and get lost?

01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,462
You mean it?

728
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,714
Sure that's what you want?

729
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,675
Are you sure you would be okay with just

730
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,969
a weak Cha Hyun-su?

Yes.

Don't know.

What should we do?

I knew you would come back.

That is, if you hadn't
been slain somewhere.

Uh…

I don't think we've met before.

For you too, this place meant everything.

Well, you know how it is.

Being a famous figure.

745
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,326
I simply can't recognize
everyone who recognizes me.

Were you a researcher?

747
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,796
I'm not all that interested in people, so…

748

I don't like 'em, you see.

749
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:50,469
You showed a lot of interest in me
despite what you say.

Yeah.

I'm glad we meet again.

I was worried, you know,

01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,228
that you might be dead.
