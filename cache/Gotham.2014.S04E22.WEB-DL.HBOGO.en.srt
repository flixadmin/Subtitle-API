1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,120
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,000
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,200
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,080
Whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,280
I care about you, and I always will.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,040
Jerome is dead.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,320
Long live, me.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,840
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I have bombs planted around the city.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,720
These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
to demolish with his bombs.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
Once those buildings are blown,

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
they collapse and create the
labyrinth from the finished drawing.

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,440
I have the locations
of every bomb Jeremiah planted.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
How did they beat you, huh?

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,360
I'll have to start again.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
I had a vision

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,160
of Gotham in flames.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,640
Together, we can make that happen.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,920
Now listen closely
to what you must do.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
Hold on, Selina.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,480
It's okay. It's okay.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,640
- Make way.
- We'll do everything we can,

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,200
but the evacuation has us dealing
with a skeleton crew.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,280
- Bruce.
- Selina.

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm right here.
You're at the hospital.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
You're gonna be okay.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Are you gonna leave me?

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
No.

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,840
No, I'm gonna be right here.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,040
You promise?

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I promise.

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,880
You know, I don't know
why I brought him here.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,240
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,200
You did the right thing, Alfred.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
You say that.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
You didn't see what he did to Selina.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,080
Right. I better get to the hospital.

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll stop by when I can.

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Alfred.

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
He couldn't have put a cap in that
psycho, done the world a favor?

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Where are we?

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Bomb squad's at the last site
on the map.

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,440
After they disarm the bomb,
they're gonna put it in a warehouse

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,880
with all the others.
Also, the mayor called.

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,600
He wants to lift
the evacuation order.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,400
Tell him we're not doing anything

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,240
until we have all the bombs
locked away.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Pardon me, Jim.

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't you all have work to do?

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,920
- What is it?
- I'd like to press charges

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
against Bruce Wayne's butler.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,480
I mean, just look at my face.

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
I think you look great.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,520
And I'd like to speak to Bruce again.

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,600
We couldn't really talk before,

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,200
what with his girlfriend
bleeding out all over him.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,960
You tried to prove
you're better than your brother.

59
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
But I'm still here.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,320
The city's still here.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You're a failure, Jeremiah.

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,520
Enjoy Arkham. Your brother did.

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
Put him in the box.
Get him ready for transport.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,640
Bring me Bruce Wayne, and I'll
tell you where the other bombs are.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
We have all your bombs.

66
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
The maze bombs, yes.

67
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,960
I mean the other ones.

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,880
Jim, as an engineer,
you expect systems to fail,

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
so you build in redundancies.

70
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,480
And I am a very good engineer.

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,720
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,240
How many lives are you willing
to bet?

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
You're right, you know.

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
I did fail.

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
I didn't yet understand
the vision I was servicing,

76
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,720
but I do now.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,840
My eyes are open, as will yours be.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,240
When you realize I'm not bluffing,
bring me Bruce Wayne.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,440
And I'd like a coffee. Black.

80
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Two sugars.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
No heartbeat.

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Extraordinary.

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
This better work.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,840
The chemicals that turned him
into this, beautiful specimen

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,240
kept his organs surprisingly
well preserved.

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,560
Once we flush his body
with antitoxin,

87
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,800
we'll top him off
with some fresh blood.

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,120
And a quick jolt to the heart
will see him good as new.

89
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
You hear that?

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,160
- You're gonna be cured.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
What?

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,240
When?

93
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
What is it?

94
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,640
Selina's been shot
by that lunatic Jeremiah.

95
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
She's at Gotham General.

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
- I have to go. I'll be back.
- Of course.

97
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
You go check on the kid.

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,640
What? No, she's in surgery.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
I'm gonna kill Jeremiah.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,960
- I'll come with you.
- I don't advise that.

101
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
The procedure
should not be interrupted.

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Stay.

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll be here...

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,080
...making sure everything
goes as planned.

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm doing this for Butch,
not for you.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
It's okay.

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,800
Unfortunately, there's no telling

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
just how many battery bombs
Jeremiah produced.

109
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,720
He was fanatically secret
about his technology,

110
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,160
and Bruce trusted him, so...

111
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
He's gotta be bluffing.

112
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Yeah?

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,480
Capt, mayor's on the phone again.

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
The evacuation stays in effect.

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,440
I will tell him when it's lifted.

116
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
<i>You think there are more bombs?</i>

117
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
Up 'til now, Jeremiah's actions
sprang

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
from the fear and hatred
of his brother.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,320
Even his obsession with Bruce
is just a reflection of Jerome's.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,320
What did he mean when he said

121
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,440
he didn't understand the vision
he was serving?

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,880
That his eyes had been opened?

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,640
Perhaps the previous mayor
took orders from a police captain.

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Sir, Captain Gordon is...

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,120
Jim Gordon is not
the mayor of Gotham, I am.

126
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,080
The people need to know
the city is safe.

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm lifting the order.

128
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
What are you looking at?

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
There's a man on the building
across the street, staring at us.

130
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
What?

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
{\an5}How many bombs are there?

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,640
{\an5}- Where are they?
- I want to talk to Bruce Wayne.

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,480
Tell me where they are,
you son of a bitch.

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,040
{\an5}- Who's helping you?
- Bruce Wayne.

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,160
{\an5}You are never gonna talk
to Bruce Wayne, you hear me?

136
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,200
{\an5}Then, more people will die.

137
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
{\an5}But you never were good at holding on

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
{\an5}to what you care about,
were you, James?

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,800
{\an5}Jim!

140
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,360
{\an5}We need you out here now!

141
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
{\an5}Can I help you?

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
{\an5}Captain Gordon.

143
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,880
{\an5}Major Rodney Harlan,
Seventh Division, Fort Henry.

144
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,760
{\an5}Major, I assume you're here
to help with the evacuation.

145
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,440
{\an5}If so, Detective Bullock
can coordinate.

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
{\an5}The governor's declared martial law.

147
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
{\an5}Until this crisis is resolved,
I'm in charge here.

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,240
{\an5}- Are you serious?
- Son, this is not a pissing match.

149
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,600
{\an5}I was sent here to restore order
in a chaotic situation.

150
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
{\an5}Can I count on you?

151
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
{\an5}Yes, sir.

152
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,440
{\an5}- What do we got?
- Not much.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,920
{\an5}Valeska had a plan to knock down
a number of buildings in Gotham.

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,760
{\an5}We recovered those bombs,
but he stashed away more.

155
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,760
{\an5}Who's helping him?
Somebody's got to be.

156
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,000
It's unclear.

157
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,960
{\an5}We've heard reports that
his followers have turned on him,

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,680
{\an5}which would indicate
he has someone else.

159
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
{\an5}He would like to talk to Bruce Wayne.

160
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,960
{\an5}- That's clearly a trap.
- His brother pulled the same gag.

161
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,520
{\an5}There was a blimp,
it was a whole thing.

162
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,080
{\an5}We'll make sure he's safe.
Get me Bruce Wayne.

163
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,800
{\an5}Major, you cannot bring
Bruce Wayne down here.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
{\an5}This is not your call, Captain.

165
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,920
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

167
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
Arrest Captain Gordon.

168
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,880
{\an5}- That's not necessary.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

169
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,920
{\an5}- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- You listen to me!

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
This city is holding on by a thread.

171
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
I will not allow anything
to jeopardize it further,

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
{\an5}including insubordination.

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
Escort Captain Gordon
across the river.

174
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
Hold him there
until you hear from me.

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
Get me Bruce Wayne.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,920
I strike where you lie,
death's gentle cousin.

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
The answer's sleep, Ed.

178
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
It's polite to let people finish.

179
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,280
Rise and shine!

180
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,680
Good morning, sweetheart.

181
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
I know, waking up in the Narrows,
a prisoner.

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Must feel like history
repeating itself.

183
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,800
- Ed...
- Speaking of history,

184
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
remember when you punched me
in the face?

185
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
That felt good.

186
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,200
Listen to me, Jeremiah Valeska
has more bombs.

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,440
- You have to...
- I have to what, Jim?

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
Set you free? Help save the city?

189
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,520
Well, we've been there, done that,
and guess what.

190
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,720
Shocker!
Lee and I are still fugitives.

191
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
I offered her a way out.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
Oh, by returning the money?

193
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
She's dispersed that among
all the deadbeats of the Narrows.

194
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,480
Not exactly what I would've done,
but point is, it's gone.

195
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,040
Now, on with the show!

196
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,760
We're a little, pressed for time.

197
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Ed.

198
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,680
Ed. Ed, wait. Ed...

199
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, Ed!

200
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
- This is 50 pounds of pressure.
- Ed...

201
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,400
What are you doing?

202
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,640
<i>Peine forte et dure.</i>

203
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,440
Well, it's my own version of it,
anyway.

204
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,040
You see, in the old days,
they used to pile weights

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
on a prisoner's chest

206
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
to try to get a confession.

207
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,280
Usually, they just died.

208
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
That's a hundred pounds.

209
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Why?

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,640
To help Lee break free
from her history.

211
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,360
You see, she has this anchor,
dead weight, holding her to her past,

212
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
and that's you.

213
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,760
Once you're gone,

214
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,520
she'll finally be free to be
the person

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,040
she was meant to be,
the person I want her to be.

216
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
150.

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
You see, I saw you together.

218
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,240
I saw the way she looked at you.

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,760
So, for her sake, you're gonna die.

220
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,560
And for my sake,

221
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
you're gonna suffer.

222
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,040
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

223
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,000
This evacuation's gonna leave
a lot of territory undefended.

224
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,240
A shame not to capitalize.

225
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Hello, Barbara.

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,720
I was only hoping to talk.

227
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,960
By attacking my people?

228
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,480
- Call it a precaution.
- What do you want?

229
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
I'm leaving Gotham,
and I want you to come with me.

230
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,520
Try again.

231
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I had a vision when I took back
the Demon's Head.

232
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,160
Death, destruction,
the city in flames.

233
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,680
But it didn't come to be.

234
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
- How disappointing for you.
- Indeed.

235
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,440
For many reasons.

236
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,040
Not least is that for centuries,

237
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,760
I have depended on the Demon's Head
to get ahead of my enemies,

238
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,960
but without the full measure
of its power...

239
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Wait.

240
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,320
Are you saying you think
some of it might still be in me?

241
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Interesting.

242
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,240
So, I guess you're here
to kill me for it?

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,040
You misunderstand.

244
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Remember the woman from the tapestry?
The one whose features you share?

245
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,800
The whore you murdered?
How could I forget?

246
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
I lied to get under your skin.

247
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I loved her.

248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Very much.

249
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,040
I offered her eternity,
but she turned it down.

250
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,240
And now I make you the same offer.

251
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,600
Join me, and we will rule
the League of Shadows together.

252
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Think about it.

253
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,160
What about your vision?
The city on fire?

254
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,960
I am making certain of it even now.

255
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,080
Its destruction will give rise
to the one I foresaw long ago,

256
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
the one who brought me here,

257
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
my heir.

258
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh, Bullock?

259
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Bullock, can you tell these punks
to let us go, please?

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,920
Major, the men escorting Gordon
were attacked.

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Your guys didn't see who.

262
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm thinking it's either
Valeska's cultists or...

263
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Enough. Did you prepare Valeska
like I asked?

264
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah.

265
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Mr. Wayne, you'll be perfectly safe.

266
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,640
If you can help us learn
the location of the bombs...

267
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Major, you brought me here
against my will.

268
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,400
I want to go back to the hospital
and back to my friend.

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Let's get this over with.

270
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Hello, Bruce.

271
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
It's great to see you.

272
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
Where are the bombs, Jeremiah?

273
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,280
Closer, please.

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Closer.

275
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Tell me.

276
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
How is the young lady doing?

277
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,680
You know why we're destined
to be best friends?

278
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,560
Because we're very much alike.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,160
You are as I used to be
at war with your true nature.

280
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,320
You must truly embrace it
if you ever want to be free.

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm just trying to help you.

282
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Trying to help me...

283
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,840
by torturing Alfred?

284
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,640
Trying to destroy Gotham?
By shooting Selina?

285
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,800
You think we're alike because there's
a darkness inside both of us.

286
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
But the difference is,
I know how to control mine.

287
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,320
I think you could be so strong.

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I see it.

289
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
He sees it too.

290
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,960
What do you mean he?

291
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
Ask him about the bombs.

292
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Where are the other bombs?

293
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,280
What bombs?

294
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,800
<i>The bombs you've planted
around the city.</i>

295
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
You blew up the mayor.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
That bomb.
Yes, that was the only one.

297
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440
But it did what it had to.

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
It got you here.

299
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Well, that's enough.
I want my boy out, mate.

300
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,520
You said he.

301
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Who do you mean?

302
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,120
The one who opened up my eyes,
who showed me

303
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,000
that everything I was doing was not
to create a Gotham of my own,

304
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
but yours.

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,440
The Gotham you need.

306
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
Your dark island.

307
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,480
And it will come to be, Bruce.

308
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Tonight.

309
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,920
Tell me his name.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
What did the doctor say?

311
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,280
Will the little bitch ever
walk again?

312
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
What vertebrae did I sever?

313
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,480
I was hoping for the lumbar.

314
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,800
Tell me his name!

315
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,760
But you already know his name.

316
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
You're his heir.

317
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Ra's al Ghul.

318
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
No, it can't be.

319
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
- Bullock.
- Yeah.

320
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,480
350 pounds of pressure.

321
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Getting hard to breathe?

322
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I'll take that as a yes.

323
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,240
You know, if we listen carefully,
we can hear some ribs cracking soon.

324
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
450.

325
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,720
Healthy male adult.

326
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,080
His ribs should be able to take
about 450 pounds before they crack.

327
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,320
Did you think you could hide
this from me, Ed?

328
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm Queen of the Narrows,
people tell me things.

329
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I know how this looks.

330
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,640
It looks like you're trying
to crush him to death

331
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
because you think we still have
feelings for each other.

332
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,840
Well, perhaps we should jump
to why this is a good thing.

333
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,120
I can't wait.

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,360
He's holding you back.

335
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
From?

336
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,520
From being the person
that you are meant to be.

337
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,160
The woman that I love.

338
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,120
You really think so little of me?

339
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't follow that.

340
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,840
How weak would that person need to be
if Jim Gordon could hold her back?

341
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
It's actually insulting.

342
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
- That's not what I intended. I...
- Enough.

343
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,960
Yesterday...

344
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,880
...you said a part of you would
always care for me.

345
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,480
The woman you loved is gone.

346
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Understand?

347
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes.

348
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,360
The Narrows is free
from landlords and gangs.

349
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,000
Every family has money
to build their life.

350
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm done. I'm leaving.

351
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,520
I want you to come with me,
but if you kill Jim, don't bother.

352
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
And I will decide
who I'm going to be.

353
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,040
Not you, not Jim Gordon. Me.

354
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I'm leaving tonight.

355
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
It's your choice.

356
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
She chose me, Jim.

357
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Did you hear that?

358
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
That's all I wanted.

359
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
You can have Gotham.

360
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,400
By the time I got there,
Jeremiah had already escaped.

361
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,800
Right.
Where the hell is Ra's al Ghul?

362
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,680
Alfred, let me guess.

363
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Ra's helped Jeremiah kidnap Bruce,
so you came to me to find Ra's.

364
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
Would you care to tell me
where he is?

365
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
I don't know where he is

366
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,600
but I know where he's gonna be.

367
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,080
Ra's is leaving Gotham tonight,
after turning it to a pile of rubble.

368
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,520
With, I assume, Jeremiah's help,
so here's the deal.

369
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,520
You get to kill Jeremiah,
you get to rescue Bruce

370
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,040
and I get to kill Ra's.

371
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,840
And how do you plan on doing that,
then?

372
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,920
I got a little surprise for him.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,120
One question.

374
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,040
Who do I get to kill?

375
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
The only way to keep Butch
on the table

376
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
was to promise I would come help.

377
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Well...

378
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,720
...don't we make quite
the little gang?

379
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,960
Let's do this.

380
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Hey.

381
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
My car's around the corner.

382
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
You're gonna want to ice those ribs.

383
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,080
Is it true, about you leaving Gotham?

384
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,520
- Yes.
- And taking Ed with you?

385
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,360
That's none of your concern.

386
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,520
Back in the GCPD,
when I told you there was so much,

387
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,680
I wished I could change.
You asked me what I meant.

388
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,520
- Jim...
- I would change everything

389
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,760
that brought us to this point.

390
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
I would ask you to leave Gotham
with me

391
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
that first moment I saw you,

392
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
and I would make sure
we had a life together.

393
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Then you wouldn't be you.

394
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
Maybe that'd be a good thing.

395
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
No, it wouldn't.

396
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm not going back to who I was.

397
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,240
But what you said yesterday

398
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,360
about a part of you
always caring for me,

399
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
I feel the same way.

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Good-bye.

401
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Now, go save Gotham.

402
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,320
- Jim.
<i>- Harvey?</i>

403
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,040
Thank God, you're all right.
What the hell happened?

404
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,200
<i>It's a long story.</i>

405
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,520
<i>Did Harlan get Bruce to the precinct?</i>

406
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,800
Yeah. It's bad.

407
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,960
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

408
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,040
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.
He took the bombs, all of them.

409
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
It's true.

410
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,360
- How did you two...
- Find each other?

411
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
I like to think it was you, Bruce.

412
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
You brought us together.

413
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
I trust things went smoothly?

414
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,960
Like clockwork.

415
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,040
Did your men retrieve my bombs?

416
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,240
They are en route to their positions
as we speak.

417
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
From here,

418
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,480
we can take in the full majesty
of Gotham's destruction.

419
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
You're both insane.

420
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,200
I know it's difficult to fathom,
Bruce,

421
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,800
but Jeremiah and I
are doing this for your benefit.

422
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,920
How is destroying Gotham
supposed to help me?

423
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,080
Because I had a vision,

424
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,000
that out of this crucible
of blood and fire

425
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,680
will rise the dark knight
that your city needs.

426
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,000
That I need.

427
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,320
To be honest, Bruce...

428
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,040
...prophesies, visions,
not really my cup of tea.

429
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,040
But our friend revealed something
to me,

430
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,200
that my twin obsessions,
rebuilding Gotham

431
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,520
and rebuilding you,
are one and the same.

432
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,680
You're the brother I never had...

433
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
...the one Jerome never could be.

434
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,840
We will create a legacy in this city.

435
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,880
Gotham falls, we rise.

436
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Together.

437
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,800
A dozen transport vans were stolen
from the GCPD motor pool.

438
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,280
That's got to be
how they're carrying the bombs.

439
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,000
There were sightings here,
here and here.

440
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,920
They're moving towards
the outskirts of Gotham.

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,880
Jeremiah must've changed targets.

442
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
- Gordon.
- Perfect.

443
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
You have some explaining to do.

444
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,560
- What happened to my men?
- Major, we got serious fish to fry.

445
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
I didn't ask for your opinion,
Detective.

446
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Two more sightings.

447
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Bolyston and Third
and then, moving north

448
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
along the Van Hook Highway.

449
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
What? That doesn't make any sense.

450
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
What buildings
would he be targeting there?

451
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,240
Told me Jeremiah promised
to turn Gotham into a dark island.

452
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,880
We need to cancel the evacuation.

453
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,640
- Get those people off the bridges.
- Absolutely not.

454
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
They're filled with people
leaving the city.

455
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,320
We'll bring them back into Gotham.

456
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,640
- Buildings fall...
- The bridges are the targets.

457
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,800
- Harper, spread the word.
- Don't move.

458
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,240
Arrest Captain Gordon.

459
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
I wouldn't do that.

460
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Arrest them both.

461
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
Officer, your radio.

462
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
This is Captain Gordon.

463
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
I want all the bridges
cleared immediately.

464
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,320
I repeat: clear all the bridges.

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,720
Civilization is so fragile, Bruce.

466
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,760
Gotham is soon to be each man
for himself,

467
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,040
a more savage place.

468
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Sounds like fun.

469
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Sure you want to leave?

470
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh, hey, Bruce.

471
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Freak.

472
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hello, Barbara.

473
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm really glad you came.

474
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Bad news, baby.

475
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm not leaving.

476
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Gotham's in my blood,

477
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,320
and I don't think
I can let you leave, either.

478
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,720
You re-forged it. Well, now.

479
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,760
You see, you say you're leaving,

480
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,800
but I've got a feeling
you're gonna be back.

481
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,320
And I don't like
looking over my shoulder.

482
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,360
Need I remind you, Barbara,

483
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,680
you've already tried using
that knife.

484
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
And also, you're outnumbered.

485
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,840
That Demon's Head's
really not working out for you, huh?

486
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,200
Help! Help!

487
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,440
Bullock, what the hell is going on?

488
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
Why are we clearing the bridges?

489
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,920
Because we said to do it.
Now just do it.

490
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,560
Did a GCPD transport van
come through here?

491
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,560
About 20 minutes ago.
Had to make way for it.

492
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
- What's your status?
<i>- All the bridges are being cleared.</i>

493
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,680
But I just heard from our choppers

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,920
and they spotted vans
on every bridge.

495
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
Vans are in position.

496
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,880
Bombs could go off any minute.

497
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
What the hell?

498
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,200
Jim!

499
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Out of the way!

500
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,400
When will you ever learn, Barbara?

501
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,320
- The knife has to be held by...
- Held by Bruce Wayne. I get it.

502
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,200
So, you know, this is for Selina.

503
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,440
In that case, it must be
very disappointing for you,

504
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,480
dying like this.

505
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
What are you doing?

506
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,080
Well done, Barbara.

507
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
The choice is now yours.

508
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,440
Stay, Bruce Wayne,
or accept your destiny,

509
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,440
become Gotham's dark knight.

510
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,840
Seems Jeremiah's made good
on his threat.

511
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,520
And I take it that means
you're not leaving.

512
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
How can I?

513
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,160
They need me more than ever now.

514
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,080
No one will help them but me.

515
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,920
So, what does that mean for us?

516
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Ed, this is the end of the road
for us.

517
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,800
All this time, I've been calling the
other Ed stupid and I'm the idiot.

518
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,520
You were never gonna leave with me.

519
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,400
You just wanted to save Jim Gordon.

520
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,720
You and Jim really aren't
that different.

521
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,920
You both think you know me.

522
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,520
You both want to change me.

523
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
Neither one of you really sees me.

524
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,240
For what it's worth, Ed,

525
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,720
I was offering you something real.

526
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
But I was never gonna be
who you wanted.

527
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,720
Sooner or later,
you were just gonna kill me.

528
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,160
It's just what you do.

529
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,840
That's quite possible.

530
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,320
But you're wrong, Lee.

531
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
I do see you.

532
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,440
Calm.

533
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Where's Butch?

534
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
What did you do with him?

535
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm right here.

536
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,040
You're you.

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

538
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm me again.

539
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,280
- Yeah.
- I love you.

540
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
I love you too, baby.

541
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Oswald.

542
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
I'll never forget this.

543
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,720
Anything you need, I'm there.

544
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Thank you, Butch.

545
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,920
I want you to know
I consider you a friend,

546
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,240
and that I am truly sorry.

547
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
What?

548
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,920
Did you think I forgot
that you murdered my mother?

549
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,280
That I just got over it?

550
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,600
I have lived with that pain
every day.

551
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,560
I could have killed you
any time I wanted,

552
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,640
but I believe in an eye for an eye.

553
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,720
You took away the one person I love,

554
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,840
so I took away the one person
you love.

555
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,360
And you get to live with that.

556
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
All of this...

557
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
...finding Strange, curing Butch,

558
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,800
was all so you could kill him
in front of me?

559
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,280
Exactly.

560
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
But don't worry,

561
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,680
in time, when I feel
that you have suffered enough...

562
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,240
...I will kill you, too.

563
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,880
Not if I kill you first.

564
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,080
You're welcome to try.

565
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,720
I'll kill you!

566
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Selina!

567
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
How is she?

568
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,400
She did well in surgery,

569
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,360
but the bullet severed her
spinal cord

570
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,000
and the damage is likely permanent.

571
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,840
Mr. Wayne, the hospital
is shutting down.

572
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,280
This is the last ambulance
leaving for the boats.

573
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,400
We have room for you,
but we need to go.

574
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Bruce.

575
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,240
I can't leave, Alfred.

576
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Ra's was right.

577
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,920
This is what I'm meant to do.

578
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
The city's abandoned, Master Bruce.

579
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,680
There's nothing more
you can do here, mate.

580
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,120
Jeremiah's still out there.

581
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
He is not your responsibility.

582
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,840
Gotham is not your responsibility.

583
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm making it mine.

584
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,280
Oh, sod it.

585
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
All right, fine.

586
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
- We'll both stay.
- No.

587
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
I need to know Selina's
gonna be okay.

588
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Please.

589
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
All right, I'll see
that she's safe...

590
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
...and then I'll come back
and I will find you.

591
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I promise.

592
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,000
You just can't throw in the towel
on an entire city.

593
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,240
There's no way to know
how many bombs are still out there.

594
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,720
The power's out,
water supply's damaged.

595
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,520
You're giving up, plain and simple.

596
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
We're proceeding with the evacuation.

597
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,800
Boats will run all night.

598
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,320
Everyone leaves,
including the police.

599
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
Now, the governor's
declared the city off-limits

600
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,800
until the situation can be evaluated.

601
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,520
Well, I'm not leaving, so if
you're gonna arrest me, do it now.

602
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He's right, Jim.

603
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,920
The government's given up
on the place,

604
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,160
there's gonna be nobody here.

605
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,480
The gangs are carving up turf.

606
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,000
In two hours, this city's
gonna be a battleground.

607
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,840
Hey!

608
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
What are you guys doing here?

609
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Yes.

610
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,000
This will do nicely.

611
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,360
This is our territory. You can't...

612
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Now it's mine.

613
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,720
I want a ring of fire
10 blocks wide.

614
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,760
If anyone stands in your way,
burn them!

615
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
The hell...

616
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,800
No, not hell.

617
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,880
Hell is what's coming.

618
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,120
Penguin says fix 'em.

619
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,480
What should I do with you?

620
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Ra's al Ghul is gone.

621
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
You defeated him.

622
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,480
We have spoken and agree,
we will follow you.

623
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Wow. I am honored.

624
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Tabitha?

625
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,600
- What happened?
- Penguin.

626
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,000
He shot me and killed Butch.

627
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,560
Everything that is wrong
with Gotham,

628
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,000
all the greed, the pain,

629
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,920
the corruption, the destruction,

630
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,880
it can all be traced back
to one problem, men!

631
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,480
Well, I think it is time
that we had a men-free zone,

632
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
starting here.

633
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,680
That's better.

634
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
That's much better.

635
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Lucius?

636
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,120
I'd requisitioned
one of Jeremiah's battery bombs

637
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
before it went to the warehouse.

638
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,360
Just restored it
to its original purpose.

639
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,720
It is an ingenious mechanism.

640
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,120
I told him we were staying,

641
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,400
figured we could use some help
with the science stuff.

642
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,160
And there are others on their way.

643
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,680
This is our city.
You're going to need our help.

644
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Speaking of...

645
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,560
...there's something
I need you to do.

646
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,960
- Where's Jeremiah?
- I don't know!

647
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,720
If you see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

648
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Bruce.

649
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,600
You're not supposed to be here.

650
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,520
Neither are you,
or the dozen cops downstairs.

651
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,160
But you stayed to fight for the city.

652
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,880
The gangs are carving up territory.

653
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,400
We're gonna have to go block
by block.

654
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
I have no idea what we're gonna find.

655
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,120
A thing like this brings out
whatever's lurking in the shadows.

656
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
The light.

657
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,360
You're basically daring whatever's
out there to come after you.

658
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Let them come.

659
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,280
There are still good people
out there.

660
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,240
They need to know we're here...

661
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
...willing to fight.

662
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,800
I remember the night we met.

663
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,480
You told me the world
may seem dark...

664
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
But there is light.
