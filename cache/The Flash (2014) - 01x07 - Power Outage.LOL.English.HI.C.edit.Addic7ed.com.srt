But what does that mean?

667
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:54,231
It means you've kicked it up a notch.

668
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:06,008
Dr. Wells.

669
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,012
What I said about how you don't
care about people, I...

670
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,448
No, look, Barry.

671
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:19,417
There is a reason that
my biography describes me

672
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:24,494
as arrogant, prickly, brusque...

673
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:26,328
"at times contemptuous."

674
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,130
- I read it twice.
- You were right.

675
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,765
I don't care much for people, Barry.

676
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:33,735
I find them misinformed, shortsighted.

677
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:34,870
So why do you do what you do?

678
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,206
Why get up in the morning?

679
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,411
Because I believe in a better future,

680
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,378
one that I very much want to see,

681
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,079
one that you are a part of.

682
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,652
I might not much care for people, Barry,

683
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:48,853
but I care about you.

[Knocks]

686
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,334
Hey, Allen.

687
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:04,468
Hey, Eddie.

688
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,436
Flowers.

689
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:10,141
That's so nice. [Giggles]

690
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:12,076
Where were you all night?

691
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,643
Home, trying to eat all
the ice cream before it melted.

692
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:18,045
I love ice cream. [Laughs]

693
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,548
He is on pain meds, lots of them,

694
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,119
but he's gonna be okay.

695
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:24,318
It's been some night.

696
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,687
I am gonna get some coffee.

697
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:26,990
I'll be back.

698
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,163
Dude.

699
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:38,872
Awesome.

700
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,842
I guess you're feeling better.

701
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,581
Oh, yeah.

702
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,850
Did you guys see that?

703
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:50,656
You're just high, partner.

704
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:53,260
Right, I forgot. [Laughs]

705
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,269
Oh, now you show up.

706
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:04,506
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

707
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,978
- It couldn't be helped.
- It's okay.

708
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,982
A girl's got to be her own hero
every now and again.

709
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:14,017
I promise I'll never be late again.

710
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,686
My best friend is always saying that,

711
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,853
and he is always late.

712
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,855
You're worth being on time for.

713
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,107
Honey, you all right?

714
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:35,778
Yeah, why?

715
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,648
You forgot your coffee.

716
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:41,718
Oh, uh...

717
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,030
Good day, Dr. Wells.

718
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,533
Yes, it is, Gideon.

719
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,369
Bring up my log, please, new entry.

720
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:56,475
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

721
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,511
In the past 24 hours,

722
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,849
subject has taken a great leap forward,

723
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:04,886
causing me to revise my initial thesis.

724
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:09,060
I thought... Well, I thought
his attachment to people

725
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:12,596
was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

726
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:15,768
Now I realize the opposite is true.

727
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:21,343
Barry's attachment to people,
the people he cares about,

728
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:25,381
is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

729
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:29,050
In the meantime, good news.

730
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:33,186
The future remains intact.

731
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,789
You're early.

732
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:39,990
Yeah, I know.

733
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,994
It feels weird to me too.

734
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:45,733
I thought after yesterday,
you'd want to sleep in.

735
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,502
Can't. There's too much work to do.

736
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:50,205
I'm ready to do it.

737
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,840
I want to push myself,

738
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:54,943
find out how fast I can really go.

739
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,812
You were right.

740
00:40:56,814 --> 00:41:00,015
This is not just about me.

741
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:01,984
Let's get to work.

742
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,228
Now, you...

743
00:41:45,663 --> 00:41:49,129
Had the ability
to steal The Flash's powers,

744
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,030
and I...

745
00:41:56,937 --> 00:42:01,908
Would love to know...

746
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,475
How you did that.
