﻿1
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,705
Hey!

2
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:14,207
What happened to him?

3
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,877
Where did you get that?
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:31,803
I just want to return.

5
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,168
Think he's a refugee?

6
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,835
Well, you look like you've been
through some real shit to me.

7
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,422
- You could probably use some food.
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,545
- I'm all right.
- Nonsense.

9
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,840
Erna loves stray dogs. Come on.

10
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,130
Agnes, go get Erna.

11
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,463
Now.

12
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,915
Where were you stationed?

13
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,045
Eastern front.

14
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,457
- Labor camp.
- They aren't human over there.

15
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:32,052
That's a war we should've won.

16
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,552
Do you have a place to sleep?

17
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,963
Tell your brother to
get the small room ready.

18
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:50,797
But only for a few days.

19
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,090
Till you're back on your feet.

20
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,840
This is going to sound strange.

21
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,295
But what year is it, please?

22
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:06,422
They really worked you
hard out there, didn't they?

23
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,168
It's 1921.

24
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,210
1921...

25
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,342
June 24, 2020

26
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,842
Three days until the Apocalypse

27
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,463
You and I are perfect for each other.

28
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,048
Never believe anything else.

29
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,421
Yeah.

30
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,257
Mrs. Doppler called in
sick. She's not coming in.

31
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,822
What's wrong with her?

32
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,760
Don't think she said.

33
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,508
Just a minute.

34
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,918
You're Mr. Wöller, right?

35
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,010
Yeah.

36
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,338
Then we're in for a fun time.

37
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,005
- Do you have a car?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,710
Wonderful.

39
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:32,627
Call from Hannah Kahnwald

40
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,258
Where did you get this?

41
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,300
- Who is that?
- It's complicated.

42
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,802
Mom, why do you have that?

43
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,343
Do you want me to make some breakfast?

44
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,338
What do we do with Mom?

45
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,343
I have no idea.

46
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,207
What are you doing here?

47
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,797
- Martha.
- Franziska.

48
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,652
- What do you want!
- We need to talk.

49
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,125
What?

50
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:45,713
If you think I'll say
sorry, you can forget it.

51
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:49,167
You fucked up, but I shouldn't
have said what I said.

52
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:50,708
We're even.

53
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,630
Am I the babysitter while
you make out in here?

54
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,553
Why did you bring her along?

55
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,618
Because our parents haven't
been home for two days.

56
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,843
I can't just leave her there alone.

57
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:07,628
Why is everyone acting so weird?

58
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,325
I want to know what's going on.

59
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,408
You're going to go into the caves?

60
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,090
You don't have to come.

61
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,628
You slept for almost 24 hours.

62
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,705
Who are you?

63
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:02,013
Everyone says that Erna
can't turn away a stray dog.

64
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,212
I'm not right here.

65
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,383
This isn't right here.

66
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,505
Hmm.

67
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,090
At first I pictured you differently.

68
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,090
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,380
Why did you say that?

70
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,547
"Sic mundus creatus est."

71
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,462
Can I help you?

72
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:28,262
Hi. I'm here looking for someone.

73
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:32,005
She used to work here, a while back.

74
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,382
Tiedemann. Claudia Tiedemann.

75
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,147
She used to run the facility.
You know where I can find her?

76
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,111
Here there's only one Tiedemann.

77
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:43,026
Aleksander Tiedemann, the guy in charge.

78
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,837
Aleksander Tiedemann?

79
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,252
So that was why you wouldn't let

80
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,337
Ulrich Nielsen onto the property?

81
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:56,762
After Fukushima, safety
standards were raised.

82
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,130
I can't just let people walk in here.

83
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:04,041
His assumption that his
son could be here somewhere

84
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,781
was completely unfounded.

85
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,878
Do you know about the door in the cave?

86
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,802
Installed in the '80s.

87
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,550
It was already welded shut
back then as a security measure.

88
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,710
- It's still shut to this day.
- You know what I find a bit strange?

89
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,842
Everyone who was born here stays.

90
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,957
That's quite unusual
for a town of this size.

91
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,505
Why is that?

92
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,088
What do you think?

93
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:39,052
The nuclear plant has always provided.

94
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,383
There's work.

95
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:43,463
Prosperity, security.

96
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,298
Although that's likely to change now.

97
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,257
When we close the facility.

98
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:01,125
- You're not from around here.
- No. Why?

99
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,303
In 1986 you came to Winden.

100
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,458
That's the same time
the kid disappeared.

101
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:12,382
Mads Nielsen.

102
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,047
Ulrich Nielsen's brother.

103
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,415
No. I came later.

104
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,005
A few weeks.

105
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,053
How's that relevant?

106
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:34,213
I guess it isn't.

107
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:52,763
One more thing.

108
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,298
What made you take
your wife's last name?

109
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,707
Why do you ask?

110
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,212
Pretty unusual, especially back then.

111
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:08,207
The Tiedemanns shaped
this city, Inspector.

112
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:10,207
Especially Regina's mother.

113
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,010
Regina has no siblings.

114
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:17,263
- We wanted to keep the name alive.
- What is your real name?

115
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,955
Köhler.

116
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:23,553
Aleksander Köhler.

117
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,510
Who's next on the list?

118
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,588
Wöller.

119
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,007
Hannah Kahnwald.

120
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,958
Why do you have a gun and
someone else's passport?

121
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,713
They're for insurance.

122
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,875
Insurance?

123
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:17,375
There's someone very interested
in keeping those things hidden.

124
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,297
So it's blackmail?

125
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,633
Who are you?

126
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,422
Who am I?

127
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,417
Who are you?

128
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,127
Hannah?

129
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:55,132
I'm sorry, but we have to tell someone.

130
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,550
Thanks for getting here so soon.

131
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,210
I know none of this
makes any sense, but...

132
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,802
this is Jonas. He...

133
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:10,195
He's much older, but he knows
where my Jonas is

134
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,231
and where Ulrich is.

135
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:23,619
You're the man Regina

136
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,531
was talking about, from the hotel.

137
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:30,212
Who are these people?

138
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,760
This man here, the priest.

139
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,880
Do you know who he is?

140
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,048
That is Noah.

141
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:47,707
Are you sure?

142
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,795
What do you know about him?

143
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,172
- He's one of them.
- What is this?

144
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,090
One of whom?

145
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,630
Of Sic Mundus.

146
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,757
The travelers.

147
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,213
The travelers?

148
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,958
Sic mundus creatus est?

149
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,298
What are you talking
about? You knew all this?

150
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,837
The time travel.

151
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,013
There's something I
think you both should see.

152
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,755
Okay.

153
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,415
You want to go in there?

154
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,875
After four children disappeared?

155
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:10,705
You stay by me. I'll make
sure we're safe. Okay?

156
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:31,713
Winden Municipal Library

157
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,798
Excuse me.

158
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,630
I'd like to learn about...

159
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,090
the town's history.

160
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,050
Where can I find articles and
documents of the last 30 years or so?

161
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,010
That's all digital now.

162
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,255
And where's that?

163
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,553
Excuse me.

164
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,132
Where is the keyboard?

165
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,627
There isn't one.

166
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:20,668
Search

167
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:34,093
Claudia Tiedemann first woman
to head a nuclear power plant

168
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,625
Nuclear power plant boss
disappears without a trace

169
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,550
Did you inform her
about the appointment?

170
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:57,423
Yes.

171
00:23:58,414 --> 00:23:59,914
Appointments

172
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,319
What do you know about Hannah Kahnwald?

173
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,422
Her husband committed suicide.

174
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,958
Hanged himself.

175
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
No one here understood
why she married him.

176
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,510
She was so pretty. She
could've had any man she wanted.

177
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:24,168
There were rumors that she had
an affair with Ulrich Nielsen.

178
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,207
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about that?

179
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,170
Can I ask you something?

180
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,008
Ask away.

181
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,585
How'd you get this position?

182
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,378
Special task force.

183
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:56,917
Did you volunteer for this?

184
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Oh, yes.

185
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,797
I did.

186
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,800
Is this man a child murderer?

187
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,878
She told me and Tronte
what we have to do.

188
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:44,418
Claudia Tiedemann.

189
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:46,875
She knew exactly at what time

190
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,553
things would happen.

191
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:51,284
It didn't make any sense,

192
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:53,359
yet it was the only way
anything made sense.

193
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,513
You knew about all of this?

194
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,007
Michael, Mikkel, Ulrich?

195
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:05,047
About everything?

196
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:16,257
This here... She gave us this book.

197
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:21,125
It's all in there, about all the
children. Who disappeared when.

198
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,758
Things about time travel.

199
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,420
Symbols and tables we
can't quite understand.

200
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,463
- The last few pages were ripped out.
- Does Katharina know this?

201
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,960
Well, you have to tell her.

202
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,205
Okay.

203
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,207
But let me do it.

204
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:01,337
Regina and Alexander Tiedemann to wed

205
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:07,585
We're getting married Regina Tiedemann
- Alexander Tiedemann

206
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,755
Waldhotel Winden Opens

207
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:20,052
Waldhotel Winden Closes

208
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,130
No trace of Mads Nielsen Chief
Inspector Egon Tiedemann...

209
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:41,418
Former Winden Chief Inspector
found dead in his apartment

210
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,085
on June 26, 1987

211
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:58,957
Excuse me.

212
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,342
Can I print off these things?

213
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,423
Sometimes I dream about him.

214
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,550
Jonas.

215
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:58,957
It all feels so real.

216
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,505
As if he was still alive.

217
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,760
How could it feel that
way if he's really dead?

218
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,337
It's possible he knew something,
before he disappeared.

219
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,128
What are you saying?

220
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,840
What if he saw something
that he shouldn't have seen?

221
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,513
The door has to be in this direction.

222
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,553
Where are we going, Charlotte?

223
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,093
Tell me where we're going.

224
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,415
Damn it, Charlotte!
Where are you taking me?

225
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:11,005
It's easier to understand
if you just see it.

226
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:16,877
What have you found?

227
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,173
You found them.

228
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,463
We found them.

229
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,797
Both.

230
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,800
And they're not dead.
They're still alive.

231
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,335
But they're not here.

232
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,045
They're not here?

233
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,550
But they're alive...
What does that mean?

234
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:54,052
It's better if you see
it with your own eyes.

235
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,837
Why is she here?

236
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,923
What's all this about, Charlotte?

237
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,918
You said you thought Mikkel went
into the cave. You were right.

238
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,415
Mikkel was in the cave and Ulrich
was looking for him in there.

239
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,458
But they found something in the tunnels.

240
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:45,382
A kind of tear... in the fabric of time.

241
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,705
You can't be serious.

242
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,672
What is all this shit?

243
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,705
- Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
- It's true.

244
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:13,507
Stay out of this! Nobody
asked you for your opinion.

245
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,255
Charlotte is right.

246
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,762
Uh-huh. Another one?

247
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,165
And who are you? Her new boy toy?

248
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,420
I'm Jonas.

249
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,382
Her son.

250
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,213
And your grandson.

251
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,625
She says it's shaking.

252
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,962
- What is it?
- We're not alone.

253
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,093
Go. Go, go!

254
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,052
Turn off the lights.

255
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,672
Bartosz?

256
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,665
What are you doing here?

257
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:34,255
What the fuck?

258
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,708
Why are you here?

259
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:44,850
My husband is trapped in the '50s,

260
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,866
and my son in the '80s.

261
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,179
You chose to leave him there
because Mikkel is your father.

262
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,649
That right?

263
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,208
Yes.

264
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,377
I can't take this seriously.

265
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,982
You're buying into all this bullshit?

266
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,838
What's in it for you? Huh?

267
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:16,707
Do you want money? Can you
speak with the dead? Yeah?

268
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,375
Katharina.

269
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:24,957
I was there.

270
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,550
I saw him there.

271
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,208
Mikkel.

272
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,340
You've all lost your minds.

273
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,798
No.

274
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:05,172
Fuck you, Magnus!

275
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,915
I swear to God, if you
have anything to do with this shit...

276
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,455
Fuck you.

277
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:13,707
- Stop it.
- Tell us what the fuck you're doing here.

278
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,958
Come here.

279
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,263
What is this thing?

280
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:41,257
- What is that?
- Don't touch it. It doesn't concern you.

281
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,915
If you have anything
to do with Mikkel or my dad...

282
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,550
I'm going to kill you.

283
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,132
What should we do now?

284
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,668
We're taking it.

285
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,877
And him?

286
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,803
We leave him here.

287
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,457
Maybe that'll change his mind.

288
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,550
Fuck.

289
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,090
You can't do this.

290
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:18,547
Martha! You can't do this!

291
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,593
Hey. Shit. Hey!

292
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,763
Magnus! Stop!

293
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,168
Magnus!

294
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,545
Magnus!

295
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,165
What's your take on all of this?

296
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,665
We have a man-eating cave.

297
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,835
A nuclear plant run by a man
obviously hiding something.

298
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:49,205
An inspector who seems
to be hiding herself.

299
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:53,957
And we have a town full of people
who cheat and betray each other.

300
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:59,883
And they're obviously very invested
in hiding what's happening here.

301
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:03,298
So, Mr. Wöller...

302
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,920
what do you make of all this?

303
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:12,835
Uh... I'm not sure.

304
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,632
Tell me, what happened to your eye?

305
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:31,632
Okay.

306
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,133
But...

307
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,708
you can't tell anyone else.

308
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,507
Uh, so...

309
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,585
- last summer...
- Watch it!

310
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,342
Interesting.

311
00:41:24,922 --> 00:41:26,922
Teacher's lounge please knock

312
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:35,667
Okay.

313
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:41,128
Eighty-six.

314
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:53,173
Six-b.

315
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:55,755
Six-b, 6b, 6b.

316
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,800
Six-b, 6b.

317
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,625
CLASS REGISTER

318
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,300
It's not open yet.

319
00:42:56,588 --> 00:43:00,048
It'll be another 32
years before it opens.

320
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:02,795
So you know about this?

321
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,710
They're waiting for you.

322
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,707
Who's waiting for me?

323
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,377
Sic Mundus.

324
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:25,512
You want to get home, don't you?

325
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:27,258
That's what they say, anyway.

326
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,053
Who are "they"?

327
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,803
The travelers.

328
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,047
What now?

329
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,048
It doesn't matter.

330
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:04,295
Everything is going to
happen the way it always has.

331
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,590
Then why are you here?

332
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,337
- He said there'd be a loophole.
- Who?

333
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:17,957
- Adam.
- Who's Adam?

334
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:21,382
The leader of Sic Mundus.

335
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:25,093
The people in the photo? The travelers?

336
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:26,172
Yeah.

337
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,628
He wants the last cycle
to begin. In three days.

338
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,128
I have to stop it.

339
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,045
That's why I'm here.

340
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:48,875
She tried to do it.

341
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:57,045
But in the end, she became
exactly what she was fighting.

342
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,510
Why did you bring me here?

343
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,802
You're one of them.

344
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:51,755
A traveler.

345
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:53,957
Not yet.

346
00:46:54,797 --> 00:46:57,127
But soon I will be.

347
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,920
It must feel strange
to see me here as well.

348
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:28,297
Especially after our last encounter.

349
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:34,627
But you've already made my acquaintance.

350
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,587
You'll get answers in time.

351
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:56,168
What are you doing here?

352
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:58,958
What's in there?

353
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:03,128
You knew it was in there!

354
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:06,458
You...

355
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:09,417
have lied to us the whole time.

356
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,342
What is that?

357
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,633
What is that?

358
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:22,708
They say it is a part of God.

359
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:30,168
But in reality it's a part of the devil.

360
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:43,923
The prophecy.

361
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:47,213
How did it arise?

362
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:05,463
The book, who wrote it?

363
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,837
Whoever it was who wrote it...

364
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,047
had already seen the past and future.

365
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,712
What will happen to him next?

366
00:53:43,922 --> 00:53:48,012
Adam will send him on his way,
the path that's been determined.

367
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:52,167
So that the last cycle may begin.

368
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:47,797
You must have a lot of questions.

369
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:15,668
Traveling leaves its marks on all of us.

370
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,207
The human body isn't
equipped for it in perpetuity.

371
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:29,963
What is this here?

372
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,592
Shall we begin?

373
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:40,957
I'm not here to begin anything.

374
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,085
I want this to end, finally. All of it!

375
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:47,012
Don't worry, it will come to an end.

376
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:48,838
That can't be avoided.

377
00:55:49,922 --> 00:55:51,262
Your end,

378
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,337
my end.

379
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:58,627
On closer inspection,
it's everyone's end.

380
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:10,918
Who are you?

381
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,210
Can't you see it already?

382
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,958
This isn't real.

383
00:56:46,588 --> 00:56:47,958
I am you.

384
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:55,457
Every stone is back where it belongs,

385
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:58,755
everyone at their destination.

386
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,008
All that's needed now is a push.
