1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:03,284
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- SOFIA: Harvey is weak.

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,064
And how many more cops need to die

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,167
- because of his incompetence?
- GORDON: As of this moment,

4
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:09,222
I'm assuming the captaincy
of Gotham Central.

5
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:11,291
Nothing in Gotham is free.

6
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:13,426
You wanted a gangster
to help you get rid of Penguin.

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,729
This is what that help looks like.

8
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:18,798
PYG: The whole town
has gone hog wild for the Pyg.

9
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,133
(snorts)

10
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:21,735
GORDON: Turns out that Pyg's real name

11
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,670
- is Lazlo Valentine.
- (alarm bell ringing)

12
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:25,405
And he just escaped.

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,307
THOMPKINS: I haven't been looking
for a cure for your brain, Ed,

14
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:28,975
because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth,

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,877
you would go back
to being who you were before.

16
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:32,879
And I like who you've become.

17
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:35,215
BRUCE: I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,249
I took the dark path.

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,717
ALFRED: Yes, you did.

20
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,886
And it's gonna be
a long, bumpy journey back.

21
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,054
What...?

22
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,222
Hello, Victor.

23
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:43,323
Where's the boy?

24
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,991
SOFIA: Alive, for now.

25
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,292
If Oswald wants to keep it that way,

26
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:48,161
he will meet me
under the Crown Point Bridge.

27
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,299
OSWALD: You wanted a war,

28
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,668
you've got one!

29
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,641
We will wait for Mr. Cobblepot

30
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:02,277
to send instructions.

31
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,392
Hello.

32
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:24,376
Where is Penguin, little man?

33
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,303
(guns cocking)

34
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,338
♪ ♪

35
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,128
(radio beeps)

36
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:55,563
This is Gordon.

37
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:57,472
I need forensics in West End Alley.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,067
Black market doc.

39
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,802
Pyg was here.

40
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,804
Looks like he got a new face.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,039
(coughing)

42
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:29,263
So, Penguin's out building
support amongst the gangs.

43
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:32,733
Pretty soon, every criminal in
Gotham is gonna be hunting us.

44
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,669
He's out building support
because we made him look weak.

45
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,906
We kill him, and all the gangs
will support me.

46
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,108
I'm still a Falcone.

47
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:44,145
Yeah, you mentioned that.
About a billion times.

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,579
(door opens)

49
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,985
(Tabitha sighs)

50
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,120
He doesn't know where Penguin is.

51
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,856
(phone vibrating)

52
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,036
(sighs) What?

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,533
I'll be right there.

54
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,890
Was that about Penguin?

55
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,870
No.

56
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,100
Harper.

57
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,380
We were an hour outside of Gotham

58
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,812
when I got waylaid by Victor Zsasz.

59
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:21,547
He took Sofia, gave me this.

60
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,082
I woke up in Virginia.

61
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,917
Damn it. I had a deal with Penguin.

62
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:26,552
MAN: There's more. We're getting word

63
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,554
Penguin had some meeting
under the Crown Point Bridge

64
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,689
late last night.

65
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:31,190
Gunfire, a car blown up.

66
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,826
- Sofia Falcone was there.
- All right.

67
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,528
We have to find Penguin. Harper?

68
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,629
- I'm good, Cap.
- Put out a citywide BOLO.

69
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,918
- I'll find Sofia. 
- What about the Pyg?

70
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,565
I heard he escaped from Arkham.

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,514
Tracked him to a black market surgeon.

72
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:46,582
He's already got a new face.
Lazlo Valentine is gone.

73
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,060
- But if we don't find him, what...
- Focus on the bigger problem.

74
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,763
We've got a war to stop, people.

75
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,074
So, you gonna tell us why
we're in your dad's house?

76
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,110
Why do you think?

77
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,467
Sofia.

78
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,936
You look tired.

79
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,131
Ms. Kean, it's good to see you again.

80
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,566
Likewise.

81
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,135
So, this is weird.

82
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,272
Why are you here, Father?

83
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,342
What did I tell you when you
asked to return to Gotham?

84
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:40,020
- I know...
- What did I tell you?!

85
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,115
- That I wasn't ready.
- Exactly.

86
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,655
And you came back anyway.

87
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:49,287
Perhaps I should've acted then,

88
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,056
but I was indulgent, curious.

89
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:55,288
Who is this daughter I raised?

90
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,847
Father, Penguin is weak.

91
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,632
If you help me, we can end this.

92
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,307
- I don't want Gotham.
- I don't believe that.

93
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,136
You love this city.

94
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,884
I used to, yes.

95
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,243
But I'm dying, Sofia.

96
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:12,884
Someone else can have Gotham.

97
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,213
What I care about now is my family.

98
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,381
And I am your family.

99
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,149
And I want this. I deserve this.

100
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,018
Gotham belongs to me.

101
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,192
Your actions have disgraced our family.

102
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,760
Tell me how sleeping with Jim Gordon,

103
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,361
the man who killed your brother,

104
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:32,762
helped reclaim Gotham.

105
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,528
I'm sorry. What?

106
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,335
I have done many things
I will have to answer for,

107
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,096
but I always knew the meaning of honor.

108
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,741
You have proven that you do not.

109
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,123
Children.

110
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,784
They can be such disappointments.

111
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,058
I kill him, and this is over!
Please.

112
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:03,113
FALCONE: You know why
I came when Penguin called?

113
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,563
It's because you were going to lose.

114
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,600
If you were anyone but my daughter,

115
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,737
you'd be dead right now.

116
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,717
(helicopter blades whirring)

117
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,352
Come on. Here we go.

118
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,920
Oh. Morning.

119
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:31,855
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- In there.

120
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,792
Dear, oh, dear.

121
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,949
Oh. Good morning, Officer.

122
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,019
My name is Alfred Pennyworth.

123
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,267
Neighbors called in a noise complaint.

124
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,801
He's all yours.

125
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,904
Thank you.

126
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,879
Right.

127
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,547
(scoffs)

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,619
(gasps)

129
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,921
Good morning, Master Bruce.

130
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,155
God!

131
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,591
I do believe the party's
well and truly over.

132
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,993
Morning, miss.

133
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,036
Good morning, miss.

134
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,003
GCPD.

135
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,972
- I'm looking...
- For my daughter.

136
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,409
You can stop.

137
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,610
She's with me.

138
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,445
Carmine.

139
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,048
I didn't expect to see you.

140
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,684
I imagine not. I arrived this morning.

141
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,319
You heard Sofia's in danger.

142
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,687
Was in danger.

143
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,322
I made a deal with Cobblepot.

144
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,858
I take her out of Gotham today,
and she lives.

145
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,394
I made the same deal. He didn't keep it.

146
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,596
He will with me.

147
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,236
I'm glad I never killed you.

148
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,507
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.

149
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,676
Killing you would have been a kindness.

150
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:02,109
You've no idea what you've
brought to your city.

151
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,828
I imagine when you find out the truth,

152
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,614
it will destroy you.

153
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,709
That's a comfort.

154
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,061
SOFIA: Another day,

155
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,268
another man sending me out of Gotham.

156
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,210
We're both just trying
to keep you alive.

157
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,402
Tell yourselves that.

158
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,106
But what I know is that
neither of you believed in me.

159
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,443
It could've been so different.

160
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,420
Good-bye, James Gordon.

161
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,132
I doubt we'll see each other again.

162
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,904
The sun never shines here.

163
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,413
Everything I did, I did for your love.

164
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,250
But that doesn't matter, does it?

165
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,786
What matters is that
after everything you've done,

166
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,328
I still consider you my daughter.

167
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,159

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,438
As long as he's using proxies,
he's protected.

335
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,285
I have to keep pressing him.

336
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,644
When his back's against the wall,

337
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,180
he'll do something
he can't take back or explain.

338
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,681
And then I'll have him.

339
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:40,216
So you're baiting him into committing

340
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,252
a public atrocity.

341
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,237
What if he already has?

342
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:52,061
There's this boy
from my orphanage, Martin.

343
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,863
Oswald cared for him.

344
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:57,267
I hid him away for his safety,

345
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:00,103
but Oswald forced me

346
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:02,235
into telling him where Martin was,

347
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,602
and then put him in a car
and blew it up.

348
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,745
Why didn't you tell me this before?

349
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,881
Because I'm his enemy.
Who's going to believe me?

350
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,184
Also, I didn't see him plant the bomb.

351
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,586
- So you have nothing.
- I didn't say that.

352
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:20,890
Oswald never understood the way
people cared for my father.

353
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,694
And one of those people just called me.

354
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,398
How is Jim Gordon beating us?!

355
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:31,067
ZSASZ: Well, every cop
in Gotham is behind him.

356
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,946
I'm guessing he has
great leadership skills.

357
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,578
Victor, when this is said and done,

358
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,444
you and I need to have
a frank discussion

359
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,672
about chain of command.

360
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,738
But now...

361
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,582
go do something horrific!

362
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:49,586
Show the GCPD exactly...

363
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:51,221
GORDON: Oswald Cobblepot!

364
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,623
You're under arrest.

365
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,126
Have you completely lost your mind?

366
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:59,827
Nobody has to die.
We only want Cobblepot.

367
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,296
OSWALD: Well, see, Jim,
that's a problem,

368
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,241
as they work for me. (chuckles)

369
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,769
But just so I know, what's the charge?

370
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,972
Murder.

371
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,162
Enough.

372
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,911
Enough! I did not kill Don Falcone,

373
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,980
and I dare you to prove otherwise.

374
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:18,748
It's not for Falcone.

375
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,750
I'm arresting you
for the murder of the boy

376
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,319
you blew up
under the Crown Point Bridge.

377
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,656
(snickering)

378
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,691
What's so funny?

379
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,462
Nothing. (chuckles)

380
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:35,714
Well, everything actually,
'cause, 'cause, you see,

381
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,501
he's not dead. (laughs)

382
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,005
I only faked his death

383
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:45,306
so that Sofia Falcone
couldn't use him against me.

384
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:48,044
She's the one who told you
I killed him, isn't she?

385
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,846
Then where is he?

386
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:53,049
He, uh... I don't know.

387
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,522
Victor took him out of Gotham. Tell him.

388
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,778
ZSASZ: What's to tell?

389
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,991
You blew that kid sky-high.

390
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,261
OSWALD: What?

391
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:09,065
You sent that pipsqueak to kingdom come.

392
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,566
No.

393
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:11,868
That's not true.

394
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,810
And I'll testify to that.

395
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:16,039
- What?
- Look...

396
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:19,568
I ain't taking the rap
for no kid murder.

397
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:21,411
(yells)

398
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:22,445
- Hey!
- Get him out of here!

399
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,014
You are lying! You are a lying traitor!

400
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,046
Victor Zsasz is a liar!

401
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:30,353
No! I will kill you!

402
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:31,354
Traitor!

403
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,556
(Oswald grunting)

404
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:37,448
This... doesn't give you
a free pass, you know.

405
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,409
Jim...

406
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:42,732
not now.

407
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,688
You did it, Cap.

408
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,609
You won.

409
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,259
Yeah, Captain!

410
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:11,661
Way to go, Captain!

411
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,040
So I'm guessing Gordon doesn't
know the kid's actually alive.

412
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,257
SOFIA: Jim Gordon played his part.

413
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:28,578
He showed the underworld
that Penguin was weak.

414
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,014
That he did.

415
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,447
End of the day,

416
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:34,889
he's a Cobblepot.

417
00:24:36,217 --> 00:24:38,254
You're a Falcone.

418
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,996
SOFIA: Smile, ladies.

419
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,239
It's a new day.

420
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:56,176
So, Sofia was as good as her word.

421
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:58,255
We got our club back.

422
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:01,232
Yippee. We get to serve drinks again.

423
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,757
It's just a base of operations.

424
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:05,913
But I am meeting with the designer later

425
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:08,257
to make it less... Penguiny.

426
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,339
Have fun.

427
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:14,450
Music to soothe the savage beast?

428
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,744
Something like that.

429
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:29,957
Alfred!

430
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:33,794
Oh, the front page is up.

431
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,030
Didn't expect you
to brave the light of day

432
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,352
for a couple more hours, Master B.

433
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:41,008
Tommy wanted to go to the horse races.

434
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,471
What's all this?

435
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:45,593
ALFRED: It's little project of mine.

436
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:48,042
I like to call it
Operation Save Bruce Wayne.

437
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:49,343
(chuckles)

438
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:50,887
Switzerland.

439
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:53,514
Few months up in the Alps,
you'll be tickety-boo.

440
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:54,982
(chuckles)

441
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:57,084
Are you going to kidnap me?

442
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,330
No, I'm gonna appeal
to your better angels.

443
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,858
And if that doesn't work, I shall beg.

444
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,761
Please, Master Bruce.

445
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:11,502
If for no other reason, do it for me.

446
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,073
These past weeks, you know how much

447
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:20,834
I've thought about Ra's al Ghul?

448
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:23,377
About my parents?

449
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,179
Not at all, Alfred.

450
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,148
All you're offering me is pain.

451
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,550
Well, there is no life without pain.

452
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,485
There's no love, there's no joy.

453
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:33,754
I don't know about that.
I'm having a fair amount of joy.

454
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,250
You're bloody miserable is what
you are, mate. I can see it.

455
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:40,348
Alfred, I know you care about me.

456
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,495
But I'm asking you
to stop what you're doing.

457
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,645
I'm not who you thought I was.

458
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,227
I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be,

459
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,867
and I'm okay with that!

460
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,437
But I'm not okay with it.

461
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:54,131
- And I don't believe it.
- And that's your problem.

462
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:57,074
Now I'm gonna go meet Tommy.

463
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,778
I can't let you do that, Master Bruce.

464
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,019
You gonna stop me?

465
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:12,237
If needs be, yes.

466
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:14,324
(chuckles softly)

467
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,898
You really think you can?

468
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,664
Oh, I know I can.

469
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,501
I just don't want you to make me try.

470
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,438
Well...

471
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:33,544
Don't do this, Master Bruce.

472
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,679
No, Alfred, we're doing this.

473
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:38,348
(Alfred shouts)

474
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,267
You're getting slow, Master Bruce.

475
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,090
You haven't been training,
have you, son?

476
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:49,493
- Got a bit of ring rust.
- Really?

477
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:52,433
Because you're the only one
breathing hard, old man.

478
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,233
(grunting)

479
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:58,742
Just stop it, will you?!

480
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:01,038
Stop it! Stop...

481
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,706
- Fine.
- All right?

482
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,308
Fine.

483
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,079
Oh, no.

484
00:28:09,381 --> 00:28:10,914
Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.

485
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:12,883
I-I don't know what came
over me, mate. I'm...

486
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,085
I...

487
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:17,187
(door slams)

488
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:20,123
I am in control!

489
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:23,093
- (laughs)
- I am in control!

490
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:24,561
Me. Ed Nygma.

491
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:26,296
(echoing): But why would you want that?

492
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,731
You don't understand.

493
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,933
We had so much fun when we were me.

494
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,619
Oh, no.

495
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,738
Tell me it's not that.

496
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,807
Not what?

497
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:38,275
I leave when spurned.

498
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,477
I give all. I take nothing.

499
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,946
I can raise you to a king
or make you to a beggar.

500
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:44,948
What am I?

501
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:48,619
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you,
'cause you're not gonna get it.

502
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:51,154
- Love.
- I am in control!

503
00:28:51,257 --> 00:28:53,457
You're in love with Lee
Thompkins, you pathetic loser.

504
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,625
Shut up!

505
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,596
Ed...

506
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:01,837
angry at mirror?

507
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:04,334
No, Grundy, I'm not angry at the mirror.

508
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:05,335
Ed...

509
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:08,171
angry at... Ed?

510
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:10,490
That is...

511
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,010
surprisingly perceptive.

512
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:15,685
(sighs) I need some air.

513
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:17,314

Where is Grundy?

531
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:25,954
I kidnapped you.

532
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,548
For the record, you're not light.

533
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:32,973
What pretty lady want?

534
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:40,037
When we were fighting,
you called me Tabby, remember?

535
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,993
Grundy want to go back to friend Ed.

536
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,584
Ed.

537
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,420
Right.

538
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:48,138
Your friend.

539
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:51,191
Well, your best friend Ed

540
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,093
tied you and me to chairs,
electrocuted you,

541
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,661
and cut off my hand.

542
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,254
Look at the scar.

543
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,132
Ring a bell?

544
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:14,422
Remember me, Butch.

545
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:18,859
I'm Tabby.

546
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,054
I'm your Tabby.

547
00:31:28,697 --> 00:31:30,697
Grundy sorry.

548
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:40,040
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

549
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,346
Before, when you said my name,

550
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:50,321
I'd just hit you in the head.

551
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:54,057
Maybe that's the only way.

552
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:59,959
So you're gonna remember me, Butch.

553
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,915
Or I'm gonna beat your head in.

554
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,708
Pretty lady.

555
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:18,398
When I called, I wasn't sure you'd come.

556
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:21,214
I was going to anyway. We need to talk.

557
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:26,177
I agree.

558
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:29,389
I'm gonna ask you not to do
what you're about to do.

559
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:30,623
Which is?

560
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,568
Unify the gangs.

561
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,928
Put the Falcones back in charge
of the underworld.

562
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:37,897
Mm. But wasn't that our deal?

563
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,652
I'd replace Penguin.

564
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,191
You'd be the law, I'd be the order.

565
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:43,970
No. And if you try and take over,

566
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,285
I will have to come after you.

567
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,721
James.

568
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:55,014
You're nothing if not predictable.

569
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:58,133
Now I think it's time
you heard my proposal.

570
00:32:58,203 --> 00:32:59,486
I'm not interested.

571
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,521
- I think you are.
- PYG: Surprise.

572
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:03,256
(gun cocks)

573
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:07,619
I know.

574
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:09,796
You thought I'd have a different face

575
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,893
'cause I killed that doctor.

576
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,564
That was just
to throw you off the scent.

577
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:17,767
SOFIA: That's not why
he's surprised, Lazlo.

578
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:19,642
Oh.

579
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,626
Can I tell him?

580
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,645
You came to this beautiful woman

581
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,247
'cause you had a problem.

582
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:28,915
A Penguin problem.

583
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:31,622
Pax Penguina was gonna last.

584
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:35,176
But Sofia had an idea.

585
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,902
I'd heard of a contract killer

586
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,525
that was impersonating
serial killers, so...

587
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,488
What if there was a killer,

588
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:41,961
real vicious

589
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:46,844
son of a bitch, hunting
the police, all slice and dice?

590
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,501
I needed the police to turn on Penguin.

591
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,883
I knew a few cops would have to die.

592
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:53,313
So you sent this monster in my city.

593
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,066
I let him improvise.

594
00:33:57,378 --> 00:34:00,261
I'll admit, got a little
carried away with the whole

595
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:02,882
cooking folks routine.

596
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,958
I really got into the role.

597
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,256
Now, the only hiccup

598
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:12,192
was that mess with her daddy.

599
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,206
It was you.

600
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:23,761
I gave him a chance, Jim.

601
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,222
And if he would have shown

602
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:28,525
one iota of appreciation for

603
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:32,312
everything I have done
for this family, for him,

604
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,380
he would be alive.

605
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,501
But I saw you shot.

606
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,788
There was another shooter there.

607
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:48,328
SOFIA: I had to do something
to throw off suspicion.

608
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:50,029
PYG: She wasn't about
to get herself plugged

609
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:52,185
by a bunch of yahoos in a car.

610
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,335
It was some pretty shooting,
if I do say so.

611
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,661
I missed all her vital parts.

612
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:04,210
I'm putting you in jail, and this time,

613
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:05,378
it's Blackgate!

614
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:07,714
- You're gonna rot in there.
- Jim, it's just...

615
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:09,415
(gunshot)

616
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,953
(sighs) That's done now.

617
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,497
My father had his moment of truth.

618
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,197
This is yours.

619
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,141
How many cops died
under the Pax Penguina?

620
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,801
Not one.

621
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,538
It was you who couldn't stomach it.

622
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:34,574
It was you who came
to the Falcones for help.

623
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:37,955
There is a direct line
from your decision

624
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:41,338
to a dozen police officers
who have been brutally murdered.

625
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:42,882
You're insane.

626
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:46,029
Why not just kill me?

627
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:47,669
Because, Jim,

628
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:51,357
I need you at the head
of the GCPD. I need...

629
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:54,021
Someone you can control.

630
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:58,431
You've been planning this
since the day we first met.

631
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,333
This isn't about Gotham.

632
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:04,337
This is revenge... for me killing Mario.

633
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:12,312
(puts gun down)

634
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:15,515
You want to arrest me, arrest me.

635
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,986
But I will talk.

636
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:22,560
And the cops that died,

637
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:26,526
the friend that you betrayed,
will all have been for nothing.

638
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:30,957
The GCPD will crumble.

639
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:33,633
Penguin, or someone worse,
will take over,

640
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:37,236
and you will lose Gotham forever.

641
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:40,607
Or...

642
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:44,175
take on the sin as your own.

643
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:48,414
Keep the GCPD, let them
think you're a hero,

644
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,884
but live knowing who you are,
what you've done.

645
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,989
That is my revenge.

646
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,663
(phone beeps, speed dials)

647
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:06,532
(line ringing)

648
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,537
OFFICER: <i>GCPD.</i>

649
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:12,672
<i>GCPD. How can I help you?</i>

650
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:16,655
<i>Hello? Anyone there? Anybody?</i>

651
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:18,289
This is Gordon.

652
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,237
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.

653
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:25,315
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

654
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:26,953
(phone beeps)

655
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:38,693
Oh, thank Christ.

656
00:37:39,432 --> 00:37:40,596
You're safe.

657
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:42,712
Master Bruce, listen.

658
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:44,979
I don't want to fight anymore.

659
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,428
You win.

660
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,743
If this is how you want to deal

661
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,284
with what you've been
going through, then so be it;

662
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,386
I'm not gonna try and stop you.

663
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,378
But just know this.

664
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,969
You will remember who you are,

665
00:38:01,003 --> 00:38:03,533
and when you do, I will be right here.

666
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:06,569
No. You won't be.

667
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:10,140
I went to my lawyer and had him
draw up emancipation papers.

668
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,479
You're no longer my legal guardian.

669
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,077
I won't sign 'em.

670
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,568
You don't have to.

671
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:29,198
Now I'm going out.

672
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,517
If you're still here when I get back,

673
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,691
I'll go to the police
and show them my face.

674
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:38,559
- Master Bruce, please.
- Alfred, you're fired.

675
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,229
