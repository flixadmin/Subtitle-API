1
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,630
(Splashes)

2
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,944
- (Clears throat)
- (People murmuring)

3
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,946
(Chuckles softly)

4
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,703
(Exhales)

5
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,041
(Scoffs)

6
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,997
Edmure: Ifl may, nephew,

7
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,666
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

8
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,918
at the stone mill which
may have some bearing...

9
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,380
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

10
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,133
And don't call him
"nephew." He is your king.

11
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,634
Robb knows I meant him no...

12
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,263
You're lucky I'm not your king.

13
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,850
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.

14
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,644
My blunder sent tywin's mad dog

15
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,564
back to casterly rock
with his tail between his legs.

16
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,941
I think king robb understands
we won't win this war

17
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,665
if he's the only one winning any battles.

18
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,087
No, there's glory enough to go around.

19
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,946
It's not about glory.

20
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,451
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

21
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,786
I seized an opportunity.

22
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,204
What value was the mill?

23
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,099
The mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

24
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,541
Robb: Is he there now?

25
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,045
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

26
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,340
I wanted to draw the
mountain into the west,

27
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,427
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

28
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,721
I wanted him to chase us,

29
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,058
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

30
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,227
without a strategic thought in his head.

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,355
I could have that head on a spike by now.

32
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,235
Instead, I have a mill.

33
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,326
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

34
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,870
Willem and martyn
Lannister are 14 years old.

35
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,373
Martyn is 15, I believe.

36
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,212
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

37
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,799
Have I sued for peace?

38
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,847
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

39
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,766
brother's great-grandsons?

40
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,941
How many men did you lose?

41
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,154
208. But for every man
we lost, the lannisters...

42
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,032
We need our men more than tywin needs his!

43
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,332
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,417
I didn't know.

45
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
You would have.

46
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,005
Right here today
at this gathering, if you had been patient.

47
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,174
We seem to be running
short of Patience here.

48
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,635
You know who isn't?

49
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,180
Tywin Lannister.

50
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,392
(Footsteps approaching)

51
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,144
(Chains rattling)

52
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,015
(Chair squeaks)

53
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,480
(Chair dragging loudly)

54
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,001
(Sighs)

55
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,420
Intimate. Lovely table.

56
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,339
Better chairs than
the old small council chamber.

57
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,217
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

58
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,387
What news of Jaime?

59
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,770
20,000 unwashed northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

60
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,023
You control more spies and informants

61
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,233
than the rest of the world combined.

62
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,279
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

63
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,697
We are trying, my lord.

64
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,157
Try harder.

65
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,369
What do we have, then?

66
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,497
Robb stark and
most of his bannermen are in riverrun

67
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,334
for the funeral
of his grandfather lord hoster Tully.

68
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,381
In stark's absence,
roose Bolton holds harrenhal,

69
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,926
which would seem
to make him lord of harrenhal,

70
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,011
in practice, not in name.

71
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,179
Tywin: Let him have it.

72
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:18,975
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

73
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,518
The lord of harrenhal will make

74
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
a worthy suitor for the widow arryn.

75
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,273
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

76
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,793
Lady arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

77
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:32,822
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

78
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,450
A successful courtship would make

79
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
lord baelish acting lord of the vale.

80
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,955
Titles do seem to breed titles.

81
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,916
You'll leave for the
eyrie as soon as possible

82
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,918
and bring lysa arryn into the fold.

83
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,087
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt

84
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,881
to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

85
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,926
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

86
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,222
but lord baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

87
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,682
The royal wedding may end up being

88
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,268
the most expensive event in living memory.

89
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,230
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

90
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,067
Not a good time
to leave the crown's finances unattended.

91
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,194
Tywin: Fully agreed.

92
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,405
Which is why I'm naming you
new master of coin.

93
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,491
- (Scoffs)
- Master of coin?

94
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,160
It would appear to best suits your talents.

95
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,954
I'm quite good at spending money,

96
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

97
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,874
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

98
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,461
I have no doubt
you will prove equal to this challenge.

99
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,338
Hear, hear.

100
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,466
Man: He lifted her high in the air

101
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,760
he sniffed and roared and smelled her there

102
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,012
she kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

103
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,557
but he licked the honey from her hair

104
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,643
all: From there to here, from here to there

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,854
all black and brown and covered with hair

106
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,022
he smelled that girl on the summer air

107
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,608
the bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

108
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:56,156
I hope you're pleased. If I were
armed, they'd never have taken us.

109
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,241
Brienne: You were armed
when we were taken.

110
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
I was in chains, if you recall.

111
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,080
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

112
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,375
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

113
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,169
"what a brilliant swordsman."

114
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,174
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

115
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,925
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

116
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,677
wrapped in chains, for the past year.

117
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,679
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

118
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,015
You were not beating me.

119
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,267
Maybe you were as good as people said...

120
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,269
Once.

121
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,439
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

122
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,697
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

123
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,658
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

124
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,205
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

125
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,623
They'll knock your teeth out.

126
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,124
You think I care?

127
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,543
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

128
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:58,218
If you fight them,
they will kill you. Do you understand?

129
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,887
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

130
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,389
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

131
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,515
What does it matter?

132
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,600
Close your eyes.

133
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,268
Pretend they're renly.

134
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,522
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

135
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,900
You'd let them do what they wanted?

136
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:19,239
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the gods.

137
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,995
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

138
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,416
Doesn't have to look pretty. It just
has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

139
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,418
Why are you helping him?

140
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,587
He takes us prisoner, now he's our friend?

141
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,256
Thoros: You're not our prisoner.

142
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,465
What am I?

143
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,591
Our guest.

144
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,635
No one's put any chains on you.

145
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,178
So I can walk away, then?

146
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,056
These woods aren't safe
for ned stark's daughter.

147
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,392
You're lucky we found you.

148
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,732
Hound: You think
you're good with that bow, you little twat?

149
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,296
Anguy: Better than anyone you've met.

150
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,613
Hound: A coward's weapon.
I like to fight up close.

151
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,117
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

152
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,744
Why? So you can kiss him?

153
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,663
You remember the last time you were here?

154
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,292
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

155
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,836
Anguy: Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

156
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,088
and I'd rather not see you no more.

157
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,883
(Groans)

158
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,636
Watch your head.

159
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,054
- (Banging)
- Off we go.

160
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,431
Man: Walk up!

161
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,724
(Horse neighing)

162
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,480
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

163
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,898
I'm staying.

164
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,485
You're what?

165
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:44,073
I baked brown bread for the
innkeep, she said she never had better.

166
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,119
Told thoros she's keeping me
as payment for all his free meals.

167
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,707
Anyway, it's not me the brotherhood
wants. My brother ain't no king.

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,459
I'm not a stark of winterhell.

169
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,793
Winterfell.

170
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,172
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

171
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,552
Well, I made you something.

172
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,141
What is it?

173
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,560
It's a wolf.

174
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,941
Yes, it is.

175
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,778
Arya: That's the tail?

176
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,237
Yeah.

177
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,617
Well, be safe.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,287
Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.

179
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:36,000
You don't burn your fingers.

180
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,470
Good-bye, hot pie.

181
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,473
Good-bye, arry.

182
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,778
Up you go, little lady.

183
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,994
Arya: Hey, hot pie.

184
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,666
It's really good.

185
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:27,677
Catelyn: A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.

186
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,642
It often comforts me
to think that even in war's darkest days,

187
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:40,064
in most places in
the world absolutely nothing is happening.

188
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,111
I've missed you, uncle.

189
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,948
Father missed you,
too, from the day you left.

190
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,242
Maybe he never said it in so many words...

191
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,910
Maybe?

192
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,288
Your father was a stubborn old ox.

193
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,709
I was surprised when he died.
Didn't think death had the Patience.

194
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:06,382
I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the gods I had been.

195
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,054
Did you make peace in the end?

196
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:17,393
After 30 years of fighting, I don't
think he remembered what started it.

197
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,105
He asked me to stop
calling myself blackfish.

198
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,651
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

199
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,323
I told him people
had been calling me blackfish for so long,

200
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,575
they don't remember my real name.

201
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,583
Every time he would leave for
the capital or fight in a campaign,

202
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,836
I'd see him off.

203
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,006
"Wait for me, little cat," he'd say.

204
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,803
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

205
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:59,060
And I would sit at this window every day
when the sun came up, waiting.

206
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,940
I wonder,

207
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,693
how many times did bran or rickon

208
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,029
stare across the moors of winterfell,

209
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,448
waiting for me to return?

210
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,785
I will never see them again. (Sobbing)

211
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,122
You mustn't think it.

212
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:25,336
We don't know the truth.
They could be in hiding.

213
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,841
Robb believes they're alive.

214
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,886
And he must go on believing.

215
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,889
He's got to remain
strong if he's to prevail.

216
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:40,768
And you must remain strong for him.

217
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
(Sighs)

218
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,698
You're robb stark's wife.

219
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,992
Hold still.

220
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,537
Is it true what they say about him?

221
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,999
I don't know. What do they say about him?

222
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,334
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

223
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,087
True.

224
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,423
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

225
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,341
True.

226
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,305
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

227
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,598
Martyn Lannister.

228
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,932
Martyn Lannister.

229
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,187
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

230
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,275
Unless it's a full moon.

231
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,194
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

232
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,198
See? Nothing to fear.

233
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,035
(Wind howling)

234
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,719
Always the artists.

235
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,573
It's only horses.

236
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,034
No men.

237
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,788
You said there was dead crows.

238
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,123
There was.

239
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,002
How many men were here?

240
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,171
About 300.

241
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,590
And you know what those men are now?

242
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,681
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

243
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,643
Do you think anyone got away?

244
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,522
Mance: It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against mormont.

245
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,151
But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.

246
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,195
And he lost.

247
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,698
His best fighting men are dead.

248
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,867
And whether
he's lord commander of the night's watch

249
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,869
or a blue-eyed corpse,

250
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,622
he's a long way from home.

251
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,501
Tormund. Climb the wall.

252
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,715
Take orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.

253
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,801
He knows castle
black's defenses better than any of us.

254
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,597
And if he's useful,
good. If not, throw him off the wall.

255
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,434
See if crows can fly.

256
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,854
We're finally going to war, old friend?

257
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,899
Hide near castle black. When I
give the signal, hit them in the night.

258
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,404
They've got a big old wall to hide
behind, but it only guards one side.

259
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,822
(Chuckles)

260
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,282
We'll meet again.

261
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,743
- Aye. If you do your job.
- Ah.

262
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,911
How will we see your signal?

263
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,748
Mance: Send your eagle
above the wall every night.

264
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,459
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

265
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,711
the north has ever seen.

266
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,796
(Men coughing)

267
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,811
(Baby crying)

268
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,363
Ghost?

269
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,548
What have we here? Frozen crows?

270
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,550
We've come a long way.

271
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,347
Craster: Smaller flock
than you went north with.

272
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,557
We can talk inside.

273
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,602
Oh, can we?

274
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,912
(Inhales)

275
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,540
(Woman 1 screaming)

276
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,585
Woman 2: They need some water.
Tether it, and I'll be inside.

277
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,263
(Woman 1 groaning)

278
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,353
Craster: Keep your eyes where they belong.

279
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,856
They're not for you.

280
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,525
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

281
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,778
Aye, pig's got value to me.

282
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,615
You should all
be kissing my feet for letting you in.

283
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,953
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

284
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,330
You are a godly man?

285
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,834
I am. I got no fear of what's out there.

286
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,044
When the white cold comes,

287
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,965
your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.

288
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,219
The only ones left
will be those who are right with the gods.

289
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,929
The real gods.

290
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,015
(Woman 1 continues groaning)

291
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag

292
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,690
or she can bite down on my fist.

293
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,486
Women. (Chuckles)

294
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:30,534
That sow right
there gave birth to a litter of eight.

295
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,661
Barely a grunt.

296
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,082
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

297
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,585
Now why don't you dine on him?

298
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,338
Carve off what you need as you go.

299
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,466
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

300
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,678
(Craster imitates pig squealing)

301
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,806
(Craster laughing)

302
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,521
(Coughing)

303
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,983
(Sighs)

304
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,446
Woman 2: Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya?

305
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,367
(Woman 1 screaming)

306
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,927
I see the head. Push. That's it.

307
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,221
You're nearly there.

308
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,098
(Whimpering)

309
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,141
(Panting)

310
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,644
One more push should do it.

311
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,729
(Screaming in pain)

312
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,067
(Baby crying)

313
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,443
(Gasps)

314
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,906
What is it? What is it?

315
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,910
(Crying loudly)

316
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,919
(Water dripping)

317
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,714
- (Door opening)
- (Gasps)

318
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,929
(Door closing)

319
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,435
(Breathing heavily)

320
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,940
(Whispers) Keep quiet.

321
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,700
(Grunts)

322
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,051
(Grunting)

323
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,889
If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.

324
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,891
I can ride.

325
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,226
You're sure?

326
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,148
(Groans)

327
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,782
(Grunts)

328
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:19,578
Ride east. Follow the rising
sun. Your sister's waiting for you.

329
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,206
I'll make you
a lord of the iron islands for this.

330
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,499
We're not in the iron islands.

331
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,085
Come on.

332
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,546
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

333
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,427
Man: Come on back.

334
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,350
Stannis: You refuse to
tell me where you're going?

335
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,520
Melisandre: I don't know yet.
The fires will show me.

336
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,955
Stannis: How long will you be gone?

337
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,299
Melisandre: (Sighs) I don't know.

338
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,442
You're abandoning me.

339
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,152
I will never abandon you.

340
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,156
You are the son of fire.

341
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,491
I am sworn to serve you.

342
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,826
Then serve me.

343
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,869
When I return, you will understand.

344
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,541
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

345
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,380
They're laughing at me,
the way renly laughed at me.

346
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,262
I want Joffrey dead. I
want robb stark dead.

347
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,934
Make me another son.

348
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,602
Icannot

349
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,895
(sniffs) Why?

350
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,982
You don't have the
strength. It would kill you.

351
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,734
I'm not easily killed.
Men have tried for years.

352
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,908
I want you.

353
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,466
Your fires burn low, my king.

354
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,389
There is another way. A better way.

355
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,101
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

356
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,811
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

357
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,354
You are.

358
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,607
There are others
with your blood in their veins.

359
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,528
You will sit on the iron throne,

360
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,906
but first there must be sacrifices.

361
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,700
The lord of light demands it.

362
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,672
The walk of punishment
is a warning, your grace.

363
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,257
To whom?

364
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,943
Jorah: To any slave who contemplates doing

365
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,553
whatever these slaves did.

366
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,931
Give me your water.

367
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,768
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

368
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,650
Here, drink.

369
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,402
(Indistinct)

370
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,697
Barristan: Leave this place, your grace.

371
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,324
Leave tonight, I beg you.

372
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,992
And what is she to do for soldiers?

373
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,246
Barristan:
We can find sellswords in pentos and myr.

374
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,831
Is it "we" already, ser barristan?

375
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,751
If you want to sit on the throne

376
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,586
your ancestors built, you must win it.

377
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,005
That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.

378
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,008
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

379
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,639
Jorah: How many wars
have you fought in, ser barristan?

380
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,808
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

381
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,352
where innocents didn't
die by the thousands?

382
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,026
I was in king's landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

383
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,280
You know what I saw? Butchery.

384
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,740
Babies, children, old men.

385
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,159
More women raped than you can count.

386
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:50,831
There's a beast in every man, and it
stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

387
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,876
But the unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

388
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,963
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

389
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:02,592
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

390
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,303
You disagree, ser barristan?

391
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,306
When your brother
led his army into battle at the trident,

392
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,891
men died for him
because they believed in him,

393
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,393
because they loved him,

394
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,021
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

395
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,567
I fought beside the
last dragon on that day.

396
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,321
I bled beside him.

397
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:26,033
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
rhaegar fought nobly,

398
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,868
and rhaegar died.

399
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,538
Did you know him well, ser barristan?

400
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,208
I did, your grace. Finest man I ever met.

401
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:40,297
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.

402
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,395
Missandei: All?
Did this one's ears mishear, your grace?

403
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,706
They did not. I want to buy them all.

404
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,773
(Both speaking valyrian)

405
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,816
She wants to buy them all.

406
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,319
She can't afford them.

407
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,323
The slut thinks she can flash her tits,

408
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,243
and make us give her whatever she wants.

409
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,876
There are 8,000 unsullied in astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?

410
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:22,047
Yes. 8,000.
And the ones still in training as well.

411
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,067
- (Translating into valyrian)
- (Greizhen speaking valyrian)

412
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,635
If they fail on the battlefield,

413
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,388
they will shame astapor.

414
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,976
Master greizhen says
they cannot sell half-trained boys.

415
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,187
If they fail on the battlefield,

416
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,481
they will bring shame upon all ofastapor.

417
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,566
I will have them all or take none.

418
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,410
Many will fall in
battle. I'll need the boys

419
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,153
to pick up the swords they drop.

420
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,363
(Groans)

421
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,507
(Speaking valyrian continually)

422
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,616
The slut cannot pay for all of this.

423
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,994
Master kraznys says you cannot afford this.

424
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,081
Her ship will buy her
100 unsullied, no more,

425
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,250
your ship will buy you 100 unsullied.

426
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,460
And this because I
like the curve of her ass.

427
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,255
(Both laughing)

428
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,780
Because master kraznys is generous.

429
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,883
What is left will buy her 10.

430
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,802
Missandei: The gold
you have left is worth 10.

431
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,488
I will give her 20
if it stops her ignorant whimpering.

432
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,597
But good master kraznys will give you 20.

433
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,767
Her Dothraki smell of shit,

434
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,269
the Dothraki you have with you...

435
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,939
But may be useful as pig feed.

436
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,651
The Dothraki you have
are not worth what they cost to feed...

437
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,629
I will give her 3 for those.

438
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,755
Missandei: But master
kraznys will give you

439
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,059
three unsullied for all of them.

440
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,032
So, ask this beggar queen,

441
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,593
missandei: Master kraznys asks
how you propose to pay...

442
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,162
How will she pay
for the remaining 7,877?

443
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:39,082
Missandei: For
the remaining 7,877 unsullied?

444
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,549
I have dragons. I'll give you one.

445
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,677
(Speaking valyrian)

446
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,139
You will win the throne with
dragons, not slaves, your grace.

447
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,808
Khaleesi, please.

448
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,611
Three dragons.

449
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,904
- One.
- Two.

450
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,197
One.

451
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,912
(Indistinct)

452
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,997
(Speaking valyrian)

453
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,001
Missandei: They want the biggest one.

454
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,169
Done.

455
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,420
Done.

456
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,588
(Sighs)

457
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,928
I'll take you as well, now.

458
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,388
You'll be master kraznys' gift to me.

459
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,933
A token of a bargain well struck.

460
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,392
(In valyrian)

461
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,437
She asks that you give me
to her, as a present.

462
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,773
She asks that you do this now.

463
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,946
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more

464
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,281
than any army. Aegon Targaryen proved that.

465
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,452
You're both here to advise me.

466
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,412
I value your advice, but if you ever

467
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,414
question me in front of strangers again,

468
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,083
you'll be advising someone else.

469
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,210
Is that understood?

470
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,715
Do you have a name?

471
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,385
This one's name is missandei, your grace.

472
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,470
Do you have a family? A mother and a father

473
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,639
you'd return to if you had the choice?

474
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,059
No, your grace. No family living.

475
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,145
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

476
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,773
Yes, your grace. Lying is a great offense.

477
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,235
Many of those on the walk of
punishment were taken there for less.

478
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,946
I offered water to
a slave dying on the walk of punishment.

479
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,199
Do you know
what he said to me? "Let me die."

480
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,952
There are no masters
in the grave, your grace.

481
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,372
Is it true what master kraznys told me

482
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,749
about the unsullied? About their obedience?

483
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,421
All questions have been taken
from them. They obey, that is all.

484
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,173
Once they are yours, they are yours.

485
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,342
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

486
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,887
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

487
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,266
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

488
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,060
You may be killed.

489
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,895
Valar morghulis.

490
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:09,399
Yes, all men must die.

491
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,569
But we are not men.

492
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,041
Tyrion: A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.

493
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,043
Littlefinger:
I'm surprised you're surprised.

494
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,339
This is the safest place in the city.

495
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,133
Not for bastards.

496
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,636
That's all of them, my lord.

497
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,513
Tyrion: Thank you, my dear. Pod.

498
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,850
Pod. Take them outside.

499
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,101
I'll be there in a moment.

500
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,436
Yes, my lord.

501
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,575
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

502
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,329
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

503
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,373
You should have him knighted.

504
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,668
If only the master of coin had such power.

505
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,587
If only.

506
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,966
I owe you a significant debt.

507
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,386
Our redheaded friend.

508
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,180
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

509
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,057
Oh, that.

510
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,227
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

511
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,104
Apparently, her grace believed

512
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,191
that you two had
some sort of special relationship.

513
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,152
We don't. I did fuck her once.

514
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,279
- I know.
- But we don't.

515
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,864
I know.

516
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,574
How'd the queen get that idea?

517
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,411
Why don't you ask her?

518
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,916
Any advice for me on my new position?

519
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,919
Keep a low profile.

520
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,047
If I had a gold dragon

521
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,384
for every time I heard thatjoke,
I'd be richer than you are.

522
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,302
Well, you are richer than I am.

523
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,388
Good point.

524
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,558
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.

525
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,228
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

526
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:15,066
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge? Try whores.

527
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:20,780
I've tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the eyrie.

528
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,745
Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

529
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,833
Tonight, then.

530
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,754
Looks like dull reading.

531
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,089
Tyrion: You think all
reading is dull reading.

532
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,967
It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

533
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,553
The secret history
of the seven kingdoms is in these pages.

534
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,347
Bronn: Unless lord twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

535
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,016
to hide what he's really up to.

536
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
Unless he made it all up, yes.

537
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,269
Podrick, do keep up.

538
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,395
Yes, my lord.

539
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,605
Podrick.

540
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,773
Yes, my lord?

541
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,109
After a long consultation
with my colleague ser bronn,

542
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,779
I finally found
a suitable reward for the services

543
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:04,073
you've provided over and
above what might be considered reasonable.

544
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:09,370
Tell me, pod,
have you ever been with a woman?

545
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,538
No, my lord.

546
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,664
Wonderful.

547
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:17,295
Genna specializes in first-timers.

548
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,964
She's not bad with second-timers, either.

549
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,841
Uh, my lord...

550
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,511
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

551
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,972
through my
would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

552
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,559
Now, as it happens,

553
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,062
marei

554
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,232
is quite the spear-handler herself.

555
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,485
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

556
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,780
as the battle raged all around me.

557
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,740
Marei: He's handsome.

558
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,285
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

559
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:55,875
Kayla is famous
from here to volantis in certain circles.

560
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:02,632
One of four women in the world who can
perform a proper meereenese knot.

561
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,718
My lord, I don't even...

562
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:10,306
Tyrion: She's here to thank you
for being a thoroughly respectful fellow,

563
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,059
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

564
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,273
Be back in time for my supper.

565
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,404
Pace yourself, lad.

566
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,117
Tyrion: For years
I've heard that littlefinger is a magician.

567
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,496
Whenever the crown needs
money, he rubs his hands together

568
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,124
and, poof, mountains of gold.

569
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,501
Let me guess. He's not a magician.

570
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,298
He's stealing it?

571
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,841
Worse, he's borrowing it.

572
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,594
What's wrong with that?

573
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,097
We can't afford to pay it
back, that's what's wrong with it.

574
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,433
The crown owes millions to my father.

575
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,977
Seeing as it's
his grandson's ass on the throne,

576
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,021
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

577
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,273
Forgive a debt, my father?

578
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,901
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

579
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,652
I've never borrowed money.

580
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,155
- I'm not clear on the rules.
- Well...

581
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,658
(Tyrion clears throat)

582
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,623
The basic principle is, I lend you money,

583
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:22,003
and after an agreed upon period of
time, you return it with interest.

584
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,379
What if I don't?

585
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,465
Well, you have to.

586
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,008
But what if I don't?

587
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,427
This is why I don't lend you money.

588
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,597
Anyway, it's not my
father I'm worried about.

589
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,724
It's the iron bank of braavos.

590
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,684
We owe them tens of millions.

591
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,811
If we fail to repay these loans,

592
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,980
the bank will fund our enemies.

593
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,192
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

594
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,860
(Door closes)

595
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,905
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.

596
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,324
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

597
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,951
The lad's practically skipping.

598
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,537
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.

599
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,122
Or should I say my money's worth?

600
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,879
Oh, it was a gift, podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.

601
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,256
He's a squire. You don't pay him.

602
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,384
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

603
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,053
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

604
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,766
Maybe they're trying to curry some
favor with the new master of coin.

605
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,810
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

606
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,854
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

607
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,690
What did you tell them?

608
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,316
I didn't tell them anything.

609
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,818
What did you do to them?

610
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,403
Lots of things.

611
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,321
And they seemed to like these things?

612
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,948
Yes, my lord.

613
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,993
Of course they did.
They're paid to seem to like it.

614
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,453
Only they weren't paid.

615
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,289
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

616
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,041
they gave him the time for free?

617
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,407
Is that what you're telling us?

618
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,174
Sit down, podrick.

619
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,759
(Clears throat)

620
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,932
We're going to need details.

621
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,519
Copious details.

622
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,275
(Horse neighing)

623
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,550
- (Gasps)
- (Neighs)

624
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,728
Come on! Come on!

625
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,568
Come on! Come on.

626
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,038
(Grunts)

627
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,082
(Gasping)

628
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,213
(Horse neighs)

629
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,511
(Wheezing)

630
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,237
(Groans)

631
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,322
You know how we deal with runaways?

632
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,325
(Groaning)

633
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,082
Take off his pants.

634
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,170
No! No! No, no, no!

635
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,338
I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

636
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:38,259
No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!

637
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,724
No, please! No! No!

638
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:45,850
(Arrow whistles)

639
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,352
(Groans)

640
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,774
(Panting)

641
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,589
You little bastard.

642
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,967
(Groans)

643
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,057
(Whimpering)

644
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,434
Come, my lord.

645
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,440
You're a long way from home,
and winter is coming.

646
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,953
(Men chattering in distance)

647
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,551
I'll take the big bitch first.

648
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:06,097
When she's good
and wet, you lot can finish her off.

649
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,683
My lord, I am brienne of tarth.

650
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,060
Lady catelyn stark commanded me

651
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,521
to deliver ser Jaime to king's landing.

652
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,773
Catelyn stark's a treasonous cunt.

653
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,277
Orders were to take the kingslayer
alive. Nobody said shit about you.

654
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,529
- (Grunting)
- (Groans)

655
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,242
You're only making it worse.

656
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,868
(All grunting)

657
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,126
Take her over there,
where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.

658
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,377
(Groans)

659
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,171
Come on!

660
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,798
(Screaming)

661
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,976
You know who she is, don't you?

662
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,898
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

663
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,236
Never been with a woman that big.

664
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,071
Jaime: She's brienne of tarth.

665
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,285
Her father is
lord selwyn tarth. Heard of tarth?

666
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,163
Man: I'm gonna cut your throat!

667
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,333
They call it
the sapphire isle. Do you know why?

668
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,879
Every sapphire in Westeros
was mined on tarth.

669
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,507
Sapphires are gemstones.

670
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,134
The blue ones.

671
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,802
I know what they are.

672
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,556
Lord selwyn would pay his daughter's weight

673
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,225
in sapphires if she's returned to him.

674
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:39,357
But only if she's alive,
her honor unbesmirched.

675
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,442
(Brienne continues screaming)

676
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,869
Bring her back here.

677
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,537
Man 1: Yes, my lord.

678
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,663
Get up.

679
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,873
Man 2: Come on.

680
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,459
Come on, on your feet.

681
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,962
Unbesmirched.

682
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,716
Not defiled.

683
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,469
Fancy word for a fancy man.

684
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,223
I hated to read as a child,

685
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,017
but my father forced me
to study every morning

686
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,645
before I could practice
with sword or horse.

687
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,774
Two hours every day
holed up in the maester's chambers.

688
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,985
I learned a lot of fancy words.

689
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,238
I bet you did.

690
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,825
(Brienne grunts)

691
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:40,209
Your father, he'd pay your
weight in gold to get you back?

692
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,922
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

693
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:49,009
And your sons will be rich
men, and their sons after them.

694
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,429
Lands, titles...

695
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,681
You'll have them all.

696
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,436
The north can't win this war.

697
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,646
You're a smart man. You understand that.

698
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,857
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

699
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,984
Aye, you have both.

700
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,698
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.

701
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:16,495
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

702
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,873
Hard to argue with that.

703
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,212
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

704
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,633
iwonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?

705
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,970
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

706
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,264
but if I could sleep lying down,

707
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,641
my back would thank you for it.

708
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,395
I'm not as young and
resilient as I was once.

709
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,398
None of us are.

710
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,861
Unchain ser Jaime from the tree.

711
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,279
Man: Come on, men.

712
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:00,164
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

713
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,208
I'm famished, actually.

714
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,211
I think we've got a
spare partridge on the fire.

715
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,963
Well, I do like partridge.

716
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,925
(Jaime groans softly)

717
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:17,389
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

718
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,479
Will this work as a table, my lord?

719
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,314
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

720
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,107
(Groans)

721
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,609
On the stump.

722
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,961
You think you're the smartest man there is.

723
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,869
(Grunting)

724
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:46,085
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

725
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,294
My father...

726
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,605
And if you get in any trouble,

727
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,715
all you've got to do is say "my father"

728
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,635
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

729
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,139
Have you got something to say?

730
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,308
(Grunts)

731
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,480
Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.

732
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:15,072
You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

733
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,075
Never forget that.

734
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,662
Here, this should help you remember.

735
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,167
(Screaming in pain)

736
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,840
(The bear and the maiden fair playing)
