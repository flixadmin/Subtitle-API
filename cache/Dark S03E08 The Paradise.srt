1
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,248
<i>Every journey has a beginning.</i>

2
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,920
<i>But yours has no end.</i>

3
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,631
<i>It goes on forever and ever.</i>

4
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:30,131
I'm here to finally make
your journey come to an end.

5
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,125
This is impossible.

6
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,291
You're dead.

7
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,415
I had you killed.

8
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:50,536
You still have no idea
how this game is played.

9
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,333
You want to destroy the knot,

10
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,711
but every step you take keeps it intact.

11
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,725
This can't be.

12
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,786
I killed it.

13
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,211
I killed Martha and I killed the origin.

14
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,288
Your world and Eva's world.

15
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,075
They both should never have existed.

16
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,664
You thought the origin

17
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,236
lies in the connection
between both worlds.

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,223
But in reality it lies outside
both of those worlds.

19
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,170
Our thinking is shaped by dualities.

20
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,786
Black, white.

21
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,273
Light and shadow.

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,290
Your world and Eva's world.

23
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,131
But that's wrong.

24
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,003
Nothing is complete
without a third dimension.

25
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,541
The triquetra.

26
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,733
There is...

27
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,773
a third world?

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,496
<i>The world that gave birth to the knot.</i>

29
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,496
<i>Where everything originates.</i>

30
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,286
<i>Where a single mistake was made.</i>

31
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,751
<i>Tannhaus... in the origin world...</i>

32
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,915
<i>like you, he lost someone.</i>

33
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,923
<i>And like you, he tried to bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

34
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,791
<i>But instead he split
and destroyed his world.</i>

35
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,671
<i>Thus creating both our worlds.</i>

36
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,831
But there's a way to destroy the knot.

37
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,373
By preventing the invention of
travel through space and time

38
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,785
in the origin world in the first place.

39
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,896
THE PARADISE

40
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,166
I'd have liked to have
spared you all of that.

41
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,430
But your path had to remain unchanged.

42
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,825
Every step had to be
taken exactly as before.

43
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,583
Up until this moment.

44
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,095
This...

45
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,495
has it happened before?

46
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,456
You trying to destroy the origin,

47
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,908
that has happened an
infinite number of times.

48
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,414
But this here,

49
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,164
you and I,

50
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,226
is happening for the first time.

51
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,128
It's time you understand how
everything is really connected.

52
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,245
<i>Everything you have done,</i>

53
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,130
<i>everything Eva has done,</i>

54
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,995
<i>has upheld the knot for
eternity, in both worlds.</i>

55
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,915
<i>You create yourself forever anew.</i>

56
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,753
<i>And so does she.</i>

57
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,666
They have to die.

58
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,289
They must all die,

59
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,461
so that they can be reborn.

60
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,206
You carry both worlds inside you.

61
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,739
What?

62
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,631
Your son.

63
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,533
He's the origin.

64
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:50,081
He gives everyone their lives
alternately in each of the two worlds.

65
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,078
He's waited a long time for you.

66
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,526
And he'll do so time and time again.

67
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,248
<i>You want to destroy your son,</i>

68
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,373
<i>and the knot along with him.</i>

69
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,998
<i>Eva wants him to live,</i>

70
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,250
<i>and must therefore uphold the knot.</i>

71
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,539
<i>She can't help it.</i>

72
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,881
<i>Time and again she'll do all
she can do to ensure he lives.</i>

73
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,206
<i>Everything you and Eva
have done in this knot,</i>

74
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,706
<i>and will do over and over again,</i>

75
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,418
<i>you did out of love.</i>

76
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,958
<i>And yet you have brought
nothing but pain and suffering.</i>

77
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,873
If you want Jonas to live,

78
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,355
if you want all of them to live,

79
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,128
then we must do what
has always been done.

80
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,043
You too.

81
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,751
<i>Both of you have done unimaginable
things on your journey.</i>

82
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:57,248
<i>Because you can't let go
of your deepest desires.</i>

83
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,248
Yours ends here and now.

84
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,623
What's that mean?

85
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,075
You have accomplished what you
were sent to this world for.

86
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,164
We've accomplished nothing.

87
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,706
She said we had to stop the apocalypse.

88
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,914
- The barrels in the power plant...
- You'll understand it all

89
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,316
when it's time for you to understand.

90
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,456
<i>You have been trying to
escape what you'll become.</i>

91
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,766
<i>But that's impossible.</i>

92
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,285
<i>In the end, you will always stand
face to face with yourselves.</i>

93
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,458
Who are you?

94
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,345
I'm sorry.

95
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,664
Your two worlds should
never have existed.

96
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,873
You and Eva,

97
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,995
the two of you should
have never existed.

98
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,164
How do you know all this?

99
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,626
How do you know about the origin world?

100
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,538
I've spent 33 years looking for
answers in your world and in hers.

101
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:36,123
<i>I've tried to put together
the pieces of the puzzle.</i>

102
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,206
<i>To understand how everything can
be reborn from the same family tree</i>

103
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,578
<i>over and over again.</i>

104
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,746
<i>Until I realised that we're
not all part of the knot.</i>

105
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,789
<i>Both worlds are a cancer</i>

106
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,131
<i>that must have grown
from something else.</i>

107
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:00,289
<i>If you remove it, you destroy
all that was born of it,</i>

108
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,331
<i>but you keep everything alive</i>

109
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,583
<i>that already existed
in the origin world.</i>

110
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,206
All these years, I thought

111
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,368
that she was my daughter.

112
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,165
For a long time, I wished
you were the father.

113
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,508
But it's better this way.

114
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,021
She isn't part of the knot.

115
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,020
She will live.

116
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,414
<i>But just like you and Eva,</i>

117
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,206
<i>I had to preserve everything</i>

118
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,638
<i>in order to become what I am today.</i>

119
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,830
You know what you have to do.

120
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,439
Do it quickly.

121
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,391
Don't let her suffer.

122
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,685
It's no life that's she's living.

123
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,516
It has to happen,

124
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,881
so I can move heaven
and earth to prevent it.

125
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,998
<i>Just like you, I've brought
pain and suffering to others,</i>

126
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,248
<i>again and again...</i>

127
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,580
<i>so that my path could
lead me here to you today.</i>

128
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,271
<i>Everything I did</i>

129
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,575
<i>I did for Regina.</i>

130
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,036
<i>All these years, I've been
searching in both worlds</i>

131
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,921
<i>for a way for her to live.</i>

132
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,918
<i>A way to break the chain
of cause and effect.</i>

133
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,975
<i>Both in your world</i>

134
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,640
<i>and in Eva's world,</i>

135
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,420
<i>I've tried to understand
how everything is connected.</i>

136
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,673
<i>Really connected.</i>

137
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,790
<i>Until I finally understood that our
two worlds were borne of another.</i>

138
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,035
<i>That Regina will always
die in both worlds.</i>

139
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,035
<i>That she can only live in the world
from which everything was created;</i>

140
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,195
<i>the origin world.</i>

141
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,445
<i>I lied to you...</i>

142
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,425
<i>and to Eva.</i>

143
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,881
<i>But the knot had to be upheld.</i>

144
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,998
<i>I had to ensure that you
both stayed in the dark.</i>

145
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,880
<i>That everyone in this
knot stayed in the dark.</i>

146
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,665
<i>First, everything had to
happen the way it always has...</i>

147
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,326
<i>in your world and in her world.</i>

148
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,728
<i>Every step in this labyrinth</i>

149
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,578
<i>had to be taken as it had been before.</i>

150
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,706
<i>An infinite chain of cause and effect</i>

151
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,058
<i>that leads us all, in both worlds,</i>

152
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,410
<i>to our same fate over and over again.</i>

153
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,463
Excuse me.

154
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,789
Did someone just pass by here?

155
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,211
An old man?

156
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,575
<i>We have no free will
to act in either world.</i>

157
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,498
<i>We will forever do what we
have always done before.</i>

158
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
Hey.

159
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,645
You're Helge Doppler, aren't you?

160
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,123
Helge.

161
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,785
<i>No fate in one world</i>

162
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,498
<i>is better than the other.</i>

163
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
What's today's date?

164
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,643
8 November.

165
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,240
Which year?

166
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,960
1986.

167
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,538
1986...

168
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,831
<i>I can change it, you know?</i>

169
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,123
I can change the past.

170
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,645
And the future.

171
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,906
Help!

172
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,668
If you don't exist,
none of this will happen.

173
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,166
No!

174
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,383
What's in there? Is he in there?

175
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,276
- What did you do to him?
- Let go!

176
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,914
<i>As long as the knot exists,</i>

177
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,706
<i>in both worlds we are damned</i>

178
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,248
<i>to feel and cause every
bit of suffering anew.</i>

179
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,330
<i>There is no difference
between the two worlds.</i>

180
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,746
<i>Things may not happen in the same way,</i>

181
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,664
<i>or at the same time.</i>

182
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,436
<i>But they do happen.</i>

183
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,081
<i>No one in this knot</i>

184
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>can escape their fate.</i>

185
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,996
It was you.

186
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,456
<i>Every piece of the puzzle</i>

187
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,788
<i>repeatedly finds its place.</i>

188
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:10,248
<i>Just like you, I moved the
pieces around the chessboard,</i>

189
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,880
<i>and had to look on as everything
happened over and over again.</i>

190
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>But I finally know
how to untie the knot.</i>

191
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,791
I know where the loophole is that
you've searched for all this time.

192
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,520
Time.

193
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:45,414
During the apocalypse, it stood
still for a fraction of a second.

194
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,076
And that threw
everything out of balance.

195
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,414
But when time stands still,

196
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,246
the chain of cause and effect
is also momentarily broken.

197
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,706
One can...

198
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,748
change things.

199
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,463
Eva knows that.

200
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:09,289
She uses the loophole in your world

201
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,771
to send her younger self off
in one direction or another,

202
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,998
in order to preserve the cycle.

203
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:21,664
And I used it to send myself
in another direction, too.

204
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,276
To be here today.

205
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:28,705
You must use it to send
Jonas on a different path...

206
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,541
in order to break the
cycle once and for all.

207
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,821
Jonas and Martha are to blame

208
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,873
for everything happening
again and again.

209
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,143
You must send them to the origin world,

210
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:44,075
so they can finally end all this.

211
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,283
I promise you.

212
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,096
I'll make this right.

213
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,153
Why are you still here?

214
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,240
She's dead!

215
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,873
What more do you want from me?

216
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,955
I can explain it. Everything.

217
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,428
But first we have to get out of here.

218
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,285
What's going on?

219
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,331
What is that?

220
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,823
What is that?

221
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,165
That is our last hope.

222
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,539
How did you do that?

223
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,181
What time is this?

224
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,616
The question isn't "what time?"

225
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,526
But "which world?"

226
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,266
What's that supposed to mean?

227
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,651
There is a way

228
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,831
that you can avoid becoming me,

229
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:59,043
a way all of this never needs to happen.

230
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,878
But for it to work,
you have to trust me.

231
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,993
You don't have much time left.

232
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,831
The other Martha,

233
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,703
you must save her.

234
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,211
The other Martha?

235
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,273
All these years I thought

236
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,578
that I alone have to change it.

237
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,081
But it is just as much her fault.

238
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,306
You are 2 parts of a whole.

239
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,330
Only together can you
return to the origin world.

240
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,778
What we know is a drop.

241
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,631
What we don't know...

242
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
is an ocean.

243
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,126
What does that mean?

244
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,458
Tick, tock.

245
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,081
Tick, tock.

246
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,500
Tick, tock.

247
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,039
Today is the day of the apocalypse...

248
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,541
in her world.

249
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,681
The loophole...

250
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,245
it also exists here.

251
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,455
For one moment, time will stand still.

252
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,828
You must get Martha...

253
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,793
before Magnus and Franziska get her.

254
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,383
And before everything happens again.

255
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:24,251
The two of you are our last hope.

256
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,751
Adam will send Jonas on his way.

257
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:37,918
He and Martha, they will stop
all this from ever happening.

258
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,673
Dad.

259
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,463
Tell him I'm sorry.

260
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,685
If everything goes right...

261
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:27,266
then Regina will live.

262
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,664
Martha?

263
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,526
What's going on?

264
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,293
Martha?

265
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,161
You have to come with us.

266
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,713
Come where?

267
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,000
This can't be.

268
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,708
You're alive.

269
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,958
You look like her.

270
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,463
You don't know who I am.

271
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,211
What time are we in?

272
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,020
When are we?

273
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,825
Why are we here?

274
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:07,373
Today is 21 June 1986.

275
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,915
The day our two worlds were created.

276
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,826
Not here, but in his world.

277
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,663
Tannhaus, the clockmaker,

278
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:19,706
will open the passage
for the first time today.

279
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,828
What?

280
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,131
We don't have much time.

281
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,831
We have to stop it from ever happening.

282
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,833
Wait!

283
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,788
What does that mean?

284
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,345
Where are we going?

285
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,333
We're bringing someone
back from the dead.

286
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,956
What's that supposed to mean?

287
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:30,228
It's a bit complicated to explain.

288
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,741
We have to get them before they die.

289
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,336
What are you trying to do?

290
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,461
You and I.

291
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,738
We're the reason everything
happens the way it does.

292
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,163
Why it happens again and again.

293
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:09,128
Because you can't let
go of what you want.

294
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,826
And I can't let go of what I want.

295
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,641
But we are the mistake.

296
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,265
The glitch in the matrix.

297
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,351
You want them to never exist.

298
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,540
Your world and mine.

299
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,630
That we never exist.

300
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,578
I was expecting you.

301
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,373
I know why you're here.

302
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,558
But in the end...

303
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,998
every death

304
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,010
is just a new beginning.

305
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,003
You can't win.

306
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,498
My dying

307
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,170
is only another step in the cycle.

308
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,375
You're going to kill me today.

309
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,420
Martha will find me.

310
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,955
Just as I once found myself.

311
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,135
It will turn her against
you once and for all.

312
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,773
What are you waiting for?

313
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,713
This isn't right.

314
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,671
It didn't happen like this.

315
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,748
It...

316
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,830
it never happened this way.

317
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,438
You killed me.

318
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,664
Every time.

319
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,516
You will die.

320
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,375
I will die.

321
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,955
And everything that has grown out of us.

322
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,888
What have you done?

323
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,456
Life is a labyrinth.

324
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:34,831
Some wander around inside
it until their death,

325
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,833
in search of a way out.

326
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,756
<i>But there is only one path,</i>

327
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,753
<i>and it leads ever deeper inside.</i>

328
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,958
<i>Only when one reaches the centre</i>

329
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,475
<i>will one understand.</i>

330
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,128
Death is incomprehensible.

331
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,630
But one can reconcile oneself with it.

332
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,383
All that we have done

333
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,828
will ultimately be forgotten.

334
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:28,286
<i>We are responsible for this
never-ending déjà vu.</i>

335
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,706
<i>And we're the ones</i>

336
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,328
<i>who have to end it.</i>

337
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,501
We...

338
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,126
are the mistake.

339
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:49,421
You and I.

340
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:09,625
<i>Both our fates are bound
together in eternal damnation.</i>

341
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,643
<i>Across both worlds.</i>

342
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,745
<i>Everything is cause and effect.</i>

343
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,956
<i>Every pain entices us to act,</i>

344
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,828
<i>shapes our will.</i>

345
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:30,631
<i>Tannhaus lost all that ever meant
anything to him in the origin world.</i>

346
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,248
<i>His son, daughter-in-law, and
granddaughter died in a car accident.</i>

347
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,170
<i>They were forced off a bridge,
and drowned in the river.</i>

348
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,583
<i>He never forgot that pain.</i>

349
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,131
<i>Jonas and Martha,</i>

350
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,631
<i>they have to take his
pain away from him,</i>

351
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:03,706
<i>so that he never looks for
a way to undo everything.</i>

352
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,831
<i>They must go to the origin world</i>

353
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,378
<i>and prevent our two worlds</i>

354
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:18,666
<i>from ever being created.</i>

355
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,745
This is the moment the
passage was first opened.

356
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,047
Tannhaus tried to travel back to a world

357
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:53,370
in which his family was still alive.

358
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:59,543
But instead, he split his own world.

359
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,620
He created the knot.

360
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,141
Created us.

361
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,789
For a brief moment,

362
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,841
there will be a bridge...

363
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,675
between all three worlds.

364
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,298
You want to go to his world?

365
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,670
We have to travel back to the
moment when his pain began.

366
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,671
Jonas...

367
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,663
the one in your world...

368
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,621
was he different?

369
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,178
It's starting.

370
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,380
Martha?

371
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,833
Martha?

372
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:50,035
Jonas?

373
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,035
Jonas!

374
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:13,626
Martha?

375
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,458
Jonas!

376
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,948
Martha?

377
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,850
Oh, there you are.

378
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,041
He looks sad.

379
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,706
Who looks sad?

380
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,768
The boy standing there.

381
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,123
But there's no one there.

382
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,335
It's only the back of your closet.

383
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,245
Jonas?

384
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,225
Is everything okay?

385
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,470
What do you want in the basement?

386
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,200
What is it?

387
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,135
There's a girl standing there.

388
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,578
There's no girl there.

389
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,116
Come on. Let's go back
to the others, okay?

390
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,378
Come on.

391
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:22,423
Do you always have to bring that
up? Can't you let it be for once?

392
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:27,251
I thought you wanted the store.

393
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,664
- Maybe not now, but sometime later.
- You never listen!

394
00:50:32,666 --> 00:50:35,539
No wonder Mum couldn't take it anymore.

395
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:38,414
Your endless lecturing,
Big Bang, Big Crunch...

396
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,826
Have you ever asked
Sonja if she's interested?

397
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:45,373
In all these years, have you
ever asked if I'm interested?

398
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,225
Or what I really want?

399
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,183
It's raining outside.

400
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,383
Is that all you have to say?

401
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,081
Marek, come on.

402
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,789
You told me the world
outside was full of secrets,

403
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:14,706
and what we know is a
drop in an infinite ocean.

404
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,706
At least you were right about that.

405
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:19,914
You may know everything about
Einstein-Rosen bridges and black holes,

406
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:24,036
but about me... You know
absolutely nothing about me.

407
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,418
I... I thought you'd
stay a few more days.

408
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,698
He'll cool off.

409
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,683
Was that really necessary?

410
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:16,246
We could just as well
have left tomorrow.

411
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,015
You're ashamed of him.

412
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,748
You have no idea what he's like.

413
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,414
Growing up that way. He lives
in his head, in his big ideas.

414
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,831
Have you ever seen what he does?

415
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,789
I don't get why anyone
watches that stuff.

416
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,206
He only ever looked up.

417
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,128
Stars, galaxies, stupid
universes, but me...

418
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,600
He never saw me.

419
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:49,921
You can't choose your family.

420
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:55,538
Yeah.

421
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,516
I chose you.

422
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:02,826
Yes.

423
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:06,166
You chose me.

424
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,055
Look out!

425
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,206
Are you okay?

426
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,458
Yeah?

427
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,751
- What are they doing there?
- I'll go and see.

428
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:38,081
What the hell is this?

429
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:41,293
You can't just stand around
here! I almost ran you over!

430
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,270
Is everything okay?

431
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,523
Do you need help?

432
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,210
The bridge is closed.

433
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,711
What?

434
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,873
There was an accident.

435
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,695
Do you think this is funny?

436
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,333
Go on, go home.

437
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,583
What we know is a drop.

438
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,198
What we don't know is an ocean.

439
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,701
Your father loves you.

440
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,218
He would do anything for you.

441
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,995
What did you just say?

442
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,126
Marek?

443
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:50,791
Is everything okay?

444
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:06,708
The bridge is closed.

445
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,503
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,423
Marek!

447
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,381
What was that?

448
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,166
You were right.

449
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,953
We should leave tomorrow.

450
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,081
You're back?

451
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,953
The bridge is closed.

452
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:31,205
- Your son thinks he met a pair of angels.
- Don't mock me.

453
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,463
I don't know why...

454
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,893
but I suddenly just got this...

455
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,461
this feeling.

456
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:12,213
It's nice that you're back.

457
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,576
I haven't even stripped the beds yet.

458
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,288
I'll take the bags upstairs.

459
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,125
Thanks.

460
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:44,855
Want to hold her?

461
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:50,371
Charlotte already missed you too.

462
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,001
I'll help Marek.

463
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,333
Do you think it worked?

464
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,095
Inside the light...

465
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,133
I saw you.

466
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,783
As a child.

467
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,968
You were looking towards me...

468
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,915
as if you could see me too.

469
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,928
In the closet?

470
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:46,576
That was you?

471
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,636
It wasn't a dream.

472
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:15,926
Do you think anything of us will remain?

473
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,883
Or is that what we are?

474
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,125
A dream?

475
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,326
And we never really existed?

476
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,750
I don't know.

477
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,380
We're a perfect match.

478
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:25,406
Never believe anything else.

479
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,331
- Shall we reheat the lasagne?
- Yes.

480
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,914
- Let me help you.
- I'll open another bottle, okay?

481
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,623
- Definitely.
- Yes.

482
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,039
Can I get a sip too?

483
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,581
- And now we'll toast to Regina.
- Yes.

484
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,960
- Here's to you.
- Here's to you.

485
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,970
And thanks for the invite.

486
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,300
- You're welcome.
- To you.

487
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,581
Your eye.

488
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:40,456
- It looks much better.
- You never actually told us what happened.

489
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:43,538
- You never told me either.
- Come on, tell us.

490
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,168
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone else.

491
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:51,021
Last summer...

492
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,250
Shit. That scared me.

493
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,331
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

494
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,623
Is this the apocalypse?

495
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,414
- I'll light some candles.
- I'll help you.

496
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:04,846
Got a light?

497
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,789
Right, then.

498
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:10,311
- Here.
- Hannah?

499
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,456
Is everything okay?

500
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,076
Hey, everything okay?

501
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:29,041
I'm not sure. I think I
had déjà vu or something.

502
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:36,671
This is going to sound
completely absurd, but...

503
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,420
this is exactly

504
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,325
what I dreamt last night.

505
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:46,998
The light was flickering.

506
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,710
There was a loud bang.

507
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,958
And then suddenly everything was dark.

508
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,373
And somehow...

509
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:00,625
the world had ended.

510
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,946
The world had ended?

511
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,710
Yeah, I don't know.

512
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,330
It was just dark, and it
never became light again.

513
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,500
I had this peculiar feeling...

514
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:21,728
that it was a good thing...

515
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,425
for everything to be over.

516
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:29,543
Like suddenly being free of everything.

517
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,290
No wanting.

518
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:35,175
No having to.

519
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,076
Infinite darkness.

520
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,096
No yesterday.

521
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,183
No today.

522
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,950
No tomorrow.

523
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,083
Nothing.

524
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,165
You really need to get that looked into.

525
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,670
Maybe it's the hormones.

526
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,789
If the world were to end today,

527
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:17,331
and you had one wish,

528
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,043
what would you wish for?

529
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,871
A world without Winden.

530
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,146
Let's drink to that.

531
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,081
Yes.

532
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,883
- A world without Winden.
- A world without Winden.

533
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,748
Looks like Winden doesn't
want to just disappear.

534
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,423
Maybe that's for the best.

535
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:51,121
Do you already have a name?

536
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:57,538
I don't know.

537
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,905
I think Jonas is a beautiful name.
