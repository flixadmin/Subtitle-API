00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,000
Previously on "arrow"...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,470
[clears throat]
I'm sorry, I--

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,840
I should go.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,440
The night of the siege,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,710
You were
at the train station.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,610
I got attacked
by one of those
crazy masked things,

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,910
But he got shot
by a cop, I think.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,710
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,810
He's dead.

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,190
I promised you, Thea.
I will never let
anyone hurt you.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,690
Sara lance is dead?

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,190
Yes.
At Merlyn's hand?

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,190
It appears.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,160
Al sa-her will face
the league's justice.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,560
He has sworn
to protect Merlyn
at any cost.

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,860
If that is true...

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,970
Then Oliver Queens
courts war with us.

18
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,500
[wind blowing]

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,440
[Oliver groaning and grunting]

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,890
Hey.

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,920
Very nice.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,760
[indistinct chatter]

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
[chuckles]

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Merry christmas.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Well, I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,170
You keep
the city safe.

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,680
You know, these days,
you're the closest thing
to a partner I got.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,810
Happy holidays.

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,220
Here you go, buddy.

30
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,820
Merlyn!

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,330
[all grunting]

32
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,890
[groans]

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,820
Nyssa.

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,730
What is this?

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,590
We agreed!
To nothing.

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,960
My father merely decided
to give you the time

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,170
To bring Sara's
killer to justice,
and you have failed.

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,070
We are doing
everything
that we can!

39
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,340
You've been distracted
protecting the city.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,010
And you've exhausted
my father's patience.

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,140
In civilizations past,

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,810
When someone
in the village was murdered,

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,150
The league would come
and kill 50 people a day

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,720
Until the true criminal
was rooted out.

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,290
Find and deliver the one
who killed ta-er al-sahfer.

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,960
You have 48 hours,
or the citizens of Starling

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,260
Will see what the league
of assassins is capable of.

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,760
You're going
to slaughter
innocent people.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,670
The cleansing
of Starling city
will fall to Sarab.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,670
Maseo?

51
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,310
Maseo is no longer.

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,380
As she said...
I am Sarab.

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,740
Deliver Sara's killer

54
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,380
Or blood will flow
in your streets.

55
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,720
This isn't what
Sara would want!

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,550
Sara is dead.

57
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,820
It's time you remember that.

58
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,970
Laurel: Dad's ok.
Um...Working too much.

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,410
I never really
know what to say
when I come here.

60
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,770
I just...

61
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,540
[inhales and exhales]

62
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,150
I wanted to wish you
a merry christmas,

63
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,750
And tell you
how much I miss you.

64
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,250
Laurel?

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,820
Thea.

66
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,090
What are you
doing here?

67
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,220
I was just leaving
flowers for my mom.

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,930
Who were you talking to?

69
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,260
I just come here...
Sometimes.

70
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,070
Even though
Sara's still alive?

71
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,570
Laurel, what--what's wrong?

72
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,970
Everything's fine.
Sara's ok.

73
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,040
No, Thea.

74
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,350
Sara's dead.

75
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,180
What?

76
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,680
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,190
While you were
gone...

78
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,790
She was murdered.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,990
By who?

80
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,690
I don't know.
I buried her here.

81
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,300
Why didn't you tell anybody,
like at least your father,

82
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,470
The police?
No, no.

83
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,040
Thea, no one
can ever know.

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,870
Why?

85
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,540
Sara, she was, uh,

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,140
She was complicated.

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,180
And if my father
found out,

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,650
It would kill him.

89
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,620
You have to promise
me that you won't
tell Oliver.

90
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,490
Of course, I--I promise.

91
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,790
[both sigh]

92
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,530
I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,730
Hey.

94
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,930
Did you know there's
a cafeteria in the building?

95
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,470
There's a cold press juice bar,

96
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,840
Organic salad station.
I know.

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,970
I eat there every day,

98
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,310
Along with 800
of your other employees.

99
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,470
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm late for a meeting.

101
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,940
Wait, Felicity!
Are we ok?

102
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,150
If by "we"
you mean you and me

103
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,120
As individual
entities, then yes,
we are fantastic.

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
This is about the kiss.

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
This is not
about the kiss.

106
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You sure? 'cause it really
feels like it's about the kiss.

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,830
Unless it's about
how I left after the kiss.

108
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,930
I can explain.
No.

109
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,460
I can explain.
It was a moment
and you regret it.

110
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,270
It's over. Now can
we please pretend
like it never happened

111
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,440
And go back to being
professionals?

112
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,840
[elevator dings,
cell phone vibrates]

113
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,770
I have to go.

114
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
Work.

115
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,450
But you're at...Work.

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,680
Felicity:
What happened?

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,450
The league wants
Sara's killer handed
over in the next 48 hours.

118
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Why do I sense
there's an "or else"

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,820
At the end
of that sentence?

120
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,060
Or else they'll start killing
innocent civilians.

121
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,130
Caitlin has the dna that
we pulled off of the arrows

122
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,630
That killed Sara,
but the str markers
are degraded,

123
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,230
So it's taking
a little bit longer.

124
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,870
Felicity...

125
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,270
It can't take
any longer.

126
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,210
If we can't find
Sara's killer in time,

127
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,780
We're going to need
a contingency plan.

128
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,250
I know.

129
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,380
I don't have one.

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,790
[exhales]

131
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,100
Here.

132
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,170
Oh, I'm not hungry.

133
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,610
The first time
I interrogated
someone,

134
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,040
I lost
my appetite
for two days.

135
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,240
You need
your strength.

136
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,310
I didn't interrogate anyone.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,080
I tortured him.

138
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,820
The question is,

139
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,850
Did you learn
anything about
chien na wei's plans?

140
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,920
[exhales] there's a biotech
company in Hong Kong.

141
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,490
They were working
on a super-antibiotic.

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,860
They got a super-virus instead.

143
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,170
They're calling it
oh-mei-gah,

144
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,270
Which is the Chinese
translation for...

145
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,600
Omega.

146
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,440
Said one vile could
wipe out an entire city.

147
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,780
So it's a bio weapon
chin na wei's after.

148
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,610
Did he tell you
where it is now?

149
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,920
Yeah.

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,450
He didn't want to,
but I made him.

151
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,790
You did what
was necessary.

152
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,120
One man's agony
is not worth

153
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,790
The lives of
an entire city.

154
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,300
Felicity: But
you're all right?

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Okay. Yes, it is
coming through now.

156
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,700
No, I'm fine.
Things are just,
um, tense here.

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,170
Thank you, caitlin.

158
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,240
Happy holidays
to you, too.

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,870
Are those the dna results?

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,510
It's the reassembled
genome s.T.A.R. Labs

161
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,480
Was able to get
off of the arrow
that killed Sara.

162
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,310
I need to run it against
potential suspects.

163
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,510
What database
are you using?

164
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Scpd maintains a genetic
markers database.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,750
Anyone's who committed
a felony in the past
three years.

166
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,990
[beep]
no, that--

167
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,190
That can't be right.

168
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,190
Who is it?
It must be a mistake.

169
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,160
Felicity!
Who killed Sara?

170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,230
You did.

171
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,420
This must be a mistake.

172
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,730
I took perspiration
off the arrows
that killed Sara.

173
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,330
Two years ago
when the police
arrested Oliver

174
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,160
Because they thought,
accurately, that he
was the vigilante,

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,260
They took a dna sample.

176
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,170
That sample is a match
out of the 13 strs.

177
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,600
The odds of that...
They're impossible.

178
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,810
Ok, so somehow
my dna is on
the arrows.

179
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,110
Someone's setting you up,
Oliver.

180
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,740
Well, somebody with
a vested interest

181
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,710
In pitting me
against the league
of assassins.

182
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,880
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

183
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,610
Merlyn was in corto maltese
with Thea

184
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,650
When this was going down.
Unless he wasn't.

185
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,080
I mean, Merlyn hid
successfully for two years

186
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,990
From the police and the league.

187
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,820
He's good
at covering his tracks.

188
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,090
So we uncover them.

189
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,430
But it might
take some time.

190
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,600
In less than 48 hours,
the league is going
to murder 50 people.

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,900
We don't have time.

192
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,580
Move to the lab.
I'll deal with

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,780
The rest
of security.

194
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,850
Stay on comms.

195
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,780
Maseo, are you set?

196
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,520
Just about.

197
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,430
Found omega.

198
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
Be careful with it.

199
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, we might
have a problem.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,340
What's wrong?

201
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,170
Somebody already
took it.

202
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,440
How did she get
in here before us?

203
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,980
She didn't need
to get in, Oliver.

204
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,550
She already
had someone inside.

205
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,390
Yeah, I know,
but it's
the holidays

206
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,590
And I guess
I'm feeling
charitable.

207
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,020
Is that ok?

208
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,760
Jake, I got
to call you
right back.

209
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,230
Hey.
Hi!

210
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,700
Look who it is.

211
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
[laughs]

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
How was your ride down?

213
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,240
Oh, uneventful.

214
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,500
Chance to grade
some papers.

215
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,010
Dad, maybe you can tell me
why half your officers

216
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,240
Are allergic
to search warrants?

217
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,380
Mom!

218
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,080
I didn't know that
you were coming to town.

219
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,350
Well, I guess
that's my fault,

220
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,450
'cause I thought you could
do a little christmas surprise.

221
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,620
Of course I want
to spend christmas
with my family.

222
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
So where's Sara?

223
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,160
She's not returning
my phone calls.

224
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,330
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause
she's, uh, she's traveling.

225
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,270
Backpacking through the andes.

226
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,530
I think.
Yeah.

227
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,740
I found something!

228
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,740
A.R.G.U.S. Monitors
air traffic in and out
of countries of interest.

229
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,880
Corto maltese is on that list.

230
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,180
This is a list of every
commercial airliner,

231
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,010
Private jet, sea plane,
and, I'm not kidding,

232
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,250
Hot air balloon that
took off from corto
maltese this past year.

233
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,320
Look at this flight path.

234
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,590
Private charter
from corto maltese
to caracas,

235
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,790
Then to cartagena,

236
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,560
Only to fly back
to caracas,
and then to tijuana.

237
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,230
Whoever was on that plane
was working pretty hard
to hide where it was going.

238
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,060
The route ends
at a private
landing strip

239
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,160
Just outside
Starling city.

240
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,100
When did it
land?

241
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,600
The night before
Sara was murdered.

242
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,940
Please! All I do
is fly the plane!

243
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,110
Quiet!

244
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,080
The man in this photo--

245
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,550
Did you fly him
from corto maltese

246
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,650
To Starling city?
No.

247
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,650
This time,
look at the photo!

248
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,460
He'll kill me.

249
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,090
He's not here. We are.

250
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,860
All right, ok, yes,
I flew him here.

251
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,130
I've got
security footage,
you want to see?

252
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,330
Security footage
from the airfield
where Merlyn landed.

253
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,540
Check
for October seventh.

254
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,470
[beep]

255
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,680
Right there,
stop.

256
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,440
I thought you said
Merlyn was keeping
his distance from Thea,

257
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,110
That he hadn't had
any contact.

258
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,680
He lied.

259
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,180
And so did she.

260
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,880
Maybe there's something
we should consider here.

261
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,520
Maybe it wasn't
your dna, Oliver,
maybe it was Thea's.

262
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,320
What?
You two
are siblings.

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,490
There would be
overlap, maybe
even enough to--

264
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,350
Diggle, are you
listening to yourself?

265
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,020
You're suggesting that
Thea killed Sara.

266
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,860
Even if--even if she would,

267
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,760
Even if she could...

268
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,360
Why?

269
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,430
Well, Malcolm Merlyn
is her father.

270
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,130
I hate to even say this.

271
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,070
Then don't.

272
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,140
Oliver...

273
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,770
I know how much
you love your sister,

274
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,040
But we have to look
at the facts.

275
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,810
The virtual autopsy
I did on Sara;

276
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,080
I thought Roy might
have stabbed her

277
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,150
Because the trajectory
wasn't consistent

278
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,810
With that of an archer
of average height.

279
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,550
You weren't considering
a killer of Thea's size.

280
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,190
Enough, both of you!

281
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,020
My sister
did not kill Sara.

282
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,220
The dna on
the arrows is mine

283
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,830
Because Malcolm Merlyn
put it there.

284
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,360
[cell phone vibrates]

285
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,060
[sighs]

286
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,000
Hi.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,430
Ray: Hey, uh,
we need to talk,

288
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,200
So I came here.
Here where?

289
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,400
Where you are.

290
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,140
I might have pinged
your phone...Again.

291
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,910
I thought I was pretty clear
when I said I didn't want
to talk about this.

292
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,850
You were.

293
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,820
But you were
also pretty wrong

294
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,420
When you said
I regretted
kissing you.

295
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,620
I can't imagine
there's a man
on the planet

296
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,520
Who would ever
regret kissing you.

297
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,090
Well, I can think of one.

298
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,860
But I am sorry about
the way I reacted.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,830
When I kissed you,
I felt guilty.

300
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,540
Oh, my god,
you're cheating on someone.

301
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,910
No.

302
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,040
Her name is anna,

303
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,580
And we were engaged.

304
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,950
Last spring,
the night
those men...

305
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,750
We ran into a few.
We tried to escape,
but we couldn't.

306
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,950
I tried to fight them,
but I couldn't.

307
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,160
I wasn't strong
enough. I...

308
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,860
They broke my leg,

309
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,030
And went after her,

310
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,030
But I couldn't
save her.

311
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,700
And I watched
them...

312
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,840
[sighs]

313
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,970
As they broke
her neck.

314
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,170
Ray, I am so sorry.

315
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,780
Anna was supposed
to be the last
woman I ever kissed.

316
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,550
And she was,

317
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,580
Until suddenly
I was kissing you.

318
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
Hey!

319
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,670
What are you doing home?
I wanted the christmas
tree to be a surprise.

320
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,770
It's a surprise.

321
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,140
I thought since it was
just the two of us now,

322
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,410
Smaller the family,
bigger the tree.

323
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,980
What about Malcolm?

324
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,150
Thea, I know you saw him
in corto maltese.

325
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,290
[sighs] Ollie, we've
lost everyone. I--

326
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,620
Malcolm's the only
family I have left
besides you.

327
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,960
Thea, I deserve
to know what

328
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,400
You've been doing
with Malcolm Merlyn.

329
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,560
I've just been getting
to know him, that's all.

330
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,100
A couple
of months ago,
did you fly back

331
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
To Starling city
with him?

332
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,040
No!

333
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,800
Ollie, if I was back
in Starling city,

334
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,740
Don't you think
I would have called you?

335
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,210
I was in corto maltese
since may.

336
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,010
Now will you please just...

337
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,410
Come upstairs and help me
find some more christmas stuff?

338
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,920
Ok.

339
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,290
[indistinct chatter]

340
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,030
[speaking Chinese]

341
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,600
[speaking Chinese]

342
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,040
What's
he saying?

343
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,140
He's trying to bribe us.

344
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,340
[speaking Chinese]

345
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,910
We want the vial
of omega you stole.

346
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,150
I don't know
what you're
talking about!

347
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,710
I didn't steal
anything!

348
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,020
Don't waste
your energy on lies.

349
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,250
We will get
the truth from you--

350
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,190
One way or the other.

351
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,760
My friend can be
very persuasive.

352
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,330
So, how are you?

353
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,200
Mmm. I'm great.

354
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,840
Work's great.
I--I've just
been really busy.

355
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,470
Something's happened.
What?

356
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,310
No. No,
nothing's happened.

357
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,910
It's Sara.

358
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,110
Isn't it?

359
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,180
When I mentioned her earlier,

360
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,350
You seemed so...Broken.

361
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,590
Mom,
Sara's fine.

362
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,260
She's just
being Sara.

363
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,130
There are few things
as powerful as
a mother's intuition.

364
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,330
You are hiding something.
I know it.

365
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,140
Just like I was the only
one who knew that Sara
didn't die on that boat.

366
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,870
I have this feeling
that I would see her again.

367
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,380
And right now,

368
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,350
That feeling...

369
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,150
Is gone.

370
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,990
She's dead...

371
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,660
Isn't she?

372
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,300
Sara, she was involved
with some very, very
dangerous people.

373
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,900
This has
to remain a secret,

374
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,630
At least until
we figure out
exactly what happened.

375
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,970
I don't understand.

376
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,540
Doesn't your father know?

377
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,740
If he knew
about Sara...

378
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,910
He couldn't take it.

379
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,250
And I can't lose
anyone else.

380
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,480
[all grunting and yelling]

381
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,630
[groaning]

382
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,240
Nyssa: Father.

383
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,710
It's nearly time.

384
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,180
Mr. Queen has not yet
presented the guilty?

385
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,820
Perhaps he believes
our threats are empty.

386
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,390
We must correct that belief.

387
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,020
Return to Starling city.

388
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,790
Be merciless.

389
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Teach Oliver Queen
we only ask but once.

390
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,870
Where you been?

391
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,140
I went
to see Thea.

392
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,570
She lied to me
again, but she
didn't kill Sara.

393
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,580
I looked her in
the eyes, Felicity.

394
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,540
These are eyes
that I have known
my entire life.

395
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,550
She could lie to me about
Merlyn and spending time
with him,

396
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,880
But she could
never do this.

397
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,520
Oliver, you are one
of the smartest men

398
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,490
I have ever known,
but you have a blind spot
when it comes to your family.

399
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,420
Not this time--

400
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,290
First your mother,
then your father,

401
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,790
And now Thea.
That's enough, diggle!

402
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,160
You know she lied
to you, Oliver!

403
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,230
Both of you, stop!

404
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,960
Oliver,

405
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,530
I can't imagine
how difficult

406
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,540
This must be for you,
but john is right.

407
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,240
Thea lied.
She lied about Merlyn!

408
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,480
I don't want to
believe that she can
do something like this.

409
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,520
Which is why you shouldn't be
the one asking the questions.

410
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,240
Thea Queen!

411
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,870
Where is
Malcolm Merlyn?

412
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,240
I don't know! Please,
please don't hurt me!

413
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,450
[both grunting]

414
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,590
Stay away from me
and my father!

415
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,930
[wind blowing]

416
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,640
Malcolm:
It's the strangest thing.

417
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,510
Thea just called

418
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,750
And said she was
attacked by the arrow.

419
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,190
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that,

420
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,260
Now would you, Oliver?

421
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,560
This was you.

422
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,330
You know, I figured

423
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,260
When I spared the man
who murdered my mother,

424
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,000
I would never
kill again.

425
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,670
[groaning and gasping]

426
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,870
I was wrong.

427
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,340
You might want
to reconsider.
Why?!

428
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,610
For Thea.

429
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,210
[cell phone vibrates]

430
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,210
Check your phone.

431
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,150
I can wait.

432
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,150
[groaning]

433
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,300
I don't think
you want the league
to see that.

434
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,430
And if you kill me,
they will.

435
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,000
This isn't her.

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,840
Have you ever
heard of a plant
called votura?

437
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,340
Grows in south america.
In fact, it thrives
in corto maltese,

438
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,080
Making the subject
extremely susceptible
to suggestion,

439
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,650
Or retaining no memory
of their actions.

440
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,720
I will tell Ra's this
was you, that Thea was
under your control.

441
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,660
And he will still kill her.
She fired the arrows.

442
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,990
You have given her
a death sentence.

443
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,960
No.

444
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,100
What I've done
is given you incentive.

445
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,200
To tell Ra's that
you killed Sara lance.

446
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,500
By right, you will be
given a trial by combat--

447
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,370
With Ra's.

448
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,910
His death will erase
any blood debt from his reign,

449
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,550
Including Thea's.

450
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,710
And yours.

451
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,220
[chuckles]

452
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,750
I have to be honest--

453
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,020
It was my concern that
the whole killing thing

454
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,950
Would have been
a dealbreaker for you.

455
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,890
But, uh, I'm gratified
to see that Thea

456
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,960
Is still sufficient
motivation.

457
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,270
Don't take too long
making up your mind.

458
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,970
Ra's isn't known
for his patience.

459
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,700
Thea was always so kind.

460
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,010
Kindest person
I've ever known.

461
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,010
My sister wasn't
born a killer.

462
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,550
Malcolm Merlyn
made her one,

463
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,120
And I let it happen.

464
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,020
No, you didn't.

465
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,920
When it comes to your family,
you always place the blame

466
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,650
On yourself,
but this is not your fault.

467
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,960
She's right, Oliver.
Throw Malcolm
in front of Ra's,

468
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,190
Let the league
sort this out.

469
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
Merlyn has a video.

470
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,130
He made contingencies.

471
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,230
Oliver, if you
fight Ra's al Ghul,

472
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,430
He'll kill you.

473
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,600
No, he won't.

474
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,540
During the undertaking,
Merlyn told me

475
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,740
That I couldn't win,

476
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,440
Because I didn't know
what I was fighting for.

477
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,880
Now I do.

478
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,380
I'm fighting for Thea.

479
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,720
He should have
confessed by now.

480
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,890
We have video
evidence of him
taking the vials.

481
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,030
He says he doesn't remember.

482
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,430
He's lying! You don't
do something like that

483
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,460
And not remember it!
There is a way.

484
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,230
I didn't think it
a possibility until now.

485
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,040
There's a drug.
It's called votura.

486
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,770
I've heard it makes
people extremely
susceptible to suggestion.

487
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,310
Like mind control?

488
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,010
Really,
that's a thing?

489
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,610
Those who get dosed
often have no memory

490
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,920
Of what they do
while under the influence.

491
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,690
Oh, great. All this
was for nothing?

492
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,390
Chien na wei
has the vile,

493
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,890
And we have no way
of finding her!

494
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,490
We've taken her inside man.

495
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,260
Finding her may not be
the problem at hand.

496
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,370
The problem could be
her finding us.

497
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,540
[speaking japanese]

498
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,740
Hello, mrs. Yamashiro.
Is your husband home?

499
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,380
[speaking japanese]

500
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,620
[yelling]
[speaking japanese]

501
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,980
Don't you dare
talk to my son!

502
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,420
Quaint house...

503
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,520
For a spy.

504
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,320
Except for these.

505
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,330
They belong to you,
don't they?

506
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,360
Tatsu, isn't it?

507
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,330
Beautiful blade.

508
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,870
[speaking japanese]

509
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,510
[both yelling]

510
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,660
Where is he?

511
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,930
You really think
my father,

512
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,860
The demon's head,
would travel all the way
from Nanda Parbat

513
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,930
Simply because you wished it?

514
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,930
Yes.

515
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,570
This way.

516
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,110
Kneel before
the demon's head.

517
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:19,260
You're just a boy.

518
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,640
Well, Mr. Queen,

519
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,800
You failed to protect
the city you love.

520
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,470
Now you'll watch it bleed.
Nobody

521
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
In my city
will die tonight.

522
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,610
Well.

523
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,280
There was only one way
to prevent that.

524
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,380
You were to produce
for me the one

525
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,190
Who killed
ta-er al-sahfer.

526
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,220
And yet
you've come alone.

527
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,790
Because it was me.

528
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,760
I killed Sara.

529
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,700
Why would you kill a woman
you once professed to love?

530
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,070
Because she
begged me to.

531
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,440
You lie.

532
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,980
It wasn't the first time
Sara chose death over
a life in the league.

533
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,480
And meeting you now,

534
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I can see why.

535
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,620
I should have Sarab cleave
your head from your shoulders.

536
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,120
Not for killing
my daughter's beloved,

537
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,420
But for thinking me a fool.

538
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,530
By league law,
I have the right

539
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,830
To challenge you to
a trial by combat.

540
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,500
It's been 67 years
since a man challenged me.

541
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,670
You covet death that much?

542
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,340
Do you accept?

543
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,250
Oh, yes.

544
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,600
[wind blowing]

545
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,500
I see the years
have done little
to dull your stubbornness.

546
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,870
Maseo...
My name is Sarab!

547
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,740
You told me once
a man cannot
live by two names.

548
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,410
And I don't.

549
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,110
Maseo is dead.

550
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,180
I am all that's left, Sarab.

551
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,580
A phantom.

552
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,220
After it happened,

553
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,860
You went
to Nanda Parbat.

554
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,090
I arrived the same year
as ta-er al-sahfer.

555
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,360
She was a great warrior.

556
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,170
You did not kill her.

557
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,470
When you face the demon,

558
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,040
It will be my duty
to bear witness.

559
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,840
I have no desire
to watch you die.

560
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,040
Under our code,

561
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,210
You have 12 hours
to settle your affairs.

562
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,950
The 13th hour,
be at this place.

563
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,190
This location is consecrated
ground for the league.

564
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,560
A place for the settlement
of blood debts--

565
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,530
If one survives the climb.

566
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,490
If you do.

567
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,560
See you
on the mountain.

568
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,940
Do you remember
how when the two
of you were little,

569
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,970
You'd play dress up?

570
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,410
One day I overheard
you and Sara.

571
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,340
[chuckles]
you were pretending

572
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,650
To be grown-up
versions of yourselves.

573
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,450
That day, you
and your sister,

574
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,350
You had your own
families.

575
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,490
Careers.

576
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,920
I was a cop, just like dad.

577
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,260
And Sara...

578
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,130
Was a doctor.

579
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,830
She wanted
to heal people.

580
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,900
She deserves
more than this.

581
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,680
Mom, can I tell you
something?

582
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,410
Whoever did this to Sara,

583
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,710
I am going to find them
no matter what it takes.

584
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,150
And I am going
to make them pay.

585
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,460
Then you
make them pay.

586
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,300
And you make them
suffer.

587
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,240
Thea: Looks good.

588
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,000
Man: That window
should be as good as new.

589
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,210
Thank you.

590
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,470
What happened
to the window?

591
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,010
Oh, god, you should
have seen it.

592
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,810
This bird went completely
hitchcock on the thing.

593
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,380
I vacuumed up
most the glass,

594
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,920
But I'd still watch your step.

595
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,380
I'll be
extra careful.

596
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,920
Are you ok?

597
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,420
Last time you had
that look on your face,

598
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,030
You told me dad
committed suicide.

599
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,890
You haven't
called him dad

600
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,230
Since you
found out
about Malcolm.

601
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,860
[exhales]

602
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,770
What's going on
with you, Ollie?

603
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,840
You think
you know who
Malcolm Merlyn is.

604
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,540
But there are
things that
I've discovered,

605
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,510
Years ago,
recently, that...

606
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,380
He doesn't
love you, Thea.

607
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,710
Because he's not
capable of it.

608
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,750
Ollie, please.

609
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,350
Don't.

610
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,520
Don't make me choose
between my father

611
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,760
And my brother.

612
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,460
I would never
make you choose.

613
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,760
You are my family.

614
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,170
There's nothing
that I won't do
to protect you.

615
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,870
What does that mean?

616
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,740
It means I love you,

617
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,450
No matter what.

618
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,190
Tatsu?

619
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,890
Akio! What happened here?

620
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,130
Oh, god, no.
No, no, no!

621
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,660
Akio, no!

622
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,300
Daddy!
Akio!

623
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,330
Akio, where is your mother?

624
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,200
The white-haired
woman! She took her!

625
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,410
Guess who
just designed
a microprocessor

626
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,180
With a specint score
just north of 9,000?

627
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,120
Ray...What are you doing

628
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,350
With Queen consolidated?
Why did you buy it?

629
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,850
Because it was
for sale.

630
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,820
My life is a little more
complicated than I let on.

631
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,660
Suffice it to say,
I have gotten very good
at keeping secrets,

632
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,560
Particularly
the kind of secrets
someone like you keeps.

633
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,970
Someone in pain.

634
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,700
Wasn't easy
for me to tell you
about anna.

635
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,400
You told me about anna,
but you didn't tell me the truth

636
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,470
About what it is you're doing.

637
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,510
So tell me, or I walk.

638
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,540
I can't tell you.

639
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,610
I have to show you.

640
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,520
The dawn
of the computer age,

641
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,590
Developers thought
the only way a machine

642
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,760
Could process information
as fast as a human brain

643
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,230
Was to build a mainframe
the size of texas.

644
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,830
But one developer
realized that
the only way

645
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,400
To reduce heat
and power consumption

646
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,870
Was to bring
the components
closer together.

647
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,400
Which meant
making them smaller.

648
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,140
But why stop
at computers?

649
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
What if it could
take other things,

650
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,610
Like, say, all of
the military-grade
technology

651
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,780
In applied sciences,

652
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,610
And make it smaller,
too? So small

653
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,080
That it can fit in
the palm of my hand.

654
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,720
I can help a lot
of people that way.

655
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,990
I don't understand.
This will help.

656
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,490
Whoa.

657
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,760
What is it?
Omac

658
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,560
Is a Queen consolidated

What are you going
to use it for?

663
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,140
To protect
the people
of this city.

664
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,450

to help me.

happening to me?

Oliver...

668
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,820
John, I have to do this.

00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,960
I know.

670
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,190
I'd just rather
die than let you
go it alone.

671
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,830
Not this time.

672
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,430
Take care of Thea.
Absolutely.

673
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,300
Felicity: I'm sorry.

674
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,770
Something came up...

675
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,810
No.

676
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,980
Let's give them
a minute.

677
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,750
So you're going?

678
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,890
Mm-hmm.

679
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,050
To Nanda Parbat?

680
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,290
No, it's a neutral site.

681
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,060
It'll be fine.
I'll come back.

682
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,500
Thea will be ok.

683
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,700
I wish that sounded
more convincing.

684
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,330
And I wish you
wouldn't go, but
I know you better,

685
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,500
So I'm not going
to ask you to stay.

686
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,570
I appreciate that.

687
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,470
But there is
one thing

688
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,780
I need
to ask you to do.

689
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,150
And you're not
going to want to.

690
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,950
Well, if it's you
asking, I'll do it.

691
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,380
Kill him.

692
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,290
You have to kill
Ra's al Ghul.

693
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
This is a duel...
Oliver,

694
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,760
With one of the most
dangerous men that has
ever walked the earth.

695
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,890
I wouldn't be doing it
if I didn't think I could win.

696
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,560
I don't doubt that.
I don't doubt that
you can beat him.

697
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,070
I am terrified that
you won't kill him.

698
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,470
Because that's not
who you are anymore.

699
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,170
And I am so afraid
that Ra's al Ghul

700
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,840
Is going to use
your humanity
against you.

701
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,450
Felicity,
I honestly don't know

702
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,110
If I'm a killer anymore.

703
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,250
But I do know two things--

704
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,850
The first is that...

705
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,750
Whoever I am,

706
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,160
I am someone that will
do whatever--whatever--

707
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,300
It takes to save my sister.

708
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,580
And the second thing?

709
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,690
I love you.

710
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,050
Remove your shirt.

711
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,650
This is custom.

712
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,920
Ra's al Ghul is not know
to be merciful.

713
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,490
But if there was a chance,

714
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,230
This will be your final
moment for it.

715
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,600
Choose your weapon.

716
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,680
Ra's al Ghul: I was
11 years old when
I killed my first man.

717
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,490
I remember the look
in his face

718
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,620
When the light went out
behind his eyes.

719
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,860
Such a sudden change,

720
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,760
Almost imperceptible,

721
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,800
Between life and death.

722
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,200
And I felt ashamed.

723
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
I had stolen
from that man

724
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,940
The most precious
gift of all--

725
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,370
Life.

726
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:38,540
But I also felt
something else--

727
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,380
Pride,

728
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,510
Because I had
taken up arms
against someone

729
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,980
Who sought to do ill
against my family.

730
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,560
And I realized what I had
done was necessary.

731
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,960
You see...

732
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,800
I had replaced evil
with death.

733
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,130
And that...

734
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,700
Is what the league
exists to do.

735
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,040
And I have killed several
thousand more men since then.

736
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,310
And the world
is better off for it.

I am envious of you.

You will see her
before I do.

743
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,560
Fight me, boy.

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:39,340

through with them.
