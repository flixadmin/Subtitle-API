1
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,870
Elodie: There are many stories of chivalry

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,290
where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress.

3
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,950
This is not one of them.

4
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,040
King Roderick: There it is.

5
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,290
Form up!

6
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,370
Let's kill the beast.

7
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,870
For glory! Hyah!

8
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,450
Be on guard.

9
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,330
Form the line!

10
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,950
Hold!

11
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,750
Floria: The last I could find.

12
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,910
Elodie: Did you take the tapestries into town like Father asked?

13
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,330
Floria: This morning.

14
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,540
We should take the furs too, and the drapes.

15
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,540
Not the drapes!

16
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,910
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

17
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,620
They serve a purpose.

18
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,540
Floria, our people are freezing.

19
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
And starving.

20
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,790
Who'd come this far north?

21
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,120
Floria: Elodie, why are they leaving?

22
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,330
Elodie: There's nothing left for them here, Floria.

23
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,870
man 1: I don't have enough. Please, I'm hungry.

24
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,410
woman 1: For food, join the line!

25
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,540
- man 2: Keep to one side.  - man 3: I'm starving.

26
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
All right then.

27
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,700
man 4: Get off! It's mine!

28
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,830
- Hey! Give me back my food.  - Get off of me, old man!

29
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,000
You've had enough!

30
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,290
woman 2: Share this with your sister. Go on.

31
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,750
- Could you see who it was?  - guard: A stranger, my lady.

32
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,080
They may take whatever wood they can carry.

33
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,620
- I'll see to it.  - Come on, Flor.

34
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,140
- woman 2: Move on.  - woman 3: Yes.

35
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
- man 5: Get in line.  - Give it to me.

36
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,660
- woman: I want to meet her first.  - Father?

37
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,250
You must be Elodie.

38
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,830
I am.

39
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,870
She will do.

40
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,540
- Red Priestess: We await your decision.  - Thank you, Your Holiness.

41
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,330
Please, this way.

42
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Father, what's happening?

43
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,330
Who is that?

44
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Stepmother?

45
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, what is it?

46
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,290
Lord Bayford: From the Queen of Aurea.

47
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
A proposal.

48
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,250
- Oh, my goodness.  - Lord Bayford: Huh...

49
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,500
- I have made a match.  - May I?

50
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,790
Lord Bayford: Uh-huh.

51
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,040
He is a prince.

52
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,870
A prince?

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,870
I know you've always wished to travel, as did your mother.

54
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,120
Go. See the world.

55
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,290
This man, he has a fleet of ships, carriages full of gold.

56
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,660
That's no reason to marry.

57
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,040
We need this.

58
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,910
Our stores are empty.

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
We will not make it to the thaw.

60
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,580
Your people need you.

61
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,290
Hey.

62
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,200
This is who we are.

63
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,000
sailor 1: Get to the port side.

64
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,790
sailor 2: Port side.

65
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,620
Elodie, what's the matter?

66
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Nothing.

67
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,410
Father says it's natural to be nervous

68
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,660
about meeting your new husband and his family.

69
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,790
They're strangers.

70
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea until Father sprang this on me.

71
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,250
sailor 1: Mind the lines.

72
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,790
Oh!

73
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,330
Are you crazy? What are you two doing up there?

74
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,040
Come down here.

75
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
Come on.

76
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,830
This is how you want your prince to meet you?

77
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,950
Scared, cold as a corpse.

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,200
Nose all drippy and wet.

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,660
What have I been telling you this entire trip?

80
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,580
- both: First impressions are everything.  - Hmm.

81
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,000
sailor 2: Come on, lift up.

82
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,120
sailor 3: Look at that.

83
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,750
I have good news, girls.

84
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,080
The captain informs me we approach Aurea's coastline.

85
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,080
It should be any time now.

86
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,290
Father.

87
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,870
What in the world?

88
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,290
Looks almost... almost like a...

89
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,450
A dragon.

90
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,290
It's okay.

91
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,810
Subtitle by Sailor420

92
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,810
Hope you enjoy the sub/show

93
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,700
Oh, my heavens.

94
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,950
It's magnificent.

95
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,500
My lords, my ladies,

96
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,120
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

97
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,950
The royal family is at prayer,

98
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
but word has been sent of your arrival.

99
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,040
In the meantime, your rooms have been made ready.

100
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,000
If you will follow me.

101
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,330
Floria: Is this a dream?

102
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,290
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

103
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,910
If you want these people to think we belong here,

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,160
you can't act so easily impressed.

105
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

106
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
I think I had a rather limited definition of wealthy.

107
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,450
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

108
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,120
A bath has been drawn

109
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,910
and supper has been carried hence.

110
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,540
At first light, I shall return to convey you

111
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,660
to meet His Royal Highness.

112
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

113
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,450
Lady Bayford: Floria, stop touching everything.

114
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,790
Is something wrong?

115
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,250
- I just hope he's kind.  - Hmm.

116
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,500
- And well-read.  - Yeah.

117
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Handsome.

118
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,330
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

119
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,700
She can use the time to settle in, as we all could.

120
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, indeed.

121
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,910
Come.

122
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,370
maid: M'lady.

123
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,660
Everyone's waiting.

124
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Ellie?

125
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,620
I can't sleep.

126
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,370
I still can't believe you're going to live here from now on.

127
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,410
You and me both.

128
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,120
I keep thinking, if only Mother were alive,

129
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,580
I could just talk to her about all of this.

130
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,160
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

131
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,330
She means well, even if she is a bit...

132
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,120
Exhausting?

133
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,330
It'll be fine. You'll see.

134
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,370
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

135
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,450
Queen Isabelle: What is your greatest strength?

136
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
Elodie: I always tell the truth, Your Majesty.

137
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Queen Isabelle: Some might call that a weakness.

138
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,160
Do you know your heart?

139
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,830
Elodie: I believe I do, Your Majesty.

140
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,040
Queen Isabelle: And what is it telling you now?

141
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,620
Queen Isabelle: Arise, Elodie.

143
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm Henry.

144
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,410
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

145
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,410
We all are.

146
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,040
My son understates our joy.

147
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,120
And if I may say so,

148
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,290
your father has understated your beauty.

149
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,500
I've never known my father to understate much of anything, Your Majesty.

150
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,660
I see she arrives with some wit.

151
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,080
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

152
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,620
And you must be Floria.

153
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,660
It seems even a harsh clime can grow the fairest flowers.

154
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,580
I love your castle.

155
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,040
I mean, I really love it.

156
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Like, a lot...

157
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Your Majesty.

158
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,450
You are to make yourself at home, child.

159
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,200
We elders have some trivial matters like weddings to attend to.

160
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,290
Lord Bayford: Yes...

161
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,290
Your correspondence made mention of some particulars

162
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,410
you wish to discuss in person.

163
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,330
- The two of us can confer in private.  - Yes.

164
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,620
It's nothing to bore our young people with.

165
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,950
They have a far more important task at hand.

166
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,950
They must get to know each other.

167
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Henry: Do you have any questions of me?

168
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,370
Elodie: Questions of what subject?

169
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,450
You may choose the subject.

170
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,700
What do you think about me?

171
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Pardon?

172
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,620
Well, you seem disinterested at best, which is your prerogative,

173
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,410
but I'd like to know if the person I'm being guilted into marrying

174
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,870
truly likes me or not.

175
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,540
If my attitude offends you, I do apologize. It was not my intent.

176
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,750
However, I was unaware that, um, you were being guilted into anything.

177
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,910
The land where I come from is exactly how your mother explained.

178
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,120
Harsh and barren.

179
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,080
This union will save us.

180
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,700
I've made my peace with it.

181
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,000
My happiness is a small price to pay for the future of my people.

182
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,790
Is something wrong?

183
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,370
It's just...

184
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,750
In the letter you sent in advance of your arrival, you sounded different.

185
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,540
Different. In what way?

186
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,620
Far more, um...

187
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,790
flowery.

188
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,450
Maybe that's because my stepmother dictated most of it

189
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,950
and my sister's idea was the heart...

190
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,450
- The heart.  - Mmm.

191
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,040
I thought it was some sort of provincial insignia.

192
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,700
You actually drew this?

193
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,080
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

194
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,040
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

195
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,620
That is very clever.

196
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,120
I used to make them for Floria when she was little.

197
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,580
- May I ask you another question?  - Certainly.

198
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,330
Do they always follow you so closely?

199
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,200
This is them giving me space.

200
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,870
That must be tiring.

201
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,450
It is, actually.

202
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,540
I saw some horses being left unattended at the stables.

203
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,450
Do you ride?

204
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,580
Elodie: Hyah!

205
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,410
- Where did you learn to ride like that?  - My mother.

206
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,120
Which way now?

207
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,290
Well, depends on what you want to see.

208
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everything.

209
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,580
Very well.

210
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened in there?

211
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
Speak already.

212
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,160
- Is the wedding still on?  - Aye.

213
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,580
You settled on a fair bride price?

214
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,120
More gold than I could ever imagine.

215
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,290
Then why do you look so?

216
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,950
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

217
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me, you didn't say anything to embarrass us.

218
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,040
No, I did not.

219
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,950
Because it's very important that our two families get along.

220
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

221
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,870
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

222
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,330
I saw something, high on the mountain last night.

223
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,950
Torches.

224
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,160
You saw that?

225
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,410
I couldn't sleep.

226
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,120
It was an ancient ceremony.

227
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Or rather, one of three.

228
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,540
They're very significant to my family.

229
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um...

230
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,620
They honor our ancestors.

231
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,330
That's why my mother chose these dates for our wedding.

232
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,700
Elodie: It is quite beautiful.

233
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,830
Henry: Yes, I suppose.

234
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,410
I really don't have anything else to compare it to.

235
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,120
May I confide in you something?

236
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Yes.

237
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,790
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

238
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,580
Really set out and see it, you know?

239
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,370
I do, actually.

240
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,830
It's my life's dream.

241
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,700
For as long as I can remember, I've longed to explore the distant lands.

242
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,200
The ones you only read about.

243
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,160
Perhaps, one day, we will.

244
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,290
Perhaps.

245
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,450
woman: And the orange in this area.

246
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,000
Lady Bayford: Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

247
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,660
Well, I'm glad you approve.

248
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,120
Very elegant.

249
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,750
You have impeccable taste.

250
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,330
Everything is just so exquisite.

251
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm sorry, is there something I can help you with?

252
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,750
I just thought we might become better acquainted,

253
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,700
seeing as we're about to be family.

254
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,330
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

255
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,410
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

256
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,200
The finest in the city.

257
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,950
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

258
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

259
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,870
Nor place undue import

260
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,700
on what is ultimately a transaction born of necessity.

261
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh... "Necessity"?

262
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,200
Well, your family needs money.

263
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,450
My family needs a bride.

264
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,790
What we don't need is more family.

265
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,580
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

266
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,000
- I merely...  - Elodie.

267
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Pardon?

268
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,410
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

269
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I said.

270
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,290
Good day, Lady Bayford.

271
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,410
It's perfect.

272
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,830
Everything in here is so perfect.

273
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Elodie: Stepmother.

274
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,250
Is something the matter?

275
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Elodie,

276
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,040
I know we haven't always been close,

277
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,790
but I need you to listen to me now.

278
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,620
This wedding... is a mistake.

279
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
What?

280
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,450
I don't understand.

281
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,950
These people, I don't trust them.

282
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,040
It's hard to explain, but a mother knows these things.

283
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,250
Only yesterday, you were enamored by this place.

284
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,330
Floria.

285
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,450
I was wrong.

286
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,750
They may be royalty, but that doesn't make them good people.

287
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Elodie: Well...

288
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,200
- What does Father think?  - He refuses to talk about it.

289
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,450
And when I try to tell him my worries, he snaps at me.

290
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,250
- Because you're being unreasonable.  - That's enough, Flor.

291
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,000
Elodie, I swear that I only want what's best for you.

292
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,000
Am I interrupting something?

293
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,750
No.

294
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Just...

295
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,000
girl talk.

296
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,410
Well, tomorrow's a big day, and these girls, they need their rest.

297
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,120
Think about what I said. There's still time.

298
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Time for what?

299
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,040
Lady Bayford: I hope you know what you're doing.

300
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,910
Good night, my angels.

301
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,700
- Good night, Father.  - Good night, Father.

302
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,910
Good night.

303
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Floria: Wow.

304
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,580
priest: You may kiss the bride.

305
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,450
I present my son and new daughter, Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

306
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,160
Goodbye, Father.

307
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,830
I hope I'm half as beautiful someday as you are today.

308
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,250
Twice as beautiful.

309
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,290
- I love you.  - I love you.

310
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey! Hey, hey!

311
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,120
Elodie: Where are we going?

312
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,410
Henry: Remember I told you about those ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

313
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,330
Elodie: Yes.

314
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,330
Henry: We're going to pay homage to my ancestors.

315
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,660
Welcome, Princess.

316
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,080
For generations, it has been our task, our duty,

317
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,500
to protect our people.

318
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,080
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

319
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,450
So, tonight,

320
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:22,040
you join a long line of women who have helped to build this kingdom.

321
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,950
When our ancestors first lay claim to this island,

322
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,200
they found they were not its sole inhabitants.

323
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,450
A creature dwelt here first.

324
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,080
The last of its kind.

325
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
With savage bloodlust,

326
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,750
the beast left its lair and set upon the village.

327
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,160
So the king gathered his soldiers to avenge his people.

328
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,370
But their steel was no match for the monster,

329
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,790
and each man met his end.

330
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,040
Each save one.

331
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,500
For the king, the beast had a far worse fate in store.

332
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,160
Give up his three beloved daughters and the island could be shared.

333
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,620
A cruel torture.

334
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,790
He adored his daughters,

335
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,040
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

336
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,500
And so, a pact was made.

337
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,950
The three princesses met their end in the belly of the beast,

338
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,620
and a kingdom was born.

339
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,910
It is this sacrifice we commemorate every generation.

340
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,410
A tradition going back centuries.

341
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,080
Your hand, child.

342
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,700
A legacy of honor and duty you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

343
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,450
Let our two lines mingle and fast become one.

344
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,370
She is now of royal blood.

345
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,580
To ensure that our kingdom thrives forevermore,

346
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,790
pay your due to the realm.

347
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,200
Toss the coin into the chasm.

348
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,040
The ceremony is now complete.

349
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,910
You may make your return.

350
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,580
I'm supposed to carry you back.

351
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
I'm fine with walking, really.

352
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,870
Floria would love this part.

353
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,910
Close your eyes.

354
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,120
I've got you.

355
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
I'm sorry.

356
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,790
Elodie screams: No!

357
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,620
Help me!

358
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,290
Help!

359
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,500
Is anyone there?!

360
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,000
That's not mine.

361
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,660
I am the sacrifice.

362
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,580
I am the sacrifice?

363
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,700
You poor thing.

364
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,040
What happened to you?

365
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,500
Give me strength, Mother.

366
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,700
dragon: Mother?

367
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,120
dragon: Your name, little bird?

368
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,330
Speak your name.

369
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,200
Elodie.

370
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,330
El-o-die.

371
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,370
Exciting.

372
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,410
What do you want?

373
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,330
I want... what is promised.

374
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,870
What is owed.

375
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,040
Every generation, your kind must pay.

376
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,750
My kind?

377
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,160
The scent of royalty betrays you.

378
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,250
It's in your blood.

379
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,620
Now, my favorite part.

380
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,370
Run.

381
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,870
dragon: Did I hurt you?

382
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,450
Quiet now?

383
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,450
A clever one.

384
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,540
The last one was over so quick.

385
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,040
No.

386
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,950
Mother wanted you to fight.

387
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,870
No. No.

388
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,040
Lord Bayford: He is a prince.

389
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,950
Queen Isabelle: They must get to know each other.

390
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,790
Henry: My greatest wish is to go see the world.

391
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,790
Elodie: Perhaps, one day we will.

392
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
One for the dress.

393
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,500
Don't worry.

394
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,290
I won't hurt you.

395
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,450
Almost caught you, little bird.

396
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:41,660
You hide now, like all the others.

397
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,830
It makes no difference.

398
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,290
This story always ends the same.

399
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
Elodie: V.

400
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,200
Victoria.

401
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,790
Beatrice.

402
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:43,830
Artemis.

403
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,660
Genevive.

404
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,620
Fatima.

405
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,700
Carlotta.

406
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,410
How many?

407
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,120
Did anyone make it out?

408
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,620
Please, don't.

409
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,580
Somebody...

410
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
It's a lie.

411
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,120
Get off.

412
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,120
I'm deeply sorry...

413
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,830
for underestimating you.

414
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,620
A map.

415
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,540
Now, where am I?

416
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
A tree.

417
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:13,080
The entrance cave.

418
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,660
Following down into the bird cave.

419
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,790
Through the twisted tunnel...

420
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,620
reaching water.

421
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,200
The glowworm cave.

422
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,870
Keep following down.

423
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,410
I am here.

424
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,410
How do I escape?

425
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,790
Is this it?

426
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,950
Did a princess make it out?

427
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,660
Three ways. Take the middle fork.

428
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,790
Music note.

429
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,290
Crystals.

430
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,790
Go on.

431
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,040
And then... I am free.

432
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,540
The middle fork.

433
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,370
Music.

434
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,580
Crystals.

435
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,450
This is it.

436
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,290
Wish me luck.

437
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,040
You made it out.

438
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,580
No!

439
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,540
dragon: Elodie.

440
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,160
Fly, little bird.

441
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,950
Hello.

442
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,120
Hello!

443
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,540
I'm here! Help!

444
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,790
Help!

445
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Hello!

446
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,910
There is no way out, Princess.

447
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,580
Not for any of you.

448
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,870
Three were taken.

449
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,370
Three must be given.

450
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,700
man: Elodie!

451
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,160
dragon: What's this?

452
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,870
man: Elodie!

453
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,160
Elodie!

454
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
Move on.

455
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,910
I've done what you paid for, milord. I'll just wait up top.

456
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,660
You'll do no such thing.

457
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,910
I hired you to guide us to her.

458
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,330
No one leaves here without my daughter.

459
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,660
man 2: Elodie!

460
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,870
Elodie!

461
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,700
Queen Isabelle: A creature dwelt here first.

462
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,500
The last of its kind.

463
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,950
It's a lie.

464
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,790
Three taken.

465
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,080
Slay the vile young.

466
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,620
Form the line!

467
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,040
Please, spare me.

468
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,870
Show mercy.

469
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,080
I will give you anything.

470
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,290
dragon: Death is not enough for you.

471
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,120
You will know my pain.

472
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,620
man 1: Elodie!

473
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,000
Elodie!

474
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:40,200
Elodie!

475
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,910
Elodie!

476
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,910
Be quiet. She can hear you.

477
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,000
I warned you. It's too late. The beast lurks in its lair.

478
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,330
- It's surely taken her there to devour...  - This lair. Where is it?

479
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:01,040
Sir, your daughter's been down here nigh on too long.

480
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,200
She's almost certainly been killed.

481
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,910
man 2: Elodie!

482
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:11,040
I'm told some have tried to hunt the beast.

483
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
For its blood.

484
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:15,790
Nonsense.

485
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,950
Why are you here?

486
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,750
I'm here for my daughter.

487
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,120
Father.

488
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,750
Father.

489
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:10,750
Please.

490
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,250
I beg of you.

491
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,500
It's not my mercy that you should seek.

492
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,250
Call her.

493
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,290
She's alive?

494
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,750
Elodie's still alive?

495
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,950
I smell her.

496
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,040
Hiding.

497
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,910
Watching.

498
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,080
Call her.

499
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,080
No.

500
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,200
Call her.

501
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,450
Elodie.

502
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:08,910
Can you hear me?

503
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:19,040
I have... I have made a horrible, horrible mistake.

504
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:23,910
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.

505
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:27,120
To trade your life

506
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,450
for the good of my people.

507
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,410
I thought that I could take the gold.

508
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,750
That I could live with myself.

509
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,450
My choice.

510
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,410
But I can't.

511
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,620
I can't.

512
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,040
dragon: Tell her to come to you.

513
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,750
Last chance.

514
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:15,250
Elodie. Hear me.

515
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:20,200
I am your father. You will obey me.

516
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:23,160
I order you.

517
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,080
Do not come out!

518
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,540
No.

519
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:37,790
No!

520
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,790
Ellie.

521
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:40,950
Use the ropes.

522
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,700
Your stepmother and Floria,

523
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,620
they wait for you at the ship.

524
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,330
Forgive me.

525
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,000
Go! Go! Go!

526
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,950
Go.

527
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:46,040
That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.

528
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,620
- Where are you going?  - To fix this.

529
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,950
- guard 1: Stop.  - guard 2: Stand back.

530
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,450
Elodie.

531
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,540
soldier: Open up!

532
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,330
Get out of the way!

533
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:45,000
Get out!

534
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,950
Seize her.

535
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,290
You can't!

536
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:55,160
- No! She's just a child!  - Floria: No!

537
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,790
You promised us a daughter.

538
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,080
- Stepmother!  - No!

539
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,580
Floria!

540
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Elodie.

541
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,080
Stepmother.

542
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,290
- Elodie.  - Stepmother.

543
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,750
Lady Bayford: Oh!

544
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,000
Thank God.

545
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,540
Are you all right?

546
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:13,620
I can manage.

547
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:15,950
Where's Floria?

548
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,870
They took her to the caves in your place.

549
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:21,000
I tried to stop them from taking your sister.

550
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,290
I have to save her.

551
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:24,870
No, I'll go. I can find her.

552
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:26,080
It may be too late.

553
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,040
No.

554
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,160
Not if I can help it.

555
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,660
Your father...

556
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,790
Go.

557
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,330
Please. Let me go!

558
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:49,540
Please let me go.

559
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:52,250
No, don't do this.

560
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,620
Mother, enough! She's too young.

561
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,830
A prince protects his kingdom, without hesitation or complaint.

562
01:21:58,910 --> 01:21:59,950
Give me your hand.

563
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,080
I cannot do this. She's just a child.

564
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,790
You're weak.

565
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:09,410
No! Please don't do this to me!

566
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,620
Get off of me!

567
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,910
Let go! Off of me!

568
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,160
Throw her in.

569
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,160
Floria!

570
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,540
Floria!

571
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,910
Floria!

572
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,790
Elodie: I'm coming for you, Flor.

573
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,700
dragon: My little ones...

574
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,330
They did not let you live.

575
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,950
Nor shall I let Elodie.

576
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,580
Your sister will come for you.

577
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,790
There she is now.

578
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,790
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?

579
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,580
Wake up!

580
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,370
We need to hurry.

581
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,500
Floria!

582
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,160
Ellie.

583
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,500
Elodie, you're alive.

584
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,950
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.

585
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,200
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.

586
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,120
We don't have time, Flor.

587
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,700
No, no, no. Not yet.

588
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:34,830
What now?

589
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,330
You have to hide quickly.

590
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:37,580
What about you?

591
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,120
I must tell her the truth.

592
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,200
Come on.

593
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:59,120
Where are you hiding?

594
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,540
Elodie softly: Dragon.

595
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,160
dragon: That won't kill me,

596
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:14,620
but it will make me angry.

597
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,950
Good.

598
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,620
I'm angry too.

599
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,040
We have both been lied to.

600
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,620
They said you set upon their village.

601
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,040
That the king came only to defend his people.

602
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,700
He came unprovoked.

603
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,290
I know what they did.

604
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,500
I know they killed your children.

605
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,580
"They"? You!

606
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,120
Your kind, your blood.

607
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,040
No!

608
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,870
My daughters were the last of my line.

609
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:53,080
So, I will take their daughters until my final breath.

610
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:57,000
Except you haven't. We are not their daughters.

611
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,750
More lies.

612
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,620
Ellie!

613
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:56,790
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

614
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,500
I am not one of them!

615
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,910
I smell it in your blood.

616
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:23,410
El-o-die.

617
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:28,040
Accept your fate...

618
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
as I have mine.

619
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,700
We are to die alone.

620
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,330
No.

621
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,870
I have an army with me.

622
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:04,410
Every innocent woman whose life was stolen down here.

623
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:10,950
Your kind were never innocent.

624
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,370
Then go ahead.

625
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,200
Show me your fire.

626
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,120
Well?

627
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:33,750
What are you waiting for?

628
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:37,950
Burn me.

629
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:41,620
Burn me!

630
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,200
My sister had this too.

631
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,750
All of us did.

632
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,870
That is how they make us royal.

633
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,450
That is the blood you smell.

634
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,120
They fooled you.

635
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,450
You've been killing innocent daughters just like they did.

636
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:24,540
Then, end it.

637
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,040
No.

638
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,000
I'm through doing what I'm told.

639
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,040
Elodie.

640
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,540
You must believe me. I haven't slept a moment since...

641
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:31,450
Since you tried to kill my sister?

642
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:33,950
Henry: I had no choice.

643
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,000
Don't you dare explain yourself to this...

644
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,660
this commoner.

645
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:44,580
Is she to be the third?

646
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,040
Princess number three.

647
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:52,250
She's the last, and then I'll be free to marry whoever I...

648
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,000
That's enough, Henry.

649
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:57,370
You know nothing of what we've endured.

650
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,290
You know nothing of our story.

651
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,000
Take your family

652
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:13,160
and run.

653
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,540
man: Come. Let's go.

654
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:21,830
I will offer you all one last chance to do the same.

655
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:30,330
No?

656
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,750
You insolent creature.

657
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,540
You think we ought to fear you now?

658
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:39,950
Why?

659
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:43,750
Because you somehow managed to escape the dragon?

660
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:49,700
It's not me you should fear.

661
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:54,290
This is the end of your story.

662
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:56,370
woman: Run!

663
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,410
- woman: It's the dragon!  - man: Run!

664
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:42,830
No!

665
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:31,120
sailor 1: Someone give me a hand with this barrel.

666
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,870
sailor 2: Let's be sharp there, lads.

667
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:35,120
Lady Bayford: You can't be serious.

668
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,080
Elodie: But I am.

669
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,910
We'll run it together.

670
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,580
We've got a bounty of supplies.

671
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,040
Enough to get us through this freeze and the next.

672
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,160
Oh, Elodie.

673
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,450
You're the only person I trust to look after our people, Mother.

674
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:56,500
Can I help too?

675
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,790
Floria.

676
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,790
I'm counting on it.

677
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,540
Floria: Stepmother. Stepmother, come and see this.

678
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,200
Lady Bayford: Oh, wide heavens!

679
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:19,450
sailor: My lady, what course shall we steer?

680
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Home.

681
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:28,160
♫  Love is a burning thing  ♫

682
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:35,580
♫  It makes a fiery ring  ♫

683
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,620
♫  Bound by wild desire  ♫

684
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:48,620
♫  I fell into a ring of fire  ♫

685
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:57,450
♫  I fell into a burning ring of fire  ♫

686
01:41:57,540 --> 01:42:01,410
♫  I went down, down, down  ♫

687
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:04,790
♫  And the flames went higher  ♫

688
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:09,330
♫  And it burns, burns, burns  ♫

689
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:11,910
♫  The ring of fire  ♫

690
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,330
♫  The ring of fire  ♫

691
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:35,620
♫  The taste of love is sweet  ♫

692
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:42,750
♫  When hearts like ours meet  ♫

693
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:49,870
♫  I fell for you like a child  ♫

694
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:57,250
♫  Oh, but the fire went wild  ♫

695
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:05,700
♫  I fell into a burning ring of fire  ♫

696
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:09,330
♫  I went down, down, down  ♫

697
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:12,790
♫  And the flames went higher  ♫

698
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:17,410
♫  And it burns, burns, burns  ♫

699
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,080
♫  The ring of fire  ♫

700
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,700
♫  The ring of fire  ♫
