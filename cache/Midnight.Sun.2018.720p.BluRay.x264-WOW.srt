
1
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,387
<i>I have this reoccurring dream.</i>

2
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:03,187
<i>I'm a little girl sitting with my mom,
and she's singing to me.</i>

3
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,790
<i>I feel the warmth of the sun
on my skin</i>

4
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:09,147
<i>and the comfort of her arms
around me.</i>

5
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:12,228
<i>And I wanna stay there.</i>

6
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:14,435
<i>Forever.</i>

7
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,627
<i>When I wake up,
I miss the dream.</i>

8
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,789
<i>I want so badly
for this dream to be real,</i>

9
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,151
<i>but that would be impossible</i>

10
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:27,467
<i>because my mom died
when I was really little.</i>

11
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:30,987
<i>And I can't go out in the sun.
Like, at all.</i>

12
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,465
<i>I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,</i>

13
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:40,710
<i>or XP, which basically means a
severe sensitivity to sunlight.</i>

14
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,835
<i>If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,</i>

15
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:48,393
<i>my brain starts to fail, and I could die.
Pretty fun, right?</i>

16
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:52,784
<i>So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,</i>

17
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,551
<i>hanging out with my dad,
who is the best dad ever.</i>

18
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>Thank goodness,
because growing up,</i>

19
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,835
<i>kids were, uh,
what you'd expect.</i>

20
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,907
- No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

21
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:05,788
That's why they have special windows.

22
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,947
Don't worry.
She can't get us during the day.

23
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:11,552
But at night,
stay far, far away.

24
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,786
<i>But not everyone was afraid of me.</i>

25
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,387
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

26
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,865
She has something called XP.

27
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,869
Basically, the light
from the sun, it hurts her.

28
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,874
So she can't ever go in the sun.

29
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,272
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

30
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,065
Can she play at night?

31
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,115
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight!

32
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,908
Oh! And I like pizza!

33
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:46,874
<i>From that point on it was me,
Morgan, and my dad.</i>

34
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,788
<i>Until one day</i>

35
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,872
<i>I saw Charlie, and that was it.</i>

36
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,869
<i>I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.</i>

37
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,629
Stupid tree.

38
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,305
<i>I saw him every day.
And yet,</i>

39
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,667
<i>he had no idea I even existed.</i>

40
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:08,394
<i>Over time, watching Charlie go
by just became a part of my routine.</i>

41
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,950
<i>Along with
constant doctor appointments,</i>

42
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:16,545
<i>sleeping during the day,
and staying up all night, which,</i>

43
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,073
<i>from what I've heard,
is the schedule of most teenagers,</i>

44
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,627
<i>and playing music
every chance I get.</i>

45
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:27,069
<i>All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.</i>

46
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,986
<i>But I still hold on
to my dreams.</i>

47
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,914
Stupid tree.

48
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:34,386
<i>No matter how impossible
they may seem.</i>

49
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,155
<i>Jeremy Pierce.</i>

50
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,786
- <i>Kendall Porter.</i>
- Congratulations.

51
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,355
<i>Peter Rathbard.</i>

52
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,065
<i>Charles Reed.</i>

53
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,869
Congratulations, Charlie.

54
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:16,670
Katie Price!

55
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,110
What are you wearing?

56
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:26,673
Oh. Cap and gown. Huh?
The faculty and staff always wear one.

57
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,954
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:31,988
Most importantly,
this is for you.

59
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,032
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

60
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:37,506
I assume as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared? Yes?

61
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:38,705
Um...

62
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,113
Yes.

63
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:43,635
That's me putting on my glasses.

64
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,275
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,515
Um, first, I would like
to thank my headmaster.

66
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:49,635
Well, I mean, really.

67
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,434
- My Spanish teacher.
- <i>De nada.</i>

68
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:54,673
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

69
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:57,475
But I really wanna state for
the record that my gym teacher

70
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,872
- had absolutely no idea what he was doing.
- What?

71
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,675
Oh, you suck!
I lift weights.

72
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:04,871
Hey, this is for you.

73
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,071
This is one of the lamest
things I've ever seen.

74
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,515
Yes! Ha-ha! I had to go to three
stores to find something this lame.

75
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,190
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst!

76
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:22,865
All right.
Are you ready for your present?

77
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:26,251
- There's a present involved?
- Oh, there's a present, yes!

78
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,931
Of course there's a present.
It's graduation.

79
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,395
This keeps getting
better and better.

80
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,111
This is Mom's.

81
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,629
Look, I know it's kind of old,

82
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,595
so if you want a newer one
I totally understand.

83
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,235
No! I love it. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

84
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:07,595
You look just like your mother.

85
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,554
Lucky you. She was hot.

86
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,391
Ew.

87
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:14,990
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

88
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:55,831
Ooh.

89
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,264
That's a good one.

90
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,553
Uh, something weird
is going on right here.

91
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,715
Hey, Dad, um,

92
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:08,628
I was wondering if I could go
play my new beautiful present

93
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,115
at the train station tonight?

94
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:13,705
It's 10:00.

95
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,771
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

96
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,947
Morgan's busy with her family,
and, Dad, I love playing for you.

97
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,789
I really do,
but I also need to get used to

98
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:24,827
playing in front of
other people, too.

99
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:26,384
Please, please, please.

100
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,155
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

101
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:30,386
And I graduated today!

102
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:33,827
Isn't that the American tradition,
to extend my curfew?

103
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:39,555
Okay, I'll extend your curfew one hour.

104
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,275
Which means midnight,
okay? Hey.

105
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:44,571
And text me right when you get there,
or I'm not just gonna call Fred,

106
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,091
I'm actually gonna come down there.
And it will be so embarrassing,

107
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,869
it will become urban legend on why
kids should stick to their curfew!

108
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:51,071
I love you.

109
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,145
Oh.

110
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,705
- Hey, don't do that thing.
- What thing?

111
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,594
That. I mean, you look all sad
and it makes me sad.

112
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,073
Please just chug this beer
and come hang out!

113
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,908
Dude, you dodged a bullet, man.

114
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:27,874
You were gonna be up at the ass
crack of dawn every morning,

115
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,186
taking tests,
nowhere near the beach.

116
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,669
And now, we get to do this

117
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,670
our whole lives.

118
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:35,708
Mmm. I forgot, doing this
our whole lives,

119
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:38,355
it's way better than
a full ride to Berkeley.

120
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,266
Zoe Carmichael.
Three o'clock.

121
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,105
Charlie. You're in trouble.

122
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,595
What did I do this time?

123
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:48,870
You didn't get me a drink.

124
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:50,635
I did not know you were thirsty.

125
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,991
Now you do.

126
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:55,228
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

127
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,675
Is that the bad one?

128
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,626
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

129
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:03,746
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

130
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:06,745
I also have some extra time for you.
And I'm not swimming.

131
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,075
You were never swimming, idiot.

132
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,590
- Zoe! Get over here, bitch!
- Hold on!

133
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,251
You're coming to
my graduation party, right?

134
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,595
Yeah, I think so.

135
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:15,675
Good.

136
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,515
Yeah!

137
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,070
Uh, what are you doing?

138
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:23,831
Dodging another bullet.

139
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,266
Come on, dude.
It's our graduation night.

140
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:29,234
I'm not feeling it, boys.
I'll see you later.

141
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,545
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

142
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:38,545
Hey-yo, Fred.

143
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,291
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you tonight.

144
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:42,625
What, and disappoint
all my fans?

145

Why are you packing up?
Where are you going?

Um, home. I gotta go home.

Home?
Wait, you live here?

156
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,993
- Wait, you didn't go to Purdue High.
- No.

157

00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,232
Um, and I graduated today,
and my dad's a super big worrier.

159
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,749
So, I really gotta...

160
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:14,951
Oh, God.

161
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:20,464
Um...

162
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:22,110
I have to go.

163
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,470
Wait! Wait!
Whoa. What...

164
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:26,713
I'm sorry, why are you...
What's the rush? What...

165
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:30,067
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

166
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,835
- Your cat?
- Yeah, it died.

167
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:38,472
- So, you're not in a rush then, right?
- No, no, I am.

168
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:40,274
I have to plan the funeral

169
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:43,666
for my, um, dead cat that died.

170
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,634
Yeah, it's super dead.

171
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,074
Wait! Wait! Wait!

172
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,029
I didn't even get your name!

173
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,811
You haven't noticed any changes in her?

174
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,731
- Motor functions still seem strong?
- Yeah.

175
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:15,668
Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

176
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,953
uh, no difficulty
swallowing or talking.

177
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,549
Believe me on that.

178
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,787
And, uh, no corneal ulcerations.

179
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,869
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

180
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,469
Any exposure to sunlight?

181
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,274
No.
Of course not.

182
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,555
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time.

183
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,269
But she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

184
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:40,627
Yeah, well, you know teenagers.

185
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,354
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

186
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,394
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

187
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,931
It's not gonna fall
into remission.

188
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:50,675
And every year,
the risk becomes more serious for her.

189
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,155
So, if she's exposed to even the
slightest bit of sunlight...

190
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,311
She won't be.

191
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:56,931
She's reached that age
we talked about.

192
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,025
She won't be.

193
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,109
Any word on the, uh,
University of Washington study?

194
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,313
I submitted Katie's name
for their Phase Two trials,

195
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:08,749
if it even gets that far.

196
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:10,430
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

197
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:11,915
Research funding
being what it is,

198
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:15,352
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

199
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,507
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

200
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:26,909
A cat funeral?

201
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,227
Please stop saying it out loud.

202
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:34,309
No, I... I mean, I've heard that
dead pets can actually be an aphrodisiac.

203
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,751
Morgan! What should I have said?

204
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,270
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

205
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:41,392
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price.

206
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,531
"I've watched you outside my
window for the past 10 years,

207
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,433
"and I've been in love with you,
stalking you

208
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,251
- "every minute of the day"?
- Okay, don't start with that.

209
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:50,268
Or, how about, "Hey,
you may remember me from kindergarten,

210
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,028
"when everyone
called me a vampire."

211
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:53,475
No one remembers that.

212
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,704
- Oh, what did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

213
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,310
I feel so stupid and lame.

214
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,952
Mmm. Well, at least you have M&M's. So.

215
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,555
Thanks.

216
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,344
Look, you're just gonna
make up for it next time.

217
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,074
There's not gonna be
a next time.

218
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:14,112
- You don't know that.
- I do.

219
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:17,346
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

220
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,028
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

221
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:20,995
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it.

222
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:22,595
What?

223
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:23,995
Oh, no, no.

224
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:27,514
- Oh, come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's happening?

225
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,011
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

226
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,788
Your notebook-notebook? No.

227
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,548
I think I left it
at the train station.

228
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:33,635
Oh, God.

229
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,115
Can you please go get it for me?

230
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,471
Morgan, it's so important.
Please?

231
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,674
You know I would but there's

232
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:42,714
a few other popping cat funerals
I was gonna hit tonight.

233
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,348
No, no, not by the corner!

234
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:56,995
Hey.

235
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:58,915
My friend's
been looking for that.

236
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,668
Do you know her? Oh, wait...

237
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,625
Morgan, right?
We had, uh, English class together.

238
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,435
- I'm Charlie.
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

239
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:08,628
And it was History class.

240
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,811
But how do you know her?
Did she just move here or something?

241
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:11,985
Notebook first.

242
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:15,227
Or you could just tell me where she lives,
and I could drop it off.

243
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:17,585
I have a better idea.

244
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,331
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

245
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:26,471
Fred has it.

246
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,512
Okay, text me when you get there
and be careful.

247
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,235
Fred?

248
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:45,191
Holy pregnant cow.

249
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:46,550
Oh, my God.

250
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:49,785
Thank you.

251
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:56,187
- Purdue Creamery.
- Morgan?

252
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,346
Hey. How's your second date?

253
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,755
How could you do this to me?

254
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,155
Oh, my God, I'm in sweatpants.

255
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,875
My hair, it's a mess.
It's tied.

256
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,073
Oh, my God, I look like an idiot.

257
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,624
Oh, please.
Katie, you're super-freaking-hot.

258
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,211
I can't even see you right now,
and I can tell you look gorgeous.

259
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:12,988
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large, uh...

260
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,634
Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

261
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,869
He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

262
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:21,311
<i>Just try to be yourself.
Don't ramble too much.</i>

263
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:22,715
And call me afterwards?

264
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:25,515
Bye.

265
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,829
Oh, my... Uh...

266
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:35,755
Uh...

267
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,470
Wow, you exist.

268
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:49,310
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

269
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,151
Were you in
the REM stage of sleep?

270
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,232
- Wha...
- That's when most dreams happen, actually.

271
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,794
Yeah. Your, uh... Your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

272
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,107
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

273
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:06,075
It looks super weird.
It's like a typewriter or something.

274
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,275
Anyway, thank you for...

275
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,665
Wait, I, uh...
I still don't know your name.

276
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,230
Oh.

277
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:13,835
It's Katie.

278
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,391
Katie, I'm Charlie.

279
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,588
Wow, that's a weird name.

280
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,873
Thank God you told me it
'cause I wouldn't have known it otherwise.

281
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,115
- Wha...
- Thank you.

282
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,385
Wait. What...

283
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,625
You didn't...

284
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,629
You didn't read through it,
did you?

285
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:32,911
- I... Just a little.
- What?

286
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:34,105
- What?
- Are you serious?

287
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,891
- You read through my journal?
- Look, I...

288
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,067
This could have been a diary.
I mean, it is, kind of.

289
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:41,034
I'm really sorry.

290
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:42,754
You left really quick
the other night,

291
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,411
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

292
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,835
so I just looked
through it quickly.

293
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,115
But I like that
you still handwrite things.

294
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,073
It's cool. It's old-school.

295
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,191
Thanks. For finding it.

296
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,315
Yeah.

297
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,191
Wait.

298
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,235
What, another cat died?
You have to...

299
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,545
Um...

300
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,465
I...

301
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:07,513
I had to... I, um...

302
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:08,790
I'm walking home.

303
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,391
Can I walk with you?

304
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:13,425
Um, yeah.

305
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,948
So you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

306
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,028
Actually, it was
the exact opposite of wild.

307
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,834
My dad's pretty protective.

308
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,029
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

309
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,593
Oh, yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

310
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:35,064
So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

311
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:37,829
Without my permission,
I may add.

312
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,475
Um...

313
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,751
Honestly, I don't know.

314
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:43,987
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

315
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,115
True.

316
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,154
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them?

317
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:52,908
Um, so, anyway, I'm right up here.
So, you don't have to walk me.

318
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:55,751
You live up there?

319
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:58,187
I don't understand
how we've never met.

320
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,955
I've probably skated by your house
every day on the way to practice.

321
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:05,429
It's a funny coincidence.

322
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:08,784
Um...

323
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,235
Thanks.

324
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,555
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

325
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:19,385
Um...

326
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:21,945
- Together?
- Yes, us together.

327
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,395
Hanging out.

328
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,230
Um...

329
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,347
I'm really busy during the day,

330
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:33,346
but I could be free at night.

331
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:35,591
I could be free at night.

332
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:39,308
Well, you should
put your number in here then.

333
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,309
I'm old-school, too.

334
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:45,790
Smooth.

335
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,467
That is so romantic.
It disgusts me.

336
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,635
What did he say about your XP?

337
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,314
It didn't come up.

338
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,155
What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

339
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,352
I didn't bring it up.

340
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:07,993
I'm not gonna just
randomly be like, "Hey, dude.

341
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,675
"By the way, the sunlight's gonna..."

342
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:13,827
Like, look,
when you tell someone you're sick,

343
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:18,950
then you start to become more like
a disease and less like a person.

344
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:21,306
I'm gonna tell him, I promise.

345
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:23,955
But I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

346
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:25,105
I do.

347
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,131
You know that annoying guy
who works with me

348
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,306
- at the ice cream shop?
- The nerdy one you hate?

349
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:30,590
Yes, Garver.

350
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:33,749
His parents are out of town tonight,
and he's throwing a party,

351
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,226
and he told me to bring friends.
So, I'm gonna bring you.

352
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:40,592
- No, no, no.
- And you're gonna bring Charlie.

353
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,265
He's gotta, like...
You know?

354
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:46,991
Doesn't... I have to wait till
he texts me first, right?

355
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:49,351
Yeah, totally. And then

356
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,171
his squire will send a note
via carrier pigeon

357
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:53,152
asking if you'd like
to merge your kingdoms.

358
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:56,592
What is this, 18th century England?
You're a hot young badass woman.

359
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:58,715
You're gonna text him
whenever you damn well please.

360
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:04,066
Be confident, okay?
Give him the facts.

361
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:05,475
Okay.

362
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,027
- Play a little hard to get.
- All right.

363
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:22,904
Make sure that he knows he's not
the only reason you're going.

364
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:24,475
Okay. Oh!

365
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,231
All right.

366
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,275
Oh, no.

367
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:39,989
This is gonna be a tame,
safe, parent-friendly party.

368
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,226
Ah-hah!
It's a totally lame party.

369
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,971
You know what we should do?
We should stay here.

370
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,829
- We'll get Hunan Chinese.
You guys love Hunan, right?

371
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,986
Put some Netflix on.
It'll be perfect.

372
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:52,027
Dad. You know I'm a good kid.

373
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:54,152
You know I'm not gonna do
anything crazy.

374
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:56,386
But I swear, if I spend
one more night here,

375
00:22:56,515 --> 00:23:00,065
just listening to everyone else
outside my window living their lives,

376
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,306
I might go crazy.

377
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,275
Tomorrow night we can order
way too much chow mein

378
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,187
and have a great movie marathon.

379
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,831
- All right.
- Yes, thank you!

380
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,508
You're the best dad
in the world.

381
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:18,711
Thanks, Mr. P!

382
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,904
Okay, um, Charlie's gonna
meet us at Garver's at 8:00.

383
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,755
We have to get ready!

384
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:27,544
Dude, what are you talking about?
We have, like, three hours!

385
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,070
We're already behind.

386
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:33,515
Done.

387
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,105
Mr. P!

388
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:40,707
May I present,
Katherine Price of Washington.

389
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:52,435
Wow.

390
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:57,473
Peanut, you look amazing.

391
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:01,110
Bye, Mr. P.

392
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:09,905
Let's go.

393
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:20,035
God, I can't believe
Garver's throwing a kegger.

394
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,305
You came.

395
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:26,231
Is there any chance that you,
or your hot friend...

396
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:27,355
Hey.

397
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:30,951
...know how to get beer
out of a keg?

398
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:32,505
Oh, no.

399
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:34,629
You didn't get a tap?

400
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,291
I didn't realize
they were separate things.

401
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,675
Why would they sell me a barrel
of beer I can't even access?

402
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:51,671
Garver, what the hell?

403
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:54,469
This is a tame, safe,
parent-friendly party!

404
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,112
Uh, do tame parties
have sundae bars?

405
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:00,149
I think it's so cool.

406
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:01,874
No, don't listen to her.

407
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,371
Okay, she's never been
to a party before.

408
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,546
She doesn't understand
how dire the situation is.

409
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:07,195
- We gotta go.
- What, you're leaving?

410
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,227
No, no, I just made
a huge thing of chili.

411
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,035
Garver, chili is not a party food.

412
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,104
You see, the party's just
kicking off.

413
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:20,675
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

414
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:22,265
Oh, my God.

415
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:33,355
Hi.

416
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,184
You look really amazing.

417
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:43,231
Um...

418
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,153
Oh, it's, uh...
It's all Morgan.

419
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,470
Mmm. I don't think so.

420
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,150
For you, good sir.

421
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,384
Oh, thank you.

422
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,355
Thank you.

423
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,705
Beef chili, huh?

424
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,190
Mmm.

425
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,511
That's top shelf, buddy. That's fresh.

426
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:04,795
- Mmm-hmm.
- I really thought we'd have a bigger turnout.

427
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,713
I told you not to go up
against a cheerleader.

428
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,025
What cheerleader?

429
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,251
Uh, some mean blonde woman
with a convertible.

430
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,629
- Zoe Carmichael?
- Yes.

431
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:12,785
Ugh.

432
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,674
She's having a party tonight as well.
Must have dinged our turnout.

433
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,389
Do you guys just wanna go there?

434
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,075
Well, uh, I like the idea.

435
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,315
Hey.

436
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,749
I was wondering where you were.

437
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,832
- Who are these people?
- Oh, these are my friends.

438
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:30,305
And, uh, they brought you a keg.

439
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:36,267
Great. Come on in.

440
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,748
Charlie!

441
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,471
You good?

442
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:08,115
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
go take a lap upstairs.

443
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,345
Away from you two.

444
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,235
Thank you.

445
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,472
Your friend Morgan,
uh, she seems cool.

446
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,745
Yeah. She's really cool.

447
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:20,531
How long have you guys known each other?

448
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,751
I don't know.
Like, forever.

449
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:26,425
He's back.

450
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,271
Whoa. Who is this?

451
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:35,513
Uh, Owen, Wes,
this is Katie Price.

452
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:36,665
- Hey.
- Hi.

453
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:38,548
Katie. You're a...
You're a...

454
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:41,345
You got Charlie
to come to a party

455
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,707
and make a smile-like feature.

456
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:46,875
Our boy hasn't looked
this good in a long time.

457
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:48,105
There you are.

458
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:54,267
I'm still thirsty.
Wanna get me that drink now?

459
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,595
I'm actually about to go take
Katie on the house party tour.

460
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,035
So. You ready?

461
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,465
We'll be right back.

462
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,755
- Nice meeting you guys.
- Nice to meet you, Katie.

463
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,428
- I can quench your thirst.
- Shut up.

464
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,315
Would you like to dance with me?

465
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:44,784
Garver, what on Earth makes you think
I'd ever want to dance with you?

466
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:55,315
You know if you tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

467
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:56,475
Totally.

468
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:04,991
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

469
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:07,067
- Gotta stay hydrated.
- Thank you.

470
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:10,835
- This is really interesting.
- Mmm-hmm.

471
00:29:11,035 --> 00:29:14,745
I don't think I've ever seen this happen.

472
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:20,033
Yeah.
Classic high school awkward party.

473
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,675
I've only seen it in the movies.

474
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,224
- I gotta show you this. Come on.
- Oh, God.

475
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,510
Come on.

476
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,825
Okay, similar to
what's going on over here.

477
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,667
We just kind of hold here

478
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:36,386
and swing the hips awkwardly.

479
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,833
- Am I doing it?
- Yeah, you're kind of.

480
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:42,793
And then I would slowly back up.

481
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:00,791
Everybody!

482
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:04,586
This is the best night
of my life! Yeah!

483
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:08,550
Oh, my G...

484
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:13,555
- You wanna go someplace else?
- Okay.

485
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,265
I don't get it.

486
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:19,195
How could they just take
your scholarship away?

487
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:24,033
Well, I had to have surgery, and they
didn't think I could ever swim again.

488
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,511
And no more scholarship
meant no more Berkeley.

489
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:30,267
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

490
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:34,553
So, how did you do it?
How did you hurt yourself?

491
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,194
It was just a freak accident.

492
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:38,547
I fell down some stairs and...

493
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:41,710
And that's not true.

494
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:43,754
That's kind of
what I tell everybody.

495
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:46,946
I got really drunk one night
at Owen's house,

496
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:52,949
and my friends dared me to jump
off the roof into the pool,

497
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,028
and I clipped the edge
with my shoulder.

498
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,470
I'm such an idiot.

499
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,788
I don't wanna be
that guy, you know?

500
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,425
Then don't be.

501
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,391
You know, my mom used to take
me here when I was little.

502
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:13,475
Really?

503
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:17,072
She sat me right there,

504
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:21,149
and, um, she tried to teach me
how to play the guitar.

505
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:24,111
Actually, this watch was hers.

506
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:30,105
I spent so much time looking at
this thing on her hand and...

507
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:34,309
Um...

508
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:36,952
She died when I was little.

509
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:38,908
She was in a car accident.

510
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,595
I'm... I'm so sorry.

511
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,189
- We can go someplace...
- No!

512
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,915
No, no. No, no.
No, I'm good.

513
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:47,711
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. I promise.

514
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,195
You wanna see something cool?

515
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,834
Ta-da.

516
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,907
- This is yours?
- No.

517
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:00,551
But it's something I'm taking
care of for the summer.

518
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,594
It's a Jespersen 53.

519
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,155
Wow.

520
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:12,192
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor

521
00:32:12,715 --> 00:32:13,865
and watch the sun set.

522
00:32:23,155 --> 00:32:26,466
That sounds perfect.

523
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:50,915
Um... Just...

524
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,510
You gotta...

525
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,389
Oh.

526
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:56,835
Sorry.

527
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:00,512
So, what are you
gonna do this year,

528
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,075
now that you're not
going to Berkeley?

529
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:05,308
Well, first I'm gonna get
a new truck.

530
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,228
And then I'm gonna drive
across country.

531
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:14,104
I've been in the pool
my entire life, and, uh,

532
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,709
I haven't got to see
much else, so.

533
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,345
Um...

534
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:21,225
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not doing anything.

535
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:25,033
I'm just gonna take some
online courses, I think.

536
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:28,827
But I'll just be here.

537
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:31,711
I, uh... I meant,
what are you doing tomorrow?

538
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,744
Oh. Oh!
Oh, God.

539
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,347
Um...

540
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:39,475
I...

541
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,511
I'm busy during the day,

542
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:46,635
but I can be free
tomorrow night.

543
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:47,831
That's perfect.

544
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:50,430
I'll see you tomorrow night?

545
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:51,515
Okay.

546
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,269
I have something to tell you.

547
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:04,955
I don't actually have a cat.

548
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,549
No shit.

549
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:20,753
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

550
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:26,225
- Morgan, who are you texting?
- Mmm.

551
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,193
- Garver.
- Hmm?

552
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:30,971
I can't hear you when you're whispering.

553
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:32,714
Garver! I made out
with Garver.

554
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:36,152
No!
He's really, really cute.

555
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:39,069
And he totally likes you.

556
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:43,866
By the way, can I tell my dad that
I'm going over to yours tonight,

557
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:45,912
so I can go hang out
with Charlie later?

558
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,651
You're asking me to help
you lie to your father,

559
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,189
so you can hang out with a guy?

560
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:54,512
I've never been so proud of you!

561
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,931
Uh, Dad, I'm gonna go over
to Morgan's tonight.

562
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:01,231
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

563
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:02,870
Hey, how was that party?

564
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:07,274
Party was nice.

565
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,029
Did you meet any fun people?

566
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:11,027
No. Not really.

567
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,274
Everybody was kind of just,
like... Ugh, you know?

568
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:16,075
Nobody was really there.
It was just... Hmm.

569
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:19,065
So I'm gonna skedaddle.

570
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,348
- Love you.
- Love you more.

571
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:27,911
I'm lying.

572
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:30,186
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

573
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:40,594
I'm going to go meet
a boy named Charlie Reed

574
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,667
who's really nice and sweet

575
00:35:42,755 --> 00:35:45,987
and I really, really like him.

576
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,391
A lot.

577
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:49,665
Are you mad?

578
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,474
Well, I'm not happy
that you lied to me.

579
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,571
- You know you can always tell me anything.
- I know. I know.

580
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:55,595
Sorry.

581
00:35:56,315 --> 00:35:57,829
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

582
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,907
- Will I hate him?
- No, no, you won't.

583
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,031
I promise.

584
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:03,811
- Does he know...
- I haven't told him yet.

585
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,030
- No, Katie...
- But I will.

586
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:07,266
I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

587
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:11,269
I know, I'm going to.
I just need a little bit longer of...

588
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:12,355
What?

589
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:15,749
Being someone
more than just a disease.

590
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:18,795
Katie.

591
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,755
It's just a few more days,
please? Like a normal girl.

592
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:26,831
Hey.

593
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,995
Is it okay if me and Katie
hang out tonight together?

594
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,670
- The entire night?
- I already admitted everything.

595
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,747
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

596
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:36,589
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

597
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:45,107
What does Katie Price wanna do?

598
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,874
There's so many things
I wanna do.

599
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,871
I have always wanted to do this.

600
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:02,350
Ready?

601
00:37:49,955 --> 00:37:51,867
What about that one over there?

602
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,114
Um, that one's called Altair.

603
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:59,629
And it's 16 light years away,
which means the light we're seeing now

604
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:01,308
was actually created
when we were two.

605
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,265
Are you okay?

606
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:11,946
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

607
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:14,715
Really?

608
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,345
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

609
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:21,515
transferred out and
another spot opened up.

610
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:25,229
Wow. That's so crazy.

611
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:26,475
You could get your spot back?

612
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,354
I mean, technically, yeah.

613
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:31,947
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

614
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:34,635
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

615
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:36,635
But I'd have to
get in shape by then,

616
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,811
which is probably impossible.
And then I'd have to swim

617
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:41,145
my best time ever to show
that I'm fully rehabbed.

618
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,635
You can totally do it.

619
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,344
But there's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

620
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:00,267
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

621
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:02,875
Okay.

622
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:08,671
And you also need
to meet my dad.

623
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,195
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

624
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,465
My... My name's Charlie.

625
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,115
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

626
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,868
Hah! I didn't know that.

627
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:29,272
So, what do you go by? Do you go by Charlie,
not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

628
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:32,229
- No, sir, just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

629
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,553
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

630
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:37,171
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

631
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:40,108
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

632
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:42,251
- That's not 1:00, is it, Charlie?
- No, sir, it's not.

633
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:44,506
- You said your curfew was 1:00.
- Yeah.

634
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:47,387
Relax, I'm not a cop.

635
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,394
How many times a week
do you shave?

636
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:57,665
Shave? Um... Uh... Like four.
Uh, four times. Four times a week, sir.

637
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,155
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

638
00:39:59,235 --> 00:40:01,670
- Why?
- Well, because they're great.

639
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,872
And one time I was at
this burger place and

640
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,947
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

641
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,425
That's awesome.

642
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:14,715
Okay.
Charlie, here's the deal.

643
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,191
Katie appears to be very strong.
And she is.

644
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:22,267
- Hey, hi.
- She's dealing with...

645
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,472
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

646
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,955
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

647
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:29,171
Thank you so much for letting
me take her out, Mr. Price.

648
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,231
Okay.

649
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:35,388
Uh... Oh, don't forget
your guitar case.

650
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:38,667
Wait, I'll hold it for ya.

651
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,189
Uh, hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

652
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:46,669
Okay. All right.

653
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:50,109
Just a little...
There you go.

654
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:52,155
Little room for the Holy Ghost.

655
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:53,795
And...

656
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,905
And open.

657
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:01,435
I believe these are for you.

658
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:03,185
Oi!

659
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,826
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

660
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:09,192
- Fred.
- Don't even try it.

661
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:10,745
Thank you, Fred.

662
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:15,235
<i>Okay, rule number one.</i>

663
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,425
When you're on a train,

664
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,428
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

665
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:23,429
Well, I wouldn't know, I've
never been on a train before.

666
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,551
Neither have I.

667
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:26,069
- Really?
- Really.

668
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:29,755
Cheers.

669
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,794
I still cannot believe that

670
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,571
we grew up in the same town
since we were younger,

671
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,211
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike

672
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:40,352
or out with a lemonade stand.

673
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:41,651
And I would've bought
your lemonade.

674
00:41:41,675 --> 00:41:43,507
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

675
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:45,754
- Who doesn't like lemonade?
- Me.

676
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,354
You know I know
the real story, right?

677
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,868
You and your dad are in the
Witness Protection Program,

678
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:56,275
and you have both testified against a mobster.

679
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,154
Very close. But, uh,

680
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,150
the truth is,

681
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:07,067
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

682
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:10,227
Right. And I've been given
specific instructions

683
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:11,874
to never be seen
in the daylight,

684
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,675
and I've been watching you
this whole entire time

685
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:16,309
from the safety of my own room.

686
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:19,912
Classic Witness Protection
Program cover story.

687
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,025
All right, close your eyes
and put your hands out.

688
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:28,875
Okay.

689
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:33,069
And open.

690
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:38,785
- Try and catch 'em in your mouth.
- Hey.

691
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,705
Thank you.

692
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:45,507
Oh. And look. We're here.

693
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:13,350
Wait, where are you taking me?

694
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:15,071
We're here.

695
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:17,747
Charlie, what is this place?

696
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:19,265
It's your surprise.

697
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:20,949
Charlie, my man.

698
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:22,794
I thought Seattle
was my surprise.

699
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,385
Come on.

700
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,070
Where are we going?

701
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,875
- It's your first live show.
- Yeah.

702
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:07,875
Whoo!

703
00:44:09,435 --> 00:44:10,835
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

704
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,433
- That was seriously so cool.
- I know.

705
00:44:15,515 --> 00:44:19,065
That was, I mean,
literally one of the best things ever.

706
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:20,155
Right?

707
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:24,229
Oh, God.
Live music is beautiful.

708
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:26,675
You're beautiful.

709
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:27,871
You're the best.

710
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:32,634
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

711
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,544
Okay.
Your turn.

712
00:44:39,955 --> 00:44:40,991
For what?

713
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:46,546
Oh! No, no.
No, no, no. I am not.

714
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:51,147
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
You owe me a song.

715
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:55,991
- I... I can't do it here.
- Yes, you can.

716
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:57,748
Remember, live shows
are the best.

717
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:02,195
Are you hungry? 'Cause I'm hungry,
and you're always hungry.

718
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:07,350
Look, we can either have
come all the way to this new city,

719
00:45:08,035 --> 00:45:10,914
underneath the stars,
and you don't play me a song,

720
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:15,394
or we can continue to have the
greatest night of our lives.

721
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:22,915
I'll be right here watching.

722
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:31,834
Go, come on, we're waiting!

723
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:51,705
She's good.

724
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:38,331
Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

725
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,790
but you were really,
really good.

726
00:47:42,115 --> 00:47:44,115
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

727
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,571
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie.

728
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:47,995
It was amazing.

729
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:52,791
- Are you ready?
- For what?

730
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:55,185
To go swimming.

731
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,028
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

732
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:02,233
Yes, you do.
You just haven't swam in a while.

733
00:48:02,435 --> 00:48:05,746
And I've never swam
in this water before,

734
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:07,270
so you're gonna take me.

735
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:11,071
Come on!

736
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:12,515
No, I'm serious.
I'm not swimming.

737
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:14,587
But you made me sing,
and I didn't want to.

738
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:16,507
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

739
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:19,906
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

740
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:22,071
Charlie.

741
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:27,069
We could've either come
all the way to the beach,

742
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,347
- under the beautiful stars, and not go swimming.
- Oh, my...

743
00:48:30,515 --> 00:48:33,314
Or we could jump into that water

744
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:36,875
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

745
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:38,435
I don't have a swimsuit.

746
00:48:38,675 --> 00:48:39,791
Neither do I.

747
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:46,755
Katie.

748
00:48:48,915 --> 00:48:50,065
You coming?

749
00:48:56,755 --> 00:48:57,905
Hurry up!

750
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:02,865
Oh, my God, it's so cold.

751
00:49:06,395 --> 00:49:09,467
Pull your arms forward,
and then push.

752
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:13,945
The breast stroke?
It seems like a trick.

753
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:19,551
Kind of.

754
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:23,228
See, this isn't so bad.

755
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:24,989
You don't hate the water.

756
00:49:28,195 --> 00:49:30,152
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

757
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:51,665
<i>Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?</i>

758
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:54,475
No.

759
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,949
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

760
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:03,995
when I couldn't swim.

761
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:10,944
I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

762
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:14,434
And neither did anybody else.

763
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:20,628
All these kids that I've been
going to school with for 15 years,

764
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:23,947
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

765
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:30,188
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

766
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:35,795
You know...
You're not the guy in the pool.

767
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:42,266
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

768
00:50:49,155 --> 00:50:53,195
Do everything you can
right now, and then decide.

769
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,151
Because now is all that matters.

770
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:05,913
- You're right.
- Good.

771
00:51:10,555 --> 00:51:12,194
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

772
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:14,506
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

773
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:20,345
What?

774
00:51:23,115 --> 00:51:24,549
Charlie, what time is it?

775
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:29,831
It's 4:50.

776
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:33,755
It's not waterproof.

777
00:51:39,275 --> 00:51:40,755
- Oh, my God.
- What?

778
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:42,906
- Oh, my God!
- Katie, wait!

779
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:44,411
- Katie, what are you doing?
- I need to go!

780
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,471
Katie, wait!

781
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,315
Katie!

782
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:56,955
Shit.

783
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:07,908
Katie, get in, let me drive you.

784
00:52:09,715 --> 00:52:11,149
Go, Charlie, go!

785
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:15,392
Katie! What the hell
is going on?

786
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:19,072
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

787
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,233
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

788
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:22,988
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed!

789
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:24,270
- Faster!
- Okay, okay!

790
00:52:27,155 --> 00:52:28,191
Oh, my God.

791
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:31,835
Katie!

792
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:33,395
Katie!

793
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:36,275
Katie!

794
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,832
Katie. Katie.

795
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:46,145
Katie.

796
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:50,112
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

797
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:54,512
Katie, please just talk to me!

798
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:57,349
- Hey! Is she inside?
- Yes.

799
00:52:57,515 --> 00:52:59,029
Is she in there? Move!

800
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:01,634
How could you let
this happen to her?

801
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:03,593
Let what happen?
What happen?

802
00:53:04,595 --> 00:53:06,507
Did she not tell you?

803
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:08,355
Tell me what?
I have no idea what's going on!

804
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:09,631
She's sick! She's sick.

805
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:12,629
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

806
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,544
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her.

807
00:53:15,635 --> 00:53:16,705
I'm sorry.

808
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:17,915
Katie?

809
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:42,633
This is a nice hospital.

810
00:53:43,675 --> 00:53:45,394
I bet they have
really good food.

811
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,670
Katie Price?

812
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,025
We're ready.

813
00:54:09,715 --> 00:54:11,911
It was like a second, if that.

814
00:54:13,035 --> 00:54:14,708
Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

815
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,155
We're good, Mr. P.

816
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:23,834
Hey. Is she okay?

817
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,464
Okay, Katie, you can sit up.

818
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:45,069
Nurse Jane will take you
back outside.

819
00:54:46,155 --> 00:54:47,589
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

820
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:51,155
Okay.

821
00:54:51,795 --> 00:54:53,912
The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

822
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:56,755
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

823
00:54:58,155 --> 00:55:00,306
<i>But, as you know,
XP generally lies dormant</i>

824
00:55:00,435 --> 00:55:02,108
<i>until there's
a triggering event.</i>

825
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:04,228
We won't know
if that's what this was

826
00:55:04,355 --> 00:55:06,915
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

827
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:10,428
And if this was
a triggering event?

828
00:55:11,435 --> 00:55:13,131
<i>We'll cross that bridge
if we come to it.</i>

829
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,306
<i>If you experience any symptoms,</i>

830
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:19,435
unexpected shaking, muscular pain,
loss of motor function,

831
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:21,074
you need to let us know immediately.

832
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:24,473
Okay.
I'm gonna go get dressed now.

833
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:27,948
<i>I'm really busy during the day,</i>

834
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:29,754
but I could be free at night.

835
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:33,309
I can be free at night.

836
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:40,910
What about UW?
What about the study?

837
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:42,668
<i>Have they started
the second phase?</i>

838
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,350
I followed up with them last week.
No news yet.

839
00:55:47,475 --> 00:55:49,228
Okay. Thanks.

840
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:01,027
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

841
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,451
Look, I know I told you
to play hard to get,

842
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:23,432
but you should at least
see what he has to say.

843
00:56:30,155 --> 00:56:32,192
He's asking if he can come
over and talk to you.

844
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:33,275
Don't.

845
00:56:35,035 --> 00:56:36,435
Please just delete them.

846
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:37,711
Katie.

847
00:56:37,955 --> 00:56:41,107
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

848
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:44,552
then he's gonna reply,
and then we're gonna meet up.

849
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,144
Which we can't.

850
00:56:47,275 --> 00:56:48,914
Why can't you? I...

851
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:51,531
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

852
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:53,274
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

853
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:56,234
I can't handle it. Okay?

854
00:56:58,635 --> 00:57:01,753
He's gonna get hurt,
and I'm not gonna be the one who hurts him.

855
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,315
So, please, can you just delete them?

856
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,354
Yeah. Okay.

857
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:57,513
We should do
another set of tests.

858
00:57:58,115 --> 00:57:59,913
The results could
come back different.

859
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:04,105
Her brain has begun to contract.
Once the neural pathways...

860
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:06,551
- What about the study?
- They shut it down, Jack.

861
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:11,824
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

862
00:58:25,395 --> 00:58:29,309
No, I... I did everything
I was supposed to do.

863
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:36,390
I mean, from the time
she was very young,

864
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:42,387
no matter how much she cried

865
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:45,706
or screamed or moaned,

866
00:58:47,155 --> 00:58:48,669
I wouldn't let her go outside.

867
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,155
I wouldn't let her go to the park.

868
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,388
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach.

869
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:02,635
And she begged me.

870
00:59:03,635 --> 00:59:05,149
She begged me

871
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:10,826
for things that she had
every right to.

872
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,228
And I denied her all of it.

873
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:17,024
And for what? Huh?

874
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,391
For this? No.

875
00:59:34,915 --> 00:59:38,955
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

876
00:59:39,555 --> 00:59:41,114
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

877
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,755
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

878
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:46,147
She always sees
the good in things.

879
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:50,873
And the way she talks about you?

880
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:55,350
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

881
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,628
You're a good father, Jack.

882
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:05,911
How long?

883
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,034
It's hard to say for sure.

884
01:01:31,595 --> 01:01:33,826
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi, Dad.

885
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:36,914
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

886
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:39,550
- Uh, yeah.
- Is that a yeah?

887
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:41,790
What are you doing?

888
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:45,394
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

889
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,674
- What?
- Yeah.

890
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:51,715
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

891
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,355
which I think
your hair looks better in.

892
01:01:53,475 --> 01:01:56,195
But then in this one
you have your camera.

893
01:01:56,275 --> 01:01:57,731
Oh! No, no, no.
This is not happening.

894
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,667
No, no. This is happening.

895
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:01,906
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

896
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:04,028
Oh, I don't know.

897
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:07,233
Okay, here's what I have so far.

898
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:10,354
"World's greatest father
and handsomest photographer."

899
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:12,115
Ugh. Veto.

900
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,073
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

901
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:18,627
"interested in art, photography,
and nostalgia about the Supersonics."

902
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:20,627
Supersonics is good.
That's important.

903
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:22,069
I knew you would like that.

904
01:02:22,715 --> 01:02:25,105
"Um, a partner in crime
to travel the world with."

905
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:26,515
I don't travel, honey.

906
01:02:28,115 --> 01:02:30,266
Uh, you will, though.

907
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:35,834
All right, we're not doing this.

908
01:02:35,915 --> 01:02:38,475
Please, please, I want to.

909
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:44,509
You lost Mom, and now
you're gonna lose me, too.

910
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:55,874
No, there's always a chance.

911
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:59,306
We've always known it's a
matter of when and not if.

912
01:02:59,995 --> 01:03:04,547
So I really need you
to be selfish and

913
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:09,265
go out there and take
those beautiful photos

914
01:03:09,355 --> 01:03:11,312
and start traveling
the world again.

915
01:03:11,395 --> 01:03:13,307
I want everyone
to see your photos, Dad.

916
01:03:13,395 --> 01:03:17,230
Just stop.
Okay, I can't. I can't.

917
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,633
I just want you

918
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:24,189
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

919
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:28,510
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

920
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:31,635
And try and find someone

921
01:03:31,715 --> 01:03:35,186
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

922
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,995
Because having someone,

923
01:03:41,435 --> 01:03:43,506
that's the best part.

924
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:49,626
So, please, just pick a rando lady
and take her out.

925
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:56,909
Okay. Okay.

926
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:00,511
- Promise me.
- I promise.

927
01:04:06,955 --> 01:04:08,025
Good.

928
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:13,512
Now we can order Chinese food.

929
01:04:16,115 --> 01:04:18,584
- Come on!
- That was so a ball.

930
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:22,472
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

931
01:04:27,315 --> 01:04:29,272
Oh. Food. Finally.

932
01:04:29,355 --> 01:04:31,074
What took them so long?

933
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:40,712
Oh, my God.
Charlie's outside.

934
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,991
I know. I called him.

935
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:45,715
What? Why?

936
01:04:45,955 --> 01:04:49,869
Because you said the best part

937
01:04:49,955 --> 01:04:51,992
was having someone
to share your adventures with.

938
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:54,386
So, go talk to him.

939
01:04:54,635 --> 01:04:55,705
Tell him the truth.

940
01:04:56,955 --> 01:04:58,230
He deserves that.

941
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:00,990
And so do you.

942
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:10,425
You exist.

943
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:14,107
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

944
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,235
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

945
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:21,784
Katie, this isn't something
you can just not tell me.

946
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:26,154
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

947
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,705
That's

948
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:35,865
unforgivable and very
selfish on my part.

949
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:40,155
We were never gonna work.

950
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:44,229
But I wanted us to.

951
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:47,111
You, me,

952
01:05:47,195 --> 01:05:51,872
we don't win in the end.

953
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:57,189
So, I'm saying goodbye, Charlie.

954
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:01,471
Goodbye.

955
01:06:09,115 --> 01:06:11,755
You know, that was the worst
breakup speech I've ever heard.

956
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:12,991
- What?
- Yeah.

957
01:06:13,075 --> 01:06:14,907
Like a D-would be generous.

958
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:17,571
- Zeroes from all the judges, Katie.
It was a total flop.

959
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:20,713
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

960
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:23,754
Seriously, Charlie.

961
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:25,869
We can't.

962
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:28,910
We can.

963
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:39,550
What I can't do,

964
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,833
I can't stop being with you.

965
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:45,791
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

966
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:49,149
I know what it is.
I know what you are going through.

967
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:52,106
But we're not the couple who doesn't try.

968
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,348
You knew that before I did.

969
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,028
You've changed my life, Katie.

970
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:10,950
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

971
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,426
Or we can have the best
summer of our lives.

972
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:19,305
What's it gonna be?

973
01:08:07,115 --> 01:08:08,469
Go, Charlie, push it!

974
01:08:12,115 --> 01:08:13,151
Go, Charlie!

975
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:21,948
That's it, Charlie, come on!

976
01:08:26,195 --> 01:08:27,629
Whoo! Whoo!

977
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:30,675
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie!

978
01:08:37,715 --> 01:08:39,229
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

979
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,953
The Berkeley coach was impressed,
and he promised to keep in touch.

980
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:51,266
In touch is good!
He'll be in touch.

981
01:08:51,635 --> 01:08:52,864
I'm so proud of you, honey.

982
01:08:54,155 --> 01:08:55,271
So good.

983
01:08:58,515 --> 01:09:00,905
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Sure.

984
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:05,428
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

985
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,707
- The rumors are true.
- Congrats.

986
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:09,627
Thank you.
You were great in there.

987
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:11,394
Thank you
for letting Katie come.

988
01:09:12,835 --> 01:09:14,110
I couldn't have stopped her.

989
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:18,989
Mr. Price, would you mind
if I took Katie out tomorrow?

990
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:25,273
Yeah. Yeah, I think
that'd be fine.

991
01:09:25,515 --> 01:09:26,710
Thank you.

992
01:10:05,795 --> 01:10:08,947
- Come on, come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

993
01:10:17,675 --> 01:10:19,826
- What is this?
- It's for you.

994
01:10:20,075 --> 01:10:21,873
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

995
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:23,671
Let's do this.

996
01:10:25,315 --> 01:10:28,194
- No, oh, my God, no.
- Katie, Katie, yes.

997
01:10:28,275 --> 01:10:30,035
- No, I can't, I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

998
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:31,475
Yes.

999
01:10:33,235 --> 01:10:36,831
This is so crazy.
How did you even pay for this?

1000
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:39,675
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

1001
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:41,635
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

1002
01:10:41,915 --> 01:10:46,751
Okay, you helped me figure out my dreams,
and now it's payback time.

1003
01:10:49,915 --> 01:10:51,269
I can't play anymore.

1004
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:52,949
Then just sing.

1005
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,195
Whenever you're ready, Katie.

1006
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:04,585
Let's lay one down.

1007
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:06,905
Thank you.

1008
01:11:09,995 --> 01:11:11,793
How did you get this?

1009
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:14,584
This is the song
I've been working on.

1010
01:11:14,755 --> 01:11:16,030
Stole your notebook again.

1011
01:12:34,835 --> 01:12:36,315
Whoa.

1012
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,674
Let me count our chips.

1013
01:12:49,475 --> 01:12:51,944
- That one.
- That one?

1014
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,908
That's Charlinium

1015
01:12:55,235 --> 01:12:58,672
'cause it is huge and powerful.

1016
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:03,431
And that one is my favorite.

1017
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:05,507
That one is Burritorium

1018
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,471
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1019
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:11,951
That one is Procyon.

1020
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,187
It's 11 light years away.

1021
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:19,025
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1022
01:13:21,915 --> 01:13:26,432
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1023
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:30,790
What?

1024
01:13:33,955 --> 01:13:36,948
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station,

1025
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,508
I already knew you.

1026
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:42,950
What do you mean?

1027
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:47,354
In elementary school,

1028
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:51,589
you walked by my window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1029
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,874
And in fourth grade,

1030
01:13:55,475 --> 01:13:57,307
you started skateboarding.

1031
01:13:57,835 --> 01:14:02,626
And in sixth grade,
you wore a Ken Griffey, Jr. jersey

1032
01:14:02,795 --> 01:14:06,232
every day for a month straight.

1033
01:14:07,915 --> 01:14:10,589
And in ninth grade,

1034
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:13,465
you buzzed off all your hair.

1035
01:14:13,555 --> 01:14:15,433
Ugh.

1036
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:17,155
And

1037
01:14:21,635 --> 01:14:23,228
every day

1038
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:28,389
I waited for you
to walk by my window,

1039
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,344
and it was the best part
of my day.

1040
01:14:37,555 --> 01:14:39,148
If I had just looked up,

1041
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:43,992
I could've been with you
this whole time.

1042
01:14:47,995 --> 01:14:49,190
You were.

1043
01:14:56,835 --> 01:15:01,068
I... I love you, Charlie.

1044
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:06,595
I love you, too.

1045
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:13,713
I can't believe you still
liked me after that buzz cut.

1046
01:15:15,275 --> 01:15:17,835
It was so ugly. Oh, my God.

1047
01:15:48,955 --> 01:15:50,515
Okay, there's some more chicken,

1048
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:52,955
but I'm eating the rest of the
noodles if no one wants them.

1049
01:15:53,555 --> 01:15:54,555
Okay.

1050
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,771
I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

1051
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:59,355
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

1052
01:15:59,435 --> 01:16:01,155
Mmm, you're gonna miss your chance.

1053
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:03,949
Owner's back tomorrow.
It's my last checkup.

1054
01:16:05,195 --> 01:16:07,505
- See you in an hour?
- Okay.

1055
01:16:10,155 --> 01:16:11,828
- I'll walk you out.
- All right.

1056
01:16:11,955 --> 01:16:13,071
I'll see you.

1057
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:17,031
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor

1058
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:19,784
and watch the sun set.

1059
01:16:23,115 --> 01:16:24,115
Wait.

1060
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:27,792
I... I wanna go with him.

1061
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,070
Go where, honey?

1062
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:32,635
Out.

1063
01:16:33,915 --> 01:16:36,191
Sailing on the boat.

1064
01:16:36,315 --> 01:16:38,955
I wanna go with him
on the boat. Now.

1065
01:16:44,195 --> 01:16:45,195
Honey.

1066
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:47,955
- It'd be better if you just stay here.
- Please, Dad.

1067
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:52,755
Let me do this.

1068
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:00,029
It's okay, Dad.

1069
01:17:01,395 --> 01:17:02,749
I really want to.

1070
01:17:13,155 --> 01:17:14,155
Okay.

1071
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:46,552
I've waited my whole life
to feel this.

1072
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:19,875
There he is.

1073
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:21,514
Hey, Mr. Price.

1074
01:21:22,115 --> 01:21:24,107
Glad you made it by
before you took off.

1075
01:21:24,195 --> 01:21:26,551
Of course.
I'm actually leaving today.

1076
01:21:26,955 --> 01:21:29,914
- Wow.
- Yeah. The first practice is in a couple of days, so.

1077
01:21:30,075 --> 01:21:32,431
- That's exciting!
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1078
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:35,555
Your coach sent me your schedule,
so I'm hoping to make it down for a meet.

1079
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:38,675
But why would, uh, my coach
send you the schedule?

1080
01:21:39,835 --> 01:21:42,634
We stayed in touch, I guess,
after Katie reached out.

1081
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,468
- Katie reached out?
- Yeah.

1082
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:46,305
She called him.

1083
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:49,426
Told him that he needed
to take another look at you.

1084
01:21:50,475 --> 01:21:52,387
Uh, no, Katie never told me.

1085
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:54,546
You know what?
Hold that thought, all right?

1086
01:21:54,675 --> 01:21:55,791
I got something for you.

1087
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:10,949
She wanted you to have that.

1088
01:22:24,675 --> 01:22:25,711
I, um...

1089
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:30,425
I never said sorry.

1090
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:35,029
I never apologized to you.

1091
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:37,471
I should have never kept Katie
out that late and I...

1092
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:40,988
Stop. Stop!

1093
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,310
It's nobody's fault. Okay?

1094
01:22:48,595 --> 01:22:50,746
We knew from the
time that she was little

1095
01:22:51,835 --> 01:22:53,827
that every day was gonna be a gift.

1096
01:22:55,955 --> 01:22:57,469
I should be thanking you.

1097
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,512
All I ever wanted to do
was make her happy.

1098
01:23:03,595 --> 01:23:05,587
And you made her so happy.

1099
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,431
Thank you.

1100
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:17,310
- Good luck at school, son.
- Thank you.

1101
01:23:27,355 --> 01:23:29,875
<i>Coming up next, we have a song
that is blowing up on YouTube</i>

1102
01:23:29,915 --> 01:23:32,191

01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:02,513
Yes!

1108
01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:04,826
Hey! Hey, that's my girl!

1109
01:25:05,115 --> 01:25:07,346
Hey, that's my girl!
Do you hear this?

1110
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,666
Put down the...
Put it down! Listen. Listen.

1111
01:25:20,355 --> 01:25:21,555
<i>Dear Charlie,</i>

1112
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,709
<i>I've always been more
comfortable writing song lyrics</i>

1113
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:27,435
<i>than actual sentences.</i>

1114
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,793
<i>There's no way I can articulate
what you've meant to me</i>

1115
01:25:30,915 --> 01:25:33,828
<i>since that moment
we first saw each other,</i>

1116
01:25:34,115 --> 01:25:38,029
<i>or the joy you've brought me since
I first saw you outside my window.</i>

1117
01:25:38,475 --> 01:25:41,547
<i>Even though our time together
was short,</i>

1118
01:25:41,635 --> 01:25:44,434
<i>the stars have been burning
for every moment of it.</i>

1119
01:25:44,755 --> 01:25:46,269
<i>And the light from those moments</i>

1120
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,950
<i>will be shining down
for the next thousand years.</i>

1121
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:55,107
<i>I hope that somehow</i>

1122
01:25:55,435 --> 01:25:58,109
<i>I'll be able to look down
and see you, Charlie.</i>

1123
01:25:58,315 --> 01:26:02,309
<i>And all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there.</i>

1124
01:26:03,035 --> 01:26:04,355
<i>And if you need me,</i>

1125
01:26:05,195 --> 01:26:07,187
<i>all you have to do is look up.</i>

1126
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:08,785
<i>And remember,</i>

1127
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:10,875
<i>I love you.</i>
