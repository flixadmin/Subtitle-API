- Try sounding a little bit more grateful, Ollie.

63

How did you do that,
by the way? No, no.

Never mind.
Don't tell me.

It's better for your case
if I don't know.

What do you mean,

No. I'm working
with your wife.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,234
Felicity would have told me
if she was working with you,

80
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,511
and the only reason that
you would ever help me

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,435

something in it for you.

- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

responsibility for his failures, too.

amazing?

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
How did she die?

She was murdered.

Murdered?

103
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,395
Who would hurt
Felicity?

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,552
Roy, the Felicity you knew
was very different

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,030
than what she became.

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,554
We wanted her to join us,

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,995
<i>but she cut ties.</i>

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
Instead, she went
underground.

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,597
She started calling
herself the calculator.

110
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,400
- Like her father?

You walk that path
long enough,

sooner or later,
it catches up to you.

113

I'm sorry, William.

whatever the circumstances,

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,796
she still sent me
this signal,

117
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,390
and I need to know why.

118
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,318
Roy: You don't owe her
anything, William.

119
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,153
Yeah? Well, maybe
she owed me.

You see
the color variation?

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,256
I think Felicity was
trying to lead us there.

124
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,478
This is kind of crazy.
You know that, right?

125
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,109
All I know is
I've come this far.

126
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,033
I'm not stopping now.

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,936
Has the silencer's flight
touched down from Moscow yet?

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,917
An hour ago in Star City
just like we thought.

129

My facial recognition algorithm
indicates she hasn't had a rendezvous

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
yet with Diaz,
but I did get an update

131

on why Diaz sent
the silencer to Russia.

132

Anatoly Knyazev?

133
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,936
I can't get
specific confirmation,

134
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,235
but the rumor
on the dark web is

135
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
that the entire Bratva
was massacred

136

two nights ago
in Moscow,

137

which doesn't bode well
for our frenemy Anatoly.

How'd things go with Oliver?
Is he OK?

139
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,155
He's fine. He hates me,
he thinks I'm a monster,

140
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
and he doesn't want my help,
but he's fine.

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,078
Oh. OK. Listen. I mean, prison's
obviously been rough on Oliver.

142
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,816
I mean, that's the whole point of prison.
Duh!

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,275
But he doesn't know
the new you.

I mean, he just knows the old,
scarier, murdery version of you.

145

I don't really care what
Oliver thinks of me,

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,353
but he doesn't want me
representing him,

147

gonna find substitute counsel.

No way. We are not changing
our strategy, not now.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
Oliver's constitutional
rights were violated.

150
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,736
A prosecutor stepping over to the
opposite side of the line to defend him

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,160
is the best leverage
that we have.

He's probably looking
for some kind of weapon.

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,559
Oh, wait. Was that
a serious question?

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,216
Well, I mean, you used to be a bad guy...
well, gal,

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,160
so I figured you'd know.

163
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,880
Rene: This doesn't look like
official D.A. business.

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,918
Did we have to
invite him?

165
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,515
- Are you two, like, friends now?
- It's a long story,

166
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,115
but the punch line is that the
silencer and Diaz are inside,

167
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,176
which means we're finally gonna
get a chance to bring them down.

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,999
And you know this how?
Oh, wait.

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,469
Let me guess.
Long story.

170
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,869
Can we just
leave it at that?

171
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
- So are you in?
- You really got to ask?

172
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,176
Rene: Where the hell
is she?

173
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,554
Felicity: According
to my tracker,

174
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,234
she's... she's in there.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,630
[Sound fades to silence]

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,073
[No dialogue]

177
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,994
[Sound returns,
alarm blaring]

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,913
Rene: Bomb!
John: <i>Go, go, move, move,</i>

179
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,275
move, move, move!

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,956
[Timer beeping]

181
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,038
[Timer accelerating]

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,600
A.R.G.U.S. has been
tracking Diaz ever since

183
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
he slaughtered
the Bratva in Russia.

184
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,273
The SCPD was responding to
a munitions plant break-In,

185
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,520
so please tell me,
Felicity,

186
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,995
how the hell do you end up in
the middle of my op again?

187
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,277
Why don't I just say
exponential search algorithm,

188
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,960
and we'll just leave
it at that?

189
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,555
We planted a tracker
on the silencer's belt.

190
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
<i>Obviously, Diaz must
have found it</i>

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,676
and is using it
as bait against us.

192
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,753
How did you manage that? You were
nowhere near the silencer at the CDC.

193
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,236
Curtis: That thing at
the CDC was you guys?

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,274
Rene: Uh, Felicity
wasn't near her. I was.

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,113
We snuck her
out together.

196
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,158
Dinah: So you two
captured the silencer?

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,630
But Felicity and Laurel were
the ones that tortured her.

198
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,435
Laurel: Actually, I convinced her not to.
You're welcome.

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,736
So now you're
working with Laurel?

200
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,736
- Laurel: I'm standing right here.
- Dinah: <i>To be fair, she did help</i>

201
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,229
shut down that illegal
psychiatric program at slabside.

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Wait. Hold on a sec.
You're gonna give me

203
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,833
crap about working with
the new Green Arrow,

204
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,280
and meanwhile,
you're siding with the black frickin' siren?

205
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
Again, still here.

206
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,416
You're working
with the new Green Arrow?

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
Curtis: Guys, I think
that the whole point of this

208
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,680
is that maybe we could all pick
up our phones a little more, huh,

209
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>shoot a text.</i>

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,639
Yeah. I am totally
talking about the fact

211
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,598
that everyone forgot
my birthday last week.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,399
Your party is next week.
Act surprised!

213
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,536
- OK, now that all
- really?

214
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
<i>Of our deep,
dark secrets are out,</i>

215
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,176
do you think that we could switch
our focus back to the psycho

216
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,554
who just tried
to blow us up?

217
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,234
Sounds like good idea.

218
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,596
John: First, ground rules.
No new Green Arrow.

219
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,275
Secondly, no one who
isn't from this Earth.

220
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
You're kicking me out?

221
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,473
Dinah:
Well, you are the D.A.

222
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,976
<i>You could have been
exposed tonight,</i>

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,071
and I think there's
no need to risk that again.

224
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,870
So an international
mob boss gets to stay

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,394
and I have to leave,
is that it?

226
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,074
Huh! Unbelievable.

227
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,356
Felicity: Laurel, wait.

228
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,874
Laurel, please wait.

229
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,560
It looks like you and your husband
don't need my help after all.

230
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,672
He does, we do, I do,
but, more importantly,

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,672
I need the D.A.
to help Oliver.

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,911
Well,
I was happy to help your little charity case

233
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,079
when I had some downtime,
but now that Diaz is back in, I don't.

234
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
Laurel, Laurel, please!

235
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,376
If I could trade
places with you

236
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,393
so that you could
go get Diaz, I would,

237
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,836
but this is my only chance
to get Oliver out of prison.

238
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,509
This is it! This...

239
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,715
This is my only chance
to get my husband back.

240
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,758
Laurel, please.

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
You know, sometimes,
I really hate being your Laurel.

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,838
I promise you that when we catch Diaz,
I will call you

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,515
and we will finish this
just like we planned.

244
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,875
Fine.

245
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,477
We're close. Should be
just up here.

246
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,016
All these years,
and you're still that boy who hates

247
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,269
not knowing stuff.

248
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,995
Are you still that girl who
loves getting into trouble?

249
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,554
You know it.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,639
It's good
seeing you.

251
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,837
I tried to keep in
touch after everything.

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,710
Yeah, I know.
Guess it was just easier

253
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,678
for me to move on
than to hold on, you know?

254
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
Wish I could do
the same sometimes.

255
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,112
I cannot believe that
they're full-grown adults.

256
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,999
Which means
we're old.

257
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,799
I never thought I'd
see you again.

258
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,316
This is the last place I ever
thought I'd come back to.

259
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,153
I wanted William
to leave me on Lian Yu.

260
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,636
How did he
convince you?

261
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,432
I found a message
inside of Oliver's bow,

262
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,836
the mark of four.

263
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,430
That's impossible.
Who could've put it there?

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,831
I don't know,
but I think it's best

265
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,679
that we keep this
between us.

266
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,031
None of us have seen
William for years.

267
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
You sure we can
trust him?

268
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,589
He's Oliver's son.

269
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,997
That is exactly
what worries me.

270
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,272
Zoe: Hey. According
to the map, it's only

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,318
a few hundred more
feet this way.

272
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,077
[Buzzer]

273
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,633
- Let's go, inmate.
- What? Where?

274
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,355
Guard: <i>Oh, you're going
to the hole permanently.</i>

275
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,715
Hey.
What's going on?

276
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,190
Officer dunbar was
killed last night,

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,176
and this little bastard was
the last one seen with him.

278
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,271
Stanley: What?!
I didn't kill anybody. It wasn't me!

279
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,576
Wait. How do you know
it was him?

280
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,432
Stanley: Oliver,
it wasn't me, I swear!

281
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,950
It must have been brick!
He set me up!

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,999
<i>Oliver! Oliver!</i>

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,071
Look who just got out
of the loony bin.

284
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,799
You learn any
life lessons in there?

285
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,236
Maybe those doctors helped
get your head on straight.

286
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
Tell me what you know
about dunbar's murder.

287
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,832
Sounds like you're
accusing us of something.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,720
I heard the poor chap
got stabbed 8 times.

289
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,916
Messy way to go.

290
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,117
You and he had
a falling out, brick.

291
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
Maybe we did,
and maybe we didn't.

292
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,799
Maybe an innocent man is rotting
in the hole in your place.

293
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,192
There are no innocent men in here, Queen.
You should know that.

294
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,239
Brick, Stanley
didn't kill that guard.

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,357
Well, I guess he's got
nothing to worry about.

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,034
The truth
will set him free.

297
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,120
Go ahead.

298
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,958
Then you can join your
friend in the hole.

299
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Hey, brick.

300
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,229
If you or anyone
in your crew

301
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,998
had something to do with this,
I'll find out.

302
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,114
Come on.

303
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,516
Meet pyotr Roslov...

304
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,634
former KGB, lots of deep,
scary ties to the Russian military.

305
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,080
Oh. He looks like
a real charmer.

306
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,431
Hmm. He is not.
Pyotr and I were associates at KGB,

307
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,354
but we had
a disagreement.

308
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,394
Then why did Diaz
have you call him?

309
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,314
Diaz wants to buy some kind of
very powerful weapon from him.

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,359
<i>He wants to destroy
Oliver Queen</i>

311
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,956
by destroying
what he loves, his city.

312
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,918
Curtis: That's why Diaz

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,856
His decryption key
is the Russian equivalent

470
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,109
of "password69."

471
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,875
Once we translated all the data,
this is what we got.

472
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,350
Say hello to betab-500.

473
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,536
John: <i>Yeah. That's a top-of-the-line
aerial explosive,</i>

474
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,835
razor-thin precision,

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,071
able to cut through
concrete like nothing.

476
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,696
Well, Diaz has two of them,
so that means our

477
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,393
list of potential
targets just doubled.

478
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,480
Keep working
on that hard drive.

479
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,630
What are you
gonna do?

480
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,555
Prepare for a mass evac
of Star City.

481
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,760
Why'd you do it, Turner?

482
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,336
What the hell are
you talking about?

483
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,555
Why'd you kill dunbar?

484
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,915
I didn't kill
that guard.

485
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,434
Your blade says you did.

486
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,554
Guards found
prints on it.

487
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,351
Turner, you're going
to the hole,

488
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,557
and this time,
you're never coming out.

489
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,317
Turner: You did this? Hey, w-wait.
You got the wrong guy.

490
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,791
You got the wrong guy.

491
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,200
I didn't do this.

492
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,711
Hey. I heard
you were up.

493
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
How are you feeling?

494
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,317
Heart pounding in head.

495
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,678
Each beat... pow...
like knife to brain.

496
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,317
I'm sorry. I should have
gotten you out sooner.

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,920
So you are not new
Felicity Smoak after all.

498
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
What do you mean?

499
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,999
You want
to be ruthless

500
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,794
to pursue madman,

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,559
I'll not judge you.

502
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,752
I am, after all,
wanted criminal.

503
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,032
I actually thought you'd be more
pissed I almost got you killed.

504
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,759
Of course I'm angry.

505
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,434
You threaten
my life,

506
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,432
but I don't like
apologies.

507
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,835
You cannot take away
mistake by wishing it so.

508
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,155
In my line of work,
you make choice,

509
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,118
you do not look back.

510
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,672
Ah. So you don't regret working
against us with Diaz last year?

511
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,756
Regret, guilt.
These are Demons you choose to live with,

512
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,835
a trade you make
to get what you want.

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,277
How bad do you want
to kill Ricardo Diaz?

514
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,834
More than anything.

515
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,800
Well, then you
embrace Demons.

516
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,473
No more half measures.

517
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,871
When I work with Oliver
in Russia,

518
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,514
he was not villain,

519
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,959
<i>but he did what
needed to be done.</i>

520
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,631
You remind me
of him then.

521
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,114
What would that Oliver
have done in this situation?

522
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,791
He would have ended
Diaz,

523
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,316
and he wouldn't care
about the cost.

524
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,794
Dinah: Hey! Laurel,
you look a little upset.

525
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Why don't we go
cool off?

526
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:12,961
Get out of my way.

527
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,231
It seems like you were
about to open your mouth

528
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
and do something you're going to regret,
counselor.

529
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,760
<i>I'm not an attorney,</i>

530
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,032
as you've reminded me
many times.

531
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,936
You sure looked like one
in that courtroom today.

532
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,077
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
matter, does it?

533
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,034
Oliver's not getting
out of prison.

534
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,480
Now, if you don't mind,
I have

535
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,075
some unfinished business
with that judge.

536
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,800
Did you even bother to
listen to yourself in court?

537
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,560
You spoke
from your heart.

538
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,876
Big surprise, by the way,
you do have one.

539
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You said, "the hardest
thing to do was to be a hero

540
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,078
"when no one
expects you to be.

541
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,391
"The easier path
is to be a criminal."

542
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,393
What do you
care, anyway?

543
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,952
If anybody knows the true me,
the real me,

544
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,554
it's you.

545
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,936
You know,
you've been telling people for 6 months now

546
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,599
you've changed.

547
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,336
It wasn't until I saw
you in that courtroom

548
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,589
that I actually
believed it.

549
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,598
Do not throw that away just
because it's getting hard now.

550
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,439
I don't want you coming to one of
my court appearances ever again.

551
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,616
William: <i>This has to be
where Felicity was hiding out.</i>

552
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,711
Dinah: Yeah,
but doing what?

553
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,109
Uh, guys.

554
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,795
Voice on P.A.: <i>You have
triggered security protocols.</i>

555
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,231
<i>If you do not provide
access credentials</i>

556
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,516
<i>in 30 seconds,</i>

557
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,639
<i>you will be terminated.</i>

558
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,675
All our weapons
were targeted.

559
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,035
Please say
you can hack this.

560
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,919
Hack Felicity?
Yeah, right!

561
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,839
Computer:
<i>Denied.</i>

562
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
She wouldn't lead us here
without access.

563
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,790
What are those?

564
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,275
Computer:
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

565
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,794
No freakin' way.

566
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,996
Get the bow.

567
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,438
Computer:
<i>Termination in 10, 9, 8, 7...</i>

568
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,432
William: Remember how
my dad used to train?

569
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,391
Computer:
<i>...6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...</i>

570
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,033
Computer:
<i>Access granted.</i>

571
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,635
Roy: You'd think Felicity would
have made that a lot easier.

572
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Dinah: She's obviously
trying to protect something.

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,914
I'll bring up the last
files she accessed.

574
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
Dinah: <i>These are
structural maps</i>

575
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,232
<i>of all the buildings
throughout Star City.</i>

576
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,312
City hall,
central library,

577
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,834
old rockets arena...

578
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,440
all areas
outside The Glades.

579
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Yeah. Along with schematics
to build explosives

580
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,750
and the money
to fund it.

581
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,474
This is a plan to level
all of Star City.

582
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,995
What you got?

583
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,158
Anatoly said in order to catch Diaz,
I couldn't worry about the cost.

584
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,576
Felicity,
you know how I feel about this.

585
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,616
I know, and that's not
the point.

586
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,677
The point is that Diaz
does worry about the cost.

587
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,354
I mean, it's basically
his whole M.O.

588
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,749
Diaz wants to
make a statement.

589
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,718
The man carries around
a flamethrower.

590
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
Subtlety isn't
his strong suit.

591
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,656
So I started wondering,
what is a statement worthy of a dragon?

592
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,080
I ran an algorithm
cross-referencing

593
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,794
the betab-500 and the
manufacturer's specification.

594
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,595
Turns out that this model
is a new version,

595
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,080
where you can attach
it to a pipe.

596
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,760
For instance,
a pipe underground filled with gas.

597
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,096
John: <i>Gas plant.</i>
Felicity: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

598
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,496
John: That building's
totally fireproof.

599
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,795
Rest of the city,
not so much.

600
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,296
Felicity: <i>If Diaz sets off
those bombs,</i>

601
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,880
a whole river of gas
underneath the city

602
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
goes up in flames
literally.

603
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,039
OK. A.R.G.U.S. will
continue the evac.

604
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
We'll handle these bombs.

605
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,896
Does that mean what
I think it means?

606
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,256
John: Call the whole team.
We're gonna need all the help

607
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,555
we can get
on this one.

608
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,456
Anatoly: I miss
good old says

609
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,711
when bomb could be turned
off by computer far away

610
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
in dark warehouse.

611
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:54,296
Yeah. These are not
those type of bombs,

612
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,736
and since we're on the
topic of freaking out,

613
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,296
the bombs are linked,
which means we can't disarm one

614
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,674
without detonating
the other.

615
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,976
Curtis: Which means
we'll have to disarm them

616
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
at the exact same time.

617
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,117
Rene: It's like
the world's worst trust fall.

618
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,437
Ohh. I was hoping it would
look less scary in person.

619
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,336
- Wishful thinking.
- Bogey number one is attached

620
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
to the main pipeline leading
straight into Star City.

621
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,114
Dinah: We got eyes
on the second bomb.

622
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,040
Felicity: Guys, this timer's
started already.

623

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,360
How did you do it?

781
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,795
I knew the Green Arrow
was good,

782
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,360
but I didn't think
he was that good.

783
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,199
Stanley, I'm just
glad you're OK.

784
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,471
OK? I'm great!
I was this close

785
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,996
to being stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

786
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,674
If you hadn't found
Turner's Blade,

787
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
it would have been
all over for me.

788
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,320
How'd you know it was
Turner's Blade?

789
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,592
- What do you mean?
- You were in the hole, Stanley,

790
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,317
so how'd you know
it was Turner's Blade?

791
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,515
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

792
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,430
You gonna eat that?

793
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,839
Man: Greg, move your head.
