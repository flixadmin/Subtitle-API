1
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:48,284
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:53,389
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,659
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:07,337
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,341
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,419
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:27,357
Just remember who you're working for.

8
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:31,895
What did you say?

9
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:35,145
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,667
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,538
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,908
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,710
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:50,594
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,182
Is that it?

16
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,384
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:57,787
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,259
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

19
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,402
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:17,407
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela...

21
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,289
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:37,643
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:44,334
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,556
Adjusting for inflation...

25
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:42,458
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation

26
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,194
say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:50,366
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:54,571
Remaining mortgage on the home, 107,000.

29
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:58,842
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,846
Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities

31
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,148
say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,852
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:14,924
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:20,630
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,700
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:29,086
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:32,442
That is what I need.

38
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:36,012
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:39,048
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:43,786
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:49,159
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:15,618
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,403
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,945
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,429
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,917
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,786
- Oh, damn, Tuco.
- Shut up!

48
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:53,289
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,959
- Do something.
- Do something?

50
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,528
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,097
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,665
Do that... Do that thing.

53
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,139
No, there's not... There's nothing.

54
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,773
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:13,426
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,147
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,886
No.

58
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,187
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,556
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,558
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:09,599
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,735
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:50,006
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,794
What's the big hurry?

65
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:20,403
Oh, I... I just think we're done here.

66
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,505
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,154
You're done.

68
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,838
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,811
Hello?

70
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,259
<i>Are already married...</i>

71
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,861
Hello?

72
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,933
<i>Thank you to our viewers...</i>

73
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,035
Hey.

74
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:36,105
<i>The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:38,975
Walt?

76
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:42,278
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,315
Walt.

78
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:52,655
Walt.

79
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,025
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

80
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:58,495
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:04,334
Are you okay?

82
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,737
Great.

83
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,309
New hat?

84
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:17,313
Yeah.

85
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,317
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,468
Do you want me to heat some up for you?

87
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:27,423
<i>But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas</i>

88
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:31,161
<i>like airports, golf courses...</i>

89
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:48,378
Where've you been?

90
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,276
What is...?

91
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,416
What are you doing?

92
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,651
Okay.

93
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:32,138
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,224
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:38,428
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

96
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:41,564
Okay. Yeah, just...

97
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,234
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,504
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:49,839
Stop it!

100
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:43,626
I know you're scared,

101
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:49,098
and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,171
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,657
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,168
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:20,804
Dead, man.

106
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,606
<i>Ruto or rute or however the hell you...</i>

107
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,791
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

108
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,893
- Conjecture isn't helping.
- Conjecture...?

109
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:31,347
- We need to state the facts.
- Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:34,800
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:36,684
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning

112
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,305
I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,974
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,594
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,444
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:53,069
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,106
And that way...
That way he just kept staring at us

118
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,909
saying, "You're done."

119
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,111
"You're done"?

120
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,063
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:07,016
That means exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,819
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,255
Right now, Tuco's thinking, "Yeah, hey

124
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:16,926
they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:22,399
What happens when he decides "no"?

126
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:32,442
No.

127
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:35,412
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,591
- How would you do it?
- What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,295
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,499
All right.

131
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,502
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,906
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:06,459
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:10,880
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:13,917
So three shots?

136
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:17,970
- Three shots or, I don't know, two.
- Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,573
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Okay, two shots.

138
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:22,157
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:25,795
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,633
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,869
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo

142
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,254
- he's probably coming at you, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,623
- You turn toward him.
- Yeah, just wheel on him...

144
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:39,607
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,243
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,262
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Three shots.

147
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:46,116
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:47,949
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:52,288
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:57,127
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,765
All right.

152
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:05,268
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,437
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,870
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,614
It's not...

156
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:30,160
How can you suggest that we kill a man,

157
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,996
and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:40,537
- It's not that easy, is it?
- Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

159
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,477
Yeah.

160
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,358
Call Skyler.

161
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,169
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

162
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:16,906
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

163
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:19,476
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

164
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,395
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant

165
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,947
over by UNM tonight,

166
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:26,649
so let me know if you guys wanna hang.

167
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,952
Listen to me. "Hang."

168
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:32,455
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

169
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,224
I'm still hip.

170
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,527
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:40,630
I don't know, I just feel like Chinese.

172
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:46,002
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:51,207
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes

174
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:54,110
with mashed potatoes and meat loaf,

175
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,015
and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,718
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:05,488
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,992
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,395
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,505
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:25,008
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,177
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:31,181
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

184
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:33,249
You got Dave at 8.

185
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:38,521
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,290
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:44,994
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.

188
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,545
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,300
They were gonna charge us a penalty.

190
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,633
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:54,086
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,073
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:21:57,273 --> 00:22:00,477
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,879
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,492
Look, it's... You know, it's just...

196
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,394
Oh, boy. I...

197
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:22,866
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,436
Yeah.

199
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:29,406
Yeah.

200
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,687
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,531
She's...

202
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:03,506
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:08,244
Hits two in the sand, two in the forest,

204
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:11,095
- and then he says, "Give me a four."
- Hey, Gomez.

205
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,716
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,952
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:18,555
Good morning to you too.

208
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,428
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:28,565
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,116
The place smells like feet.

211
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,469
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:39,342
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,311
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:43,629
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:47,383
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,655
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:56,707
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,597
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,599
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,771
- So, what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

221
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,174
P2P?

222
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:14,244
They're cooking old school biker meth.

223
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,262
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:19,149
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:21,885
Pseudo's in short supply,

226
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,622
so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,425
That and the thermite

228
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,794
I'd say these two know their chemistry.

229
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:33,696
- But ranking them as burglars?
- Shit.

230
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:36,849
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,203
They got book learning
but no street skills.

232
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:41,771
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,956
Chem students trying to make a big score.

234
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,242
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,045
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor...

236
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:52,348
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:57,053
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them,

238
00:24:57,253 --> 00:24:59,989
and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,537
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:00,270
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

241
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:03,303
<i>We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.</i>

242
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,643
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

243
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:08,344
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier</i>

244
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:12,181
<i>before you go out
and, you know, face the day.</i>

245
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,650
<i>I'm realising now</i>

246
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,950
<i>it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone</i>

247
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,356
<i>owing to the extra baby weight...</i>

248
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,993
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:32,468
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,238
No.

251
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,675
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:44,581
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...
My stomach, you know.

253
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:48,785
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:19,282
- How would he know where I live?
- You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,583
Who else could it be?

256
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,819
- Did you ever tell him my name?
- No.

257
00:28:23,052 --> 00:28:25,102
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:27,206
- No.
- What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,575
- Did you tell them anything?
- I didn't say jack.

260
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,196
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:37,533
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:45,008
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,176
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,553
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:28:56,786 --> 00:29:01,190
I finally figured out how to...
Look, I just finally... I figured it out.

266
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,993
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:08,131
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,099
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:13,469
I've got a better idea.

270
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:17,574
Thank God.

271
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,175
All right.

272
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,711
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:27,050
- Beans.
- Beans?

274
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:30,587
They're castor beans.

275
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,570
So, what are we gonna do with them?

276
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,159
Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk?

277
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,961
Climb it and escape?

278
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,598
We are going to process them into ricin.

279
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:44,434
Rice and beans?

280
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:49,606
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

281
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,141
It's toxic in small doses.

282
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:54,777
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,780
All right.

284
00:29:58,014 --> 00:30:00,783
- All right. So...
- Don't touch them.

285
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:05,154
- You can get poisoned from beans?
- Yes.

286
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:09,859
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,696
The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella

288
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,115
to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

289
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:19,602
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,206
But it... It killed him?

291
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,341
Oh, yes.

292
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:30,013
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device,

293
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:35,184
and then no more Tuco.

294
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:18,795
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey, Hank.

295
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,030
How you doing?

296
00:31:21,264 --> 00:31:24,234
Is this... This a bad time?

297
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,938
No, come on in.

298
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,682
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,620
What can I do for you?

300
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:49,726
Maybe we ought...

301
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,895
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:53,663
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:57,033
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,274
- Did she send you?
- Hell, no.

305
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,043
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:09,078
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:13,383
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,321
Look

309
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,090
I know you gals have your ups and downs.

310
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:22,759
- I get it.
- Gals.

311
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:26,296
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,501
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:36,472
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:32:36,673 --> 00:32:40,543
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:44,180
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,683
Just call her back.

317
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:54,657
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,927
That's right.

319
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,065
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:05,535
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:09,072
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:33:09,272 --> 00:33:13,743
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

323
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:15,812
Yeah.

324
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:21,451
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know...

325
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,826
You knew about this.

326
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:33,396
We're working on it.

327
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,699
I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,802
- And I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:42,639
But it's an ongoing process, Sky,

330
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,543
and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:48,177
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:52,081
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,084
Do we?

334
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,653
Yeah.

335
00:33:58,321 --> 00:33:59,822
I need support.

336
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:02,825
Me.

337
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,028
The almost-40-year-old pregnant woman

338
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:07,111
with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,548
And the husband with the lung cancer

340
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,518
who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:14,602
And he barely even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,774
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,742
And the overdrawn checking account.

344
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:23,479
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap,

345
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,430
and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet,

346
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,751
and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:31,921
But, oh, I see.

348
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,757
Now I'm supposed to go, "Hank, please

349
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,460
what can I possibly do to further benefit

350
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,396
my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister

351
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,630
who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:49,706
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:08,258
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

354
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:42,358
That's all it takes?

355
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,095
That's all it takes.

356
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,832
So now what?

357
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,136
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,705
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,941
Business as usual.

360
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,844
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:08,318
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,686
Care to try it?"

363
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,689
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,090
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:17,809
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:21,497
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:24,133
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:27,804
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:31,174
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

370
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:37,580
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72

371
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,350
it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,621
- What, like a heart attack?
- Yeah.

373
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,756
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,792
His associates won't know
any differently,

375
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,896
and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:56,065
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:15,451
Just keep it down.

378
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,787
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,556
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

380
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,526
You been home yet?

381
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:27,397
No. Why?

382
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,965
<i>Well...</i>

383
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,567
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:35,955
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

385
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,924
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.</i>

386
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:44,280
<i>- I should have just kept out of it.
- Yeah, well, okay.</i>

387
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,049
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:49,953
Yeah, well, that... You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,722
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

390
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,859
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,428
Hank, unfortunately, I really...

392
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:02,165
<i>Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

393
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:07,203
Actually, I'm at work, so... Oh, hey.

394
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:09,255
You wanna see something really freaky?

395
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:12,609
<i>- Well, I would, but...
- Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

396
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:17,981
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,319
<i>Hank.</i>

398
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,819
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:32,161
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:36,866
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

401
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:40,036
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

402
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,607
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

403
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:48,444
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

404
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,918
- I'm taking this.
- No. It's my gun. I need it!

405
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:57,768
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:01,057
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've...

407
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,661
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:47,804
Skyler?

409
00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:55,879
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:04,220
Skyler?

411
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,100
Hey.

412
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:54,270
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,141
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,747
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:11,020
So where have you been this time?

416
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:20,396
Walt?

417
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:35,545
Walt?

418
00:41:51,895 --> 00:41:55,999
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:42:05,408 --> 00:42:07,277
Walt!

420
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:10,914
I'll be right there.

421
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:22,225
Yeah, I recognise these two knobjobs.

422
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,828
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit

423
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:26,296
named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:42:26,496 --> 00:42:29,065
- Guess he got tired of associating.
- Yeah.

425
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:31,901
- Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

426
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:34,370
Thanks.

427
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,158
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:43,378
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:51,087
I see lots of blood, but no bullet holes.

430
00:42:53,556 --> 00:42:55,106
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:58,009
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:01,231
Let me get out of your way here, man.

433
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,978
Snap.

434
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:18,014
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:30,059
Oh, this is beautiful.

436
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,062
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:35,096
We got the world's dumbest criminal.

438
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,634
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:41,804
Big stuff here was moving this guy's body

440
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:45,341
when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,979
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,751
- Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
- Don't you just?

443
00:43:54,984 --> 00:43:57,086
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,557
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:44:06,095 --> 00:44:10,633
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:44:18,374 --> 00:44:20,910
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:45:15,598 --> 00:45:17,248
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,408
Get in.

449
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,557
Get in.

450
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,473
Let's go.
