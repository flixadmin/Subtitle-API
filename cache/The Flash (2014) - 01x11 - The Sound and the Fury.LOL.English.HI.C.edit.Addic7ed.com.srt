00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,196
to me, but maybe for the
sake of a fun exercise,

167
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,265
we could pretend you did.

168
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,633
I have a good feeling about him.

169
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,168
Just as I did about you.

170
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,704
[laughs] Oh...

171
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,307
Hartley...

172
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,677
You're still my guy.

173
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:20,949
And nothing and no one is
ever going to change that.

174
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,083
I canvassed the street.

175
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,287
No other reports of vandalism.

176
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,955
No strange cars.

177
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:34,325
Get this... Wells says he's
right there when it happened.

178
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:38,092
All that glass shattering down
around him and he can't walk?

179
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,794
And he didn't have a scratch on him.

180
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,654
There's no point of impact.

181
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:09,324
No rock or bat or... any solid object

182
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,860
went through these windows.

183
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:14,530
It's as if they just shattered themselves.

184
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,569
This wasn't some teenage prank?

185
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,671
No, it wasn't.

186
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,306
But you don't want our help.

187
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:26,577
Why?

188
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,381
Because I already know who did this.

189
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,383
Hartley Rathaway.

190
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:36,318
Who is Hartley Rathaway?

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,185
Hartley Rathaway is the prodigal son.

192
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:42,156
And he has returned.

193
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:50,654
Hartley Rathaway possesses one
of the finest scientific minds

194
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:51,680
I've ever encountered.

195
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,890
Any ties to Rathaway Industries?

196
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,257
His grandfather founded the
company, his father expanded it,

197
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:58,424
and Hartley here was set
to inherit the throne.

198
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:01,261
- What happened?
- He came out to his parents.

199
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:02,930
Old money, old values.

200
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,633
They were estranged when we met,

201
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:06,602
but, brilliant. I couldn't have built

202
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,103
the particle accelerator without him.

203
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:10,573
You guys have never
even mentioned his name.

204
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:14,077
That's because Hartley had
a challenging personality.

205
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,313
What she means is he was mostly a jerk.

206
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:20,017
But, every once in a while,

207
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,286
he could be a dick.

208
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,021
[laughs]

209
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,123
Let's just say that
Hartley, like many outliers,

210
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,824
had trouble relating to his peers.

211
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,461
Yes, but he was always your favorite.

212
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,796
The chosen one.

213
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,563
He referred to himself like that.

214
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:38,134
So if you two were so
close, why would he target you?

215
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,633
Hartley left S.T.A.R.
Labs about a year ago

216
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,300
after we had a...

217
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,135
a disagreement.

218
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:47,973
About what?

219
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:50,206
Look, don't worry. We'll stop him.

220
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,376
I won't let him hurt you, any of you.

221
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,644
Let's get back to my lab, all right?

222
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:04,815
I could've gone my whole life
without seeing that jerk again.

223
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:11,159
Yo. This place is so dope.

224
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,195
What a coincidence. We
were thinking of making

225
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:16,534
“Yo. This place is so
dope” our new slogan.

226
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,438
If you're so convinced
Dr. Wells made a mistake

227
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,540
in hiring me, why don't
you try proving it to him?

228
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:25,175
Magnetic flux is measured by what?

229
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,675
Hall effect pick up.

230
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:29,011
The dual of a parallel R-C circuit?

231
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:31,944
Series R-L circuit.
I can go all day, pal.

232
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,511
[slow clapping]

233
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:37,014
Hartley, it looks like
you have met your match.

234
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,682
I am Dr. Caitlin Snow.
It's very nice to meet you.

235
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:41,283
Cisco Ramon. Nice to meet you.

236
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,986
And just ignore Hartley. We all do.

237
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:46,743
Tell your boyfriend I need
his specs on the synchotron

238
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,886
by end of day.

239
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,522
Actually, it is the end of Ronnie's day.

240
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,858
We are leaving early.

241
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,529
My boyfriend is taking me out of town

242
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,363
for our one-year anniversary.

243
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:57,566
- Aw. That's sweet.
- Thanks.

244
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,034
I'll see you guys on Monday.

245
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,137
See ya.

246
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:05,106
She seems nice.

247
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,843
You don't.

248
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,578
I give you a week.

249
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,080
Max.

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,628
Hi. I'm Iris West. It's my first day.

251
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,296
I can see that.

252
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:29,964
Really? Does it show?

253
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,798
Uh, the fact that I've
never seen you before shows.

254
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,130
Mr. Bridge! Nice of
you to make an appearance

255
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,197
at a staff meeting.

256
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,500
I do love a good shmear.

257
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:42,003
Everyone, welcome
Iris West, our new cub.

258
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:45,335
Anyone want to volunteer
to be her mama bear?

259
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:49,336
Mason, you picked a bad
day to actually show up.

260
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,603
- I don't nanny.
- I lost the ability

261
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,971
to make a joke back in '05. Today, you do.

262
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,908
Deadlines. All new
stories are due on my desk

263
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,345
at the end of the day.

264
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,083
Oh, actually, I had an idea for a piece.

265
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,819
There's this program in Keystone

266
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:04,788
that helps battered women
get back on their feet.

267
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,093
Ah, that sounds really great, West.

268
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,361
Actually, any thoughts on
a piece about The Flash,

269
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:14,396
something you haven't written
about yet, something new?

270
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,297
Um, no.

271
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,534
Not currently.

272
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,337
All right. Sally forth, everyone.

273
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:23,175
Sally forth.

274
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,013
Everything has a natural frequency.

275
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,715
[ting] And since sound is expressed

276
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,584
as a vibration, if the pitch of the sound

277
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,119
matches the natural vibration
frequency of an object, then...

278
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:35,054
[high pitch frequency]

279
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,957
[both laughing]

280
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,575
So, you're saying that
can happen to anything,

281
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:41,797
- Not just glass?
- Oh, yeah.

282
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,164
I think that's absolutely
what happened to the windows

283
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,565
at Wells' house.

284
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:49,133
He's using some kind of sonic technology.

285
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:53,102
I'm getting this feeling that
Wells is hiding something...

286
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:55,305
about what's going on with
this Rathaway character...

287
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,342
Don't touch that!

288
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:00,913
I mean, it sounds like
this Hartley guy was a pill

289
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:02,781
before he went all
super villain, so I...

290
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,583
I get why he never mentioned him.

291
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:07,787
Like he never mentions his
girlfriend that got killed.

292
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,221
No.

293
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,056
How do you know about her?

294
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,257
He's taking up a big part of our lives.

295
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,858
I wanted to know more about him.

296
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,960
I mean, if you want
to know more about him,

297
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,830
you could just ask me.

298
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:23,736
Sounds like you don't know
him as well as you think.

299
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,506
Joe. Multiple 911 calls.

300
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,740
Rathaway Industries is under attack.

301
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,441
Sector cars are en route.

302
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,278
[phone buzzing]

303
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,215
- Hey.
- Barry, it's Caitlin.

304
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,687
I think I know why you're calling.

305
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,040
[sirens blaring]

306
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,880
Get down on the ground!

307
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,381
It's over, Rathaway.

308
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,616
You know my name.

309
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,850
I know some names too.

310
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,350
Caitlin Snow.

311
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:11,218
Cisco Ramon.

312
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,720
Harrison Wells.

313
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:16,453
I can hear the radio waves
emanating from your suit.

314
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:17,956
About 1900 megahertz.

315
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,529
Is that them on the other end, listening?

316
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:23,032
Are they gonna hear you die?

317
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:25,735
No. They're going to hear
you get your ass kicked.

318
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:27,402
Okay.

319
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:45,722
Looks like you're not
as smart as everyone says.

320
00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:46,957
Smart enough to have figured out

321
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,794
who Harrison Wells really is.

322
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:52,097
You see, I know his secret.

323
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,969
Being scooped up by a guy
clad in head-to-toe leather

324
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:07,540
is a long-time fantasy of mine, so thanks.

325
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,543
Well, well, well, the gang's all here.

326
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,215
You've lasted a lot longer
than I would've thought, Cisco.

327
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:16,016
And you didn't last ten
seconds against The Flash.

328
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,288
I was thinking of
calling myself Pied Piper.

329
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,155
Hey! I assign the nicknames around here.

330
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:25,023
Although that one's not bad.

331
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,558
Caitlin...

332
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,360
Never did get that wedding invite.

333
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,929
Shut the hell up!

334
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:33,129
Stay in front of me.

335
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:43,104
The scanner is detecting foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

336
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:44,773
- Take 'em out.
- I can't.

337
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,541
I suffered head trauma
when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

338
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,378
My hearing was severely damaged.

339
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,547
Without these, I'm in
pain you can't imagine.

340
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:55,253
We all lost something that night.

341
00:16:56,923 --> 00:17:00,759
Ha. Very clever re-purposing
the anti-proton cavities

342
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:02,295
into confinement cells.

343
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,266
Wells' idea, I'm sure.

344
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,901
It was mine, actually.

345
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,459
_

346
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:10,470
_

347
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,609
_

348
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,578
Hartley, don't make this more
difficult than it has to be.

349
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,169
_

350
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,766
_

351
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:22,745
_

352
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,620
Enough, Hartley.

353
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,392
Give us a minute.

354
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,164
See you soon, Cisco.

355
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,699
Doubt it!

356
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,781
_

357
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,770
_

358
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,645
God, I wish I'd taken
a language in high school.

359
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,048
How did you know we were
working with The Flash?

360
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,217
I wrote a hexagonal algorithm

361
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,586
tracking all of his sightings,

362
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,386
extrapolating a
theoretical exit trajectory.

363
00:17:56,388 --> 00:18:00,660
In other words, every time he
ran from the scene of a crime,

364
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,762
he ran in this general direction.

365
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:06,666
You are brilliant.

366
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:11,201
And... any anguish you have
been through because of me

367
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:14,974
was never my intent.

368
00:18:14,976 --> 00:18:16,375
Not bad...

369
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:19,813
as far as heartfelt apologies go.

370
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:23,083
Except that wasn't for my benefit.

371
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:25,519
That was for you, Flash.

372
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,423
Feels good to have the great
Harrison Wells behind you,

373
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,858
doesn't it? But one day,

374
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,830
this man will turn on you... [laughs]

375
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,600
In a flash...

376
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:38,768
And even you won't see it coming.

377
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,900
I only hope that he leaves you
in better shape than he left me.

378
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:45,102
If you're lucky, you'll only be dead.

379
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,773
Because every day I have
to live with the agonizing,

380
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:51,541
piercing screaming in my ears.

381
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,181
[laughs] I almost forgot... I told your pet

382
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,716
I know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.

383
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:04,121
Have fun letting him in on that one.

384
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:11,396
I assume you were all listening.

385
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:15,167
Well, Hartley was telling the truth.

386
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,837
I have not been honest with you.

387
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,673
With any of you.

388
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:29,519
The accelerator...

389
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,556
Hartley warned me that
there was indeed a chance

390
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,758
that the accelerator could explode.

391
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,300
His data did not show 100% certainty,

392
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,735
just that there was a risk,
but it was a real risk.

393
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:46,407
And yet I made the decision

394
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:52,347
that the reward... that...

395
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:56,085
everything we could learn and
everything we could achieve,

396
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,688
that all of that...

397
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,926
simply outweighed that risk.

398
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:07,295
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,933
Then the next time you
choose to put our lives,

400
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,800
and the lives of the people that we love,

401
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,202
at risk,

402
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:21,372
I'll expect a heads up.

403
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:36,094
After the explosion, when
everyone else left you...

404
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:40,735
Caitlin and Cisco stood by you.

405
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:43,205
You owe them more than an apology.

406
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,040
They might soon get more
than that what with Hartley

407
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,909
so intent on sending me to the next world.

408
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,545
What are...

409
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:53,817
that wouldn't make it right with them.

410
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,590
You broke their trust. Our trust.

411
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,608
Oh! Hi, chief.

412
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,240
- Is that what people call you?
- Uh, no. Not really.

413
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:22,942
Listen, eyewitnesses say that
The Flash thwarted an attack

414
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,578
downtown today. Look into it.

415
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,749
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Great.

416
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,087
Mason, you're looking
particularly rumpled today.

417
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,454
Mm-hmm.

418
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,627
So, what are we working on?

419
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:39,632
I am following up on a
lead on corruption at the DWP.

420
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,774
You... well, I think you just
got your assignment from Larkin,

421
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,208
didn't you?

422
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,710
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

423
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:48,246
I know that Larkin hired
me because he thinks

424
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:50,649
that I have some sort of in with The Flash.

425
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,753
But I am serious about being a journalist.

426
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,823
Why? Because you write a blog?

427
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:59,425
My mother writes a blog.

428
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,794
I may not have a lot of
experience, but I do have...

429
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:05,029
Spunk? Grit?

430
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,764
Gumption?

431
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:09,099
What is this, a Chick-Lit novel?

432
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:17,442
[pop music in background]

433
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,845
No, no, no, I am
having the worst day ever.

434
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:24,047
We both can't be having
the worst day ever. Okay?

435
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,648
And I was really looking forward to getting

436
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,216
some good complaining in.

437
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:28,953
Well, fire away.

438
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:32,189
Okay, well, turns out that
the real reason they hired me

439
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,223
is because they think I
have some sort of connection

440
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:36,692
to The Flash, which I don't.

441
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,363
Not anymore.

442
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:40,465
And I've been teamed up with Mason Bridge,

443
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:44,204
who is a legend, who I
admired, before he told me

444
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:47,408
I was a worthless, talentless millennial.

445
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,283
Well, the people we admire aren't always

446
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,920
who we'd like them to be.

447
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,555
Well said.

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,728
So, I'm screwed.

449
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,130
No, look...

450
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:09,003
if this Mason guy doesn't
see what a talented journalist

451
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:11,040
you are, then he's probably a lousy writer.

452
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,476
He won the Pulitzer.

453
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,913
Twice, I think.

454
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,815
Oh. Good for him.

455
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:21,086
[laughs]

456
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,655
Thanks, Barry.

457
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:26,229
Having someone believe
in me, it's, um...

458
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,498
a small... really, really big thing.

459
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:34,203
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

460
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:42,647
Where's Dr. Wells?

461
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,814
I'm not sure. Barry was right.

462
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:47,416
Hartley was using sonic resonance.

463
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:49,820
The intensity regulator's
measuring decibels.

464
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,119
But you know what's weird?

465
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,720
He had it set to the lowest setting.

466
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,588
- What do you mean?
- Well...

467
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,857
He could've completely
destroyed his father's building

468
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,659
if he wanted to in one blast.

469
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:01,828
So, why not just do it and leave?

470
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,566
I mean, why stick around and
run the risk of getting caught?

471
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:08,800
Unless he wanted to be caught.

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,968
Okay, your turn, why are
you having the worst day...

492
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,149
Tell me, Harrison.

493
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,283
Am I still your guy?

494
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:32,888
Hey! Are you okay?

495
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,122
Yeah, uh, Cisco and Dr. Wells.

496
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:40,795
He's gone.

497
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,367
Hey.

498
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:50,939
Welcome back, Mr. Ramon.

499
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,073
Ooh.

500
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,840
Oh, man.

501
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:56,974
- Caitlin?
- Hey.

502
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:58,376
She's fine.

503
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:00,380
You need to rest. You have a concussion.

504
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,683
You're lucky.

505
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:04,485
Please tell me you got him.

506
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,623
I guess the attack on his
family's company was a fake out

507
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,026
- so we'd catch him.
- And give him

508
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,194
- direct access to S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Why?

509
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,295
I should've known
he was up to something.

510
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:14,465
This is my fault.

511
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,334
Hey, man. This is on me, too.

512
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,637
I shouldn't have left before...

513
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,773
This is no one's fault but mine.

514
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:22,807
I earned the blame... I'm not
interested in sharing it.

515
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,581
Hartley doesn't think
I've paid for my crimes.

516
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,916
And he's right.

517
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:30,116
He won't stop until I do.

518
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,220
Where are you going?

519
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,392
To earn back your trust.

520
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,174
Hmm... now what were you
doing in my accelerator?

521
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:50,347
Thought it was our accelerator.

522
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,484
Because it will be our fault
if we turn this thing on

523
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,853
and blow a hole in Central City.

524
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,990
_

525
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,797
You are wagering the lives
of everyone in this building.

526
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,632
Everyone in this city.

527
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,301
If you don't have the courage
to admit you could be wrong,

528
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:07,874
I will do it for you.

529
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,810
Hartley Rathaway...

530
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:14,916
your position at S.T.A.R.
Labs is terminated.

531
00:28:14,918 --> 00:28:17,451
If you think you can shut me up...

532
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:18,919
Oh, I know I can, Hartley.

533
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:21,789
Because if you breathe
one word of any kind of

534
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,590
unsubstantiated accusation,

535
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,893
I will make sure the only
job you ever get in physics

536
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:30,165
is teaching it to high school juniors.

537
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:47,113
What is going on here?

538
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,851
[whispers]: Press conference.

539
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,527
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

540
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,498
And for those of you that
read the ten-volume report

541
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,632
issued by the Norris Commission,

542
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,931
well, I commend you on your tenacity.

543
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:07,903
You already know, then, the
circumstances that led to

544
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:12,475
the explosion of the S.T.A.R.
Labs particle accelerator.

545
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:15,280
Or rather, you think you do.

546
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:19,451
Now, the Commission's finding
was that the catastrophe was

547
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:23,520
caused by a chain of events
that nobody could have predicted,

548
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:25,555
including myself.

549
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,090
The truth is...

550
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,591
I was warned there was a chance

551
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:32,027
the particle accelerator might fail.

552
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,963
I was warned by a
former colleague...

553
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:36,298
a friend.

554
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,565
I chose to ignore the
warning and in so doing,

555
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:44,737
I let down all of you.

556
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,008
As a new friend pointed out...

557
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,043
I failed this city.

558
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:55,084
I failed this city and I failed
those who trusted me the most.

559
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,624
By coming forward today...

560
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:02,027
it's my hope I'm taking
the first step toward

561
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,828
regaining that trust.

562
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,098
[machinery whining]

563
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,803
And your trust as well.

564
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,206
Are there any questions?
[everybody talking at once]

565
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,610
Do you have any intention of rebuilding

566
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,879
the particle accelerator?

567
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,884
Miss West, do you have a question for me?

568
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,657
I don't believe you answered
my colleague's question,

569
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,560
Dr. Wells, so I'll ask it again.

570
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,362
Do you have any intention of rebuilding

571
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:32,932
the particle accelerator,
either now or in the future?

572
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:38,206
Of course not.

573
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,575
Thank you for your answer, Doctor.

574
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,646
- It's my pleasure.
- [everybody talking at once]

575
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:44,482
No further questions.

576
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:48,451
Hey.

577
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:49,787
What was that?

578
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,956
Gumption.

579
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:54,958
Has Hartley made contact yet?

580
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,627
What makes you so sure he will?

581
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:57,995
Because he's Hartley,

582
00:30:57,997 --> 00:30:59,928
and he'll want to have the last word.

583
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,663
Cisco, you should be resting.

584
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:03,432
The answer to why Hartley
fooled us into catching him

585
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:05,802
is in here, and I'm gonna find it.

586
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,180
- You have nothing to prove.
- Not true.

587
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:19,783
[chuckles]

588
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:24,554
Do you know why I hired you, Cisco?

589
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:27,155
You said you saw
something in me, I know.

590
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,625
What I saw was humanity.

591
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:32,393
You and Hartley, Cisco,
you're both brilliant.

592
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:35,625
- You both have mental.
- [snaps fingers]

593
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,996
Sparks. But his brilliance

594
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:39,731
subtracted from the
experience of working here,

595
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:40,998
whereas your brilliance,

596
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,566
your heart,

597
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,268
your warmth, your humor,

598
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,902
it just adds to it.

599
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:55,806
There is no chosen one, Cisco.

600
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:59,373
No second or third favorite. Never was.

601
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,211
It's just us.

602
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:05,778
[speakers popping]

603
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,480
What's that?

604
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:11,249
Nice gambit, Harrison.
But this isn't over.

605
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:13,283
Hartley, what do you want?
What do you want, Hartley?

606
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,187
I already gave my mea culpa today.

607
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,223
The city already hated you.

608
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:19,091
You don't think I noticed
that press conference

609
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,126
was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?

610
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:24,200
No, no, no. I've played
with you too many times

611
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,101
to let you get away with that.

612
00:32:26,103 --> 00:32:29,273
This is between you, me, and The Flash.

613
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:31,477
You don't want to play for those kind

614
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,843
of stakes with me, Hartley.

615
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:35,547
Actually, I really do.

616
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:38,083
What do you say? One last game of chess?

617
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,983
You and I both know
that the winner of the game

618
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:42,018
is the one who makes
the next-to-last mistake,

619
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
and you clearly have a move in mind.

620
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:45,521
You're right.

621
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,791
And I'm already at the board.

622
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:52,031
So why don't you move your
precious scarlet knight...

623
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:58,267
While I take out a few pawns.

624
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,141
[tires screech]

625
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:14,319
All right. All right,
Cisco, where do I go?

626
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,387
I can't trace the signal. He
could be sending his messages

627
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,022
- from anywhere.
- Cisco,

628
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:19,723
scan for seismic activity.

629
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:20,889
If Hartley's using sonic blast,

630
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:22,522
the vibrations could cause tremors.

631
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:31,859
[cars honking]

632
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,964
[people yelling]

633
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:41,139
Look. Over here. Quake
activity but no fault line.

634
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:43,039
The Keystone Cleveland Dam.

635
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:47,208
Barry! Don't underestimate
him. He's brilliant.

636
00:33:48,377 --> 00:33:51,642
Well, good thing I'll have you in here.

637
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,678
Rook to knight four.

638
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,413
Aah!

639
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:07,353
[woman screaming]

640
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,527
[woman whimpers]

641
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,830
Barry, you need to
disarm Hartley immediately.

642
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:20,331
Immediately! Do you hear me?

643
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,832
He is a master of distraction.

644
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:24,602
He is a master of hiding his true endgame.

645
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:35,286
A-ha!

646
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,490
- Uh-oh.
- A-ha what?

647
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:40,191
I figured out what Hartley

648
00:34:40,193 --> 00:34:42,093
stole from S.T.A.R. Labs,
why he let himself get caught.

649
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:44,096
Which brings us to the “uh-oh.”

650
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:46,664
He has all the data on
Barry's molecular scans.

651
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,365
Why would he want that?

652
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,801
He can get Barry's frequency.

653
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,604
Barry, you need to get out of there!

654
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,771
You need to get out of there immediately!

655
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:04,148
It's over! You lose!

656
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,384
Amazing. He replaced me with you?

657
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:08,786
Total moron.

658
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:11,722
I got you with the same trick twice.

659
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:14,088
[loud vibrating frequency]

660
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,188
Ah!

661
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,991
Uhh!

662
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:21,760
I got the idea watching you
and Harrison chit-chat...

663
00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:24,093
to use your suit's own
speakers to kill you.

664
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:25,728
Gah!

665
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,164
That feeling? That's
your organs shearing apart.

666
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:33,297
And you activated the
frequency when you disarmed me.

667
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:36,267
In chess, we call that a discovered attack.

668
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,270
You don't see it until it's too late.

669
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,671
- Right, Harrison?
- Aah!

670
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,939
Barry's vitals are bottoming out.

671
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,540
We need to do something.

672
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,241
What are you doing?

673
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,476
Barry's on the travel road
of the dam, at rush hour,

674
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:51,179
surrounded by cars.

675
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,583
Many of those cars are going
to have satellite radio.

676
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,050
Satellite sends a signal to the car,

677
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,585
- song comes out the speaker...
- Yes! I know

678
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,420
how satellite radio
works! How does that help?

679
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,056
Well, I'm gonna have the
satellite send something

680
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,224
other than a song.

681
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,091
Hartley is about to hear something

682
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,459
he was not expecting...

683
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,129
a sound wave that will
meet the frequency of

684
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,234
and destroy his weapons.

685
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:10,700
[radio tuning]

686
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:15,603
You don't seem so special anymore.

687
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,772
Given how easy it was to bring you down,

688
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:20,541
I wonder if Harrison will even miss you.

689
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:25,150
[whining grows]

[sizzling]

692
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:34,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

693
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:40,438
No!

694
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,340
Aah!

695
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:52,384
Checkmate.

696
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,091
- [broken up]
- Barry, can you hear me?

697
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,461
Sort of!

698
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,838
- Okay!
- How do you feel?

699
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,375
Fine! I mean there is a
little ringing in my ears,

700
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:18,113
but other than that I'm good, so...

701
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,279
You're speaking very loudly.

702
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,582
- Sorry.
- It's okay, it'll pass.

703
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:23,983
[chuckles]

704
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:27,552
- Nice moves.
- Thank you.

705
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,053
Anytime.

706
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,021
I think I'm gonna take my doctor's advice

707
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:32,089
and go lie down.

708
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:33,890
What a great idea!

709
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,359
[laughs]

710
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:38,096
Man, I feel like I'm hung over times ten.

711
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:39,997
I'm not surprised.

712
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:47,602
It's difficult for me...

713
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:51,007
to admit when I'm wrong.

714
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:54,180
Certainly, in front of
an entire city but also...

715
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,553
Also to my closest friends.

716
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,488
So I hope one day

717
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,859
to restore your trust and faith in me.

718
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:13,629
That day was today.

719
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,735
Not every hero wears a mask.

720
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:29,639
Some heroes save the day
in the simplest of ways.

721
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,610
By just being there for us...

722
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:35,578
or letting us know we're believed in.

723
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,552
If I'm any sort of hero today,
it's not because of my speed.

724
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:44,627
It's because I learned how
from the people in my life...

725
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:47,097
all of them.

726
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,268
Hey.

727
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,170
Hey.

728
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:57,807
Man, that press conference
today was something else.

729
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:01,941
Dr. Wells... took a lot of guts to do that.

730
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:03,509
I have to give him that.

731
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,845
He has his moments.

732
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,881
What's up?

733
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,616
Must have been hard for you.

734
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:12,885
- What? To be this handsome?
- [laughs]

735
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,485
Raising me.

736
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:16,786
Oh. No.

737
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,091
Well, a kid who loved
math and chemistry,

738
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,028
whose idea of a fun afternoon was

739
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,930
doing experiments in the garage.

740
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:26,562
- [laughs]
- Couldn't have been easy.

741
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,167
As soon as I started AP classes, you had

742
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:32,172
no clue how to help me with my homework.

743
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:34,339
- No.
- You must have always felt like

744
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:40,278
you were competing with Richard
Dawkins and Neil Tyson and...

745
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,013
Henry Allen too.

746
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,382
But, look, none of them, no one...

747
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,917
could ever replace you.

748
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,915
Not even Wells.

749
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,879
Aw.

750
00:39:52,881 --> 00:39:54,982
[laughs]

751
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:57,782
[both laughing]

752
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:59,183
All right, I'll see you at home.

753
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,951
All right.

754
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:03,087
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, Barry.

755
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:06,190
Hey, what'd you find out?

756
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:10,061
I searched Wells' entire
house like you said.

757
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:12,298
There was nothing.

758
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:15,402
Are you sure you
want to do this...

759
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:17,637
Investigate Wells?

760
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,105
100%

761
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:41,637
Your evil hearing aids won't
help you escape this time.

762
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,807
So I'd get comfy.

763
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,641
You must be enjoying this, Cisco.

764
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,276
- I am.
- Ah, well,

765
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,944
if that scares you, I can't imagine

766
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:51,112
how you're gonna feel when
you open up these doors

767
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,747
- and let me out of here.
- Hmm...

768
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:55,650
maybe I'm going deaf,
'cause I could've sworn

769
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,920
you just said I'm gonna let you out.

770
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,356
And very soon too.

771
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:04,691
Why would I ever do that?

772
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:08,230
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

773
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,938
I know what really
happened to him that night.

774
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,640
And I know how to save him.

775
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,312
Warning! Tachyon output
has passed acceptable

776
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,615
tolerance range.

777
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,486
Continued exposure is not recommended.

778
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:29,822
Increase to maximum, Gideon.

779
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,956
Increasing to maximum, Doctor.

780
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:35,495
Speed Force absorption at 35% and rising.

781
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:39,433
I'm not stabilizing. I
can't hang on to my speed.

782
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,402
It comes and goes, and
I can not control it.

783
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:46,243
Gideon, for how much longer
is the Tachyonic device viable?

784
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:48,445
Calculations inconclusive.

785
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:52,012
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Oh, that's okay, Gideon.

786
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:55,617
This was only meant to be a temporary fix.

787
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,849
The real endgame is almost here.
