1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,189
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,979
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:09,216
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,151
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:14,287
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:19,192
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:23,363
I must be something else.

8
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:25,198
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,067
When I was in Afghanistan,
my unit was tasked

10
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,404
with protecting Gholem Qadir.

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,439
How is it you think
your brother ended up dead?

12
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,541
You shot at a client,
you missed.

13
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:36,143
I don't miss.

14
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,911
You murdered Shado.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:42,516
Yes, I pulled the trigger,
but you, you aimed the gun.

16
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,023
What are you
doing here?

17
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,892
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

18
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:56,463
You cannot die until you have known
complete despair.

19
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,433
And you will.
I promise.

20
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:18,652
Sara.

21
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,091
Sara?

22
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:25,959
Murderer.

23
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:51,084
Mne nuzhno
vstretit'sya svami.

24
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,864
Aleksi. Kak Ty, moy drug?

25
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:05,932
What can I
do for you?

26
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:09,002
There's no gulags here
in Starling City.

27
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,972
Anatoly talks too much.

28
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:14,207
Eto verno.

29
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,042
I need you
to find a man for me.

30
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,845
His name is Slade Wilson.
He's rich, Australian,

31
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,213
and he's missing an eye.

32
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,948
I need to know
where he sleeps.

33
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,651
First, I need your assistance
with my business.

34
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:29,089
There is a man who owes me
a substantial amount of money.

35
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:30,190
I am not here to trade.

36
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,559
You know how our
brotherhood works.

37
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:35,028
I do a favor for you

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,696
and you do one for me.

39
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,466
Put it on my tab, Aleksi.

40
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:42,235
I don't have time
for these games.

41
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,538
Make time.

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,573
My services are
of no use to you

43
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:49,843
unless yours
are use to me.

44
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:08,028
I know exactly
how this brotherhood works,

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,697
and right now,
it works for me.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,394
U nas yest' ponimaniye?

49
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:27,581
I woke up
and you were gone.

50
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,050
Yeah. I wasn't tired.

51
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:31,718
You should be.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,486
When's the last time
you actually slept?

53
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,188
Right before I found out

54
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,390
that Slade Wilson
is still alive.

55
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:40,961
Do you want to talk?

56
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,863
I mean...

57
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:47,100
I know neither one of us are very
good about sharing our feelings,

58
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,570
but...I mean, I get it.

59
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:52,439
Slade, and...

60
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,408
And it's a lot,
and, you know,

61
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,777
it's ok if you're scared.
I am, too.

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,947
I'm not scared.
Slade came back

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,782
to Starling City
with an agenda.

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,151
First, he tries to mass produce
the Mirakuru.

65
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:07,087
Then he shows up...

66
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,856
at my mother's
house.

67
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,691
So he wants
a fight, fine.

68
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll give him a fight.
And this time,

69
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,295
when I kill him,
I will make damn sure

70
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,430
that he stays dead.

71
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:20,600
I just need
to find him.

72
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,292
Ooh, coffee?

73
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,260
Hot cocoa.
Hmm.

74
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:48,695
What, no
marshmallows?

75
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,697
I'm out.

76
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,632
What are you doing here, Dig?

77
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,967
Keeping an eye
on things.

78
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:56,636
Ok. And by things,
you mean my neck.

79
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,772
The one you think Slade Wilson's
going to break in my sleep.

80
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah, something
like that.

81
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,676
Look, I have extra
security details

82
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,244
on Oliver's mother.

83
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,146
Roy's keeping
an eye on Thea,

84
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:07,614
Sara's staying
close to Laurel.

85
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:10,250
So I get you sitting
outside of my house

86
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:13,019
like that lacrosse player
my freshman year of college.

87
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,654
What?

88
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:17,390
You know, I had a life
before you and Oliver, yeah?

89
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:21,027
Right. I just want to make sure
you're ok, Felicity.

90
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,029
And I love you for it.

91
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,165
But if Slade wants
to kill me, he can.

92
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,667
There's nothing you can do
to stop him.

93
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,071
So go home. Ok?

94
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,410
Hey.

95
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,212
Nice jammies.

96
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:09,109
What took you so long?

97
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:13,313
What is all this?

98
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:16,683
A little early for champagne,
don't you think?

99
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,619
Not for me.

100
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,288
I just got back
from a mission in Pyongyang.

101
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,191
Well, damn.

102
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,227
That was you?

103
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,664
I'm sorry.
That's classified information.

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,702
But I missed my ex-husband,
new boyfriend.

105
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,104
And A.R.G.U.S. has
a standing reservation

106
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,740
at this hotel
for very important assets.

107
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,108
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,910
Can you stay?

109
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:46,913
Um, well, Oliver
and I kind of have

110
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:50,216
a...situation.

111
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,218
Everything all right?

112
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,322
Yeah, yeah,
we're handling it.

113
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,092
So you can stay.

114
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:05,298
Mmm.

115
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,303
Hey.

116
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,972
Is there a problem,
Michaels?

117
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,809
We need to rest.
These women are tired.

118
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,277
We're all tired.

119
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,345
It's a long hike back to camp.
Keep going.

120
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:22,449
Shall I go explain to the ladies
why they want to get back before dark?

121
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,217
They're not allowed
to talk to you.

122
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,186
Why, 'cause I'm an American?
Because you're a man.

123
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,488
Five minutes.

124
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,463
Girls in the military.
Can't keep up,

125
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,298
don't join up, right?

126
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,527
Whoa, whoa, hey,
what's going on here?

127
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,629
What's going on?

128
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,564
You recognize that face?

129
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:15,869
You should. He's on the U.S. military's
high value target list.

130
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,036
Gholem Qadir.

131
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,539
Opium drug lord
and arms dealer.

132
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,441
Wanted alive.

133
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,919
What were you saying
about women in the military?

134
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:35,221
Why didn't we do fun stuff like this
when we were married?

135
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,525
And take time out from our busy schedule
of driving each other crazy?

136
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,261
Amanda.

137
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,963
Don't look so worried,
agent Michaels.

138
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,598
We've all
availed ourselves

139
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,301
of the Ostrander suite at some point
in our careers.

140
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,704
Something's come up,
I'll need you to come with me.

141
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,373
Duty calls.

142
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,641
Yeah, guess so.

143
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:56,376
Actually...

144
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:58,344
I meant both of you.

145
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,115
What are we
looking at here?

146
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:05,218
Hydroxy-cyclosarin.
It's a nerve agent.

147
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,853
The apocalypse in the form
of a chemical weapon.

148
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,822
And it's about to hit
the open market.

149
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,157
A.R.G.U.S. agents
uncovered

150
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,825
a manufacturing plant
in Kahndaq.

151
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,828
All samples were accounted for,
except for one.

152
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,965
Two weeks later,
this footage

153
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,067
was captured in a remote village
in southern Qurac.

154
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,670
One milliliter has a kill radius
of ten miles.

155
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:26,472
It only took half that amount
to produce these results.

156
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:30,577
Our sources have traced the sample
through Europe to an estate in Markovia.

157
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,345
So send in the army.

158
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,280
We send in the army, we risk
an international spectacle

159
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,182
our government
can't afford.

160
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,917
This has to be off-book.

161
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,486
If you need me to draw up
the smash and grab, done.

162
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:44,257
But John isn't a field agent.
He's not qualified.

163
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,527
Judging from how he and Oliver Queen
spend their free time,

164
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,996
I'd say
his credits transfer.

165
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,198
Hey, look, I don't want this thing out
in the open any more than you do,

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,535
but I'm not sending my boss in
on another one of your business trips.

167
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:58,037
I have no intention
of involving the Arrow.

168
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,606
I need you.

169
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,674
What for?

170
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:03,676
Gholem Qadir.

171
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,311
We caught him.

172
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,013
D.O.D. turned Qadir
loose a few years ago.

173
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,915
Who thought
that was a good idea?

174
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,750
It's a complicated
world, Johnny.

175
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:12,852
The nerve agent's
not the only WMD

176
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,988
Qadir's tried getting
his scummy fingers on.

177
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,723
Last month, he tried
to buy Malcolm Merlyn's

178
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,358
prototype
earthquake machine.

179
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,194
Thank you for stopping that,
by the way.

180
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:24,030
Fortunately, he doesn't know about
your involvement in that.

181
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:27,767
He remembers you as the man
who tried to save his life.

182
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,969
The nerve agent's
under lock and key

183
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,537
at his estate in Markovia.

184
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,740
He's scheduled to host
a fundraiser there shortly.

185
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,675
The two of us haven't
exactly kept in touch.

186
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:40,313
We've got that covered,
but our window is rapidly closing.

187
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,585
Ok.

188
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,954
So I infiltrate the fundraiser,
come out with the package.

189
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:49,422
Sounds simple enough.

190
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,791
Nothing in this
business is simple.

191
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,760
You know that,
Mr. Diggle.

192
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:56,295
Follow me.

193
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:58,231
I don't need you
to get the nerve agent out.

194
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,266
I need you to get your team in.

195
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,101
My team?

196
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:05,571
They're designated
"Task Force X."

197
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,141
Give me a break.

198
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,978
This ain't no task force.

199
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,414
Let's call it like it is--

200
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:18,651
Welcome
to the Suicide Squad.

201
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:29,427
"It's not only prisoners
who grow course and hardened

202
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:31,845
"from corporal punishment,
but those as well

203
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:34,914
who perpetrate the act or who are
present to witness it."

204
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,016
Oh, please stop
giving him books.

205
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:38,651
So this
is your unit, huh, Waller?

206
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:40,953
What, OJ and Charles Manson
weren't available?

207
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,856
This is a dangerous operation.

208
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,392
And these men
have useful skills.

209
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:47,493
Should the mission be
compromised...

210
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,728
You'll just
write them off.

211
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,730
The Suicide Squad.

212
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:00,506
Yeah, like he would
ever make the sacrifice.

213
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:08,747
Lyla, I can't believe
you're on board with this.

214
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,015
Those men are murderers!

215
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,417
And what's
the number of bodies

216
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,085
between Oliver Queen
and Sara Lance?

217
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:16,188
What they do, what I do,
is completely different.

218
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,357
Not really, John.
Don't you see that?

219
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,392
What I see is you letting
the man who killed my brother

220
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:21,594
roam completely free.

221
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,629
It's not freedom.
It's work.

222
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:24,830
It's wrong.

223
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:26,298
Do you cuties
need some counseling?

224
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,734
I'm a trained therapist.

225
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:34,573
"Do you have previous
experience in retail?"

226
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,508
Does shopping count?

227
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:42,715
Sara?

228
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,917
I've seen that look before.

229
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,953
On my face in the mirror when
Ollie goes into distant mode.

230
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:49,788
Hang in there.

231
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,423
He'll open up to you
when he's ready.

232
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:54,293
Yeah.
You'd think so.

233
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:58,197
I started by tracing the donation
Mr. Wilson made to Moira's campaign.

234
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,933
All of the money was routed through
a series of offshore accounts.

235
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:02,935
None of which link back
to a local address,

236
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:05,070
so I looked into
credit card transactions

237
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:07,806
and car rental agreements.
What?

238
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,342
He's got to get around somehow,
just not by rental car.

239
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,311
Slade's former ASIS.

240
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,679
He knows how
to be a ghost.

241
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,151
Robbery in progress.

242
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:22,021
5th and Giffen.

243
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:26,458
We're still in the crime fighting
business, right?

244
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:21,380
Harbinger has eyes
on the target.

245
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,015
Light the torches.

246
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,417
Deadshot is a go.

247
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,353
Shrapnel's a go.

248
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,421
Tiger's a go.

249
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:31,857
This is Mockingbird.

250
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,726
Harbinger,
you have a green light.

251
00:14:33,728 --> 00:14:35,861
Freelancer, you're a go.
Deadshot?

252
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:38,931
Got Freelancer
in my sights.

253
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:41,533
What's stopping you
from shooting me right now?

254
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,335
Honor.

255
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:49,641
Can I trouble you
for a cigarette, my friend?

256
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:53,812
I don't smoke,
and I'm not your friend.

257
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,914
You know who I am?

258
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,617
What it is I do?

259
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:02,287
You're dealing drugs,
weapons and children.

260
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:05,190
Play both sides
of the conflict.

261
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:08,160
Make money while
your country burns.

262
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,863
I do not have
to be the only one.

263
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,331
Let me go,
I make you rich.

264
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,633
You trying to bribe
my men, Qadir?

265
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,703
If we wanted to make a buck,
this is the last place we'd be, moron.

266
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,638
Get down!

267
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:33,052
Sorry, I wasn't
looking where I was--

268
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:35,287
Gholem Qadir.

269
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:38,123
I do know what is less likely--

270
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,992
that John Diggle
would be clumsy,

271
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,827
or I would find him here,
of all places.

272
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,295
You like art, my friend?

273
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:44,630
I know a good
investment when I see one.

274
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:46,165
Out of the military, then?

275
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,000
And in a more
lucrative line of work.

276
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,268
What kind of work is that?

277
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,170
The kind you don't
get to ask about.

278
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,172
It's good seeing
you, Gholem.

279
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:54,239
Everything all right
here, Mr. Diggle?

280
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,308
Yes, he's with me.

281
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,913
So the soldier now has
his own security.

282
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,916
In my line of work, when I do a
good job, I tend to make enemies.

283
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,718
A good man turns bad.

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,587
Bad man turns good.

285
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,522
You changed my life, you know.

286
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:12,191
Trust me, that was
never my intention.

287
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:13,759
The intelligence
I provided your government,

288
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,394
it saved many lives.

289
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:18,831
Now as a free man,
I give back when I can.

290
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,365
Of course.

291
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,935
Get down!

292
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,242
It's all clear.

293
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:32,044
Deja vu, my friend.

294
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:33,278
Mr. Qadir!

295
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,813
I am fine.

296
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,349
I do not believe
I was the target.

297
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,921
Like I said, when I do my job right,
I tend to make enemies.

298
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:45,657
We should go.

299
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,828
Good job, Deadshot.
You're a go for exfil.

300
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,897
Already in motion.

301
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,066
Except, uh,

302
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:55,734
I'm not the only one.

303
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,103
Shrapnel just bolted.

304
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,972
Find him.

305
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,840
Picking him up,
headed east.

306
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,877
Shrapnel.

307
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:07,379
Stand down and return
to the rally point.

308
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,415
I won't be conscripted
into your moral army.

309
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,784
Stand down!
Final warning.

310
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:15,287
Especially not while in a country
without an extradition treaty.

311
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,488
Very well.

312
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,798
What the hell's
going on?

313
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,834
Shrapnel just fouled
out of the game.

314
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,183
What the hell
was that?

315
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,784
We're going to want
popcorn for this.

316
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,454
You said it yourself,
John. They're murderers.

317
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:50,688
Criminals.

318
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,658
They need an incentive
to follow orders.

319
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
So you rigged
their heads with explosives?

320
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,195
There's no danger as long
as they play by the rules.

321
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,796
Scheffer didn't.

322
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,832
It's like I don't
even know you anymore, Lyla.

323
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,136
Where are we at with Qadir?

324
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:11,476
Save a man's life once,
get a silver star.

325
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,845
Save it twice?
Rent a tux.

326
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:17,715
I'll await further
instructions, sir.

327
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:36,200
Vashi lyudi
nezhnyye.

328
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,503
So is my patience.

329
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,906
This is Starling City
bank account number

330
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:44,409
for your Mr. Wilson.

331
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:46,711
To be clear...

332
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:49,847
Take this envelope
and we are through.

333
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:52,250
I do not care
who your friends are.

334
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,919
U nas yest' ponimaniye?

335
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:08,533
Relax, it's just me.

336
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,068
What's going on, Ollie?

337
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,602
Hey! Talk to me.

338
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,204
Now is not the time.

339
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,473
Then when is the time?

340
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:18,042
The Bratva, Ollie?
You're losing your grip.

341
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,078
Ok? Slade's getting
in your head.

342
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,379
I need this to stop.

343
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,048
And for it to stop,
I need to find him.

344
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,850
Yeah, and until then,
how long do you think

345
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,585
you can keep
this up for?

346
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:29,353
You're not eating,
you're barely sleeping.

347
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:32,657
And when you do,
you have nightmares.

348
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:35,460
They're about her,
aren't they?

349
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:38,963
Hey, look at me.

350
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:40,698
You did what
you had to do, ok?

351
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,301
Ivo was going to shoot Shado,
or me, or both of us.

352
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,269
It was an
impossible choice.

353
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,672
I made it, anyway.

354
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,942
But if you had
chosen differently,

355
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,844
then it would be me
haunting you at night.

356
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:58,850
It still could be, Sara.

357
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,852
That's why we have to stop.

358
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,156
What are you saying?

359
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:08,693
He's going to use you
to hurt me.

360
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,462
Or he's going to hurt you...

361
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:22,006
Stay away from me.

362
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:28,293
Seeing as how you haven't
brought it up,

363
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,781
I'm guessing you
haven't got very far

364
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,516
with that H.I.V.E.
lead I gave you.

365
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:33,184
Just make this quick.

366
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:37,688
You're usually
so chatty, John.

367
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,424
These problems with your girl,
they got you down, huh?

368
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,393
And what about
your girl?

369
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:45,863
The one you have
a shrine to in that cell of yours?

370
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,999
Zoe.

371
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,203
Does your daughter
know what you do for a living?

372
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,671
She is why I do what I do.

373
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,640
Really?
Yeah.

374
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:58,376
How many enemies can
a little girl have?

375
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,378
I wouldn't know.

376
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,879
Everything I make
beyond expenses

377
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,682
goes in a blind trust.

378
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:13,591
A girl needs
her father.

379
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:15,560
Nah, not this father.

380
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:18,029
Best thing I can do
for her life...

381
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,964
Not be in it.

382
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,571
Is it ready?

383
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,839
We're almost there.

384
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:34,111
You know, we went through all
that trouble to get Johnny here

385
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:35,913
invited to this little shindig.

386
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:38,349
Seems like an awful waste
not to use that invitation.

387
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,286
You're using it.

388
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,016
Once you have hands
on the nerve agent,

389
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,854
pocket it,
walk right on out.

390
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:46,057
Copy that.

391
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:53,898
Thank you very much.
Your generosity is much appreciated.

392
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,704
That's not exactly
army camo.

393
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,872
But have you given any thought to
what would happen

394
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:03,774
if Qadir recognizes
you anyway?

395
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,577
Mr. Diggle.
Who is this vision?

396
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,146
His new bodyguard.

397
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:12,083
Mmm. You will have to refer me
to your security company.

398
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,418
I'm glad you could
come tonight.

399
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,954
It's the least I could do after
you saved my life.

400
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:18,623
Again.

401
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,158
I will see you
inside, my friend.

402
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,094
Gholem.

403
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:25,062
It would seem
I didn't have time

404
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:29,166
to get credentials
for my associate.

405
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:32,637
Come. This way.

406
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,944
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

407
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:41,646
I forgot those
were in there.

408
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,062
Enjoy the benefit,
Mr. Diggle.

409
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:08,172
Deadshot and his gear
are in position.

410
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:09,940
Tiger's got
the overwatch.

411
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:12,176
Harbinger to all,
fire in the hole.

412
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,552
Shooter at my ten!

413
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:26,057
I got you covered!

414
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,391
Bounding!

415
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,374
All clear!

416
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,628
It's just a kid.

417
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,690
And don't you look
lovely tonight?

418
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,232
Oh, I think you owe
your bodyguard a dance.

419
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,334
I insist.

420
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,015
Deadshot en route
to package.

421
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,750
The fate of the world

422
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,520
resting in the hands
of Floyd Lawton.

423
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:52,423
It helps to focus
on the mission.

424
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:55,426
Is that what
you tell yourself?

425
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,761
I tell myself to see
the world how it is,

426
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,263
not how I want to see it.

427
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,333
We both operate
in the grey.

428
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,368
The only difference
is, is I'm willing to admit it.

429
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,003
That's not the only
difference between us.

430
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,339
That's true.
I don't judge other people for it.

431
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,007
Lyla, I'm the same man
I've always been.

432
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,775
And I'm who
I've always been.

433
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,844
You're rigid, John.

434
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,714
You're blind to any viewpoint
that isn't yours.

435
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,283
These past few months
have been amazing.

436
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,985
But we've done more
playing than talking.

437
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,620
Because when we talk,
we tend to get divorced.

438
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,065
Don't worry.

439
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,734
It's virgin.

440
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,672
Ugh. Which is why
it tastes terrible.

441
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,241
True.

442
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,353
So.

443
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,956
It looks like things with you
and Sara are going well.

444
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,658
I'm not sure
you're the best person

445
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,894
to talk to with all this.
And why is that?

446
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,330
Is it because of the whole cheating,
shipwreck, drowning,

447
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,198
not drowning, you're
back, she's back thing?

448
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,466
Sorry.

449
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,935
It's brutal AA
honesty talking.

450
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,837
I think I preferred it when
we were all lying to each other.

451
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,939
No, you just
thought you did.

452
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,876
I know you better
than almost anyone, Ollie.

453
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,944
I know that you think that you don't
deserve to be happy,

454
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,713
but you're wrong.

455
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,648
You may think
that keeping her at arm's length,

456
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,683
you're protecting
her, but you're not.

457
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,886
You're only
protecting yourself.

458
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:32,456
It's more complicated than that.

459
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,426
It always is.

460
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,471
I got the address for that account
number you gave me.

461
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,173
I'll call Roy and Sara.

462
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:53,444
No. I'm not giving Slade
any more targets.

463
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,347
You can't go out
there by yourself, it's suicide.

464
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,850
This started
with the two of us.

465
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,319
That's how it ends.

466
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,028
Deadshot's on target.

467
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,036
Bingo.

468
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,755
I don't know what to do.

469
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,292
He's too far ahead.

470
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,427
I mean, he spent years
planning this,

471
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,263
and he knows
everything about me.

472
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,699
I can't, I...

473
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,540
I don't know
how to stop him.

474
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,877
Well, you start
by letting people help you.

475
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:10,013
But he's going
to come after you.

476
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,750
You're alive...

477
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,753
Because Shado isn't.

478
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,356
And when he does,
do you think it'll make a difference

479
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,958
whether or not
we're together?

480
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,969
Let him come.

481
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,571
I'm not the girl he
knew on the island.

482
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:38,242
I'm not that easy
to kill.

483
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,348
Together?

484
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,055
Together.

485
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,963
I'm in.

486
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,934
I'll have the nerve agent
in my pocket in 30 seconds.

487
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,584
Harbinger...

488
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:25,489
We've got what I would describe
as a little bit of a situation here.

489
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,723
Explain.

490
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,091
Well, I got eyes
on the nerve agent,

491
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:29,826
and I'm not going to be
able to move it,

492
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,395
much less pocket it.

493
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:34,398
Stand by, Deadshot.
I need to talk to Waller.

494
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,567
Go for Mockingbird.

495
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,903
We have a situation.
The package is much bigger

496
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,505
than our pre-op briefing
indicated.

497
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,307
Stand by.

498
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,612
Deadshot's on target; I need
to see what he does.

499
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,747
Activate the camera
in his eye piece.

500
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,516
Multi spectrum
from Lawton's rig

501
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,017
coming in...now.

502
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,752
It's a match.

503
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,790
Tiger, move
for extraction.

504
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,491
Deadshot,
remain in position.

505
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,061
Harbinger and Freelancer, evac
and head to the rally point.

506
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,630
Deadshot still isn't
topside with the package.

507
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,633
I only needed eyes on.
Fall back to the rally point.

508
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,568
Wait...You knew
that the nerve agent

509
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,270
was too large
to be extracted?

510
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:16,340
Fall back
to the rally point.

511
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,675
Nine is inbound
and hot.

512
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,244
Mockingbird out.

513
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,679
What the hell
are nines?

514
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,781
MQ-9s. Predators.

515
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,684
Waller's called in
a drone strike.

516
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,954
Everyone here is dead
inside of ten minutes.

517
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:46,105
The nines carry
the Hellfire missile.

518
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,040
Just one of them
can level this whole building.

519
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,842
And your boss doesn't care
who's here when it does.

520
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:51,510
Lyla, we have to get
these people out of here.

521
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:54,947
Maybe there's a house alarm
we can trigger.

522
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:58,851
John, we have
to move now.

523
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:00,686
I have a better idea.

524
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:05,591
Excuse me.

525
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:06,892
Excuse me.

526
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,828
Can I have your
attention, please?

527
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,400
In honor of our host.

528
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:18,704
Gholem Qadir excels at everything
he puts his mind to,

529
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,873
be it business,

530
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:23,075
philanthropy...

531
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:26,679
or terrorism.

532
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,249
Yeah, I guess you could say Gholem
is somewhat of a renaissance man.

533
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:32,451
He dabbles in a little
bit of everything.

534
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,421
Arms trading--
did I mention the sex trafficking?

535
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:39,191
Or the deadly nerve
agent that he's holding

536
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:42,862
just 30 feet beneath
this very dance floor.

537
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,897
These are lies!
This man is a mercenary!

538
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:48,000
Lawton!

539
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:50,669
He's not answering.
I have to go help him.

540
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,371
I can't believe
I just said that.

541
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:55,908
You! You were
in Afghanistan five years ago.

542
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,545
You and that Judas have been deceiving
me from the start.

543
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,383
Good timing.

544
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,151
Got tired of waiting
for my invitation.

545
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:16,228
Tsk, tsk.
Disobeying orders, John.

546
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,564
Behind you.

547
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,437
That's two
you owe me, junior.

548
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:28,040
We have to go.

549
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,441
Waller told me
to stay here.

550
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,110
There's an incoming
drone strike.

551
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:34,313
How contemporary.
Get your team clear.

552
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,516
You are on my team.

553
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,018
And it's time for you to go.

554
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,220
Yeah, that's right.
It is time.

555
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:43,789
And this
is my way to go.

556
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,993
Suicide Squad,
remember?

557
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:50,396
I'm expendable,
John.

558
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,933
Even got the damn bomb
in my head to prove it.

559
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:57,569
This way, at least I get to go out
doing something honorable.

560
00:33:57,571 --> 00:33:58,938
You don't get to die
that easy, Lawton.

561
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,005
Really?

562
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,507
Why don't you give
me even just

563
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,043
one good reason
why not, huh?

564
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:06,812
Zoe.

565
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,424
What about the nerve gas?
Believe me--

566
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:21,460
Waller's already
got that covered.

567
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:32,338
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

568
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,852
The drone shifted course.
It's following us.

569
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:50,356
Do you find that funny?

570
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,291
The wall.
What a woman.

571
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,860
How do you think she knew where
to send the drone, huh?

572
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:57,396
And I mean,
the precise coordinates.

573
00:34:57,398 --> 00:35:00,032
The implants.
Bomb and GPS.

574
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,834
Pretty clever,
right? The drone

575
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:04,403
ain't targeting
Gholem's house.

576
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,805
It's targeting me.

577
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,146
Whoa, hang on, do I
get a say in this?

578
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:15,481
Turn around.
What are you doing?

579
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,483
Look, I think
I'd rather get blown up!

580
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,518
Hold still.
This is going to hurt.

581
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,004
The Markovian government
is threatening retaliation

582
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:56,507
following an unprovoked
drone attack over a no-fly zone.

583
00:35:56,509 --> 00:36:00,144
Just the attention we wanted
to avoid. Well done.

584
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,846
I'm not the one
who sent that drone.

585
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:04,748
It was cloaked.
An explosion atop

586
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,784
a chemical weapons cache
is easy to explain.

587
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,152
Instead, there were
witnesses and we had

588
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:10,588
to send in a SEAL team
to clean out the estate.

589
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,156
I guess you'll think
twice before dragging me

590
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:13,791
in to do your dirty
work, Waller.

591
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,126
Somehow I don't think
it will be an issue.

592
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:17,128
Good day, Mr. Diggle.

593
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,807
Kind of uncanny.

594
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:33,344
How Diggle knew exactly
where Lawton's implant was.

595
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:35,012
Still,

596
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:38,082
it exposed an obvious
design flaw.

597
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:41,585
We'll be putting in the implants
in their spinal vertebrae now.

598
00:36:41,587 --> 00:36:43,988
Have Lawton and the others
prepped for surgery.

599
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,236
Waller said in a few years,
you might even get a pardon.

600
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:01,605
Don't worry, John.

601
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:04,542
We both know I'm not
going to be around that long.

602
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,628
You still employed?

603
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,530
People with my security clearance
aren't that easy

604
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:28,933
to get rid of.
Right.

605
00:37:32,237 --> 00:37:35,005
What about us, Johnny?

606
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:38,209
Last night, the man who
killed my brother

607
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:40,411
showed more character than
the woman charged

608
00:37:40,413 --> 00:37:42,513
with protecting
the world.

609
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:47,384
Good and bad is not
so clear to me.

610
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:51,255
One thing
I do know for sure,

611
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:54,425
black and white...

612
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:58,262
Is that I can't ever
lose you again.

613
00:37:58,264 --> 00:38:01,532
Finally.

614
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:04,501
Something we agree on.

615
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:24,655
Well, there goes another
terrorist-turned-ally.

616
00:38:24,657 --> 00:38:27,190
By the way, I put you in
for a commendation

617
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:28,892
for saving Qadir's ass.

618
00:38:28,894 --> 00:38:32,195
You owe me a beer.

619
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:40,103
Congratulations.

620
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:42,739
Yeah, well, kill a kid,
get a medal, right?

621
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:45,208
When someone's shooting
a Kalishnikov at you,

622
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,711
he's not a kid.

623
00:38:47,713 --> 00:38:50,213
I see things
differently.

624
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:53,116
It's a complicated world,
Johnny.

625
00:38:53,118 --> 00:38:55,118
Is it ok if I call you Johnny?

626
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,221
I don't think I caught your first
name, Michaels.

627
00:38:58,223 --> 00:39:00,591
Lyla.

628
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:03,026
It's really good
to meet you, Lyla.

629
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:09,366
In international news,
a United Nations inspections team

630
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:13,103
was called to a chemical weapons
manufacturing facility

631
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,072
hidden beneath
the Markovian estate

632
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:17,107
of humanitarian
Gholem Qadir.

633
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:19,376
Closer to home, mayoral
candidate Moira Queen

634
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:21,612
stumped
for an initiative

635
00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:24,982
to revive inner city
after school swim programs.

636
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:26,283
Oh, I remember how
much my children

637
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:27,985
enjoyed swimming
when they were young.

638
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:30,120
I couldn't get them out
of the pool.

639
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:32,089
We need--

640
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:34,791
I thought
you hated swimming.

641
00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:36,526
I detest swimming.

642
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:39,363
So does Thea.

643
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:41,298
My mother sometimes--ahem--

644
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,267
enjoys a casual relationship
with the truth.

645
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:48,005
Anyway.

646
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:00,484
Thank you
for being there for me.

647
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,552
You mean for not
letting you push me away?

648
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:05,455
I'm going to stop doing that.

649
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:07,658
Yeah? Good.

650
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,794
You'll be wasting
your time, anyways.

651
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:26,076
It looks like
you took my advice.

652
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:29,646
Thank you.

653
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:31,314
Helping me
with Sara,

654
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:34,351
I know that that...
can't be easy.

655
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:35,819
Helping two people
I care about?

656
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:37,320
There's nothing easier.

657
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:39,990
I came by to take Sara
to dinner.

658
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,992
Would you care to join?

659
00:40:41,994 --> 00:40:44,995
I'd love to, but I need
to go see an old friend.

660
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:47,064
Ok.

661
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,518
Hello, Oliver.

662
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,154
Hello, Amanda.

663
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:14,157
Still mad at me?
Lucky for you,

664
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,525
you've been pushed
down that list.

665
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:18,295
Really? Who do you want
to kill more than me?

666
00:41:18,297 --> 00:41:20,263
Slade Wilson is alive.

667
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:21,965
You killed him.

668
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,134
It's not possible.

669
00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:26,169
Everything is possible
where Slade is concerned.

670
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:29,473
And I need
your help to find him.

671
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:34,144
I might have something.
What?

672
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:35,903
There's a new player
we've been tracking--

673
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:37,048
mercenary.

674
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,249
He's left a trail of bodies

675
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,818
from Macau
to Istanbul to Lisbon.

676
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,421
A trail that leads
right here to Starling.

677
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:52,696
We've been
calling him Deathstroke.
