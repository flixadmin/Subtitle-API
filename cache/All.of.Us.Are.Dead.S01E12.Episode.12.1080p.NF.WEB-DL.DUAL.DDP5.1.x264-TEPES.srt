1
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,824
Oh, shit.

2
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,161
Your house isn't over there, is it?

3
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,122
No.

4
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,792
I think they're burning Hyosan down.

5
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,544
Seoul University.

6
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,044
What about it?

7
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,172
To save the majority,

8
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,510
just how heartless do you think
you need to be?

9
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,558
Did they teach you things
like that at school?

10
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,357
We don't learn
that kind of stuff in my major.

11
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,901
I'm not sure which major has that.

12
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,243
Oh...

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,835
Stay still.

14
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,654
Let's go.

15
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,579
On-jo, let's go.

16
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,964
I can't go on like this.

17
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm sorry. Can you wait for just a sec?

18
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,222
Actually, never mind.

19
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

20
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,446
I'll go with her.

21
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,948
I'll go, too.

22
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,325
I'm also going.

23
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,729
No, you hurt your leg.

24
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,246
Wu-jin, keep an eye on Dae-su.

25
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,464
Hey, Cheong-san.

26
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,638
Cheong-san!

27
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,776
Cheong-san, you're such a jerk!

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,251
Let's go.

29
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,923
I don't smell anything.
There's no one here.

30
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,012
Let's say bye to Cheong-san...

31
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,767
and go.

32
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,966
Careful. Slowly.

33
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,134
Oh, shit.

34
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,020
CHEONG-SAN CHICKEN
CHICKEN AND BEER

35
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,524
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

36
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,285
<i>One infected, eliminated.</i>

37
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>Pulling out.</i>

38
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,168
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA

39
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,547
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

40
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,345
<i>The soldiers saw
that we were at the school.</i>

41
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,807
They left us there without helping us,
and then they bombed it.

42
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,395
Maybe they actually want us to die.

43
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,523
I don't believe that.

44
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,737
I think it's all because of me.

45
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,075
Because we were with zombies,

46
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,414
they must think we're neither
a zombie nor human, like me.

47
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,543
Maybe that's what they thought.

48
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,795
Don't talk like that.

49
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,675
Is it really okay for me
to stay with you guys like this?

50
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,470
You're still our friend
and our class president.

51
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,598
We couldn't have made it
this far without you.

52
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,892
Still...

53
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,019
You haven't turned yet,

54
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,605
and you never will.

55
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,075
I really wanna do that again
in the future.

56
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,164
That was my first time
sitting around a fire with friends.

57
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,544
We'll be able to do that again, right?

58
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,171
Let's do it again tonight.

59
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,717
What the hell?

60
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,969
What's wrong?

61
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,805
Shit. I think we're lost.

62
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,975
- There's no trail?
- There hasn't been a trail for a while.

63
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,394
I think we've been going
in fucking circle.

64
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
Why did you come this way
if there was no trail?

65
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,486
If we go down the wrong way,
it will be Hyosan.

66
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,986
Ha-ri.

67
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,069
Look.

68
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,992
There's something there.

69
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,342
Someone must have left it here.

70
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,053
Who did something so nice, huh?

71
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,014
A ginseng digger?

72
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,808
Who is that?

73
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,440
There's another one.

74
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,810
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

75
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,749
Status?

76
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,502
Like people are about to die
of starvation.

77
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,838
Just preserve and transport them.

78
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,632
Under no circumstances
can you do to harm them.

79
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,216
Of course, sir.

80
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,947
Didn't he say to go to Yangdong?

81
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,867
You don't think there are zombies here,
too, do you?

82
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,618
No way.

83
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,706
Maybe they evacuated,
because it's next to Hyosan.

84
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,917
Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

85
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,336
Where is everyone?

86
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,548
We're okay here.

87
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,967
Why? How do you know that?

88
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,013
There are no broken windows,
or blood on the streets.

89
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,101
It wouldn't be this clean
if there had been a zombie rampage.

90
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,938
What?

91
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
Hold on.

92
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,128
Nam-ra, what is it?

93
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,009
What's up? You hear something?

94
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Zombies.

95
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,473
Where, though?

96
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,768
Everywhere.

97
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,729
A lot... A lot of them?

98
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,981
One, two, three...

99
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>four, five, six...</i>

100
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>seven, eight...</i>

101
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,578
<i>nine, ten, eleven...</i>

102
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,545
Run.

103
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,298
Hey, follow me.

104
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,073
Aah!

105
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,290
- Are you okay?
- Take Dae-su and go.

106
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,374
Forget it.

107
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,878
What are you doing?

108
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,254
I said forget it.

109
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,509
On-jo.

110
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,140
Fuck.

111
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
I feel this may be the end.

112
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,687
Stay behind me.

113
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,815
Don't be like this. Stay back.

114
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,988
Ha-ri!

115
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,786
Get off me!

116
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,585
Fuck!

117
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,920
Get off me!

118
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,338
Get off of him!

119
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,549
Get off! Hey!

120
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,395
Wu-jin.

121
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,191
Damn it. Oh, no.

122
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,818
Fuck! I knew this would happen.

123
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,488
It's okay. It's okay.

124
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,324
I knew it.

125
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,994
- Wu-jin, look at me.
- Ha-ri.

126
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,955
You really made it to the nationals?

127
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,041
Mm-hm, I... I did.

128
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,584
Liar.

129
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,253
You came to school,
because you failed the preliminaries.

130
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,423
Or else, you'd be at the tournament.

131
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,717
If you lost,

132
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,512
you should've gone home,
why did you come to the damn school?

133
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,515
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

134
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,393
Keep doing archery. Okay?

135
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,437
Mm-hm.

136
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,688
Don't give up.

137
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,069
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,824
Wu-jin, I'm sorry.

139
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,577
No. No. Not Wu-jin, please.

140
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,913
Don't do it.

141
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,748
Fuck.

142
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,729
I'm sorry.

143
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,623
Su-hyeok.

144
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
Wu-jin...

145
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,588
Wu-jin... Wu-jin...

146
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,975
More are coming. Let's go.
There won't be any that way.

147
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,188
Come on. Let's go.

148
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,908
Please don't. Come on.

149
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,034
Let go.

150
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,546
Don't die for no reason.

151
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,154
If we run now, we're going to make it.

152
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,823
We should have enough time.

153
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,328
I know I've killed
a lot of zombies myself,

154
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,623
but a human being would apologize
for killing her brother

155
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,166
right in front of her.

156
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,661
<i>Eat them.</i>

157
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,958
<i>Eat them. Eat them all.</i>

158
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,549
<i>Why not? You're hungry.</i>

159
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,595
<i>Kill them.</i>

160
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,229
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

161
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:46,907
Wait a sec.

162
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,158
What?

163
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,327
Nam-ra's gone.

164
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,455
I'll be right back.

165
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,165
- Su-hyeok!
- Hey, Su-hyeok.

166
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,835
- You okay on your own?
- What are you going to do?

167
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,004
- Go ahead. I'll catch up.
- On-jo.

168
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,172
Hey, On-jo!

169
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,543
Hey, Nam-ra.

170
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,557
Why are you all by yourself?

171
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,226
Let's go.

172
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,479
Stay back.

173
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,273
Come on. Come with us.

174
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,860
- Mm?
- I said stay back!

175
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,665
Nam-ra!

176
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,671
Nam-ra. It's me, On-jo.

177
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,006
Nam-ra, don't do this.

178
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,716
Nam-ra!

179
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
Nam-ra.

180
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,622
You can bite me. It's okay.

181
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,167
It's okay. Trust me.

182
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,669
It's okay, Nam-ra.

183
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,557
On-jo. On-jo.

184
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,559
Hey. Are you okay?

185
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,143
Are you okay?

186
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Nam-ra.

187
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,983
Nam-ra.

188
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,363
Hey, Nam-ra!

189
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,546

190
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,424

Up ahead!

195
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,214
Survivors confirmed.

196
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,601
Save yourselves! Hurry!

197
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,732
Go home! Make it home!

198
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,443

All of you!

203
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,254
Come after me! Today, I am...

204
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,342
the happiest guy in this school!

205
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,369

00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
U-sin.

207
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,584
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

208
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,671
What about your dad?

209
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,218
Did you see him?
So-ju said he was going to go find you.

<i>I already knew the sorrow</i>

212
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>of being a survivor.</i>

213
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,249
<i>But I didn't know
just how heavy that sorrow...</i>

214
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,002
<i>would be.</i>

215
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,840
Do you know
the teacher, Lee Byeong-chan?

216
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,635
I only took morning classes,
because I had training.

217
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,971
So no, I don't.

218
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,766
Did he ever say, or do anything
out of the ordinary in the past?

219
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,520
That's not important at all right now.

220
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,398
Listen, I'm a senior.
I wanna go to college.

221
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,068
If there's anything you wanna say,
just say it.

222
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,826
What... How many times
do I have to tell you?

223
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,498
He kidnapped a kid
from our class named Hyeon-ju.

224
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,334
I heard he gave Hyeon-ju
some sort of injection.

225
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,544
Why...

226
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,297
Why did you leave us there?

227
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,178
You abandoned us.

228
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,680
- If you cooperate with our investigation...
- No.

229
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,682
I won't ask adults for anything...

230
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,019
ever again in my life.

231
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,064
So, please...

232
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,360
don't ask for my cooperation.

I couldn't find you.

281
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,772
I saw the others a few times around here.

282
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,234
I wanted to see them,

284

I thought it might remind me.

Will you forget if you don't see them?

286
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,538
I went to the mountain last night
and saw a campfire.

287
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,542
I think someone lit a fire
on the school rooftop.

288
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,504
On the rooftop?

289
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,089
Are you sure about that?

290
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,718
I could have been mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure.

291
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,890
Nam-ra said that we should have a campfire

292
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,018
if we should ever meet again.

293
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,823
I plan on going tonight.

294
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,448
I'll go with you.

295
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,957
I'm sorry about that day.

296
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,376
What day?

297
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,714
That day when Nam-ra tried to bite you.

298
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,091
Sorry I couldn't do anything.

299
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,010
Don't worry. It's okay.

300
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,306
Your choice that day saved us all.

301
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,642
Don't tell the others.

302
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,478
It might be too dangerous,
so let's go by ourselves.

303
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,764
I told you not to tell them.

304
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,146
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone else.

305
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,943
Um...

306
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,694
I said it was between us.

307
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,282
She said she'd tell the cops
if we didn't take her.

308
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,620
They won't give me special admission
for surviving the zombie attack.

309
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:31,374
How is that even related?
We'll be arrested if we get caught.

310
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,834
Might as well go to jail
if I can't get into college.

311
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,755
Let's go. Climb that wall, huh?

312
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,132
Wait. You're really coming?

313
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,425
All of you?

314
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,637
You're not the only one who feels guilty.

315
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,180
We were all hurt, too.

316
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,307
Being alone doesn't make it hurt less.

317
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,646
Come on.

318
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,149
Didn't you say there was a rope?

319
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,734
- How do we get up there?
- Move.

320
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,028
Are you sure?

321
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,281
I'm going as well.

322
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,008
- Get on all fours.
- What?

323
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,450
- Come on.
- You heard her.

324
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,387
I MISS YOU ALL

325
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,106
What's that?

326
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,108
Well...

327
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,069
I couldn't throw it away.

328
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,823

329
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,993
I promise to bring a box next time.

00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,043
I see a light.

331
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,839
- Do you?
- No. Where?

332
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,506
It's over there.

333
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,719
Hey, I think
that really is our school.

334
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,062
What a mess.

335
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,648
I know.

336
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,090
Come on.

337
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,139
Mm-hm.

338
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:10,150
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

339
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,656
Do you really think it's Nam-ra?

340
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,741
Mm-hm.

341
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,495
I don't know why, but...

342
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,081
I think it's her.

343
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,303
Who do you think?

344
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,099
Maybe...

345
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,270
it was kids who came back
to the school like us.

346
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,693
Maybe it was a YouTuber or something.

347
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,487
Like those kids who like haunted houses.

348
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,743
No.

349
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,121
Nam-ra.

350
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,251
Maybe she lit it because she missed us.

351
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,002
How would you know that?

352
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,924
I don't know for sure.

353
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,093
But I think I do.

354
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,889
You made it.

355
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,849
Oh...

356
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,644
The prez.

357
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,564
Nam-ra.

358
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,126
Hey, prez.

359
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,630
Am I still your class president?

360
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,303
It's nice.

361
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,807
Are you okay?

362
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,310
How have you been?

363
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,410
I've missed you, guys.

364
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,373
I've missed all of you.

365
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,335
Nam-ra.

366
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,673
I wanted to go see you,
but I didn't think I should.

367
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,008
No, it's okay.

368
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,511
Let's go. Come with us.

369
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,140
I still have things that I have to do.

370
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,392
What things?

371
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,853
Mmm...

372
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,730
There are some others like me.

373
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,733
Some of them ran away
from the school a while ago,

374
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,526
but there are still a few left.

375
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,071
You're not a zombie.

376
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,907
Don't say that.

377
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,912
You know how we're not really kids,
but also not quite adults yet, either?

378
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,164
That's like me.

379
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,208
I'm neither a human...

380
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,753
nor a monster.

381
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,462
You're not.

382
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,258
Please stay.

383
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,679
It'll be okay.

384
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,736
We're friends even if we're apart.

385
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,530
Okay?

386
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,911
Aren't we?

387
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,373
Yes, you're right.

388
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,085
Wherever we are, we'll be friends.

389
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,046
Well, that's good enough.

390
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,677
It's them.

391
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,935
See you, okay?

392
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,350
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

393
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,144
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
