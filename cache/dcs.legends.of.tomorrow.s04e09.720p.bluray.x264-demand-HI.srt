Legends Of Tomorrow...

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
[Sara] <i>Hello, John.</i>

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,997
You opened a door, love. And Mallus
wasn't the only thing that got out.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,355
Now, there's magic.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,592
The damage that these supernatural
fugitives can cause is unfathomable.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,876
- How much money do you need?
- $4.2 billion a year.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Done.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,376
[Hank] <i>I'm gonna green light
additional funding</i>

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,756
<i>to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.</i>

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,877
Hi. I'm your magical caretaker.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Your creature handler, she's great.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,999
- Mona.
- Konane.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,355
[Mona] <i>Did someone hurt you?</i>

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,318
[Hank] <i>These creatures are controllable.</i>

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,432
Project Hades is go.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,637
Stop! Where are you taking him?

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
[alarm blaring]

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,080
Oh, thank God you're back.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,390
What is going on?

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,512
Long story. Lots of twists and turns.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,910
- Some dramatic irony.
- Cliff notes, Gary.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,832
- The Kaupe is out.
- [Hank] Director Sharpe.

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,992
Gary, take him down to lockup.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,590
Aw!

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,319
What an adorable little puppet.

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,196
Eat my fuzzy dung, you dick!

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,719
Well, well, well.

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
Look who finally decided
to show up for work.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,918
Nice of you to grace us
with your presence, Director Sharpe.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,595
One of your employees
let a creature loose,

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,400
and then not surprisingly
got attacked by it.

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,069
Wait. Mona let him out?
Why would she...

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,790
I want that wolfman back in his cell,
or you're done.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,234
And fire that girl.

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,279
Of all the days this could happen.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,696
[Agent Sharpe] All right, everyone.

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,712
Screen all calls
to animal control and 911.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,520
Pull CCTV from every corner
in a ten-mile radius.

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
- Let's go.
- [man] Yes, ma'am.

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,637
- Don't listen to him.
- Sara, he's right.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,230
I never should've left Mona
in charge of those fugitives.

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,678
I should've been here, and instead,
I was off gallivanting like a...

43
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,876
Like a Legend?

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,513
Look, we're on this.

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,035
That Kaupe doesn't stand a chance.

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,515
I'll fix this.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,157
- Our potty mouth puppet is locked up.
- Wonderful.

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,920
Because I've got
another job for you, Gary.

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,553
But you're not gonna like it.

Ow!

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,709
[Mona] Mom? Dad?

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,596
What's going on?

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,637
You were in a cycling accident.

[speaking Mandarin]

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,799
[in English] I wasn't on a bike.
I was scratched by...

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,595
Konane, let go!

Oh, no. He's out there alone.

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,350
Who?

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,751
I can't talk about it.
It's work-related. Top secret.

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
[speaking Mandarin]

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
[in English] We have failed as parents.

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,074
It's all your fault.

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
[Mona speaking Mandarin]

68
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,274
[in English] Gary.

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,192
Oh, my God. I'm happy to see you.

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,715
My parents won't believe
what I really do for work.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,880
Oh, you mean betraying the people
that gave you a chance?

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,396
Ava believed in you
and you let her down.

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,755
You let us all down.

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,998
Gary, what are you talking about?

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,232
You released a dangerous beast,
and now, he's out there running free.

76
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,596
Wait. You think I let the Kaupe out?

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,120
It was the men in black.

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,431
- Didn't you see the bodies?
- No.

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,355
There was only footage of you
letting the hairy hunk man out.

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,035
Now, there's me telling you...

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
You're fired.

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,240
You can't fire me.

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,876
I swear there were two men who came
for Konane, but he killed them.

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,076
Sorry, Mona.

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,056
I really liked you, you know,
and I know it hurts now,

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,276
but in a few seconds
you won't remember a thing.

87
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,272
Don't you dare. I need my mind!

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,096
You do not have clearance
to handle this device.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,554
You can't take my memories!

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,834
What was I doing here?

91
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,355
You're here to give me your jacket.

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
[scoffs]

93
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,920
Right, right, right.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,311
And also, you were gonna
give me your time courier.

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,196
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Now, take my place,
it's almost lunchtime.

97
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Oh...

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,394
Ooh!

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Jell-O.

100
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,430
[rustling]

101
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,153
I know you're there.

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,153
Stop following me,
or I'll turn your brain into pudding!

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,076
Konane?

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,914
You're alive.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,832
I was so worried they'd find you.

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,277
Don't worry about that.

107
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,919
I know you didn't mean to hurt me.

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
- [tires screeching]
- [growls]

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,714
It's them! Run!

110
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,109
I won't let them get you.

111
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll close this behind you,
so, they won't be able to follow.

112
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,116
- Mona.
- I have to keep you safe. Go!

113
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,280
- [grunts]
- Mona! Mona.

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,432
You're safe. We're the good guys.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,273
Oh, yeah? Who sent you?

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,551
Was it the Bureau,
or the men in black?

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,994
Where is the wolfman?

118
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,720
He's gone. It's too late.

119
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,355
You'll never find him because
I don't even know where he went.

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,472
So, grill me all you want. You...

121
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,835
[gasps]

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
[thuds]

123
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,790
What kind of gun is this?

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,957
Did you just try to
"shoot her" shoot her?

125
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,390
Any hits?

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,480
I tried to isolate the portal
from today's courier activity

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,914
- but so far, no dice.
- [sighs]

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,832
It would help
if I had the actual courier.

129
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,434
Sure. Here you go.

130
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,030
Okay, never mind.

131
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,952
So, we have a vicious monster
on the loose,

132
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,191
and no idea
where it might have disappeared to.

133
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,634
He's not a vicious monster.

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,554
People just assume that
because of the way he looks.

135
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,720
- He's a demigod. He used to be a king.
- [cocks gun]

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,989
Hey, what are you doing?

137
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,753
Seeing if this thing
works on her mouth.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,316
Or how about we just give our guest

139
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,159
the dignity of hearing her story first.

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
[grunts]

141
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,041
I'm telling you.

142
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,077
The men in black are behind all of this.

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,119
They're framing me, so, they can
keep hurting the magical creatures.

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,435
Hurting them how?

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,433
I don't know, but Konane was
terrified when they came for him.

146
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,749
I was just trying to help him.

147
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,038
Mona, we saw
the security footage and...

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,309
There were no men in black, just you.

149
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,113
Well, they must have altered
the footage to hide the truth.

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,350
I'm like Mulder,

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,154
and those guys are the shadow
government covering their tracks.

152
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,709
It's a conspiracy.
The truth is out there!

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,632
Okay, Fox, okay, Fox! Take a breath!

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,475
We believe you.

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,476
Right, Sara?

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,756
Yes. We do.

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,456
And we're gonna
get to the bottom of this,

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,599
but first, we need to find the Kaupe
before he hurts himself.

159
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,989
Can you help us do that?

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,311
So, I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging?

161
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,516
What? No.

- Exactly what I needed to say.

That girl is clearly bonkers,
but the Kaupe trusts her

165
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,199
and we need her as bait.

166

What if she's not crazy?

167
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,896
What if there really is
a cover-up at the Bureau?

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,515
Then Ava would know about it
and she wouldn't allow it.

All right, fine.

176

As far as hiding places go, smack

Well, according to

El Lobo arrived on the scene
six months ago

and quickly rose to the top.

201

The mystery surrounding
his true identity

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,356
inspired novels, movies and TV shows.

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,835
I challenge you
to a <i>lucha de apuestas!</i>

321
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,679
[all murmuring]

322
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,197
The loser will take off his mask

323
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,115
and forfeit and never set foot
in the ring ever again.

324
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,395
[growling]

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,356
You heard it here,
ladies and gentleman.

326
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,432
The gauntlet has been thrown.

327
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,195
Do you accept this match
and its conditions, <i>señor?</i>

328
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,630
[all cheering]

329
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,593
Then the fight is on!

330
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,469
Tomorrow night. Same time, same place.

331
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,836
This will be one for the history books.

332
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,880
Get your tickets now!

333
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,911
So, he's back on track,
historically-speaking.

334
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,673
Now, how's that
for a bang-up job, Lancey?

335
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,630
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Hey, get back here.

336
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,915
What is going on?

337
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,390
Out of my way, fanboys. Get out!

338
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,590
[groans]

339
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,911
Damn it!
Mona's gonna get herself trampled.

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,229
[snarling]

341
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,675
You can say what you will,
but that Kaupe,

342
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,553
he's a real gent in my book.

343
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,910
So, this is where you've been living.

344
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,271
Wow! [chuckles]

345
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,757
I like what you've done with the place.

346
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,991
It's, um... It's homey.

347
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,999
It's like you're back on the island.

348
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,159
You miss Hawaii, don't you?

349
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,515
Home.

350
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,956
You miss home?

351
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
Home.

352
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,076
Mona home.

353
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Do I miss home?

354
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,394
Eh, you know.

355
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,149
Guilt-tripping parents, lack of a job.

356
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,357
No one who understands me.

357
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,678
Wow, that's beautiful.

358
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,791
[both laughing]

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,116
Mona.

360
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,716
There has to be a logical reason
why Hank replaced the footage.

361
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,950
So, let's think about it.

362
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,475
Look, I get that you
and your dad are in a good place

363
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,835
for the first time in a while,

364
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,310
but we just can't ignore
that this is happening.

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,960
But can we please reserve judgement
until we see the footage?

366
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,314
Sure, uh, the original footage
can only be restored

367
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,278
from the device used to delete it.

368
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,875
- You mean my dad's phone?
- Yeah.

369
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,069
We gotta go for it tonight.

370
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,835
He's gonna be distracted.

371
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,816
He's gonna be boozing and schmoozing
at the benefit gala.

372
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,753
[snaps fingers]
I have a plus one. Are you in?

373
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,633
Yeah. Okay.

374
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,296
Uh... As long as
we don't have to do that thing

375
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,800
where we act like we're dating.

376
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
You and I dating would be totally weird.

377
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,320
Totally weird. Yeah.

378
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,516
Um...

379
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,834
Text me the details
and I will meet you there.

380
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Yeah.

381
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Bye.

382
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,637
I must be really hungry because
that actually looks kind of good.

383
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,916
[sniffing]

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,229
[Mona] What is it?

385
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,470
[growling]

386
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,517
Where is he, Mona?

387
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,759
He's gone. You scared him off.

388
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,000
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone, love.

389
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,749
He isn't like that.

390
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,679
He's sweet and gentle.

391
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,910
He won't hurt any...

392
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,756
[grunts]

393
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,400
[grunting]

394
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,193
Eat this, you furball.

395
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,554
[Mona] Konane, stop!

396
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,958
[growling]

397
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,589
- [gunshot]
- [gasps]

398
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,835
You got one messed-up
definition of sweet.

399
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,960
[door opens]

400
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,713
[Sara] Hey, Gideon said you...

401
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,836
Wow.

402
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,071
- You got a date?
- No. It's not a date.

403
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,960
I am dressed like this

404
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,590
because the footage
you saw at the Bureau earlier,

405
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,957
was definitely altered. By Hank.

406
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,112
Okay, before I do the math on this,
are you sure?

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,317
Yeah, Mona was telling the truth.

408
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,392
There is a cover-up at the Bureau.

409
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,995
What are the chances
that Ava's wrapped up in this?

410
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,120
Honestly, I don't know yet,
but if she's not a part of it then...

411
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,793
She's probably in a lot of danger.

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,434
[elevator bell dings]

413
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Gary!

414
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,040
Close that hospital gown,
or I will report you to HR.

415
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,256
Where the hell have you been all day?

416
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,919
I don't know who I am.

417
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,952
I don't know why anything is things.

418
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,113
I don't know where my nipple went.

419
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,520
Where is my nipple?

420
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,115
- Where is my nipple?
- Gary.

421
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,716
[growling]

422
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
He was so scared.

423
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,590
I had to do something to stop them.

424
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,674
- Where were they taking him?
- Somewhere terrible.

425
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,558
That's why he can't
go back to the Bureau.

426
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,280
The men in black are gonna
hurt him again or worse.

427
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,232
Well, he can't stay in Mexico.

428
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,757
So, take him back home.

429
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,317
Back to ancient Hawaii,
to his old kingdom.

430
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,194
You saw him in the arena.
He's meant to be a king.

431
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,636
- Mona, it is not that simple.
- Why?

432
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,110
[Gideon] <i>Captain, you're being
hailed by Director Sharpe.</i>

433
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,316
That is why.

434
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Gideon, I'll take it on the bridge.

435
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,839
[Gideon] <i>I'm afraid she's overridden
my security protocols.</i>

436
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,315
Ava! Wow, look at you.

437
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,278
- You look great.
<i>- Yeah, thanks.</i>

438
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,398
<i>But listen, Sara, the situation
with the Kaupe has gotten much worse.</i>

439
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,551
<i>He now has an accomplice, Mona Wu.</i>

440
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,996
<i>Now, she may not look it,
but she is extremely dangerous.</i>

441
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,336
<i>She completely wiped Gary's mind.</i>

442
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,760
- [chair creaks]
- [Sara] Um...

443
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,195
[chuckles]

444
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,696
<i>Wait, you've had Mona in custody
this whole time and you didn't...</i>

445
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,792
It's a long story, but I need
to explain to you in person.

446
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,080
This line might not be secure.

447
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,998
<i>The line isn't secure, Sara,
what are you...</i>

448
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,755
[growls]

449
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,675
<i>You have the Kaupe, too?</i>

450
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,479
Look, I can't explain right now.

451
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,200
<i>Okay, then I'm sending
an extraction team.</i>

452
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,993
Gideon, mask our location.

453
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,151
<i>Sara, you need to bring in
that fugitive now.</i>

454
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,790
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,033
<i>Don't you dare hang up on...</i>

456
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,430
[sighs]

457
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,555
Whoa!

458
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,831
Did you just hang up
on your girlfriend?

459
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,793
Mona, you better not be wrong
about this.

460
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,357
I need to go to that benefit,
so, I can talk to Ava face-to-face.

461
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,592
Before you leave, I have a petition
to become interim captain

462
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,034
of the <i>Waverider</i> in your absence.

463
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,590
I have a John Hancock from every
Legend except you.

464
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,395
It looks like you crossed out
part of Rory's signature.

465
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,596
Really?

466
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,719
The team is to keep a low profile.

467
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,634
Radio silence and absolutely
no time travel.

468
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,834
Captain Palmer has got it covered.

469
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,434
Interim captain.

470
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
[door opens]

471
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,751
[Ray] After your recent, unfortunate
misadventures in time travel,

472
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,555
I created a team-building card game

473
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,957
to help you learn the dos and don'ts
of our prior missions.

474
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,473
I'm calling it...

475
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,992
Fun way to learn
from your mistakes, right?

476
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,800
Oh, you got to be joking.
"Vandal Savage."

477
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,036
That's a real name.

478
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,896
And here's me thinking that
Damien Darhk's moniker

I'm sure we can figure
something out once Sara gets back.

489
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,998
In the meantime, it's game time.

- [both] Oh!
- Come off it.

491

I mean, weren't you just nattering on
about team-building experiences?

492
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,992
Well, let's go out there
and actually fix something.

493
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,520
[scoffs] Well, yeah,
but Sara said to stay put.

Oh, come on, Raymundo.

495
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,959
This isn't just important
for some dusty old history book.

496
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,952
This is important
for the people of Mexico.

497
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,389
All we need to do is make sure

498
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,597
that the <i>luchas de apuesta</i>
fight goes on.

499
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,355
And make sure that El Cura
comes out on top.

500
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,830
- Grand finale.
- Yeah.

Is this your new girlfriend?

- Um, yeah. This is Zari.
- Mmm-hmm.

Zari. What a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman

Anyhoo, I'd better go make sure
everything is good

Are you blushing right now?

No, shut up. Take my toothpick.
Stay on task.

Where is the Kaupe
and why isn't he in Bureau custody?

525
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,030

- Making sure we're not overheard.

Sara, my ass is already on the line.

That's good.

Just dance.

533
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,799
I think Mona was onto something

00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,111
about secret agents trying
to infiltrate the Bureau.

535

That is insane.

- Sara...
- Just listen to me.

537
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,751
The security footage was altered
and I think Mona was framed.

538
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,473
Even if that was true, which I doubt,

539
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,313
you are still harboring a fugitive.

- Ava...
- Hand him over now.

541

We can deal with the rest of this later.

I can't do that.

I think I might be stuck.

It's time to whip you back
into fighting shape, eh, mate?

549
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,557
Okay, you need to shake off

to practice winning,

he's here to practice losing, all right?

555
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,149
I don't trust him.

556
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,879
He's never done choreography.

557
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,356
For the people to accept me
as their hero again,

558
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,193
my victory must be absolute.

Well, you'd better get to work then,

Sure, muscle memory will kick in.

In fact, it makes you a hero.

Buck loved Garima,

So, he threw the contest

If you lose tomorrow,
me and you can escape, too.

to keeping a low profile?

It's a long story,

so, just trust us, okay?

612
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,256
All right, so entering through
the north and south wings

613
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,176
is the best chance of catching
the Legends off guard.

00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,912
[announcer] And now,
the man you are all here to see,

637
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,879
the undefeated champion of the people,

638
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,393
El Lobo!

639
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,230

[growling]

641
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,836
Bring it in, gentlemen.

642
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,790
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

643
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,998
No biting, no scratching.
Nothing below the belt.

644
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,549
All right, to your corners.

645
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,359
[Hank]
The strongest of us will never know

646
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,075
what it's like to live
with this disorder.

647
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,856
- And that's why I called my work...
- [beeps]

648
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,270
Okay, moment of truth.

649
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,472
[Hank] Because victory is possible.

650
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,439
In fact, it's inevitable.

651
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,351
I don't accept this
Altruistic Angel Award for myself

652
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,999
as some pat on the back.

653
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,515
I receive it as a call to arms.

654
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,271
Let's all come together
and end this fight.

655
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
- [groans]
- Oh!

656
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,592
All right, take it easy, remember?

657
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,478
Come on, shake it off, mate,
shake it off.

658
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,336
Look, I know you feel like throwing
in the towel right now, but trust me,

659
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,432
there's nothing people like more
than a good comeback. Now go.

660
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,715

You're losing so good. Keep it up.

663
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,074
Play dead, furball.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an emergency evacuation.

668
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,712
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

669
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,590
We have some
uninvited guests here, Sara.

670
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,631
Give them hell. That's an order.

671
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,274
No outside interference.

672
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,999
Finally, a real fight!

[all cheering]

675
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,516
These fools are trying to censor us.

676
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,434
But we ain't gonna stand
for that, are we?

677
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,030
On your left, mate.

678
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,760
Nice one, Raymundo.

679
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,752
Now, El Cura and his mates

680
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,236
they fight for the people.

681
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,872
The people!

682
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,392
Now, this is what I call
a bloody good show.

683
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,194
[Charlie] He didn't abandon you!

684
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Have a towel, mate.

685
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,000
So, don't you dare abandon him!

686
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,997
- [groans]
- Whoa!

687
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,514
Come on!

688
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,720
[El Cura yelling]

689
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Yeah!

- [all cheering]
- [bell dings]

691

Yeah! Yeah!

[crowd chanting] Cura! Cura! Cura!

695
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,229
I reckon we should team-build
like this more often, Legends.

696
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,833
[sighs]

697

<i>Well, looks like you've saved
history again.</i>

698
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,114
Congratulations, Sara.

699
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,676
- Ava, just let me explain...
- No need.

700
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,119
It's all very clear to me.

701
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,516
Ava, please don't hang up...

702
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,680
On me.

703
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,995
Some night, huh?

704
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,357
We just raised over $500,000.

705
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,510
Roaring success.

706
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,760
I saw the footage, Hank.

707
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,636
The real footage.

708
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,559
Nathaniel, it was you who convinced
me to fund the Bureau.

709
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,915
Don't...

710
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,720
Please don't remind me.

711
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,673
I went out on a limb for you.

712
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,072
I need you to trust me on this.
There's a purpose to what you saw.

713
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,278
Of course, I trust you.

714
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,757
I just need you to bring me in
on these sort of things.

715
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,836
- In due time, son.
- [cell phone ringing]

716
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,590
I got to take this.

717
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,796
Yeah.

718
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,277
You cloned all the data
off that phone, right?

719
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,470
Uh-huh.

720
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,755
Good.

721
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,750
Keep digging.

722
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,360
I wanna know everything.

723
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,351
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

724
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
[agent] <i>Blame it on your son's

Kid, come here.

728

[Mick exhales deeply]

729
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,395
There's something about Buck
and Garima you should know.

730
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,233
They didn't live happily ever after.

731
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,757
They came from two different worlds.

732
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,594
Worlds that needed them.

733
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,200
They didn't belong together,

734
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,355
but they loved one another...

735
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,796
A lot.

736
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,310
How do you know?

737
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,040
The next book in the series
hasn't even been published yet.

738
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,270
I just do!

739
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Here.

740
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,274
Don't do anything stupid.

741
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,240
I'm gonna take a leak.

742
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,633
I brought snickerdoodles.

743
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,754
I'll just, um, put them here.

744
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,435
[sighs]

745
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,992
Ava, look, I'm sorry.
I didn't come here to fight.

746
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,559
I know things got ugly between us today,

747
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,838
but I just wanna put it behind us.

748
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,995
I needed one thing
from you today, Sara.

749
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,117
For you to be in my corner.

750
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,316
That's all I asked.

751
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,030
Well, I'm here now.

752
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,713
Well, that's great.

753
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,400
Just in time for my meeting with Hank,

754
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,597
where I'll probably be fired,
thanks to you.

755
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,194
Ava, Hank is the real problem here.

756
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,034
I mean, he's been
torturing prisoners off-site...

757
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,276
Who cares?

758
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,591
A few weeks ago, the Legends
were sending them to hell.

759
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,791
I mean, since when
is protecting magical creatures,

760
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,696
things that shouldn't even be
in our world in the first place,

761
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,279
more important than protecting me?

762
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,953
And when have you become so callous

763
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,793
about the prisoners in your care?

764
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,590
My priority is to protect history, Sara.

765
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,034
Human history.

766
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,550
If Hank has to experiment
on a few creatures

767
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,880
to try to find a better way
to fight them, then so be it.

768
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,677
Ava, you do not believe that.

769
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,031
Come on, I know you.

770
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,474
You're not like Hank.

771
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,914
Look, this is your Bureau

772
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,600
and he's doing
something twisted with it.

773
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,839
You don't understand
how any of this works.

774
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,912
No, Hank is the reason
that this Bureau is here.

775
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,456
If we piss him off, it all goes away.

776
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,551
Think of how many people,
how many human people

777
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
- would get hurt if that happened.
- Well, he can't shut us down.

778
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,031
Oh, my God!
Sara, everything is not about you.

779
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,318
Do you understand you're asking me
to risk everything?

780
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,677
For what? For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters? I'd...

781
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,355
For me.

782
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,835
Well, I've already given you
everything I have to give. So...

783
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,633
Today, I asked you for one thing.

784
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,560
Ava, don't do this.

785
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,710
Just go.

786
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,152
I'm done.

787
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,115
[door closes]

788
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,910
[crying]

789
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,876
Well, Konane,
it's time for our new adventure.

790
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,754
Konane, I, uh...

791
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,475
I can't.

792
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,752
I wanna live in your world.

793
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,033
I mean, look at it.

794
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,753
It's beautiful.

795
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,517
But I don't belong there.

796
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,398
[grunting]

797
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,871
If I went, I'd just be
running away from my world,

- Step away from the creature, miss.
