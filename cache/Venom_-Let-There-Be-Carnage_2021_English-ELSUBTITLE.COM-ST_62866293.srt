2
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:23,300
Lights out!

3
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,167
Cletus, are you there?

4
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,401
My angel.

5
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,434
This is for you.

6
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,534
What did the doctor say?

7
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,434
He said the mutations
are advancing.

8
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,534
My powers are too strong.

9
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,534
Cletus, I'm scared.

10
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,267
It's gonna be okay.

11
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,367
They're coming to take me away.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,067
They're sending me to a place

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,134
where there are others like me.

14
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,933
They can't do that.

15
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,734
They can't take you from me.

16
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,900
You're my one bright light.

17
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:07,033
I will always love you!

18
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,100
Frances!

19
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,234
Get off!

20
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,634
Frances!

21
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,100
No! No!

22
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,000
Any last words?

23
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:19,234
<i>Welcome to your new home,
Frances.</i>

24
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,734
<i>Your old
boyfriend's finally getting</i>

25
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,768
<i>what he deserves.</i>

26
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,534
<i>And the world will be
a safer place without him.</i>

27
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,592
<i>Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,</i>

28
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,926
<i>I don't want anything to do
with Cletus Kasady.</i>

29
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,726
<i>Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.</i>

30
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,158
Though, in my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady

31
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,926
and you blew it.

32
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:06,125
Right, um, so...
what does he want?

33
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,192
Maybe he wants
to spill the beans

34
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,392
about where the missing bodies
are buried.

35
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:14,058
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

36
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,626
No!

37
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,726
Take your tiny hands off of me!

38
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:27,993
We should be out there
protecting the city lethally!

39
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,759
What was that?

40
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,158
Unhand me!

41
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:39,192
Man should never
consent to crawl

42
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:41,859
when he has
the impulse to fly.

43
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:45,559
You are a bottom-feeder.

44
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,192
Be quiet.

45
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,859
How many times have I told you

46
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,993
that I want you to hide
yourself when I am working?

47
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,692
I am serious. It is important.

48
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,392
You have to show me respect.

49
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,259
- Respect? Respect?
- Yes. Yes.

50
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,592
- Okay.
- Okay.

51
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:03,526
Kasady gonna give you
the scoop, right?

52
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,325
- Right.
- Wrong.

53
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,759
- What do you mean?
- Because you blow everything.

54
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:08,959
Oh, okay, I see.

55
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:10,526
You're talking
about Anne again.

56
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,292
I miss her!

57
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,392
I will do it.

58
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:17,826
I don't like you.

59
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,225
<i>Let me eat him!</i>

60
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:23,626
You do not deserve nice things.

61
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,659
<i>Welcome back, Eddie Brock.</i>

62
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,659
I've been thinking about you.

63
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,559
What do you want, Cletus?

64
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,359
I mean, why am I here?

65
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:54,559
Do a man who's buried alive
a kindness, won't you?

66
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:58,192
Get a message out to all my...

67
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,225
fans.

68
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:04,425
And in return,
I'll give you my life.

69
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,492
What?

70
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,826
Story.

71
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,425
I heard the written word

72
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,292
hasn't been working out
so well.

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,492
Piece like this,
an exclusive...

74
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,526
...would put you back on top.

75
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,792
Go on.

76
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:25,626
People love...

77
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,325
serial killers.

78
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:34,726
All my secrets laid bare,
Eddie.

79
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:38,058
So much carnage.

80
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,626
But why me?

81
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,692
I like you.

82
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,893
All right, it's a deal.

83
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,058
What's your message?

84
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:54,893
That distant cathedral

85
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,592
- is all I see...
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:08:57,726 --> 00:09:02,058
<i>...fractured angel</i>

87
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,526
<i>the other part of me.</i>

88
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,526
Print that in your column.

89
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,726
Is that it? This, um...
Who's gonna...

90
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:15,192
Who's gonna read that,
some random haiku?

91
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,325
Print it,

92
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,893
and what's mine is yours.

93
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,192
Wow, lucky me.

94
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,993
Goodbye, Eddie.

95
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:27,893
Thank you.

96
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,993
Thank you.

97
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,025
<i>What a dick.</i>

98
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,959
<i>Eddie, look. Look.</i>

99
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,492
What are you doing?

100
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,726
<i>Your job for you.</i>

101
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,692
Eddie.

102
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,058
Don't forget me, Eddie.

103
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:03,926
What did you get?

104
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,926
Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

105
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:08,759
What? A little louder.

106
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,325
He read me poetry, man.

107
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,659
Is this some kind of joke
to you, Eddie?

108
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,359
Because I'm not laughing.

109
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:16,425
<i>Yeah,
you could do with a laugh.</i>

110
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,058
Come on, man.

111
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,092
These things, they just take
a little time, all right?

112
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,759
Well, the second
he gives you something...

113
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:22,993
Of course.

114
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,692
Keep me ahead of the curve,
Eddie.

115
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,158
- Don't embarrass me.
- All right.

116
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,425
Do you understand?

117
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,425
Trust me, the only scoop

118
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,959
I'm getting today
is double chocolate chip.

119
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,225
<i>No! I get brain freeze.</i>

120
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,659
<i>Come here.</i>

121
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,125
<i>Look.</i>

122
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,859
- I'm looking.
- <i>Grab those.</i>

123
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,726
All right.

124
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,459
Whoa. Okay.

125
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,492
<i>Now, what do you think?</i>

126
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,158
- I think I'm Pablo Picasso.
- <i>No!</i>

127
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:04,559
- Okay.
- <i>Come here. Look.</i>

128
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,759
- <i>Well, say what you see.</i>
- Uh, it's a house.

129
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:11,893
<i>Never mind.</i>

130
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,726
Oh, I know this one.

131
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:22,559
- It's a tree.
- <i>Idiot.</i>

132
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,359
<i>Sit down.</i>

133
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,559
<i>Now, pay attention.</i>

134
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,125
<i>Bingo.</i>

135
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,726
Holy cow.

136
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,926
Would you say your
friendship with Cletus Kasady

137
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,592
is what allowed you to solve
this decades-old mystery?

138
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,359
You are the only person
from the outside world

139
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,559
he's spoken with.

140
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:10,926
Seems he likes you.

141
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:12,759
Well, you know,
he's a serial killer.

142
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,659
I don't see how
he can like anyone.

143
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,425
<i>Brock was able to uncover</i>

144
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,526
<i>what the FBI and police
could not.</i>

145
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:22,192
<i>Bowing to public outrage,</i>

146
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,158
<i>the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium</i>

147
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,526
<i>and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.</i>

148
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,459
<i>Brock's career has been given
a much-needed revival,</i>

149
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,459
<i>putting him back on top
once more.</i>

150
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,359
<i>A harrowing story
finally comes to an end.</i>

151
00:12:57,492 --> 00:13:00,392
<i>Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families.</i>

152
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,893
<i>Thanks to the diligence
of one man.</i>

153
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,325
- <i>Thank you, Eddie Brock.</i>
- And Venom.

154
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,893
You know,
this could be us, Eddie.

155
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:13,526
Going out there, solving cases,
fighting bad guys.

156
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,425
Maybe I eat them, hmm?

157
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,692
And then we save the day.

158
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,058
<i>But we saved the day.
It's done.</i>

159
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,759
You said I could eat bad guys!

160
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,592
<i>This again?</i>

161
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,926
I need to be free,

162
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,926
feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

163
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:34,259
<i>You don't have any hair.</i>

164
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:35,993
You are not listening to me.

165
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,859
<i>Oh, I'm listening.</i>

166
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:40,659
I cannot live
like this anymore.

167
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:43,459
- I'm starving.
- <i>So eat those guys.</i>

168
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,158
I can't.

169
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,158
Sonny and Cher
are best friends.

170
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:49,792
<i>Are you serious?
That's ridiculous. That's what...</i>

171
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,893
Man, that was abusive.

172
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,492
That was abuse.

173
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,392
And that's a $2,000 TV.

174
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,726
You have got to get control
of your aggression.

175
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,225
That is why we have Snookie!

176
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,692
<i>I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone.</i>

177
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,092
<i>I need brains.</i>

178
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,592
Chickens have brains.

179
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,659
<i>I most passionately disagree.</i>

180
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,225
<i>Look.</i>

181
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,158
<i>Look at those poor idiots.</i>

182
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,325
<i>Small brains.</i>

183
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,492
Come on, man, it's not
their fault that you, uh...

184
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,492
you live on
the old phenylethyla...

185
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:25,926
- laphenylethylan.
- <i>Phenylethylalanine.</i>

186
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,325
Yeah, I just...
I just said that.

187
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,893
<i>I've told you a thousand times,</i>

188
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,659
- <i>because it is only found...</i>
- Yeah?

189
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,025
- <i>...in brains and in chocolate.</i>
- And in chocolate.

190
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,058
That's right. All right,
well, how about this?

191
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:38,559
You live in my body,
you live by my rules.

192
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,626
- <i>I live in your body because...</i>
- Why?

193
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,792
<i>...unfortunately,
I don't have many options.</i>

194
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,893
Well, how about this, son?

195
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,993
The FBI is still
investigating us

196
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,659
for all of that stuff that
"we were involved with,"

197
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,025
so if one more head
goes missing,

198
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,325
we will get hauled off
into Area 51.

199
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,726
They will kill us both.

200
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:00,659
So somebody has to be
responsible.

201
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,959
<i>Responsibility...
it's for the mediocre.</i>

202
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,792
- <i>Food!</i>
- Can you stop doing that?

203
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,392
- <i>Food! Food!</i>
- Please just stop doing that now.

204
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:13,692
- Come on, stop doing that.
- <i>Food!</i>

205
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,158
- I have a deadline! Will you...
- <i>Food...!</i>

206
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,092
Goddamn it! Fine!

207
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:25,559
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hey, Mrs. Chen.

208
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,225
Good evening, Venom.

209
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,759
He says hi. Oh.

210
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,192
Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

211
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:33,158
- <i>No!</i>
- Oh, no. We have a deal.

212
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:35,692
What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

213
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,325
I don't think so.

214
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,993
I've been keeping
my mouth shut,

215
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,158
- feeding your little secret.
- Wow.

216
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,092
Little old Mrs. Chen is
a little old blackmailer, huh?

217
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,692
Less of the old. I am 39.

218
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:49,158
- <i>And I am Barry Manilow.</i>
- Right.

219
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:51,025
<i>I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.</i>

220
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,792
No, no, you cannot eat
Mrs. Chen.

221
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:57,726
- What?
- Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan B.

222
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,692
What's plan B?

223
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,993
Aah! Not this again!

224
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,125
I need human brains to survive.

225
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,392
<i>Uh-uh.
Now, pick up some chickens, man.</i>

226
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:10,893
<i>Let's go.</i>

227
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:27,359
I'm done with this grossness.

228
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,659
Look at all the amazing things
that we can do.

229
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:40,359
We are wasting our talent.

230
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,392
Bad guy.

231
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:56,859
Hello, kitty.

232
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,526
<i>Leave him. Leave him be.</i>

233
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:03,058
<i>Leave him be! Leave him be!</i>

234
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:06,292
- I shall remove your head.
- <i>No, you won't.</i>

235
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,526
- I will use it for bowling!
- <i>No, you will not.</i>

236
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,359
I will take it to...

237
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,125
What is the one
that we like, Eddie?

238
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:13,559
<i>It's Lucky Strike.</i>

239
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,826
- Yes! Lucky Strike!
- <i>Put him down!</i>

240
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,659
I will take you
to Lucky Strike,

241
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,158
and I will score
a 300-point game.

242
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:22,058
- <i>You won't.</i>
- The rest of your pudgy little

243
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:24,692
boy body will be left here...

244
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,926
...rolling around
in dumpster juice.

245
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,025
<i>Oh, God.</i>

246
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,926
<i>No! Put him down!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</i>

247
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,826
<i>no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

248
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,726
<i>No!</i>

249
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:37,392
Fine!

250
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,225
<i>She didn't want our help.</i>

251
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,225
She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

252
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,826
There is a difference.

253
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,225
<i>It is Anne.</i>

254
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,559
<i>Anne is on the phone, Eddie!</i>

255
00:17:58,058 --> 00:17:59,526
Hey, Anne.

256
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,158
<i>Hey, E-Eddie. Hi.</i>

257
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,392
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Be nice to her.</i>

258
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:03,859
<i>You sound out of breath.</i>

259
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,626
I'm-I'm not catching you
at a bad time, am I?

260
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,125
No, no, not at all.
I'm just, uh...

261
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,359
- I'm just hanging around.
- <i>Okay.</i>

262
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:14,325
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
I haven't returned your calls.

263
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,125
I guess...

264
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:19,158
I just needed a little space
after the whole...

265
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,592
alien biting a guy's
head off thing, so...

266
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,259
<i>Ah, the good old days.</i>

267
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,259
Anyway, so I have some news,

268
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:27,259
and-and I was wondering
if we could meet.

269
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,592
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

270
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,025
<i>That would be fine. Great.</i>

271
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,192
Okay, great.
Uh, how's tomorrow night?

272
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,492
Tomorrow night? Yeah, great.

273
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:38,659
- <i>8:00?</i>
- L'Araignée?

274
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,058
- Okay, great.
- Looking forward to it.

275
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:41,425
Oh... Yeah, okay.
Me, too. Bye.

276
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,592
Great.

277
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:43,859
<i>It's over with the doctor!</i>

278
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:45,259
<i>That is the voice of a woman</i>

279
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,225
<i>who just got brutally dumped.</i>

280
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,192
Stop.

281
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:58,225
<i>Don't you want
to look your best?</i>

282
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,225
Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

283
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,158
Wow.

284
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,792
Hey.

285
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:11,626
Hey.

286
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,659
- Okay. Hi.
- Yeah.

287
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,792
Wow.

288
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,692
<i>Awkward.</i>

289
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,692
So, uh, h-how's it going?
How's, uh...

290
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,859
- How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah.
- Uh, good, good.

291
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:27,826
You know, he's still wiping
his ass on the carpet.

292
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,559
He learned that from you.

293
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,259
Yeah, how-how's, uh...
how's the legal aid work going?

294
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,359
Well, you know how much
I love an underdog, so...

295
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,325
Yeah. Yeah, that's why you...

296
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,359
put up with me
for so long, huh?

297
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,392
You said it.

298
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,926
- S-So...
- So...

299
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,158
<i>So?</i>

300
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,325
I don't know, I-I thought
it would be better

301
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,325
to tell you in person that...

302
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,359
Uh-huh.

303
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,025
<i>No!</i>

304
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,626
Wow. Oh, Anne.

305
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,025
Wow, that is, uh...

306
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,459
that is so much bigger
than the...

307
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:01,993
the one that I got you.

308
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,526
<i>Ugh, it's gaudy.</i>

309
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,526
That's Dan, right?
Doc-Doctor Dan.

310
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:07,025
Yeah, that... it's Dan.

311
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:08,959
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

312
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:09,993
Are you okay?

313
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,425
Yeah, I'm okay.

314
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,726
- <i>Well, I am not okay.</i>
- Yeah.

315
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,158
You could just say,
"Congratulations.

316
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,692
I'm happy for you."

317
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,225
You know, like two people

318
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,058
who still care enough
about each other to lie

319
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,158
so that the other one doesn't
feel like complete shit. I...

320
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:23,826
Maybe we could do
that version of this?

321
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,158
No, I am...
I am happy for you, Anne.

322
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,692
- You know, I'm, uh...
- <i>No.</i>

323
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,025
Congratulations.

324
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:30,492
Thank you.

325
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:33,225
<i>That was going to be us, Eddie.</i>

326
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,592
<i>I, for one, would not
be inconsolable</i>

327
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:37,325
<i>if Dan were to fall
into traffic</i>

328
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,058
<i>and lose his head and his feet</i>

329
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,158
- <i>and all of his teeth!</i>
- What?

330
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,325
What was that?

331
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,859
What? Nothing.

332
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,425
Whoa.

333
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,526
If I ask you a question,

334
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,893
do you have the ability
to tell me the truth?

335
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,559
You mean as in being

336
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:54,659
super happy for you
because of your engagement?

337
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,325
Because, I mean,
you just told me to lie,

338
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:58,325
so that's really,
really confusing.

339
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,626
Is Venom with you?

340
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,826
He's dead.

341
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,726
<i>I am.
I'm playing dead right now.</i>

342
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,058
Yeah, I mean, he...

343
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,959
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,459
- Okay.
- Okay.

345
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:12,158
Well, that's...

346
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,993
You just don't change, do you?

347
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,526
What are you talking about?
This is just a...

348
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,659
It's a huge shock.
Um, I'm in...

349
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,225
Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

350
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,325
No, the truth is you don't
love anybody. You can't.

351
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,359
Commitment's just not
your thing.

352
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,926
All right, then, fine.

353
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,158
Do not marry Dan.

354
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,859
- Dan makes me feel safe.
- Ugh.

355
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:35,726
Okay, and you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

356
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,325
And sometimes you just
have to know when to get off.

357
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,926
- Yeah, and not yak.
- <i>And not yak!</i>

358
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:41,492
You know, not yak.

359
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,158
Yak.

360
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:48,192
Hey, Venom.

361
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,359
Take care of him, all right?

362
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,425
Don't let him keep
messing everything up.

363
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,359
<i>I'm going to make you cry
now, Eddie.</i>

364
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:58,125
<i>She will love it.</i>

365
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,125
<i>Cry. Cry.</i>

366
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,993
It's a lot to process.

367
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,492
Congratulations, Anne.

368
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,526
It's great news.

369
00:22:19,993 --> 00:22:21,125
<i>Slow down, pal.</i>

370
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:22,459
Why?

371
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,659
You don't believe
in consequences.

372
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,158
No injuries. You fix them.

373
00:22:27,292 --> 00:22:29,325
No hangovers. You mend them.

374
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,526
I couldn't even hurt myself
if I tried.

375
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:44,092
<i>Eddie, I apologize
that I can't mend the heart.</i>

376
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:47,425
<i>Emotional pain,
it hits much harder,</i>

377
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,826
<i>and it lasts longer.</i>

378
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:55,225
<i>You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and take it.</i>

379
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,526
Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

380
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,792
<i>Why?</i>

381
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,225
Because I'm a real boy

382
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,058
and you're just an amoeba.

383
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,859
<i>I will only take that</i>

384
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:09,492
<i>because we are hurting
right now.</i>

385
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,492
<i>Don't worry, buddy.
I will get you through this.</i>

386
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,792
Do you know what always
cheers me up

387
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,926
in the morning, Eddie?

388
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,759

<i>Uh, no, it's a bad idea.</i>

440

I mean, I-I-I put him there.

441
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:28,325
<i>Actually, he put himself there</i>

442
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,792

<i>if I polish off

You can't be sure who is

451
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,392
- <i>They're in prison!</i>
- Yeah, but, you know,

452
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,926
some people take
false confessions.

453
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,359
They, uh... you know,
they take pleas.

454
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:53,659
We watched <i>Making a Murderer.</i>

455
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,859
You all right?

456
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:56,492
Yeah, man, I'm just practicing.

<i>I am a predator, Eddie.</i>

- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Lions do not eat salad.</i>

459
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:02,225
Yeah, but you're not a lion,
are you?

460
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,092
I mean, I see you
more of a vexatious little

00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,192
pig, dog, house bat thing.

462
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,392
That's fine.

463
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,325
- <i>You suck.</i>
- You suck!

464
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:11,158
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, wow.

465
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,993
I don't have
an explanation for that.

466
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,192
I think I just... I'm having
a panic attack, um...

467
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,859
Yeah, I'll sign here.

468
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,893
Stand two feet away
from the bars.

469
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:22,993
No touching the condemned.

470
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,058
Understood.

471
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:28,192
Visitor's here.

472
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:37,559
This is a "me" thing,
not a "we" thing.

<i>Everything is a "you" thing.</i>

Oh, happy day for
you, Eddie Brock.

475
00:27:43,192 --> 00:27:45,926
Mm, what a scoop.

476
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,559
The end of the Magical...

00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:50,559
Misery Tour.

478
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:53,526
I worry for your soul.

479
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,158
How will you live
with the weight

480
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,993
of snuffing out a man's life?

481
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,025
I was, uh... I was hoping

482
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:01,192
maybe you could give me
a couple pointers.

483
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:06,392
Funny little guy, aren't you?

484
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:08,158
<i>Don't need that.</i>

485
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,192
<i>My memory is outstanding.</i>

486
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,726
<i>Rude.</i>

487
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,459
Consequences.

488
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:20,158
Every decision you ever make.

489
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:23,726
Who do we leave behind,

490
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,392
and how do we leave them?

491
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:31,158
A connubial bed, empty,

492
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,158
waiting in the darkness

493
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:37,325
for the rescuer
who never comes.

494
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:38,692
Because of you.

495
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:40,325
<i>This guy makes zero sense.</i>

496
00:28:40,459 --> 00:28:44,359
You and I are the same.

497
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:46,692
No. No, we're not.

498
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:50,058
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

499
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,893
You feel like home to me,
Eddie, like family.

500
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,225
And really, truly,

501
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,025
that is all I ever wanted
in this world.

502
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,492
Family.

503
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,826
Well, killing your grandmother
and your mother

504
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,526
sure is a funny way
of showing it.

505
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:10,359
Anything you want to unburden
yourself with before...

506
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:15,225
...um, this happens?

507
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,692
Yes.

508
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:22,626
I have wishes
to bestow upon you.

509
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,125
<i>Oh, that is kind.</i>

510
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:28,125
I want to wish you...

511
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:30,125
this heartbreak.

512
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:32,025
<i>Uh-oh. Too late.</i>

513
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:35,826
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

514
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:37,826
as you always have been.

515
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,192
<i>Watch it, pal.</i>

516
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:40,826
Wh-Where are you going
with this?

517
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,192
You are a cancer

518
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,859
to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

519
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,425
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

520
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,826
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

521
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,659
after you killed his wife,
your mother,

522
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,559
just by being born.

523
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,492
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

524
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:03,392
No, no! No, no, no, don't!
Don't!

525
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:05,759
<i>Speak to my friend
again like that... I dare you!</i>

526
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,158
Hey, hey!

527
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,125
No touching the inmate.

528
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,559
Hey, back up!

529
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:19,526
Eddie?

530
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,325
You're done.

531
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:26,726
I have tasted blood before,
my friend, and that is not it.

532
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,492
Eddie Brock has a big secret.

533
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:32,158
Shut up, Kasady!

534
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,826
<i>That may have been a mistake.</i>

535
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,859
Shut up.

536
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:47,926
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

537
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:49,993
I don't know anymore.

538
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,826
<i>Eddie!</i>

539
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,592
I don't want to hear
another word out your mouth.

540
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,325
- <i>Eddie.</i>
- I don't want to hear it.

541
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,325
<i>Eddie, I am sorry.</i>

542
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,859
<i>That was his last
time on record ever.</i>

543
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,359
There's no more...
any words for his victims or...

544
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:06,025
You know, they're gone.

545
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,425
Any clues
of outstanding bodies,

546
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,225
we-we've lost forever
and completely.

547
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,759
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

548
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,392
- You didn't mean to?
- <i>And I said I'm sorry.</i>

549
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:14,859
You didn't mean to,
but you did it.

550
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,392
I mean, you just decided...
I don't know.

551
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,726
That's it, you did it.

552
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,292
You know,
you didn't even think

553
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:20,959
that we might get caught,
we might get killed?

554
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,559
No, you don't think about
things like that, do you?

555
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:24,192
You just think about chickens,
you think about you,

556
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:26,893
you think about what you want,
and you think about you.

557
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,792
<i>Let me remind you
of something, Eddie.</i>

558
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:30,626
<i>You were a loser
before I came along.</i>

559
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,692
<i>You were nothing.
I made you special.</i>

560
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:34,158
Oh, you made me special, huh?

561
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,492
Well, let me tell you
something, right?

562
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,058
Before you came along,
I had a life.

563
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:38,692
I didn't have chickens,
all right? But I had dreams.

564
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,125
Yeah, I had dreams,
and I had a fiancée,

565
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,826
and I had a really successful
TV show!

566
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,826
<i>Ah, but you destroyed all
of those things by yourself.</i>

567
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:48,158
Yeah, but you know what?
I rebuilt my life,

568
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:49,993
and now I just want to live it.
Good night.

569
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,392
<i>And how did you build
this new life?</i>

570
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:52,826
- Hmm?
- Excuse me?

571
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,759
Well, who found the clue
on the wall

572
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:57,192
so you could be
this big, shiny hero?

573
00:31:57,325 --> 00:31:58,826
Hmm? Who found the clue?

574
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,592
- Who?
- Wow.

575
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:01,859
Yeah.

576
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:03,359
No, no, no.

577
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:07,058
This is not about
being a hero for me, man.

578
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:10,692
This is about wanting
to live in peace.

579
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:13,826
D-Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

580
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,325
No, you don't.

581
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,692
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

582
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,225
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live

583
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,826
without you whining
in my ear all the time

584
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:24,659
about eating bad guys
or, like, nagging me about Anne

585
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,993
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

586
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,826
Do you know how lucky you are
that I chose you?

587
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,559
You chose me?

588
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,559
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

589
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:36,559
when your friends kicked you
off the planet Ming Mong

590
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,192
'cause you are a reject!

591
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,659
You are a pariah.
Lethal protection, my ass.

592
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,659
You couldn't protect anything.
You are useless.

593
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,359
You couldn't get a job
down here cleaning toilets!

594
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:47,392
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:48,692
I don't know what came over me.

596
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:49,993
Please, let me fix it.

597
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,592
So I can break it again!

598
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,993
You son of a bitch.

599
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:08,826
Out!

600
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,058
Get out.

601
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:11,592
Take your stuff. Get out!

602
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,993
This is my house.

603
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,225
No!

604
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,659
Keep it down up there!

605
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:21,959
Get out!

606
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,659
Sonny?

607
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,359
You wouldn't dare!

608
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:37,459
Yeah, absolutely.

609
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,792
No, no, no!

610
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:43,392
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- No!

611
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:44,959
I'm calling the police!

612
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,792
I-I am so sorry.

613
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,392
Show yourself.

614
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:05,826
You can't win!
Take a look at me.

615
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,759
Look at the size of you.

616
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:09,526
Puny.

617
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,259
How dare you?

618
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,392
I guess this is goodbye.

619
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,659
Oh, yeah.
Finally something we agree on.

620
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,459
What in the world?

621
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:33,158
All this crazy shit.

622
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:34,792
Yeah.

623
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:48,692
Hmm?

624
00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:53,325
No. No.

625
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,359
No, no, no, no.

626
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,092
No!

627
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:01,225
Yeah!

628
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,225
No!

629
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,325
- Yeah!
- No!

630
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,025
Oh, yeah.

631
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,225
No.

632
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:16,893
No, no, no.

633
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:18,726
I wish I never met you!

634
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:21,926
<i>Sayonara!</i>

635
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:37,292
Cletus Kasady,
you have been tried, convicted

636
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,492
and sentenced to death
by the state of California.

637
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:46,392
May your passing bring closure
to the victims' families,

638
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:50,292
and may you find peace
in the hereafter.

639
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:53,025
Soon come chaos.

640
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:55,792
Chaos soon come.

641
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,492
Are those your final words?

642
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,359
Enjoy the show.

643
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,025
Warden.

644
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:45,526
Something wicked...

645
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,859
this way comes.

646
00:36:57,592 --> 00:37:00,259
Somebody let me out!

647
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,759
Don't move!

648
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,225
Hey!

649
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,158
Please.

650
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,559
I got a family.

651
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,192
Any last words, Warden?

652
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:16,025
Don't! Please!

658
00:40:56,984 --> 00:40:58,617
Come on, don't look at me
like that.

659
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,350
It was never,
never gonna work out.

660
00:41:00,484 --> 00:41:01,717
All right?

661
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:13,584
Yes.

662
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,450
<i>Just because of
how quickly he moved in...</i>

663
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,951
<i>...the offensive line cannot pick him up.</i>

664
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,517
<i>Breaking news.</i>

665
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:20,684
<i>Serial killer Cletus Kasady
is on the run...</i>

666
00:41:20,817 --> 00:41:22,183
Shit.

667
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:23,617
<i>...as a statewide
manhunt is underway...</i>

668
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,617
- Oh, shit.
- <i>...after last night's audacious</i>

669
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,084
<i>escape from San Quentin Prison.</i>

670
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,984
<i>It is absolutely chaos here.</i>

671
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,317
<i>We have reports
of multiple casualties.</i>

672
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,851
<i>We don't how Cletus Kasady...</i>

673
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:43,317
- Hey.
- What, you're not dead?

674
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,684
No.

675
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,550
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:48,150
Come on in.

677
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:51,884
Uh, yeah, I was just seeing
for myself on the news.

678
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:55,150
Yeah, on a scale
of one to ten, it's 11 bad.

679
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:57,217
Reports coming
from San Quentin are,

680
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,384
quite frankly, bananas.
Nice TV.

681
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,617
W-Well, how-how did he do it?

682
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,317
- Yeah, how did he, indeed?
- Yeah.

683
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,018
That's the million-dollar
question.

684
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,384
And yet again, you were
his special visitor.

685
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,183
So, what did he tell you?

686
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:11,250
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

687
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:13,250
Nothing about an escape plan?

688
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:15,751
Nothing about some kind
of elaborate breakout costume?

689
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:17,283
No.

690
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,817
Well, how come, every time,

691
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:20,984
you seem to be at the center
of these things

692
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,450
and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

693
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,084
Maybe I'm lucky.

694
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:28,183
Yeah, right.

695
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:31,984
You-you said, um...

696
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,250
...the reports coming out

697
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,517
of San Quentin are bananas?

698
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:38,417
What-what do...
what do you mean by "bananas"?

699
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,851
Remember when I asked you
a similar question...

700
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:42,717
- Uh-huh.
- ...the day you interviewed him?

701
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,817
Information is currency.

702
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:47,350
You of all people
should know that.

703
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,384
Come on.

704
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,384
I thought he'd come
to try to find the man

705
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:58,350
that nearly got him executed,
but I guess not.

706
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:00,183
I'd lay low if I was you.

707
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:02,951
I'll see myself out.

708
00:43:12,317 --> 00:43:13,617
Okay, think.

709
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:15,417
Think, think,
think, think, think.

710
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,417
What would Venom do?

711
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,250
He would find you
before you find me,

712
00:43:19,384 --> 00:43:20,984
and he would eat your face!
Damn.

713
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:23,018
All right.

714
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,851
<i>Who do we leave behind,</i>

715
00:43:24,984 --> 00:43:26,817
<i>and how do we leave them?</i>

716
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,550
- <i>A connubial bed, empty...</i>
- "Connubial bed."

717
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:32,018
- <i>...left to rot...</i>
- Is it marriage? What...

718
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,951
<i>...waiting in the darkness for
the rescuer who never comes.</i>

719
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,417
I don't understand.

720
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,317
"That circle of hell..."

721
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,617
<i>Because of you.</i>

722
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:46,651
- <i>You and I are the same.</i>
- "With one bright light"?

723
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:48,784
<i>Twisted insides, mean daddies.</i>

724
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,217
"Bright light."

725
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,384
<i>You feel like home to me.</i>

726
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:56,051
- <i>Like family.</i>
- St. Estes.

727
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,751
<i>Crapola!</i>

728
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:19,183
<i>Another one bites the dust.</i>

729
00:44:32,951 --> 00:44:37,084
Look at all these weirdos.

730
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:39,018
My kind of people.

731
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:42,817
- Nice costume.
- Hey!

732
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:44,784
Awesome work.

733
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,051
Greatest costume ever.
Oh, my God.

734
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:50,018
- Oh.
- Is that Japanese?

735
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,951
No, I made it myself.

736
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:54,118
- Hey.
- Who, me?

737
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,118
Hello, gorgeous.

738
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,118
Sorry, no, you're not my type.

739
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,984
I am out of the Eddie closet.

740
00:45:27,217 --> 00:45:30,283
Hello, darlin'.

741
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:32,283
Ooh, racer red.

742
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:34,150
Got to have it.

743
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:41,951
<i>Let's get this party started.</i>

744
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,283
Oh, hell yes.

745
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:47,851
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

746
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:49,651
Hey! Stop!

747
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:51,517
Stop that! Stop! Stop!

748
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:53,183
Ah, shit.

749
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:01,717
- You are real.
- I am.

750
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:05,150
And once I kill that thing
that made me,

751
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:07,851
we will be indestructible.

752
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:12,217
I know where to find him,
but first,

753
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,250
I need you to help me find
something I lost.

754
00:46:16,384 --> 00:46:18,917

Thank you, one person.

772
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:25,118
Eddie was wrong.

773
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:30,450
He kept me hidden
because he was ashamed.

774
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,250
But look at me now.

775
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,250
You love me, and I'm free!

776
00:47:39,283 --> 00:47:41,751
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

777
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:45,984
Stop this cruel treatment
of aliens.

778
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:48,283
It is wrong.

779
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,684
All of us should be able
to live together

780
00:47:50,817 --> 00:47:52,684
upon this ball of rock.

781
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:55,684
Yeah!

782
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:58,484
Free to be who we be!

783
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,118
I love you!

784
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,517
I love you, too.

785
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:07,350
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

786
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,018
Lethal Protector out.

787
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,517
Whoa, that was
a hard act to follow.

788
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,250
I wish you could have
seen me tonight...

789
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:28,917
...Eddie.

790
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,817
Holy shit.

791
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:19,884
- Mulligan.
- <i>Uh, it's Eddie Brock here.</i>

792
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:21,550
Look, uh, this may be
a long shot,

793
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:22,984
but I-I think
I may have found something.

794
00:49:23,118 --> 00:49:24,717
Go on, Eddie. What do you got?

795
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:26,450
<i>Last time I spoke to Kasady,
he was talking to me</i>

796
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,684
about connubial beds
and-and marriage.

797
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:30,450
And, uh, it didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

798
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:33,183
but, um, I'm here at St. Estes,
and I found this, uh...

799
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:35,984
<i>Well, I'm standing
in front of a... of a...</i>

800
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:37,684
<i>of a tree,
and I'm-I'm looking at it.</i>

801
00:49:37,817 --> 00:49:39,150
<i>It's, uh...
it's got a carving on it.</i>

802
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:43,817
It says "CK loves FB."

803
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:46,018
I'm thinking that maybe
whoever this FB is

804
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,484
might know where he's headed.

805
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:51,150
And, uh... a-and if you can,
I don't know,

806
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:52,851
pull up some files
from St. Estes,

807
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:56,684
<i>maybe you can figure out
who this FB is.</i>

808
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:59,350
FB, that's, uh...
that's Frances Barrison.

809
00:49:59,484 --> 00:50:02,051
Wow. That-that's quick.

810
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:04,217
Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie.

811
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,450
She's dead.
I, uh... I shot her.

812
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:48,917
Can I help you, sir?

813
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:07,384
Got any of those internets?

814
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,317
You're alive.

815
00:51:35,984 --> 00:51:39,018
When I get out, I'm gonna
slice your face off

816
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,784
and wear it to a party!

817
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:43,018
You're never getting out
of here, Siegfried.

818
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,817
No one does.

819
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:52,084
Well, Frances,

820
00:51:52,217 --> 00:51:54,417
<i>it seems your sweetheart
has done a Houdini act</i>

821
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,417
<i>over there at San Quentin.</i>

822
00:51:58,217 --> 00:52:00,250
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

823
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,851
<i>Oh, don't get excited.</i>

824
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:04,817
<i>He's not gonna find you.</i>

825
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:10,350
<i>Screw you.</i>

826
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:12,517
<i>How flattering.</i>

827
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:14,051
But you're not my type.

828
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:16,118
I wonder where he could be.

829
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:21,784
<i>I'm right here.</i>

830
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,717
<i>Ta-da.</i>

831
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:46,484
Hi, baby.

832
00:52:49,617 --> 00:52:51,484
I...

833
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:54,484
don't want you
to freak out, okay?

834
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:57,784
Um, I'd like you to meet...

835
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:00,084
Carnage.

836
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,350
That is so hot.

837
00:53:32,617 --> 00:53:33,951
Go!

838
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:47,118
A '66.

839
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,417
My dream car.

840
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,018
Yeah, I remember.

841
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,651
Let's see what you got.

842
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:25,617
Mm, mm.

843
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:34,051
Yes, baby!

844
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:53,517
<i>This is SFPD. Stand down.</i>

845
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:20,317
Stop!

846
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,851
You'll kill him!

847
00:55:21,984 --> 00:55:25,350
<i>She does that
again, I'll eat her face.</i>

848
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,150
He's sensitive to sound.

849
00:55:32,283 --> 00:55:35,517
<i>Stop the vehicle. Stand down.</i>

850
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,651
Who said romance was dead?

851
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:52,417
Hey. No drunks in here.

852
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:57,817
Help me. Food.

853
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,684
Out. You get out!

854
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:01,651
Chocolate.

855
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,751
Venom?

856
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:07,450
<i>I'm having trouble</i>

857
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:10,150
<i>keeping them standing, Mrs. C.</i>

858
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,150
Where's Eddie?

859
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:14,851
Food.

860
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,550
Monsters!

861
00:56:25,684 --> 00:56:28,217
Monsters everywhere!

862
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,350
They're everywhere!

863
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:32,884
Monsters!

864
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:51,851
Put out an APB.

865
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:53,651
Form a perimeter.

866
00:56:53,784 --> 00:56:55,584
Blockade state lines.

867
00:56:55,717 --> 00:56:57,517
And bring in Brock.

868
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,450
I'm no use to anybody here.

869
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,817
I'm just wasting your time.

870
00:57:03,951 --> 00:57:05,584
Well, you know
what I keep thinking?

871
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,250
I keep thinking,
"What else is Eddie Brock

872
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:08,751
"not sharing
about Cletus Kasady?

873
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,118
"Now, why was it Eddie
that Cletus wanted

874
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,717
to witness the execution?" Huh?

875
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,951
Bad things happen around you.

876
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,317
Multiple dead bodies
at your building last year,

877
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:21,384
that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

878
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:24,018
and only you
at the Life Foundation

879
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,217
when that rocket exploded.

880
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,283
And now Clyde's found Bonnie,

881
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:30,018
and there's a dead psychiatrist
at a facility

882
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,717
I knew nothing about
until today.

883
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:33,951
And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

884
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,884
Monsters?
Uh, what-what do you mean...

885
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:38,884
- what do you mean, "monsters"?
- Monsters, Eddie!

886
00:57:39,018 --> 00:57:41,550
Everywhere Cletus goes,
so goes this supposed monster.

887
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:44,283
- Oh, God.
- Talk to me, Eddie.

888
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,084
Talk to me!

889
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:50,018
How's he doing it, Eddie?

890
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:52,984
<i>What's the secret?</i>

891
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:55,118
<i>How's he making people
see things?</i>

892
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,484
All right, I, uh...

893
00:57:58,018 --> 00:57:59,851
I can't answer any more
of your questions

894
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:01,784
without making my phone call.

895
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,684
I'll get you your phone call.

896
00:58:08,817 --> 00:58:10,951
But you know
what secrets want, Eddie?

897
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:12,651
They want out.

898
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,484
That's why they're
so hard to keep.

899
00:58:23,517 --> 00:58:25,550
Eddie asked you to do this?

900
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:27,150
And he doesn't have anyone else
that can help him?

901
00:58:27,283 --> 00:58:28,317
We're gonna be late
for the party.

902
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,651
He's in trouble, Dan.

903
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:31,350
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

904
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:34,484
Are there gonna be
aliens again?

905
00:58:34,617 --> 00:58:36,617
No, of course not.

906
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,051
I'd like to speak to him alone.

907
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,051
Well, your duty of honesty
supersedes

908
00:58:42,182 --> 00:58:45,183
your duty to the client
if somebody gets harmed.

909
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:47,517
They teach you that
at posh school?

910
00:58:48,884 --> 00:58:50,517
Oh, hey. Anne.

911
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:53,018
Hey, Anne, thank you so...
thank you so much for coming.

912
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,183
Boy,
that little guy's a charmer, huh?

913
00:58:56,317 --> 00:58:58,584
How much do I need to worry
about you right now?

914
00:58:58,717 --> 00:58:59,984
Uh, I-I messed up.

915
00:59:00,118 --> 00:59:01,517
Okay. How badly?

916
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:04,084
Uh, it couldn't be worse,
and it's-it's all on me.

917
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:05,484
Whatever you did, Eddie,

918
00:59:05,617 --> 00:59:07,317
you just need to tell
the cops the truth.

919
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,283
No. No.
No, I can't tell them

920
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:11,283
that they are chasing
a serial killer

921
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:14,684
who's also
got an alien inside of him.

922
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:17,217
And he's capable
of killing everybody.

923
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,283
Venom.

924
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,484
Talk to me. What's happening?

925
00:59:23,617 --> 00:59:26,317
No, he's-he's not here.
He's not here.

926
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,550
Is this, like, an "I'm lying"
"He's not here,"

927
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:32,317
or is this a real
"He's not here"?

928
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,617
He's not here.

929
00:59:33,751 --> 00:59:35,217
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

930
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:37,250
<i>St. Estes fire. All units.</i>

931
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:38,717
What the actual f...

932
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,550
- Eddie, think. Think.
- I don't know. I don't know.

933
00:59:40,684 --> 00:59:42,350
All I know that...
i-is that he can't go long

934
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:44,018
without eating food, right,
so he's eating chicken

935
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,684
and he eats chocolate,
and that's it.

936
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:48,684
And that is only if he's still
observing the rules.

937
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,584
We need to find him.

938
00:59:53,717 --> 00:59:55,817
You mean I need to find him.

939
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:57,517
Yeah, you need
to find him, please.

940
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:59,317
And then I-I... I will fix it.

941
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,751
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

942
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:05,917
Mrs. Chen.

943
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:07,651
- Who's asking?
- It's me.

944
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:10,884
What do you want?

945
01:00:11,018 --> 01:00:12,751
- Oh, she's a charmer.
- Okay, listen.

946
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:13,817
You broke Eddie's heart.

947
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,183
Okay, I actually
don't have time

948
01:00:15,317 --> 01:00:16,450
to explain why
that's wildly off the mark.

949
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:17,584
Do you know where Venom is?

950
01:00:17,717 --> 01:00:19,450
You want to break
his heart, too?

951
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:21,217
I'm not gonna get into
who did what to who.

952
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,018
Eddie said that he might be
here because of the chocolate.

953
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,651
I-I just need to speak
with the alien.

954
01:00:24,784 --> 01:00:26,484
Wha... Hey, you said there
weren't gonna be any aliens.

955
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:28,617
- I meant more aliens.

- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

965
01:00:47,183 --> 01:00:48,118
Eddie needs Venom.

966
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,350
She just called me a pussy.

967
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:50,751
He said he didn't need him,

968
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:52,517
that life was better
without him.

969
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:55,784
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care...

970
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:57,817
Oh, wait a second.

971
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,751
You get out here right now.

972
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:06,084
Do you... D-Do you see that?

973
01:01:06,217 --> 01:01:08,784
- Seriously, do you see that?
- Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

974
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:10,917
Eddie's going to
have to fight this battle

975
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:13,084
all by his little bitch self.

976
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:14,917
Oh, don't be a big baby.
Go help your friend.

977
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,517
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets.

978
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,784
Cletus will come for him.

979
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:21,217
He won't survive without you.

980
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,118
Of course he won't.

981
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,150
Because I am the hero
of the two of us.

982
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,651
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

983
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:34,617
You're the coolest,

984
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:37,118
you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

985
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,550
I am.

986
01:01:38,684 --> 01:01:40,150
You know, I'm still
standing right here.

987
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:42,684
No one likes you, Dan!

988
01:01:42,817 --> 01:01:44,684
I love seeing you in action.

989
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:52,417
Let's go save that asshole.

990
01:01:58,084 --> 01:02:01,350
I promised
we'd be free from here.

991
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:05,283
And we'd walk to
the cathedral on the hill.

992
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,118
A wedding.

993
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,851
Three guests.

994
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,250
One for each of us.

995
01:02:13,384 --> 01:02:15,984
The cop that took my eye.

996
01:02:16,118 --> 01:02:18,283
Eddie Brock.

997
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:20,851
And Venom.

998
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,150
A red wedding.

999
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:31,118
You... you didn't find him?

1000
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,717
Oh, my Lord.

1001
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:46,517
What happened?

1002
01:02:56,784 --> 01:02:58,317
Hey, Dan.

1003
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,917
All right, let's go.

1004
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:01,917
<i>I'm not talking to him!</i>

1005
01:03:02,051 --> 01:03:03,951
Well, he doesn't want
to come out.

1006
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:05,651
What-what do you mean?
We-we have to leave right now

1007
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,183
'cause Cletus is gonna
wipe the city out.

1008
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,617
<i>We're not doing
shit until he apologizes.</i>

1009
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:12,018
So, he's looking for an apology.
Look, I know that amends aren't

1010
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,517
- really your thing, but...
- An apology?

1011
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:15,250
What, like, as in right...
right now, an apology?

1012
01:03:15,384 --> 01:03:18,651
<i>I need him to beg.</i>

1013
01:03:18,784 --> 01:03:20,784
Fine, I will be
the bigger of us.

1014
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:24,317
<i>I will always be the bigger of
us, but go on.</i>

1015
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,684
What did he say?
What is he saying?

1016
01:03:25,817 --> 01:03:27,484
He said he's listening
very sincerely.

1017
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:28,817
All right, listen to this.

1018
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,051
I am sorry.

1019
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:31,984
<i>Not the right tone.</i>

1020
01:03:32,118 --> 01:03:33,550
I'm sorry.

1021
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,784
<i>Nope.</i>

1022
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,617
I-I am sorry.

1023
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,150
So weird.

1024
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:39,450
I'm sorry!

1025
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:40,784
I don't know why
you're shouting at me.

1026
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,183
Well, 'cause...
Okay, well, fine.

1027
01:03:42,317 --> 01:03:44,517
I was a... I was a loser
before I met you.

1028
01:03:44,651 --> 01:03:46,217
- <i>Yep. That's right.</i>
- And, uh...

1029
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,051
and now I am someone.

1030
01:03:50,183 --> 01:03:52,550
All right? You made me special.

1031
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:53,784
<i>Damn right.</i>

1032
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,051
Why don't you put
a cherry on it?

1033
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:58,084
A cherry on that? Right. Um...

1034
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:00,084
I'm...

1035
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:02,984
I-I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said.

1036
01:04:03,118 --> 01:04:05,018
- <i>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>
- Everything that I did not say.

1037
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,617
- Everything that I did, you know.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1038
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,018
And probably everything
that I-I did...

1039
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,484
I did not... I did not do.

1040
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,283
- <i>Mm...</i>
- Yeah, he's thinking.

1041
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:14,183
- <i>Hmm...</i>
- Come on. Come on.

1042
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:17,751
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Whoa.

1043
01:04:17,884 --> 01:04:19,751
Whoa! Oh.

1044
01:04:19,884 --> 01:04:20,984
Oh, no.

1045
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:22,450
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1046
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:24,250
Are you gonna...
are you gonna kiss me now?

1047
01:04:24,384 --> 01:04:25,984
- No.
- No?

1048
01:04:26,118 --> 01:04:27,684
Oh, God,
I'm never doing that again.

1049
01:04:27,817 --> 01:04:29,183
God, well, maybe never.
I don't know.

1050
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,450
Honestly, it's really fun.

1051
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:32,118
<i>If we save the day,</i>

1052
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,384
<i>can we call ourselves
the Lethal Protector?</i>

1053
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:35,617
That is so '80s.
Dan, pack quickly.

1054
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:37,984
Don't stay.
And if for any reason...

1055
01:04:38,118 --> 01:04:39,384
Fire and sound.

1056
01:04:39,517 --> 01:04:41,183
"Fire and sound"?
Is that a band?

1057
01:04:41,317 --> 01:04:42,951
- No, it's what kills them.
- Yeah.

1058
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:44,684
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

1059
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,350
<i>Not sorry.</i>

1060
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,484
- Oh...
- God, I'm so sorry.

1061
01:04:51,617 --> 01:04:53,717
Man, those two need some
serious couples counseling.

1062
01:04:57,817 --> 01:05:00,283
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

1063
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:06,417
Shit. Oh, my God.

1064
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,684
Kasady, place your hands
on your head!

1065
01:05:12,817 --> 01:05:14,784
Which, um...

1066
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:16,917
hands?

1067
01:05:17,051 --> 01:05:18,317
What the...

1068
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,250
We found you.

1069
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:28,250
Shriek will be so pleased.

1070
01:05:32,817 --> 01:05:34,817
Yoo-hoo!

1071
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,317
Brockalicious.

1072
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:56,051
Bling-a-ling.

1073
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:00,951
Now, whose finger
were you meant for?

1074
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:07,018
Ah.

1075
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,984
A nice, shiny lure

1076
01:06:10,118 --> 01:06:12,450
for a little fishy.

1077
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,984
Okay. Here we go, buddy.

1078
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,517
Hello, Anne.

1079
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:35,118
I just incapacitated
your boyfriend.

1080
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,951
Now, he'll be okay...

1081
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:39,617
with an answer about
where Eddie Brock is.

1082
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:43,118
Well,
I'm sure as shit not gonna tell you that.

1083
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,984
It's a shame to hurt you.

1084
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:55,517
Tell Brock
Cletus will make a swap.

1085
01:06:55,651 --> 01:06:57,984
Her head for his.

1086
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,484
He's gonna kill you both.

1087
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,817
Peeps have tried that already.

1088
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:05,984
Botched it.

1089
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:19,684
<i>They can't find him!</i>

1090
01:07:19,817 --> 01:07:21,684
They are hunting us,
too, buddy.

1091
01:07:23,584 --> 01:07:25,150
Come on, where are you?

1092
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:32,751
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

1093
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:34,884
- Eddie, they got her.
- <i>Huh?</i>

1094
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,817
- They've taken Anne!
- Calm down.

1095
01:07:36,951 --> 01:07:38,183
Yeah, they took her
to their wedding.

1096
01:07:38,317 --> 01:07:39,884
- They took her where?
- <i>Their wedding.</i>

1097
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,884
- Grace Cathedral. Hurry.
- <i>We're on our way.</i>

1098
01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:44,817
All right, it looks like
we are going to a wedding.

1099
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:46,817
<i>Oh, will there be canapés?</i>

1100
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:48,651
You bet your ass.

1101
01:08:24,751 --> 01:08:28,018
That distant cathedral

1102
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,350
is all I see.

1103
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:36,450
Fractured angel,

1104
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,317
the other part of me.

1105
01:08:40,651 --> 01:08:42,317
D-Dearly beloved...

1106
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:44,118
Gifts first.

1107
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,018
Actually, traditionally...

1108
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,150
Shut your mouth.

1109
01:08:50,183 --> 01:08:51,317
Father.

1110
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:55,717
Baby, I got for you
what you want most.

1111
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:57,217
The cop?

1112
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,817
The cop.

1113
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:00,484
Continue, Father.

1114
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:04,484
Dearly beloved, if anyone
objects to this marriage,

1115
01:09:04,617 --> 01:09:07,217
speak now
or forever hold th-their...

1116
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:11,118
Where is she?!

1117
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,350
There you are.

1118
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,350
Death to you, Father.

1119
01:09:18,484 --> 01:09:19,350
No!

1120
01:09:19,484 --> 01:09:21,150
Not you, Father.

1121
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,784
You, Father.

1122
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,317
Oh, shit!

1123
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:28,018
Uh, where you going?
What are you doing?

1124
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:29,751
<i>This is much
worse than I thought.</i>

1125
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:32,317
<i>That is a red one. Wow. Uh...</i>

1126
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,584
- Red one?
- <i>We should leave immediately.</i>

1127
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,350
<i>Annie will get over it.</i>

1128
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:38,584
<i>We never liked her anyway.
So let's go.</i>

1129
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:39,984
Now?

1130
01:09:40,118 --> 01:09:41,118
<i>Congratulations
to the happy couple.</i>

1131
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,450
<i>We are leaving.</i>

1132
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,350
Eddie! Yoo-hoo.

1133
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:47,051
I'll be right with you,
all right? Mm.

1134
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,051
Okay, you need
to come out right now.

1135
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,817
Because I am feeling super,
super vulnerable right here.

1136
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:53,617
Brock's just like you?

1137
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:54,984
Not for long.

1138
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,018
Eddie, over here!

1139
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,051
You need to come out right now.

1140
01:10:01,183 --> 01:10:03,884
I will let you eat everybody.
You can eat 'em all!

1141
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:06,717
Apart from him in the robe.
You cannot eat him.

1142
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:08,517
- <i>Promise?</i>
- I promise.

1143
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:12,917
<i>Thank you.</i>

1144
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,684
Baby!

1145
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:30,651
Shut your mouth.

1146
01:10:31,984 --> 01:10:33,984
Marriage trouble already?

1147
01:10:35,951 --> 01:10:37,450
Time to die.

1148
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:39,118
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

1149
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,150
I mean us.
We are going to die.

1150
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:25,617
I-I killed you.

1151
01:11:25,751 --> 01:11:28,484
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

1152
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:36,183
You, kill him,
but keep your mouth shut.

1153
01:11:36,317 --> 01:11:38,917
<i>Our wife knows
what she's doing.</i>

1154
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:41,018
Just turn it down.

1155
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,717
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1156
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:46,484
- Stop him.
- My cop!

1157
01:11:53,283 --> 01:11:54,784
Honeymoon over?

1158
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,617
Oh, God. No.

1159
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,884
Power up.

1160
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:02,051
<i>No!</i>

1161
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,817
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Cletus Kasady...

1162
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:38,817
What do they say
about an eye for an eye?

1163
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:50,317
Fire and sound.

1164
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,550
Except without the sound.

1165
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:56,283
Baby!

1166
01:12:59,018 --> 01:13:00,051
Cletus!

1167
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,984
<i>Mano a mano,</i> Brock.

1168
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:41,450
You know how I spent
my endless days?

1169
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:53,617
I spent them thinking about

1170
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:57,317
how you only told
one side of the story.

1171
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:14,217
You didn't write about the part
where Cletus was abused

1172
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:17,517
by Mommy, Daddy and Granny!

1173
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:55,450
You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

1174
01:14:55,584 --> 01:14:58,018
that no one cared about

1175
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:01,183
and no one came to save!

1176
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:09,484
You never asked yourself why!

1177
01:15:09,617 --> 01:15:13,018
That's bad journalism!

1178
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:22,584
Oh, happy days.

1179
01:15:31,617 --> 01:15:34,183
I'm not a crazy man,

1180
01:15:35,283 --> 01:15:38,751
but I am a vengeful one.

1181
01:15:42,884 --> 01:15:45,084
You're going to watch her die.

1182
01:15:51,283 --> 01:15:53,784
Anne! Anne!

1183
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:10,517
Do something!

1184
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,183
Eddie, I'm afraid
we cannot beat them.

1185
01:16:21,484 --> 01:16:24,817
Baby, that's too much.

1186
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,917
You got to stop him.

1187
01:16:28,051 --> 01:16:29,784
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1188
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,784
I'll shut her up for good.

1189
01:16:33,084 --> 01:16:35,684
No, stop! You're hurting her!

1190
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,183
<i>Get up!</i>

1191
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:43,150
I can't.

1192
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,350
<i>Look. Look.</i>

1193
01:16:46,484 --> 01:16:48,317
<i>They're not symbiotic.</i>

1194
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:50,450
Get away from her!

1195
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:51,617
Shut up.

1196
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:53,651
<i>Get your hands off my wife!</i>

1197
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:58,018
<i>They're not a match.</i>

1198
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,684
We are.

1199
01:16:59,817 --> 01:17:02,350
<i>That's right. We are.</i>

1200
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:05,951
Together, we are...

1201
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:09,951
The Lethal Protector!

1202
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:30,784
Let there be carnage!

1203
01:18:52,584 --> 01:18:55,051
I got you. You okay?

1204
01:19:25,118 --> 01:19:28,584
Father, one of us must die.

1205
01:19:28,717 --> 01:19:30,851
<i>We need fire.</i>

1206
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,684
Or sound.

1207
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:52,951
No!

1208
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:12,517
Holy mackerel.

1209
01:20:49,317 --> 01:20:51,784
He did not taste good.

1210
01:21:04,617 --> 01:21:06,250
I'm a killer

1211
01:21:06,384 --> 01:21:08,984
with or without
the monster, Eddie.

1212
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:12,951
You know what I really wanted?

1213
01:21:14,317 --> 01:21:16,183
No. What was it, Cletus?

1214
01:21:16,317 --> 01:21:19,084
I told you,
but you weren't listening.

1215
01:21:20,217 --> 01:21:21,751
Well, I'm listening now.

1216
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,584
I wanted your friendship.

1217
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:29,984
I'm sorry, Cletus.

1218
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:34,183
Fuck this guy.

1219
01:21:56,317 --> 01:21:58,417
You in there,
get him out of here.

1220
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,250
They're gonna come
for you both.

1221
01:22:00,384 --> 01:22:01,917
I know.

1222
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,584
Hey, Anne.

1223
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:07,217
Take care.

1224
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,450
Yeah, you, too, champ.

1225
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:13,984
Dan!

1226
01:22:14,118 --> 01:22:15,617
You take care, too.

1227
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:17,317
Thanks.

1228
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:19,018
I like you.

1229
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,817
We totally
didn't need him, though.

1230
01:22:20,951 --> 01:22:24,517
Honestly, I think he was more
of a hindrance than a help.

1231
01:22:38,084 --> 01:22:39,951
Monsters.

1232
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:51,484
That there is Don Quixote,

1233
01:22:51,617 --> 01:22:54,984
and the guy next to him
is, uh, S-Sancho Panza.

1234
01:22:55,118 --> 01:22:56,651
They're two
very different people

1235
01:22:56,784 --> 01:22:59,283
who have very different takes
on the world.

1236
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:02,150
D-Different ways
of doing things.

1237
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:04,617
Sometimes they didn't like
each other a whole lot,

1238
01:23:04,751 --> 01:23:07,317
but ultimately...

1239
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,283
they worked together to bring
out the best in each other.

1240
01:23:11,717 --> 01:23:15,450
<i>Eddie, the time has come.</i>

1241
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,684
<i>I must go alone.</i>

1242
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:19,751
<i>It is me they want.</i>

1243
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:21,484
Yeah.

1244
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:25,617
Well, my dear Sancho,

1245
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,984
facts are the enemy of truth.

1246
01:23:29,118 --> 01:23:30,851
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

1247
01:23:30,984 --> 01:23:32,784
It means...

1248
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:37,751
It means that we are...

1249
01:23:37,884 --> 01:23:39,584
- frien...
- <i>Fugitives!</i>

1250
01:23:39,717 --> 01:23:41,917
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1251
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:44,084
- <i>On the run.</i>
- That, too.

1252
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:00,817
Thank you
for bringing me here.

1253
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:03,317
Yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

1254
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,517
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1255
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:08,984
I'm sorry that we can't
do anything about the old

1256
01:24:09,118 --> 01:24:11,450
"wind in your hair"
situation, but...

1257
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:15,118
Osho says,
when you love someone,

1258
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:18,018
- you accept the whole person...
- Osho?

1259
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,651
...with all of their defects.

1260
01:24:20,784 --> 01:24:22,183
"Defects." Hmm.

1261
01:24:22,317 --> 01:24:23,717
Nobody is perfect.

1262
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,283
Just go back.
Go back a minute.

1263
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,851
You telling me...
you just said that you love me.

1264
01:24:27,984 --> 01:24:29,517
- Um...
- You did.

1265
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:33,684
Where will we go?

1266
01:24:33,817 --> 01:24:36,684
I don't know. I don't know.

1267
01:24:36,817 --> 01:24:39,384
Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

1268
01:24:39,517 --> 01:24:42,150
Oh! You really meant it!

1269
01:24:42,283 --> 01:24:43,851
Yeah.

1270
01:24:43,984 --> 01:24:46,283
We will need a cape
and a mask.

1271
01:24:47,684 --> 01:24:49,018
No.

1272
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,217
No, I think you got
that covered. We're good.
