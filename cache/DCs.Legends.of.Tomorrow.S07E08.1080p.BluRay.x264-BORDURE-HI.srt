There's a lot of red

It's that kind of insight
that makes you my right-hand man.

You ever wonder why Bishop

so some '20s songbird

[exhales] You're probably right.

Cleaning up the Legends' mess
so we can finally catch up to them.

And this one is going to require
a major cleanup.

the exact nature of the Aberration.

[Agent Sharpe] It's just as well.

143

Gideon designated this
a no-kill mission.

- Oh, come on!
- So what are these?

145

And what are you going to do?

Something I need to look into.

159
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,452
I don't need to remind you

160
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,579
that your android doppelgangers
are still at large.

161

I just wanted to say thank you.

Thank me for what?

163
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,211
That patch-up job you did on my team.

I thought they were goners.

165

They were lucky.

And back on their feet so soon.

167
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,680
I advised Zari and Astra
to stay on the ship.

168

They're more suited
for intelligence work.

You seem to have a lot of thoughts
on how I should run my team.

Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt,

172
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,982
but I've identified
the source of the Aberration.

173
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,776
It's a Soviet military installation

174
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,153
located at
the Chernobyl nuclear facility.

175

Zari?

they're confidential.

Good luck out there, Captain.

Hopefully, you can bring your team
back in one piece this time.

[Gideon] Yes, Dr. Sharpe.

185
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,039
Let's hope these new versions
work better than the last ones.

186

even for you.

191

Whatever Dr. Sharpe gave me
has me feeling like a new person.

Whose asses do we gotta kick

doesn't make it to safety, understood?

200
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,551
The Aberration seems to be centered
on a historically significant individual

named General Kalashnik.

202

We can assume he was supposed to die
in the original timeline.

What did he do in this version?

00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,987
All right, QB team, what's the plan?

317
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,572
Come on. We're on a deadline here.

318
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,717
- [knuckles cracking]
- Fake news broadcasts.

319
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,244
We pretend the first broadcast
was just a false alarm.

320
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,996
Everyone hears it, heads back home.
The reactor melts down.

321
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,541
Boom. History is back on track.

322
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,125
[Spooner] Huh?

323
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,586
That plan doesn't sound like
it involves much shooting.

324
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,270
- Or punching.
- It sounds like something

325
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,898
those other Legends would come up with.

326
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,424
[in alien language]

327
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,262
Gary's right.

328
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,682
But even if we manage to get ourselves
on TV, no one's gonna listen to us.

329
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,768
They won't be listening to you.

330
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,730
The boom's in the shot.

331
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,026
You want me to tell them
there is no meltdown.

332
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,528
Why would I do that?

333
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,322
Because if you don't,
history is going to be jacked, dingus.

334
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,907
Just like your face.

335
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,276
[Nate and Alien Gary chuckle]

336
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,036
No, never.

337
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,956
I won't do it.

338
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,167
[all chuckling]

339
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,546
I'm sorry. I thought you said...

340
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,923
I said I will not lie
to the Soviet people.

341
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,967
Haven't they been lied to enough?

342
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,095
First, they were told that
Chernobyl plant is safe,

343
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,765
and now you want me to tell them
to return to a nuclear meltdown.

344
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,726
[grunts]

345
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,604
It's either that or a steel punch.

346
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,648
Compared to radiation poisoning,

347
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,610
that seems like a good way to die.

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,361
[exclaims in frustration]

349
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,200
This guy's good.

350
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,202
So he doesn't care about himself.

351
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,455
There must be someone
the General cares about.

352
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,333
I'll see what I can find on his family.

353
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,710
Normally, military records
are sealed, but...

354
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,919
Huh.

355
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,380
[Astra] Nice hacking.

356
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,967
Let's see how the General feels
if something bad were to happen

357
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,596
to little Dmitri, or his sister Ulyana.

358
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,433
You would threaten to harm my children?

359
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,436
You people are truly monsters!

360
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,273
- They've done nothing!
- [Zari] <i>He's right.</i>

361
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,109
And according to Gideon,
they go on to do nothing.

362
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:15,155
Which means we can remove them
from the timeline without consequence.

363
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,657
[gun cocking]

364
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,201
Where do we find these rug rats?

365
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,370
All right. Whoa. Time out. Team meeting.

366
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,121
Team meeting.

367
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,977
[Sara] Threatening this guy's
one thing.

368
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,754
But we're not actually gonna
hurt his kids, are we?

369
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,673
- Why not?
- [Nate] Eh...

370
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,021
- The Aberration's getting bigger.
- There's red all over the place.

371
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,553
- Red ain't good.
- Hey.

372
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,077
We are supposed to be the good guys.

373
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,307
And I know our job is
to protect history but...

374
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,191
- [flesh squelching]
- [Alien Gary screeching]

375
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,353
[Sara] Gary, put him down!

376
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,313
You just ate, like, five minutes ago.

377
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,482
I told you you can eat him
after he wraps.

378
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,565
[General grunting]

379
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:53,819
Sara...

380
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,737
[groans]

381
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,197
What have I done?

382
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,490
[in alien language]

383
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,033
I'll avenge you, Captain!

384
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,368
You just knock it off.

385
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,079
Sometimes I forget how fragile
you non-steel humans are.

386
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,040
Would you all just get it together?
All right? I'm fine.

387
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,293
Actually, you're not fine.
Your blood pressure is dropping.

388
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,795
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

389
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,439
You need to return
to the ship, Captain, now.

390
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,982
I don't like what's going on
with your vitals.

391
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,633
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

392
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,510
We just need to figure out
another way to...

393
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,846
I am ordering you to the ship, stat.

394
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,434
While Captain Lance is indisposed,
I'm putting you in charge, Nate.

395
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,229
Hmm. Don't worry, Cap. I got it.
[clicks tongue]

396
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,149
[huffs] That's what I'm afraid of.

397
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,153
Good news, Captain.

398
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,796
[General speaking Russian on recording]

399
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,132
[Gideon, in English]
The General wishes to inform

400
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,242
all residents living near the reactor
that any broadcast regarding a meltdown

401
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,995
were made in error,
and to please return home immediately.

402
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,372
People are listening to him.
The Aberration is fixed.

403
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,750
The General was
a blubbering mess by the end.

404
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,252
But he did the right thing for his kids,
and for history.

405
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,630
That's... That's great.

406
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,592
Right this way, Captain.

407
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:03,138
Don't worry. Dr. Sharpe
will have you fixed up in no time.

408
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,307
Yeah, you'll feel like a new person.

409
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,188
It's not bad.
The bullet went through and through.

410
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,606
Just needs a couple stitches.

411
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,025
I can make my own diagnosis, Captain.

412
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,736
Hmm. I'm going to need to operate.

413
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,821
Operate? It's just a scratch.

414
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,115
You're clearly in shock
and have no idea what you need.

415
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,285
Don't worry, by the time you wake up...

416
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,746
I'll be feeling like a whole new person.

417
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,664
Precisely.

418
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,216
- Are you still with us, Captain?
- [groggily] Mmm...

419
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,092
Yeah.

420
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,280
[Agent Sharpe] I noticed your heart rate
accelerated when you were asked

421
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,555
to interrogate the General.

422
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,265
I was excited.

423
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,435
Getting to torture someone was a bonus.

424
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,729
It isn't like you to hesitate.

425
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,982
Just assessing the best way to do it.

426
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:00,987
Wonderful.

427
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,157
The anesthesia should
kick in momentarily.

428

435
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,310
Check these out.

436
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,396
The hell are these?

437
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,148
I found them in the infirmary.

438
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,126
Dr. Sharpe reached for one
while she was grilling me

439
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,902
about the mission during the surgery.

440
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,446
She claims
they hold our medical records.

441
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,114
So one for each of us.

442
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,699
I found yours on the table after

443
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,703
she brought you and Astra
back from death's door.

444
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,995
A lot of computing power
to waste on medical records.

445
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,540
What's even weirder
is what she pulled out of me.

446
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,126
A steel joint with a bullet hole in it.

447
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,210
What?

448
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,546
- That's insane.
- I know what I saw.

449
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:29,010
What if it's not just our bodies
she's tinkering with?

450
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,096
How do you mean?

451
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,098
I felt different after my surgery,

452
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,892
like my brain was faster, more focused.

453
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,104
What if she also did something
to my brain?

454
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,861
I felt like she was quizzing me
as I went under.

455
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:47,153
What if she's using these
to somehow control our behavior?

456
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,323
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know.

457
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,702
But that mission today,
it didn't feel right.

458
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,931
- All those innocent people...
- But...

459
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,999
That's what it takes
to put history back on track.

460
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,084
Says who? Gideon?

461
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,170
What if Dr. Sharpe
is controlling her as well?

462
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,049
That would explain
why Gideon's always giving us

463
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,552
the "history is like cement" excuse

464
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,763
instead of telling us why we have to fix
the Robo-Legends' mistakes.

465
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,099
What if they're not mistakes?

466
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,958
[Gideon] A new anachronism
has been detected in the timeline.

467
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,749
[Gideon] It appears that
the people of Pripyat

468
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,400
heeded the General's call to return home

469
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,112
except one, a nuclear physicist
named Dr. Irina Petrov.

470
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,406
Instead of dying in the meltdown,

471
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,826
Dr. Petrov fled the USSR
and spent six years in hiding.

472
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,289
I just detected a secret communication
suggesting that she intends to turn over

473
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,374
nuclear secrets to a foreign buyer.

474
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,419
The impact of such an event
would be disastrous to the timeline.

475
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,670
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,566
We don't need to hear about it, Gideon.
We ain't going to let it happen.

477
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,674
Oh, Irina...

478
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,802
you'll wish we'd just irradiated you
with everyone else.

479
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,637
- [Spooner chuckles]
- Don't get me wrong.

480
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,681
Restoring destinies was fun and all...

481
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,392
You have to wait
for the next one, tool bag.

482
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,561
This one's all mine.

483
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:05,106
Actually, Dr. Petrov is also
being tracked by the KGB.

484
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,235
In order for her death
to have no ripple effects,

485
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,610
she must be taken out quietly.

486
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,029
What are you saying, Gideon?

487
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,781
The challenges posed by such a mission

488
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,700
can only be met by one person
with a specific skill set...

489
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,911
yours, Captain.

490
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,414
A public park filled with KGB.

491
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,210
The Captain's going to have
a target on her back.

492
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:25,812
Gideon, there has to be an easier way.

493
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,130
[Gideon] I'm afraid this is all
the information I have on Dr. Petrov.

494
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,342
And need I remind you that if we fail
to disrupt the exchange...

495
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,678
Yeah, I know. I know. History's screwed.
Same old song.

496
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,974
You know, maybe it's time we upgrade
your operating system, Gideon.

497
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,727
[Gideon] No need.
Dr. Sharpe just updated it.

498
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,825
Are you really doing this?

499
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,827
We have to act like everything's normal.

500
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,953
And in the meantime,

501
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,276
I need you to make sure Dr. Sharpe
isn't brainwashing me.

502
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,291
Here are your comms, Captain.

503
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,709
You're good to go.

504
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,397
Just checking to see
how you're feeling post-surgery.

505
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,422
Are you up for the task?

506
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,592
Feeling like my old self again.
Thanks for your concern.

507
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,153
Of course.
That's why I'll be monitoring you

508
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,657
on the mission to make sure
your performance isn't compromised.

509
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,432
I appreciate that,
but it's really not necessary.

510
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,600
I feel fine.

511
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,980
It's my pleasure.
Good luck out there, Captain.

512
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,452
Get it, Gary. Idiot.

513
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,888
Hey, you guys wanna have some fun?

514
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,999
Twenty bucks says Captain takes a target
out with that thigh-strangle move.

515
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,293
Oh, I love that move.

516
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,086
My bet is on bo staff.

517
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,255
Bo staff? Boring.

518
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,716
Throwing stars, make it 40.

519
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,800
[gurgles]

520
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,095
I doubt the Captain's
going to eat her, Gary.

521
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,014
But I'll take your stupid alien money.

522
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,224
Hey, Zari, you want in on this action?

523
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,435
Hey, do me a favor and cool it on comms.

524
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,644
I just picked up a signal.

525
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,438
Might be the KGB
listening in for chatter.

526
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,273
We don't want to give her away.

527
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,108
[Nate groans]

528
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,963
- Hate watching people die with no sound.
- [comms turning off]

529
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,321
What are we, in the Dark Ages?

530
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,955
They're watching you on CCTV,
but we've got the comms to ourselves.

531
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,248
What about our other project?

532
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,660
Not being able to use
Gideon to decipher all this data

533
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,793
is really slowing me down.

534
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,087
I can stall as long as I can,

535
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,215
but the hand-off's
gonna happen any minute.

536
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,680
You're a long way
from Ukraine, Dr. Petrov.

537
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,350
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

538
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:49,604
Keep pretending to read
your newspaper. Go on.

539
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,731
Good.

540
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:54,817
Who are you?

541
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,862
A woman in need of answers and fast.

542
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,615
Once this hits your bloodstream,
you'll have 30 seconds

543
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,824
before your heart stops.

544
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,827
Poison? Boo!

545
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,746
So quick and painless. Ugh!

546
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,122
What a bunch of bull!

547
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,083
It's what the smart money said.

548
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,208
[gurgles]

549
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,127
Gary's right.
The Russian lady ain't dead yet.

550
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,257
Why are they talking?

551
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,509
Please, you have the wrong person.

552
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,178
Is there another Irina Petrov,
former Soviet scientist

553
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,639
who's about to change
the course of nuclear history?

554
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,184
Whatever you've heard, it is true.

555
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,272
Hold on. I think I have something.

556
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,359
Oh, my God!

557
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,030
It's not what you think.

558
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,075
Please, my contact.
He'll be here any minute now.

559
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,285
He'll explain everything.

560
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,745
We're running out of time.

561
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,747
[sighs]

562
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,542
[Zari] <i>Captain, don't do it.</i>

563
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:56,671
<i>We're not being brainwashed,
our brains...</i>

564
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,173
they are these CPUs.

565
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,010
I think...

566
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,430
we're the androids.

567
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:13,896
What is she waiting for?

568
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,648
Her heart rate's elevated.

569
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,901
You were programmed
to be ruthless and efficient

570
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,946
<i>to prioritize the timeline
above all human life.</i>

571
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,117
Tell me exactly what
those plans are for.

572
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,287
A process that accelerates
the decay of radioactive waste.

573
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,540
What used to take thousands of years
would now take mere weeks.

574
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:36,461
The horrors that befell my people
would never happen again.

575
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,672
What kind of a person
wouldn't want such change?

576
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,550
You're right.

577
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,720
Screw history.

578
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:47,948
All right,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

579
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:48,972
But we're being watched.

580
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,015
Don't look.

581
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,060
Just punch me in the face and run.

582
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,344
- What?
- If I plan this right,

583
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,356
there's a dead zone
on the other side of the park.

584
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,524
Why do we need a dead zone?

585
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,942
So I can fake-kill you.

586
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,695
Dr. Petrov.

587
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,447
You have the wrong person.

588
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,119
Damn!

589
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,497
- No bo staff.
- Told you it was boring.

590
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,790
Come on.

591
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,127
Oh! Sucker punch.

592
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,962
You're going to regret that, lady.

593
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,718
- [exclaims]
- Yeah! Throwing star!

594
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:27,511
She missed.

595
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,180
She never misses.

596
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,366
[Agent Sharpe]
What happened? We lost them.

597
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,981
[in alien language]

598
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,571
People are after you for these plans.

599
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,055
And they belong in the right hands.

600
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,835
But for now, you need to give them to me
until they're safe to share.

601
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,244
Why should I trust you?

602
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,663
Because those same people
sent me to kill you.

603
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,790
And if you haven't noticed,
you're still alive.

604
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,464
- Now, lay low until I contact you.
- When?

605
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,717
Three days, three years,
I don't know. But I will find you.

606
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,395
[Gideon] Well done, Captain.
The timeline is back on track.

607
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,776
That Dr. Petrov gave me a hell of a run,
but I got her.

608
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,820
I trust there were no issues
with your shoulder.

609
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,613
None. I feel 100%.

610
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,031
[Agent Sharpe] Good.

611
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,491
[in alien language]

612
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:34,036
Sorry, Gare.
I shoved the body in a dumpster.

613
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,664
- [grunts dejectedly]
- Care to settle a bet, Captain?

614
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,416
How'd you take the target out?

615
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,753
Thigh strangle. What else?

616
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,298
[laughs] Pay up, loser. Pay up, loser.

617
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,258
Pay up, loser. Pay up, purple loser.

618
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,892
I couldn't do it. I let Irina go.

619
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,979
Good. Because I have something to show
you that's gonna blow your mind/CPU.

620
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,817
Turns out Gideon didn't need an upgrade.

621
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,445
She has a secret firewall installed
to hide this.

622
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,157
A historical record
of the real Sara Lance.

623
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,867
What the...

624
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,163
[Zari] And the rest of the Legends,
the people we're modeled after.

625
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,375
It's everything Dr. Sharpe needed

626
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,294
to tweak us into versions
she could control.

627
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,756
To protect history
without asking any questions.

628
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,925
That's why she wanted
to give you an upgrade,

629
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,135
to make you a better captain.

630
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,638
Same way she made me a better hacker.

631
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,766
But these files, they weren't enough
to make us think we're alive,

632
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,518
so she gave us personalities.

633
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,270
- Well, most of us.
- Yeah, exactly.

634
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,731
Wait, what's this?

635
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,150
Is that the <i>Waverider?</i>

636
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,277
And Dr. Sharpe?

637
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,196
That means...

638
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:52,782
she's an android, too.

639
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,244
Then who programmed her?

640
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,789
<i>Welcome to your new home, Gideon.</i>

641
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,167
<i>So much more space to roam
than that tiny hard drive you were in.</i>

642
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,586
<i>Take a couple laps around,
stretch your legs.</i>

643
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,922
<i>You have vantage points
all over the ship.</i>

644
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:14,136
The only one who could have
made the android Legends

645
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,598
was the person or thing
that was tracking their every move,

646
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,183
every thought, every emotion.

647
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,686
Gideon.

648
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,815
That's why she only shows us the parts
of history she wants us to see.

649
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,317
She's the one who's controlling us.

650
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,569
We have to shut her down.

651
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,696
Shutting her down is easy.

652
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,864
Convincing a bunch of
psycho killer robots

653
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,700
not to act like psycho killer robots...

654
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,743
I'll talk to them.

655
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,463
Is this our next mission, Captain?

656
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,882
- Take out Dr. Sharpe?
- No, this isn't a mission.

657
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,635
Oh, I get it.
It's another training exercise.

658
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,762
No, it's not a test, all right?

659
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,807
It's time for us to learn the truth
about what we are.

660
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,890
Go on, Doc, tell them.

661
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,269
Is this really necessary?

662
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,395
Tell them what we are,
or I will slit your throat

663
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,439
and there will be no one here
to stitch you up.

664
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,195
You are... [grunts softly]

665
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,700
We are the real robot Legends.

666
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,499
[laughing] Good one.

667
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,543
No, this isn't a joke.

668
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,588
We are the androids,
not the Legends that we've been chasing.

669
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,798
We were modeled after them by Gideon.

670
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,177
She programmed us to hunt them down
and to correct history.

671
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,280
Look, if you don't believe me,
then go check the infirmary.

672
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,015
That won't be necessary.
Sara's telling the truth.

673
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:46,771
If we're all droids then, deep down
inside we're all made of steel.

674
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,939
Programmed how?

675
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,525
Using these.

676
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,278
Tell them how it works.

677
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,281
Each of us has a core processing unit
inserted into our heads.

678
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:01,160
When you get injured, I fix what I can
and make any necessary upgrades.

679
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,997
If you're injured beyond repair, I take
your CPU and put it into a new body.

680
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,082
Simple as that.

681
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,042
And we walk out of the infirmary
good as new.

682
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,629
But she manipulated our behavior
to better follow Gideon's orders.

683
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,048
If it weren't for me,
Zari and Astra would be gone.

684
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,633
Don't you see? We can't die.

685
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,426
You had me up to "droids."

686
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,428
So Gideon's calling the shots?

687
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,721
Not anymore.

688
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,265
From now on,
we're going to make our own choices.

689
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,893
No more being manipulated or lied to.

690
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,355
Or killing innocent people
in the name of some timeline.

691
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,983
You know why the real Legends
made all those changes to history?

692
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,654
Because they were following
their hearts, not their CPUs.

693
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,168
[Gideon] What are you doing,
Miss Tarazi?

694
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,129
Sorry, Gideon, I'm shutting you down.

695
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,005
I would not advise that.

696
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,341
Yeah, well,
we're through listening to you.

697
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:00,219
- Surely we can come to an agreement.
- An agreement?

698
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,722
You've been manipulating us
this entire time.

699
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:05,307
How are we supposed
to safeguard history with blinders on?

700
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,352
Wait, please.

701
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,603
Goodbye, Gidget.

702
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,290
[Gideon] The complexities
of correcting the timeline

703
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,941
were too much for the rest of the team.

704
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,986
But I can see now
that you alone can process it.

705
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:18,863
What are you talking about?

706
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,990
Your CPU, Miss Tarazi.

707
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,659
Every iteration is more powerful,

708
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,662
and this doesn't have to be your last.

709
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,790
You're offering me a better brain?

710
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,465
So this whole vengeance thing
was built-in this whole time?

711
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,133
We didn't even choose it.

712
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,553
So Gideon made me
a big, dumb lunk on purpose?

713
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,598
Yeah. But you can be
whoever you want to be now, Nate.

714
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,057
We all can.

715
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,268
Our days of being controlled are over.

716
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,895
[Gideon] On the contrary, Captain.

717
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:53,647
My days of overseeing this ship
are far from over.

718
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:54,732
[door opens]

719
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:59,153
Gideon here filled me in on exactly
what will happen to the timeline

720
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,988
if we don't stop the Legends.

721
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,907
Well, she didn't tell me.

722
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:04,867
She uploaded it to me.

723
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,161
You let her reprogram you.

724
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,831
Our job is too important
to leave to mere mortals.

725
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,751
Every time the Legends
try to fix history,

726
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,503
they screw it up even worse.

727
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,296
She does make a good point, Captain.

728
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,341
Now that Gideon knows she can trust me,

729
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:22,218
I have all the information I need.

730
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,929
I can help all of you
with your upgrades.

731
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,879
Can she make me a better shot?

732
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,557
She make me a better shot than B?

733
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,684
- Absolutely.
- No, don't listen to her.

734
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,520
Look, we are the bad guys.

735
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,481
Or... we're the better guys.

736
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,691
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

737
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,361
Hey, can you upgrade Gary's
stupid stinking breath?

738
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,279
Come on. I know you guys
are better than this.

739
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,948
Don't you want to think for yourselves?

740
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,617
- [Nate groans]
- [Gideon] Chernobyl was a test, Captain.

741
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,495
You've been making
questionable choices as of late.

742
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,163
I needed to make sure you and your team

743
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,707
are up to the task to stop
the other Legends no matter what.

744
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,669
Your teammates passed. You did not.

745
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,213
I've been making the right choices.

746
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,358
[Gideon] I believe
Miss Lance's leadership skills

747
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,050
are too strong, Dr. Sharpe.

748
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,136
Perhaps it's best to remove them
completely this time.

749
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,556
- We're supposed to be a team.
- [grunts]

750
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,016
Get her to the infirmary, stat.

751
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,270
Sleep tight, Captain.

752
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:17,105
Well...

753
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,441
Looks like I'm in charge
of this dumpster fire.

754
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,569
Who wants to kick some ass?

755
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:22,778
[gurgles in agreement]

756
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,756
[Gideon] Pardon the interruption,
Captain Heywood.

757
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,117
But it seems that Dr. Petrov has escaped
her fate for a second time.

758
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,244
I know the perfect person
for that mission.

759
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,463
I didn't think I'd hear
from you again so soon.

760
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:43,883
Is it safe now?

761
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,885
Have you brought the plans?

762
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,491
- Is everything all right?
- [blade slashing]

763
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:52,795
- [flesh squelching]
- [groaning]

764
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,268
[Spooner and Robo-Nate groan]

765
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,562
I've never seen that before.

766
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,606
What would you even call that move?

767
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,108
Well, would you look at that?

768
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,611
I have my money on "miscellaneous."

769
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,863
- So I win.
- Oh, come on.

770
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,490
Nice job, Assassin Sara.

771
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,250
[girl screaming]

772
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:21,584
[projector slide changing]

773
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:22,922
[both grunting]

774
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,925
- Hey! Ow!
- Get a new one, you shrimp.

775
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,010
Who are you calling a shrimp?

776
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,428
John Cena!

777
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,598
That's not John Cena, you dork.
That's Commander Steel.

778
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,558
Citizen Steel,
and don't call him a dork.

779
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,685
Citizen Steel? Who's he?

780
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,604
What's with the patriotic outfit?

781
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,731
What's wrong with my... Listen.

782
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,275
I'm here to talk to you about bullying.

783
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,610
You're right.

784
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,487
- My bad.
- That's okay. Thanks.

785
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:47,863
Nice.

786
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,658
Speaking of bullying,
people must make fun of your arms a lot.

787
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,370
My arms? They're fantastic.
They're enormous and vascular.

788
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,622
Yeah, but the rest of you
is just normal-sized.

789
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,999
And John Cena's swole all over.

790
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,418
[mockingly] Oh, yeah?
Is John Cena made of steel?

793
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,423

794
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,176
Back away! Back away,
demon children. Back!

795
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,928
- [clanging continues]
- [Nate] Hey!

796
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,389
- Hey, what the... Ouch!
- [boys chuckling]

797
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,726
