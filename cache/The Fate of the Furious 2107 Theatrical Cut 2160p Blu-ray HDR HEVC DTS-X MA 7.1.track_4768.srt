Thanks...

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
Handcuffs? What is this?

It's called abuse of power.

You told me
to round them up.

I didn't tell you
to hand...

00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,520
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.

I'm sorry, guys,
really, I...

you treat old friends?

know who the hell this guy is.

523

Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

524
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:21,990
Nobody. So, then,
who is he?

525

Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

Well, thanks
to your botched Berlin job,

you all made Interpol's

Top 10.

00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:43,845
That's all right.

00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,598
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?

535
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,058
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

536
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,227
I'm... I missed?
Yeah.

537
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,854
ROMAN: That's impossible!

538
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,814
What number did
they come in at?

539
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,194
Six, eight, nine, ten.

540
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,446
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,615
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.

542
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,533
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
(SCOFFS)

543
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:10,455
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

544
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,415
We're awaiting
hard confirmation,

545
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,377
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

546
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,381
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

547
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,674
Not according
to our sources.

548
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,967
What does she want?

549
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,177
No one knows.

550
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,429
Cipher is like
a digital act of God.

551
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,892
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

552
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,644
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

553
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,397
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

554
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,734
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

555
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,152
So, basically,
she's the bogeyman.

556
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,405
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

557
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,367
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

won't mess with her.

why he's turned.

to track Dom.

Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

in an extra pair of hands.

a whole hell of a lot better.

you wanna tell me why

you just put me in a room with this

Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

586
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,291
I don't care about you, your
crew, or your little family.

587
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,751
I'm here for Cipher.

588
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,669
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?

You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,215
You should get
a bigger size.

591
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,428
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

592
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,013
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

593
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,308
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

little black site prison.

596
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,441
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

597
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,776
So, if ll get a shot
to take her down,

598
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,110
believe me, Flex,
I'm taking it.

599

You're taking my boot right up your
ass, is what you're taking.

600
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,949
Guys, guys. The fastest way to
find Cipher is through Toretto.

601
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,451
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

602
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,870
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

603
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,790
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

you two are gonna work together.

I'm gonna take
that as a yes.

seeing this?

was where we started.

627
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,489
But Cipher's already
created an evasion

628

that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

but it was
a good thought, Roman.

So, she's made
my program obsolete.

is why you're here.

635

You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

636
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,391
means they have to be

01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,571
Da-da.

1116
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,906
Please don't hurt him,
I'm begging you.

1117
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,367
I don't want you to beg.

1118
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,329
I want you to learn.

1119
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,039
Learn what?

1120
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:46,003
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.

1121
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:49,798
Da-da.

1122
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,511
But it was
the wrong choice.

1123
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,890
This is the consequence
of that.

1124
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,642
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) No!

1125
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,561
No! No!

1126
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,979
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1127
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,940
Save your son!

1128
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,400
No!

1129
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:09,693
(GUNSHOTS)

1130
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:11,445
(CRYING)

1131
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,411
(SHUSHING)

1132
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:34,885
(EXHALES)

1133
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,096
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

1134
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:39,890
Traffic cams.

1135
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,058
I got you.

1136
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,647
I knew it.

1137
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,398
I recognize that guy.

1138
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,609
That's Connor Rhodes.

1139
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,695
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

1140
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,073
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

1141
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,699
Connor Rhodes.

1142
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,911
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

1143
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,496
It's Mose Jakande.

1144
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,165
Warlord who tried
to get God's Eye.

1145
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,918
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

1146
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,225
Everything you're
feeling right now,

1147
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,228
this rage, a sense of
loss, it's not real.

1148
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,567
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

1149
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,319
to ensure continuation
of the species.

1150
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,991
When early man would
visit a watering hole,

1151
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,993
if they didn't
watch their child,

1152
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,495
and it got snatched
by a crocodile,

1153
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:50,544
our brains would create a
painful but instructional memory,

1154
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,755
so it would
never happen again.

1155
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:59,094
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

1156
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,013
that rules your world,

1157
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,600
it's a biological lie.

1158
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,061
You don't
have to accept it.

1159
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,565
I don't.

1160
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,529
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

1161
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,364
without any repercussions?

1162
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,368
I wouldn't have even looked your
way if you hadn't done that.

1163
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,996
You didn't even know
you had a kid.

1164
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,917
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

1165
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,502
Help you start a war.

1166
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,504
Is that what
you think I want?

1167
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,467
That's so limited.

1168
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,095
I didn't take that football
to start a war

1169
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,890
any more than I took your
son to start a family.

1170
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,726
Taking your son
got me the codes.

1171
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,354
The codes will
get me the nukes

1172
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,814
and the nukes
will get me what I want

1173
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:57,402
today, tomorrow,
and every day after that.

1174
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,071
And what's that?

1175
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,491
Accountability.

1176
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,162
The second I fire off
one of those nukes,

1177
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,624
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1178
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,250
when they cross the line,

1179
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,255
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

1180
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,051
Because the truth is, Dom,

1181
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,136
to the world out there,

1182
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,684
ll am the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1183
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,983
We've got one
last job to do.

1184
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,112
DOM: Cipher.

1185
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:50,956
If I were you,
I'd kiss my son.

1186
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:58,588
Because whether you value it or
not, all of this,

1187
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:02,759
your plane,
your security, and you,

1188
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,804
are still on this earth
because of him.

1189
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:14,396
RAMSEY: The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.

1190
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,939
But now,
we have Rhodes' information.

1191
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,858
And we're getting
snapshots of his data

1192
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,693
before it's
scrubbed off the net.

1193
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,069
That looks like somebody's
bank account,

1194
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,446
so why don't we
just go ahead...

1195
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:23,697
It's a longitude.

1196
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,658
Given the fact that
Dom hit a Russian motorcade,

1197
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,994
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1198
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,247
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1199
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,667
Yalta, Poltava...

1200
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,169
It's like they just
threw letters together.

1201
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,545
Kronyu rt.

1202
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:39,838
MR. NOBODY: It's "VIadovin."

1203
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,590
What are you doing here?
What?

1204
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,550
Told you I was gonna check
in on you from time to time

1205
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:44,634
to see how
you were doin".

1206
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,178
By the way, not so hot.

1207
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,389
But there's nothing
in Vladovin. It's justice.

1208
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,640
That's funny.

1209
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,851
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1210
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,853
where they retrofitted
Cold War submarines.

1211
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,230
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1212
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:58,857
The base was taken over

1213
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,234
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1214
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,944
and the Russians
haven't taken it back yet,

1215
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,280
so there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1216
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,866
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.

1217
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,244
It sounds like everything we
do, our legs gonna be blown off.

1218
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:14,664
It sounds like you still number
11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)

1219
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,750
It sounds like
you've changed

1220
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,252
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1221
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,462
Guys, guys.

1222
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,881
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1223
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,759
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1224
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,886
the Russian
Minister of Defense

1225
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,722
got himself involved in a
little incident on US territory,

1226
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,933
and the two governments aren't
talking to each other for a while.

1227
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,643
By the time they do,
it'll be too late.

1228
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,520
So, any other
suggestions?

1229
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,397
HOBBS: Yeah. I got one.

1230
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,108
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1231
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,069
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

1232
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,320
Separatist.

1233
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:46,488
Whatever.
It's suicide.

1234
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,031
It's stopping World War lll.

1235
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,243
What's it gonna be, rook?

1236
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,829
You gonna close your
eyes on this one, too?

1237
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,455
Pray that
the apocalypse doesn't come

1238
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:56,957
knocking on your
mama's front door?

1239
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,001
Or, are you gonna
saddle up, be a man,

1240
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,587
and save the entire
goddamn world?

1241
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,054
You know,
I think I figured it out.

1242
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,472
What's that?

1243
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,516
Rule number three.
Which is?

1244
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,102
There are no rules.

1245
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,396
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)

1246
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,607
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1247
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,317
LITTLE NOBODY: Aerial
transport leaves in an hour.

1248
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,945
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1249
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,864
All bets are off?
Bets are off?

1250
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,282
Do svidanyal!

1251
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:57,809
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit.

1252
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,769
But the game's changed.

1253
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,148
Before, we were just trying to catch
Dom, but now, after all this,

1254
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,150
I want you to know,
If 1 have to,

1255
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:07,777
I'm gonna put him down.

1256
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,407
Then you might have
to take us both down.

1257
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,452
ROMAN: I'm freezing, man.

1258
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,203
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
This ain't for me.

1259
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,206
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1260
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,837
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

1261
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:31,009
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1262
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,678
Man, that's entirely
too much information.

1263
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:34,930
I'm just sayin'.

1264
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,765
Well, one thing's
for sure.

1265
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,143
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

1266
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,686
because no one
would be this insane

1267
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,355
to hit this place
without a damn army.

1268
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,691
I wouldn't be

02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:46,669
(LAUGHS)

1749
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:55,678
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1750
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:57,472
Wow.

1751
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:01,017
Daddy's stayin' home.

1752
02:04:02,435 --> 02:04:03,686
(LAUGHS)

1753
02:04:07,523 --> 02:04:08,566
Nobody.

1754
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,692
Keep in touch.

1755
02:04:10,151 --> 02:04:11,736
Ah. Hang on a second.

1756
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,238
This could be interesting.

1757
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,328
(SIGHS) What made
you think I'd do it?

1758
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:22,789
Brotherhood.

1759
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:26,501
I saw that look you gave
Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.

1760
02:04:26,834 --> 02:04:28,336
Glad I did it.

1761
02:04:31,673 --> 02:04:34,175
I can't believe
you went to see my mother.

1762
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:37,428
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1763
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,484
All this fuss over you.

1764
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:53,444
(COOING)

1765
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:58,908
Yes.

1766
02:05:03,997 --> 02:05:07,083
Elena, I promised
to keep our son safe.

1767
02:05:09,252 --> 02:05:11,421
And now,
he always will be.

1768
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:23,850
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1769
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:27,937
One who never gave up on me.

1770
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:34,694
He's beautiful.

1771
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:38,031
DOM: You've heard me say

1772
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,783
that you never turn
your back on family,

1773
02:05:42,744 --> 02:05:46,789
and I wanna thank you all for
never turning your back on me.

1774
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:52,962
You wanna meet them?

1775
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,131
All right.

1776
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:57,300
Everyone,

1777
02:05:58,634 --> 02:06:00,053
meet Brian.

1778
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:02,972
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

1779
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:06,934
(COOING)

1780
02:06:09,312 --> 02:06:10,563
HOBBS: To Brian!

1781
02:06:10,646 --> 02:06:12,523
ROMAN: Welcome
to the family, Brian.

1782
02:06:12,607 --> 02:06:15,318
Okay, I guess
it's my turn to say grace.

1783
02:06:15,777 --> 02:06:18,279
We thank you
for giving us family.

1784
02:06:18,362 --> 02:06:22,742
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
