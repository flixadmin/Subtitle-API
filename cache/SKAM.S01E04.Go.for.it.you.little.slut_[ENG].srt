1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,620
- Maybe I can get a friend of yours?
- Maybe Chris?

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,220
I got Chris for you.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,460
- This is Chris.
- I am Chris.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,140
You have to get new friends.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,220
- Hi! Thanks for last time.
- Hi.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,100
We were wondering
if you're already on a russ bus.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,500
Say hi to Sana,
she wants to join the bus meeting.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,530
We have a really big advantage
over the other bus groups.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,500
I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,420
- We're wasting time on toilet paper.
- But what do you want us to do?

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,580
Do we know any '97 guys?
You guys have to hook up with them.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,160
SHAME

13
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,180
SUNDAY, 10:11 A.M.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,780
What are you doing?

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,140
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,050
No.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,600
I had a nightmare.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,640
About what?

19
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,050
I dreamed that you wore red clothes.

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,710
You were completely drunk and singing:
"Tonight it's allowed to be a whore."

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,020
Ha-ha. Really funny.

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,080
You're the one who said I should get friends.

23
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,620
So what's the problem?

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,050
The problem is that you don't understand
that russ time is just a capitalistic event--

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,400
Bla, bla, bla...

27
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,530
You know Sana said I should dump you.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,880
- Did she?
- Yes.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,180
You couldn't manage without me
for a single minute.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,540
You couldn't, could you?

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,940
You couldn't...

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,670
Eva?

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,620
- Hi!
- Hi!

34
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,180
- So good to see you!
- It's good to see you, too.

35
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,850
- Did you just get here now?
- Yes. I got an earlier flight.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,140
- Were you sleeping?
- No, no!

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,340
Should we make breakfast?

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,980
- Yes, let's. Are you hungry?
- Yes, I'm really hungry.

39
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,130
MONDAY, 2:47 P.M.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,040
Hi, dear. I saw a history test
lying on the table here
 where you got a 3-. Is it recent?

41
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Mom:

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,000
- Eva! I have to talk to you.
- Yes?

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,230
I was wondering,
and I don't know what you think,

44
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,520
but do you think Sana is a good fit
for our bus group?

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,100
Maybe she's a bit harsh?

46
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,060
Hey, she asked you to
break up with your boyfriend!

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,670
But you do agree that she can't join our bus?
Because I talked to Chris--

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Hey! Sana was wondering something.

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,800
How much toilet paper do you have?

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,580
- Why?
- Do you want to get rid of them or not?

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,920
- Eight pallets.
- Hello!

52
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,500
- You said you didn't know any '97 guys?
- I don't.

53
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,010
- He's on a bus with William.
- Is he?!

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,360
- Who's William?
- You don't know who William is?

55
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,380
No.

56
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,230
He's the hottest, coolest guy
in all of third-year.

57
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,020
That is William.

58
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,450
Are you following that guy Chris
on Instagram?

59
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,100
No.

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,900
- Do it.
- Why should I?

61
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,210
So you can get to know him.

62
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,150
I don't want to get to know him,
I have a boyfriend.

63
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,610
I told you, this is becoming a problem.

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,290
You don't have to hook up with him,
just get to know him,

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,930
so we can go to
a bus pre-party with William.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can tell your boyfriend that
that's your reason.

67
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,950
Yeah, because he'll surely
respect and accept that?

68
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,740
Yes! Just follow him.

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,410
Give me your phone.

70
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,030
Do you know what he's called on Insta?

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,920
Hey, that's enough!

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,830
When he sends you a message,
reply, and flirt.

73
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,690
Why would he message me?

74
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,000
Just flirt with him, okay?

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,680
- I have to go. Tschüss!
- Tschüss!

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,140
She's just like the lady
from Åndenes makt.

77
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,820
I know. She's completely raw.

78
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,310
TUESDAY, 3:41 P.M.

79
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,140
- Who is this Julian Dahl on Insta?
- No idea.

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
He's stalking me.

81
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,320
- Want to go to your place?
- No, let's go to yours.

82
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,260
Eva doesn't want to tell her mom
we're together.

83
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,850
Why not?

84
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,140
- Because she's embarrassed of me.
- That's not it.

85
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,420
I don't want her to meet you
when you're lying in my bed.

86
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,780
Okay...

87
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,860
Then invite me to dinner with your mom.

88
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,330
Thanks for the likes.
Never had a stalker before.

89
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,460
- Huh?
- Huh?

90
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,300
- Invite me to dinner with your mom.
- Yeah, I'll invite you to dinner.

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,140
Okay, when?

92
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,130
Hehe! Yes, a real stalker,
be careful, I'm standing
outside your house.

93
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,390
When?

94
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,820
Yeah... today, tomorrow, on Friday,
or next month?

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,370
Haha! Freaky. I'm actually
a bit scared now.

96
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,660
Christmas? May 17th?

97
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,690
Haha! Freaky. I'm actually
a bit scared now.

98
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,690
And horny.

99
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,540
Hello?

100
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,980
- Friday.
- Yeah, Friday.

101
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,700
- Who are you texting with?
- Vilde.

102
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,400
The russ bus boss.

103
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,080
Russ bus boss? You're not on a bus.

104
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,310
- She is, and it's really messed up.
- Stop saying I'm messed up.

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,410
You were saying it yourself
two weeks ago.

106
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,870
Yeah, maybe I changed my mind?

107
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,380
- Yeah, maybe you did.
- Okay.

108
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,770
THURSDAY, 12:10 P.M

109
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,420
Guess who's invited to a pre-party
with the Penetrator guys?

110
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,420
- Are you kidding?
- Really, Eva?

111
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,100
- Check it out.
- William will be...

112
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,900
That's great, Eva!
Oh, my god, you did this for us!

113
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,700
"Penetrator pre-party at Borkis' on Friday."

114
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,660
- "Cool. Can you bring some friends?"
- "Are they hot?"

115
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,200
Yes!

116
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,440
Shh! Relax. Try to be cool.

117
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,140
- We have to get alcohol!
- Yeah, I'll call the beer man.

118
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,140
- Does anyone have a fake ID?
- What's wrong with the beer man?

119
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,820
Are you looking at me? Do I look like I drink?

120
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,380
- I don't drink, either.
- What an awesome gang...

121
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,580
- I can probably take some wine from my mom.
- Could you?

122
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,100
How much? Can we share?
I can pay if you want.

123
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,390
I could take from my mom, but her wine
is so expensive, so if I took some,

124
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,910
- she would notice--
- Stop talking.

125
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,340
You talk too much.

126
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,220
- Excuse me?
- Shh!

127
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,440
Seriously?

128
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,870
She can't be on our bus,
she's completely psycho!

129
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,540
It's the beer man.

130
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,840
Yes, please.

131
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,430
We'd like some beers for...
four girls.

132
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,750
And a hundred boys!

133
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,780
Do we have to pay? If we have a friend here
who's called Vilde, if she maybe can flash?

134
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,860
So we don't need to pay in cash.

135
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,510
Maybe we can...

136
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,570
Or maybe we can get...

137
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,180
get... Noora to do it.

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,240
No, we don't do that. Hello?

139
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,540
Hello? Are you in prison?

140
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,560
FRIDAY, 6:41 P.M.

141
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,820
Fuck.

142
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,100
What are they doing here?

143
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,500
Hi!

144
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,190
Wasn't it them who threw her off their bus?

145
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,770
Wasn't it her who called you a slut
at that revue-party?

146
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,060
Don't leave me. Either Christoffer will rape me,
or those girls will kill me.

147
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,700
Okay. I won't leave you.

148
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,690
...he had one goal — to get this girl pregnant,
but he couldn't find her, so he had to...

149
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,060
You're kidding!
Is that why you're called the Penetrators?

150
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,220
That's why we're the Penetrators, because...

151
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,060
William asked me
if I wanted to go outside with him.

152
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,220
- I think he wants to hook up.
- Fucking hell! Go for it, you little slut!

153
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,900
- "Little slut"?
- Yeah, she's really slutty!

154
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,140
No, no! I'm also slutty.

155
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,980
Hola!

156
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:28,020
Well, just talk politics with him or something!
He's going to lose his boner right away.

157
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,980
3 missed calls from Jonas

158
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,980
Jonas (27 min ago):
What about that dinner?

159
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,180
Hey.

160
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,620
Hi.

161
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,020
- Are those like your crew, or what?
- My crew?

162
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,180
- Yeah, I mean, are you on a russ bus with them?
- No, I'm not on a russ bus.

163
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,180
- I'm not going to be a russ.
- Okay?

164
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,180
I just think russ time is pretty lame.

165
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,460
Okay, why?

166
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,180
Because russ time is just
a capitalistic event governed by market forces.

167
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Okay... okay.

168
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,460
You're a bit brainy.

169
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,360
I mean, I like it!

170
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,580
I think it's kinda hot.

171
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,610
You think it's hot?

172
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,380
Damn rude! What the fuck!

173
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,020
Drama!

174
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,780
Yeah, I have to go.

175
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,900
- What's up?
- It's an emergency!
