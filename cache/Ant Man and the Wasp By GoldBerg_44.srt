00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,030
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

156
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,170

157

Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

158
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,970
when you can't leave
the house.

159
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,040
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

160
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,680
Close-up magic.

161
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,620
I learned that.

162
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,330
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

163
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,070
Oh, Cassie.

164
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,140
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,010
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

166
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,610
Well, think of it this way.

167
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,420
Your school has rules, right?

168
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,520
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

169
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

170
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,630
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

171
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,270
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

172
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,340
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,470
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

174
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,710
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

175
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,580
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

176
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,220
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

177
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,120
followed by three years
of probation.

178
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,100
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

179
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,370
or contact with any
former associates who were...

180
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,570
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

181
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,140
Or any related statutes.

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,380
Okay, sweetie?

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,250
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

184
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,530
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

185
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,830
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

186
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,400
but you haven't had
any contact

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,840
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,670
- No.
- You sure?

189
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,740
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

190
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,380
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

191
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,390
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

192
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,690
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

193
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,500
that any violation
of your agreement

194
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,530
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

195
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,840
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

196
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,810
They hate his guts.

199

It's what we call him.

307

I didn't think I'd get caught.

313

We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,810

So, while you were relaxing
at home...

333
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,850
we were building this.

334
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,790
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

335
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,430
To my mom.

336
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,530
We think she might still
be down there.

337
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,430
We just don't know where.

338
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,340
What?

339
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,510
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

340
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,610
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

341
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,750
You built all this
and you don't even know

342
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,320
if she's alive?

343
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,390
It's called a hypothesis.

344
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,290
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

345
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,570
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

346
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,270
But for a split second,

347
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,810
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

348
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,080
And?

349
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,220
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

350
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,420
We think
when you were down there,

351
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,960
you may have entangled
with her.

352
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

353
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,530
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

354
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,840
We think she might have put

355
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,010
some kind of a message
in your head.

356
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,980
Hopefully, a location.

357
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,780
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

358
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,650
Your mom put a message
in my head?

359
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,420
Come on. That's insane.

360
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,660
No, Scott.

and fighting the Avengers.

363
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,670
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

364
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,850

you really destroyed it.

I did, I destroyed it,

I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

I had a dream.

She was playing hide-and-seek

in the dream?

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,030
No.

Was it in a wardrobe?

No, it was
in a tall dresser.

388

389

Red.

392

Do you have a point?

464
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,180
Oh, you think
that I don't know

465
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,520
what you've been building
with all this?

466
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,220
Quantum technology.

467
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,860
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

468
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,000
forget cryptocurrency.

469
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,940
Quantum energy is the future.

470
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,610
It's the next gold rush.

471
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,570
Is that so?

472
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,540
I want in, Hope.

473
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,180
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

474
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,060
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

475
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,830
Starting bid...

476
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,930
one billion dollars.

477
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,500
Thank you, Sonny, really.

478
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,000
But my father and I
have something

479
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,380
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

480
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,680
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,050
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

for my injured feelings.

Listen, Sonny.

489
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,730
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

490
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,440
if you just give me
that component.

you're takin' from here...

Quantum phasing.

it's been a little crazy.

1081
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

1082

No. No, no, no, no.

The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

1084

You gotta come right now
and fix it.

1085
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,300
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

1086
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,370
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

1087
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,840
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

1088
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,410
And you can fix them there.

1089
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,610
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

1090
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,780
It's complicated.

1091
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,890
What do you mean
it's complicated?

1092

As you can see, sir,

1093

Keep practicin'.

Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1098
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,050
so we can fix the plans.

1099
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,860

for tomorrow morning.

1102

Down to the undercarriage,

To wit, I have learned
