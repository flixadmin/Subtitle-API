1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,240
- Oink. Oink.
- What the...

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,880
A cop was murdered last night.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,560
A bagman on your payroll.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Grenade!

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,920
We have unfinished business.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Listen.
If you think you're going to...

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,200
Don't talk about my mother!

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,840
An opportunity awaits you.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,480
With you and Barbara?

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,120
Three of us could give all those
creeps a run for their money.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,360
She's making alliances
with politicians.

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,920
Building a fortress.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
She's been planning a war.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,720
Oswald, I want you to know,
I forgive you.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,360
You started an orphanage?

18
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
I wanted to surprise you.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,520
If you don't kill me,
I will kill every one you love.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,080
It doesn't stop 'til

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,120
I've butchered every single
swine on Penguin's payroll!

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,880
Besides, we both know,
Captain Bullock, you deserve this.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,320
Hold on, buddy.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,040
How long have you been taking money
from Penguin?

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
You got to understand, Jim,
the debts I got...

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
It stops now.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Calling dibs on my office?

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,040
I ain't dead yet.

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
Just measuring for when you are.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
Shouldn't you be resting?

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
Let me help you.

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm fine.

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,160
Great. So we can talk
about you taking Penguin's money.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
- I'm not that fine.
- I meant what I said, Harvey.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,880
This stops. Today. You hear me?

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,280
Hey! Hey!

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,840
What the hell is that?

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
You're trying to change the subject.

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,200
Obviously. But seriously
what the hell is that?

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Is that blood?

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,080
Some fancy-ass guy on the phone.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,400
How was I supposed to know
what we were carrying?

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Stench of death, for starters?

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,320
I got a cold.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,760
44 boxes.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,560
One for every cop in the precinct.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,560
Pyg's escalating.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
He's not just after dirty cops
anymore.

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
It's the whole GCPD.

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,800
- There are 45 cops here.
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,680
The instructions said
don't give nothing

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,520
to this one cop here named...

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Jim Gordon?

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Your support, I really appreciate it.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,880
{\an5}Enjoy the benefit.

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,480
{\an5}I think as far as the foundation
is concerned...

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
Helping the needy.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
{\an5}Very good for the soul, Master Bruce.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
{\an5}I have to say I really appreciate

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,960
{\an5}you allowing us to do
the fundraiser here.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,520
{\an5}The Society meant a great deal
to your father.

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,720
{\an5}As long as I don't have to leave
the house...

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,800
{\an5}Well, you're Bruce Wayne, ain't you?

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,800
{\an5}The world can come to you.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,080
{\an5}Hey. What the hell?

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,640
{\an5}- Excuse me?
- You knocked into me.

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Bruce.

68
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,760
{\an5}- Sorry, I didn't notice.
- Well, you should've.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
{\an5}- Bruce.
- Honestly. I'm really sorry.

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,040
{\an5}I haven't wanted to push,
Master Bruce.

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,960
{\an5}I mean, what happened with Ra's...

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,360
I know that you're hurting.

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
{\an5}Just, please, tell me
what I can do to help.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,160
{\an5}You can get off my back.

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
{\an5}I'm sorry.

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
{\an5}I just...

77
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,120
{\an5}I can't stop thinking about...

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
{\an5}when I...

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
{\an5}I should feel bad.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Guilty.

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,400
I... I... I just...

82
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
{\an5}You're just angry.

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,120
{\an5}That anger is concealing
what's really going on.

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,080
{\an5}Unless you face it full-on,
it will consume you.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
{\an5}And it will erupt.

86
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
I know...

87
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,120
what you're capable of.

88
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,880
{\an5}And I don't want to see you,
or anybody else get hurt.

89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I need some air.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Next time you see red stuff dripping
from a package,

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
consider calling the police.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
We're COD.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
Get the hell out of here.

95
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Hey, Jim.

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
James! I am so happy

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
we are working hand in hand
to rid the city of this menace.

98
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
He just showed up to offer his help.

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Did he?

100
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Nice to meet you, Jim.
I'm Headhunter.

101
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
I'm sure you heard of me.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
My new security consultant.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,080
Recommended by Victor,
who is off visiting his bubbie.

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,760
You want to know
why I carry two pistols?

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
Overcompensation?

106
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,560
See, I always shoot twice.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,560
The first one does the job.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,600
Every time. But the second one,
well that's just my signature.

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,640
He has a signature.

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
Colorful, isn't he?

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,720
But effective.

112
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,920
Mr. Headhunter and my men
will help the GCPD

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
until this Pyg situation is resolved.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,840
We don't want your help,
or that of your idiot hitman.

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Pyg's actions threaten
the both of us.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,440
He's killing my cops, my employees.

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,600
Allegedly.

118
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
Get this through your head, Oswald.

119
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,680
We don't work for you
and we don't work with you.

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Ever.

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,200
Well, your captain says otherwise.

122
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,280
Excited to work with you, Jim.

123
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,680
Are you out of your fricking mind?

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,000
- Jim, listen...
- You are legitimizing him, Harvey.

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,880
He's been legitimized for years.

126
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,880
He was the freaking mayor!

127
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,840
Is it about the money? Is that it?

128
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
It's not about that.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
How can I know that?

130
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,760
How can you even know that?

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,320
Take a look out there, okay?

132
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,040
Half the precinct skipped town

133
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,800
because they didn't want to wear
bacon-flavored death masks.

134
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,280
We need the help.

135
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,880
You are dangerously overreacting.

136
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm overreacting because every cop
in this precinct got a death threat.

137
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
Except, of course, for you.

138
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,080
So, Penguin's guys are gonna beat

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,800
and torture their way
through the city?

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,480
Then execute Pyg if they find him?

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
And?

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,200
And the people need to know

143
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,600
they don't need gangsters
to keep them safe.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna find Pyg,

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,800
alive and I'll bring him to justice.

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Good for you.

147
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,360
Three cops just went missing.

148
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Where?

149
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
It's gonna be tough.

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
It's the Narrows.

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
So, that's it.

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,400
We're shutting up the shop.

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,080
So long. Farewell. Toodle-loo.

154
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,880
I can't believe this.

155
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,320
I can.

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,920
All this was so I could be Ra's eyes
and ears in Gotham.

157
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,440
He was bankrolling us
and now he's gone.

158
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
So I'm pulling the plug.

159
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,680
Help yourself to whatever.

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,280
So all of this being partners,
building something together, lies.

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
A sales pitch.

162
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
I couldn't do it alone.

163
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,400
We can still spy on the jerks who
come in here and get intel on jobs.

164
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
We can make it work.

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,880
What?

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,960
And the three of us stay together
like a plucky little family?

167
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Well, how about a little parting
lesson from big sis.

168
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,440
In this life, you're on your own.

169
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Always.

170
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
Bonus lesson,
never make Bellinis from a can.

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,400
I followed a buyer
from the Street Demonz.

172
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,920
They have a chop shop across town
and I saw exactly

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
where they hide their stash.

174
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Let's hit it. Show her she's wrong.

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
We're not gonna rip off one
of Gotham's biggest motorcycle gangs.

176
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Why not?

177
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
You and I will find something else.

178
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,760
<i>All right, PD here,
Penguin's guys over there.</i>

179
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
Three missing officers.

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,320
Patel from our precinct,
Fisoli and Perkov from the two-two.

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,560
Good Lord, there's blood all over.

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
He got them here.

183
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,800
Clear view from dozens of windows.

184
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
- Someone saw it.
- They sure did.

185
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,280
All right, bring it in, everybody.

186
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Come on.

187
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,800
This is the Narrows.

188
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,280
The poorest of the poor,
the hardest of the hard.

189
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,920
Now, I don't need to tell you that
they got a code of silence down here,

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,600
which means we got to make them
more scared of us

191
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,720
than they are of their own people.

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,680
We go floor by floor.

193
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,600
- Air mail!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Let's get them! Move on out!

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,160
This is gonna be fun.

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
Get off of him! Get back.

197
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,040
Hey! Hey!

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,320
Get off! Get off of him.

199
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,320
They're potential witnesses.
They're not perps.

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
This is the Narrows, Gordon.

201
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
You think there's a difference?

202
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,800
- Step away, Ruseckas.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

203
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,240
Ruseckas, they need you upstairs.

204
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,560
You two, go. Now.

205
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
Working out great.

206
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,840
If it gets me my cop killer,
yeah, it is.

207
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Right.

208
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Bruce?

209
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,600
I just wanted to say hi.

210
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm Grace.
We went to school together.

211
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,520
Grace Blomdhal.

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
Yeah.

213
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Sorry I...

214
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
It's been years.
I didn't even recognize you.

215
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,760
I heard you were homeschooling.

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Yeah.

217
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,680
I...

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,240
Why aren't you in school?

219
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,320
'Cause it's Saturday.

220
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
I don't mean to knock your fundraiser

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
but is there any chance
you're as bored as I am?

222
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,920
You'd have to be pretty bored.

223
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
So do you want to maybe go
somewhere?

224
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah.

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
May I?

226
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
Ma'am, please.

227
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,880
I'm Detective Gordon.

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,080
We didn't see nothing.

229
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,000
But you knew those missing cops.

230
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,520
Or knew of them.

231
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Right?

232
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,880
Three officers, different precinct,
same patrol car

233
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
they were freelancing.

234
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,600
Look, I know how it is down here.

235
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,240
A lot of bad stuff happens.

236
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
Half the time it's the cops doing it.

237
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
They were running some sort
of protection racket, am I right?

238
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
You sit over here.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah?

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
It gives you a pretty good view.

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,400
So, what did you see?

242
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,720
Please, I need you to leave.

243
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,200
No one's gonna know
you told me anything.

244
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,520
I give you my word.

245
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
- Can I help?
- Get out of here.

246
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Now.

247
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
Will do, Jim.

248
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Hey!

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,120
This is ridiculous.
We're all on the same team.

250
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,320
No, no, come on.

251
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,160
Come on. Come, come yeah.

252
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
If the old lady doesn't talk,
the old man gets it!

253
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,800
And after that, I go apartment
by apartment until I get an answer!

254
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Drop it!

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
Back at you, Jim.

256
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Everybody stand down!

257
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm giving you three seconds.

258
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm giving you two.

259
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
No one is counting!

260
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
You, drop your weapon!

261
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
I'll tell you what I saw!

262
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
He took them.

263
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,920
He was driving a hearse.

264
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,760
I didn't see the plate.

265
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
It's all right.

266
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,320
We don't need the plate.

267
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,640
Just tell me which direction
was he headed.

268
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,760
Down Seventh.

269
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Heading west.

270
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Hey, thanks, Jim.

271
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
You know, I never really did
the whole good-cop-bad-cop thing.

272
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
It's quite effective.

273
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,880
West on Seventh that's Hoover Island.

274
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,360
It's tiny, there's only a couple
of abandoned buildings.

275
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,520
We can canvas the whole area
in ten minutes.

276
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah.

277
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,440
And the second shot,
well, that's just my signature.

278
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,040
I know it doesn't look good
but no one got hurt too bad.

279
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,600
And we got what we needed, right?

280
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,960
You just, you got to trust me
on this one, partner, okay?

281
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,080
People, we're moving out
to Hoover Island right now!

282
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
Let's move! Go!

283
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
Go!

284
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Come on!

285
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,640
Last door, let's go!

286
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,720
Empty.

287
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,760
I got two in here!

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
This man is alive. Call an ambulance.

289
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,280
- Help me.
- We will. We're here.

290
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,040
Jim! Pyg disappeared.

291
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,960
There's no sign of the third cop
anywhere.

292
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,280
All right. Get some help.

293
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,080
Hold on.

294
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
My God.

295
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
It's okay.

296
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,240
<i>As you can see behind me,
we just had a major police operation.</i>

297
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>A raid of some sort on this
abandoned...</i>

298
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,600
- Sofia, look!
- <i>Hoover Island.</i>

299
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,960
Those are my men.

300
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,400
And there's that Headhunter person
I was talking about.

301
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,200
Kind of a moron but he is effective.

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,240
<i>Another is in stable condition
and on his way to Gotham...</i>

303
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,160
So, technically,
I saved that cop's life.

304
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,400
Such great PR.

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,720
Excuse me. Little person.

306
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Scoot.

307
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,600
Is co-opting the police not the most
brilliant idea I have ever had?

308
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,600
It is Pax Penguina taken
to a whole other level.

309
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Hello?

310
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Isn't it?

311
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,960
You don't need to know what I think.

312
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Well, now I definitely do.

313
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Ears.

314
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,360
My father never would have publicly
aligned with the GCPD.

315
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,560
They are incompetent and unreliable.

316
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,800
Eventually, they will fail and fail
big and you will fail with them.

317
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,040
So, that's what I think.

318
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,600
Thank you for your input.

319
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,720
You're welcome, Oswald.

320
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
Because you have shown me
very clearly what not to do.

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,720
In fact I'm gonna get more involved.

322
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Personally.

323
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,680
Don't ask for my opinion
if you don't want to hear it.

324
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Okay.

325
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,560
Look at that!

326
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,880
Come on!

327
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
Yo! The alarm's going off!

328
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
What the hell!

329
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Someone broke in?

330
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,240
I was... I was under the car.

331
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
The stash is gone.

332
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
Guy must've got out.

333
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
So, you must've messed up
your only job.

334
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,160
Guess it's time to burn rubber.

335
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,520
Wait! No!

336
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,320
No! Let me go!

337
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,200
No! No!

338
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,520
- Yeah?
<i>- Hey.</i>

339
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,520
We scanned the entire area still
no sign of Pyg or Officer Patel.

340
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,560
<i>- You get anything off Fisoli?</i>
- No. No.

341
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
I'll...

342
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
Wait a minute. He's coming to...

343
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
I'll call you back.

344
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,240
Officer Fisoli.

345
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
It's okay. It's all right.

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
You're on your way to Gotham General.

347
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
You're safe. I'm Detective Gordon.

348
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,960
I know who you are.

349
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,360
You were taken by the Pyg.

350
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,240
Did you happen to see his face?

351
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,840
I don't know. He wore a mask.

352
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
The others?

353
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,640
Perkov didn't make it.

354
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,840
Patel's gone missing.

355
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,400
- Do you remember anything?
- I don't know, man.

356
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
He was torturing us for hours.

357
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,320
He was singing nursery rhymes,
talking crazy.

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, geez.

359
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,200
I watched him bleed out Perkov.

360
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,000
- Did he say anything about Patel?
- I don't know. I don't remember.

361
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,320
Look at me.
Look at what he did to me.

362
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay, all right, all right,
all right.

363
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Let's take a break.

364
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,240
Why is he doing this?

365
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,760
'Cause he's insane.

366
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,000
But it's more than that.

367
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,560
I guess he's just reached
a breaking point.

368
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
There's so much rot in Gotham.

369
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,440
All of it, high to low.

370
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
Sometimes even I feel like breaking,
you know?

371
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,280
I was on Penguin's pad.

372
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Started off small stuff deliveries
and payoffs and then...

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,040
it got bad.

374
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
I get it.

375
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,080
I've done bad stuff myself.

376
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,520
For Penguin, even.

377
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,400
But you and I can make it right.

378
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,960
Once I get Pyg, I'm gonna
take down the Pax Penguina.

379
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,400
And then I'm gonna go
after the dirty cops, one by one.

380
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,040
Now you have a chance...

381
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,000
to make right
what you've done wrong.

382
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Help me.

383
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
Pyg is planning something.

384
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,800
Nearby. He was...

385
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
Maybe where he took Patel.

386
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,440
He... he... he kept saying
something about...

387
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,400
"I'll bring justice to where
there is... justice no more."

388
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Justice. A courthouse.

389
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,960
There ain't no courthouse
in the Narrows.

390
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
There's one they abandoned
a few years back.

391
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,880
- Pull it over! I'm getting out.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,400
- Thank you, Officer Fisoli.
- Hey.

393
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,600
You are one of the good ones, Jim.

394
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, Brant. I ran into an old friend.
Bruce Wayne.

395
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,280
Bruce, this is Emma Hsueh
and Tommy Elliott.

396
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
- You two know each other?
- Oh, yeah.

397
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
Last time I saw this guy,
he punched me in the face.

398
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
- I should go.
- Okay.

399
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Hey, hold on, bro.

400
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
I totally deserved it. If anything,
you should've hit me harder.

401
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
So true.

402
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,200
He was such a jerk back then.

403
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
- Okay.
- Little heads up,

404
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,680
next time you just bring
some random kid to my place.

405
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,160
Parents' place, Brant.

406
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
He's so jealous.

407
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,200
Brant wanted Grace all to himself.

408
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
Whatever. You want a shot?

409
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,000
- Maybe sample some party favors?
- I'm good.

410
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,120
Oh, I forgot about this guy.
Total animal.

411
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
So what do you do for fun?

412
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,320
I used to walk on rooftops
and fight crime.

413
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,720
Now I'm not so sure.

414
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,720
You're a bigger dork than I remember.
Just kidding.

415
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,680
Hey, whatever happened to that, that,
that creepy old guy, the butler?

416
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,400
Is he still, buttling?

417
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm kidding.

418
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
It's a joke.

419
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,760
- Seriously, does he buttle with you?
- Bruce!

420
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,120
- Bruce! No!
- Stop!

421
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,080
So, does he buttle with you?

422
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,200
Brant, didn't you say you
had a hookup at that club?

423
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,920
Yeah. Yeah, this is lame. Let's go.

424
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,760
Brant's a tool but this'll be fun.

425
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,000
There partner.

426
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
- You followed me?
- Didn't have to.

427
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Your captain told me
where you were headed.

428
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,160
I guess he thought
maybe you needed some help.

429
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,760
Hi, Jim. Thanks for leading the way.

430
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,200
We'll take it from here.

431
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
Keep watching me like that
and I'll think you don't trust me.

432
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,520
Just give me my money
so I can get out of here.

433
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,800
- Where are you?
<i>- Okay, I don't want to hear</i>

434
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
<i>how I'm an idiot.</i>

435
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,840
I'm at the Demonz' place.

436
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,520
It's, it's bad.

437
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,640
- What?
- <i>I'm hiding but...</i>

438
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,720
there are three of them, strapped.

439
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,880
And they just called backup.

440
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,760
You idiot.

441
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,320
<i>How about you yell at me
after you come get me?</i>

442
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,720
<i>Just wait right there.</i>

443
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,840
I kind of have to.

444
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,840
Selina's at the Demonz.
We got to get her.

445
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,240
Isn't this what they call
a teachable moment?

446
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Let her claw her way out.

447
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,160
- We owe her.
- That is what her salary was for.

448
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,920
Look, she only went there to prove
that we can make this work,

449
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
us running heists together.

450
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,360
Oh. Then she might have considered
not getting caught.

451
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,480
She just wants a purpose.
She wants a home.

452
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,240
Then sucks for her.

453
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,120
You know, I thought you'd changed.

454
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
Like maybe you could think
about somebody

455
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
other than yourself for once.

456
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,600
Then sucks for you.

457
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,760
It was my idea to offer
my consulting services.

458
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,880
And I daresay it has been
a smashing success,

459
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,240
the Pax Penguina
taken to the tactical level.

460
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,600
And now we have reason to believe
that the notorious Pyg is trapped

461
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
in the courthouse behind us.

462
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,360
- So let me...
- Look I know it's a bit of a circus.

463
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
But there was no way in hell

464
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,080
I was gonna let you go in there
alone, all right?

465
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,440
The Pyg ain't gonna go down easy.

466
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,720
So, I say, we let Penguin's thugs
go in first,

467
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,120
let them be the cannon fodder
instead of our guys.

468
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,840
It's win-win.

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,360
End of conversation.

470
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,400
- Yeah.
<i>- Did you know,</i>

471
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,040
<i>I spell my name with a "Y?"</i>

472
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,600
I didn't. You want to meet me
somewhere, we can talk about it?

473
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,440
<i>Please, Jim, I'm not that dumb.</i>

474
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,960
<i>Anyway, P-Y-G.</i>

475
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,360
<i>The "Y" is because it's short
for "Pygmalion."</i>

476
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,520
<i>Like I'm creating a new,
better Gotham.</i>

477
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,120
<i>- And I'm creating a new you, Jim.</i>
- Really?

478
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,320
<i>Yes, except there's a slight hitch.</i>

479
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,240
<i>I can't recreate you if you're,
you know, dead.</i>

480
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,680
<i>Which you will be if you go in there.</i>

481
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,240
- In where?
<i>- Oh, don't act dumb.</i>

482
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,800
<i>Only I get to do that.</i>

483
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,000
<i>Let them play cops and robbers.
It'll be fun.</i>

484
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,240
<i>But not you.</i>

485
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,440
Why should I believe anything
you have to say?

486
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>Because,
"you are one of the good ones, Jim."</i>

487
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
Harper! Call Gotham General.

488
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Find out what the hell happened
to Fisoli!

489
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,800
Check again.

490
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,240
- Jones. Brant Jones.
- I heard you the first time.

491
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,520
You said we could get in.

492
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Nope.

493
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Stupid bouncer's acting
like he doesn't know who I am.

494
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,560
He knows who you are.

495
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
He just doesn't care.

496
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,400
I don't care how much money you have.

497
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,600
You're a dork and a freak, Wayne.

498
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,520
- You always were.
- Brant, chill.

499
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,280
Give me a second, guys.

500
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,200
- It's your fault for inviting him.
- Shut up, Brant.

501
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,800
Wait, who's Bruce talking to?

502
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Let's go, guys.

503
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Not him.

504
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,520
Let me talk to the owner.

505
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,520
You're standing next to him.

506
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
I bought the place.

507
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,840
- You guys in or out?
- In.

508
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
You can't find either of them?

509
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,040
No, they're not standing
over him anymore.

510
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
They can't find the ambulance.

511
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Call it off!

512
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,600
Call off the raid.

513
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Fisoli's dead.

514
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,680
The guy in the ambulance
was the Pyg in disguise.

515
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
What the hell are you talking about?

516
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
Pyg called me. He warned me off.

517
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,400
He used the same phrase
he used in the ambulance.

518
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,600
He fed us the clue to get us here.

519
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,680
It has to be a trap.

520
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,520
So the insane serial killer who hates
cops warned you to save your life,

521
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,160
- because why, now?
- Because I'm against dirty cops.

522
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,480
Oh! Except all of the times
you are one.

523
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm telling you, Harvey, call it off.

524
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,160
Call it off.

525
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,240
I have another interpretation, Jim.
The Pyg is not trying to save you.

526
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,840
He's trying to save himself
by stopping the raid.

527
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,640
You are being played.

528
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,200
And not for the first time,
I might add.

529
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
We called Gotham General.

530
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
They can't locate Fisoli,
or the ambulance.

531
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,520
Jim, it's Gotham General.
It's a madhouse down there.

532
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,320
If I'm correct, the Pyg isn't even
in the courthouse.

533
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,880
I came directly from the ambulance.
There is no way he beat me here.

534
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,040
- You're wrong! Pyg is in there, Jim!
- He's right!

535
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,240
We got a spotter across the street
that got a visual on Pyg in there,

536
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,360
standing next to Patel
tied to a chair.

537
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,120
- I swear.
- Look, I can't explain it.

538
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,840
All I know is, this is a trap.

539
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,560
Now, you asked me to trust you.
I am asking you to trust me.

540
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
It's so tiresome!

541
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,160
Start the operation!

542
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,400
Jim, I'm sorry.
I'm with Penguin on this one.

543
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,840
We got to think about Patel.

544
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,160
Let's move out, people!

545
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,240
You better pray I can clean up
your mess on this one, Harvey.

546
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
You are out of line, pal!

547
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,160
And you are gonna get our guys
slaughtered!

548
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,280
Jim Gordon,
I am ordering you to stand down!

549
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,720
Finally, a good idea, Harvey! Boys?

550
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,840
We've gone over the game plan,
people.

551
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,560
You know what to do. Let's go.

552
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
When's our guys coming?

553
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,480
How should I know? You called them.

554
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,320
It's about time. Come on...

555
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,800
I'll draw their fire.
You see an opening, run.

556
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,640
Screw that. Whatever we're doing,
we're doing together.

557
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,560
Well, I guess, now we see
if I taught you how to use that whip.

558
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
Hello? Excuse me?

559
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,280
- Did you guys order Thai?
- No.

560
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
Good, 'cause I don't have any.

561
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,480
- Nice shooting.
- Obviously.

562
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Give me my cut.

563
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
- Barbara.
- I'm sorry.

564
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,440
Did you want a hug?
I just killed five guys for you.

565
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
Actually, we did it together.

566
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,320
So that's it?

567
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,480
We're just over?

568
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Over?

569
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,800
Think I came down here for kicks?

570
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,440
You're coming back to the nest.

571
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,000
We got a shipment coming in
and a business to run.

572
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Well, come on.

573
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Hey!

574
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,480
Got him!

575
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
Come on!

576
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Harvey.

577
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Damn it!

578
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Oh, no.

579
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,040
Patel. Oh.

580
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Oh, no.

581
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
It's a setup!

582
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,120
Get out!

583
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
The exits are blocked!

584
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
That's not our guns.

585
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,240
They're pinned down.

586
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,040
Hey! Come on, back up.

587
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Get in there.

588
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,960
Get in there!

589
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
Headhunter's hit!

590
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,000
Ruseckas!

591
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,160
Harper! Get Patel, now!

592
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,040
Shoot the chain!

593
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Get down!

594
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Come on.

595
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,440
I did not order the cops in there.
I do not have that authority.

596
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,920
I made a suggestion.

597
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,680
- It was Captain Bullock...
- Gordon. Gordon!

598
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,720
How did you find the courage to
run in and save all of those people?

599
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,800
If the Pyg is watching the GCPD
is gonna take you down.

600
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,160
And that was Detective James Gordon
with a very modest,

601
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,760
if I may say, statement
about his genuinely heroic...

602
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,800
- Way to go, Jim.
- Thanks.

603
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,800
They think Patel's gonna make it.

604
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,120
Congratulations, Jim.

605
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,480
You're a hero.

606
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,640
And I'm just the cop who shot a cop.

607
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,640
This is Gordon.

608
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,480
<i>Wow. You were amazing.</i>

609
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,520
Oh, I was right about you.

610
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,160
You are a "get things done" type,
Jim Gordon.

611
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,360
Oh, and those things
that you want to get done,

612
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,680
well...
they're the same things I want,

613
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,040
Only if you want to go to prison
for the rest of your life.

614
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,720
Well, now that's just mean.

615
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm gonna find you.

616
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, I hope you do.

617
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,680
'Cause I want to thank you
in the flesh, flesh, flesh.

618
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,600
Because what you said
about the rot in Gotham,

619
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,200
high to low, so concisely phrased,
well, gave me an idea.

620
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,440
The next step in my plot.

621
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,200
It's a saga.

622
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,400
It's an epic.

623
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,440
<i>It's a spectacle.</i>

624
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,560
And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.

625
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,040
I'll see you soon.

626
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Man!

627
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,600
Well, I guess Gordon was right.

628
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
You know, we should've...

629
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
Second one's my signature.

630
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Dude.

631
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
This is awesome.

632
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,640
I always knew there was another side
to you, Bruce Wayne.

633
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
I think I'm gonna try it out
for a while.

634
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,280
Thanks. That's from all of us,
even if they're not saying it.

635
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,880
Thank you, Detective.
You'd have done the same.

636
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,600
Yeah, but not as well.

637
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,480
- We got an unlicensed robbery.
- I got a license.

638
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,480
Like I told him,
I just don't know where I put it.

639
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,440
Oh, wait. It's in my boot.

640
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,560
Oh, we ain't accepting these no more.
