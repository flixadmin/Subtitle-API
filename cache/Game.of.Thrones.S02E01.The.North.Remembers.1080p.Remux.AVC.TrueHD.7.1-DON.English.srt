And if the king listens to what I say,

137
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,069
the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

144
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,508
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

145
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,555
We had three Starks to trade.

146
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,266
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

147
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,352
Father will be furious.

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,980
It must be odd for you

to be the disappointing child.

and all our Northern sons.

152

The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

153
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,090
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

154
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:36,762
and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

155
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,598
When I was a boy,

156
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,062
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,105
Men worked back then.

158
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:52,486
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

Gods forbid it rains.

161
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,912
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

162
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,917
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

163
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,502

tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

326
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,037
This is our place.

327
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,914
Our husband keeps us safe.

328
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,000
Better to live free than die a slave.

329
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,506
CRASTER: Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

330
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,886
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

331
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,013
We chose different paths.

332
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:13,268
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

333
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,273
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

334
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,441
and eat me out of pigs.

335
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,402
A roof would be welcome.

336
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,903
It's been hard riding.

337
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,198
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

339
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,248
he loses the hand.

340
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,212
And I see this one staring too long,

341
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,299
I might just gouge his eyes out.

342

will freeze the seas...

Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

366
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,086
You smell of fear,

367

Stop me.

In the ancient books, it's written

that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

As do I,

387

He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

If you tell him the truth...

What's the truth?

MATTHOS: "And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

393
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,803
He wasn't my beloved brother.

394
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,972
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

395
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,891
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

396

A lie. Take it out.

you could make peace with your brother...

Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

421

Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

422

The Lord of Light stands behind him.

And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,114
No, but he's starting to know me.

484
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,452
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

485
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,497
It's better than three defeats.

486
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,007
(SNARLING)

487
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,820
SHAE: This city stinks.

488
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,658
Like dead bodies.

489
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,827
TYRION: A bit corpsey, yes.

490
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,371
And shit.

491
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,039
I thought you wanted to come here.

492
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,086
I love it.

493
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,048
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

494
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,677
And cum and garlic and rum.

495
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,263
You can smell cum from the balcony?

496
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,309
I love the stink. I love the noise.

497
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,394
Cities make me want to fuck.

498
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,564
And so did the country.

499
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,734
(SIGHS)

500
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,319
This is where I belong.

501
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,196
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

502
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,823
No one can know you're here.

503
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,491
No one will know.

504
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,285
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

505
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,330
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

506
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,832
one or two great liars.

507
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,792
What about you?

508
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:11,628
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

509
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,381
(LAUGHS) Truth?

510
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:19,345
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

511
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,388
Why do you think I am so little?

512
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:25,768
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

513
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,983
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

514
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:36,695
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

515
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,117
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

516
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,214
Lord Baelish.

517
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,548
Your Grace.

518
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:59,093
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

519
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,719
Of course, Your Grace.

520
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,721
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

521
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,973
we can't seem to locate her.

522
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,603
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

523
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,106
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

524
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,066
Curious.

525
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,235
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

526
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,320
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

527
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,656
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

528
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,117
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

529
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,452
He'll have an answer for you.

530
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:26,954
Whether you believe it...

531
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,041
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

532
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,585
Who knows what they want?

533
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,587
A mockingbird.

534
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,675
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

535
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,430
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

536
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,098
I'm glad you like it.

537
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,643
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

538
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,187
Others have to find their own way.

539
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,774
I heard a song once

540
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,444
about a boy of modest means

541
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,029
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

542
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,991
He loved the eldest daughter.

543
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,410
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

544
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:11,748
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

545
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,129
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

546
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,215
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

547
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:24,136
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

548
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,346
especially in a prominent family.

549
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,724
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

550
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,185
I've found.

551
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,271
And which truth is that?

552
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,690
Knowledge is power.

553
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,488
Seize him.

554
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,241
Cut his throat.

555
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,077
Stop. Wait.

556
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

557
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,919
Step back three paces.

558
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,130
Turn around.

559
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,341
Close your eyes.

560
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,263
Power is power.

561
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:14,686
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

562
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,605
to locate the Stark girl for me.

563
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,358
I would very much appreciate it.

564
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,120
ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?

565
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,790
I am, Your Grace.

566
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,252
ROBB: I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

567
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:42,631
First, your family must release my sisters.

568
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,260
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

569
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:51,056
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

570
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,143
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

571
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,105
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

572
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,983
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

573
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:07,322
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

574
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,661
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

575
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,746
The King in the North.

576
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,249
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

577
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,044
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

578
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,130
If he disregards this command,

579
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,091
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

580
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:30,929
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

581
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:34,391
These are... Your Grace, these are...

582
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,977
These are my terms.

583
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,147
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

584
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,523
If not,

585
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:45,777
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

586
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,572
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

587
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,198
Oh, is he?

588
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,161
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

589
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,456
That will be all for tonight.

590
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,431
A word, Your Grace?

591
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,977
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

592
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,688
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

593
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,732
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

594
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,902
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

595
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,820
Of course they are.

596
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,198
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

597
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,576
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

598
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,623
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

599
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,167
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

600
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,002
Men who fought my father.

601
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:46,338
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

602
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,092
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

603
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,428
I'm his only living son.

604
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,557
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

605
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,771
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

606
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,274
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

607
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,612
We can avenge him together.

608
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,908
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

609
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,285
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

610
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,248
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

611
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,833
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

612
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,793
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

613
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,672
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

614
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:32,050
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

615
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:35,887
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

616
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,223
Before me, it was Father.

617
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,975
You married one rebel and mothered another.

618
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,978
I mothered more than just rebels,

619
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,272
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

620
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,609
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

621
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:52,904
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

622
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,990
And Arya...

623
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,828
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

624
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,457
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

625
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
It's time for me to go home.

626
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,519
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

627
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,814
You can't go to Winterfell.

628
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,150
I beg your pardon?

629
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,612
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

630
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,074
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

631
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,160
Why in the name of all the gods...

632
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,039
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

633
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,208
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

634
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,043
You know him. You know his family.

635
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,504
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

636
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:51,880
You have a hundred other lords...

637
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,966
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

638
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,678
If Renly sides with us,

639
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:01,264
we'll outnumber them two to one.

640
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:04,142
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

641

We'll get the girls back.

00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,898
Then we'll all go home, for good.

- King Renly.

Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

652
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,889
That is a seat for a conqueror.

653
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,559
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

We can't find Arya Stark.

With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

656
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,274
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

657
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,610
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

658
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,195
I think they might. They're weak.

659
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,197
They put too much value on their women.

660
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,910
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

661

Send out as many men as we can.

I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

663
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,750
The king does not ask, he commands.

664
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,629
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

665
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:58,548
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

666
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,508
His life is in danger.

Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
