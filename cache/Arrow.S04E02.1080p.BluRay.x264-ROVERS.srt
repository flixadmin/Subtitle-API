1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,128
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,890
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,721
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,447
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.
I had to become someone else.</i>

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,450
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,763
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,724
Previously on Arrow...

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,285
I wanna know what I'm doing here.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,561
Where's Waller?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,286
Your job is to infiltrate the area
and report back.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,125
<i>The media's
been calling them the Ghosts.</i>

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,805
They're <i>like</i> nothing we'd
ever seen before.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,081
We need the Arrow.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,250
<i>I'm the one who controls the...
What do you people call them? The Ghosts?</i>

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,441
I'm Damien Darhk.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,762
Mass murder? Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,610
You signed up to follow my instructions.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,006
And if I don't help you?

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,287
You don't have a choice.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,087
<i>Six months ago, the Arrow died.
But what he stood for didn't.</i>

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,325
<i>I am declaring my intention
to fight for this city.</i>

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,169
<i>- I</i> want a codename.
- What?

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,007
Well, everyone's got a codename.
You even got a new one. I want a codename.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,168
Find the bomb and then we'll talk.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,966
I'm scanning frequency signatures.
I just know we're not gonna talk about it.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,406
John, you've got a runner.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,846
I'm on it.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,202
Got it. Ghosts' frequency of choice is on
the ground level.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,682
<i>Ten 'II get you 20 it's the bomb.
I don't mean that "it's the bomb,"</i>

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,924
like it's good, like, "it's the bomb!"
I mean like it's the explosive.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,730
Got it. Ground floor.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,887
You better move it.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,201
<i>The signal strength I'm reading,</i>

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,209
they can blow the treatment plant
from Central City.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,090
It's done. Get Diggle down here
to handle the dismantling.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,924
You know, it seems like he could
use a codename, too.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,526
Just get him down here.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,562
Saving the city's water supply, that's
an honest night's... Morning's work.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,407
Yeah, but no matter what we do,
these Ghosts, they keep coming.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,571
We still did a good job tonight.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,761
Yeah, not good enough.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,769
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,209
Kind of felt like you were
out there for blood tonight.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,727
Look, you haven't been dealing with these
Ghosts as long as we have.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,049
If I go easy on them,
things are gonna end bad really fast.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,090
I'm worried that if you keep going the way
that you're going,

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,442
you're going to put one
of them down permanently.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,250
I know where the line ends, okay?
And look, it's almost 9:00.

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,125
Mrs. Danforth and Madison are gonna be
at our house in, like, an hour.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,446
So I have time for one of your lectures
or a shower. I pick shower.

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,005
Is everything okay?

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,643
You look nice.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,969
It's my first day back at Palmer Tech.
I get to be bossy today

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,408
because I am the boss of a
multibillion-dollar corporation.

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,928
I know I should be nervous, I know,
but I'm not. I'm actually really excited.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,002
You should be excited. That's why I got
you the first-day-as-a-boss fern.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,486
Aw.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,210
And packed your lunch.

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,851
Who are you?

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,165
Who are you?

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,650
Answer me!

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,526
All right.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,371
What?

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,566
Come on.

65
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,085
<i>Madison, how's school?</i>

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,483
It's good. I graduate in May
with a degree in Ancient Philosophy.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,527
Ancient Philosophy? What happened to
your dream of being J.T.'s backup dancer?

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,007
That's still plan B, obviously.

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,881
It is so lovely to see you two. Really.
It's been far too long.

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,684
No, Thea and I were glad you got in touch.

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,724
Yeah, we were a little surprised though.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,611
Well, I admit that
reconnecting with the son and daughter

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,721
of one of my dearest friends is not the
only reason that I wanted to see you.

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,730
And here comes the crazy.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,442
Last week, like the rest of the city,
I saw the Green Arrow's broadcast.

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
And it hit me.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,243
If that man could take up the Arrow's
mantle, I could take up your mother's.

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,402
Um, how?

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,765
By running for mayor.

80
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,969
See, I told you. Crazy.

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,290
No one's opposing me, obviously.
But there'll still need to be an election.

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,289
There's a very good reason that no one
else is running.

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,449
Yeah, the last three mayors
have been killed.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,887
To say nothing of the city's leadership
last week.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,128
Which is exactly why we need
a mayor more than ever.

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,449
I want to step forward,
and I'm asking for your support.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,961
Wow. You guys look bigger than you did
when you were on my computer screen.

88
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,327
Perhaps, we should begin with this
quarter's financials.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,610
Thank you. Uh... Okay.

90
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,250
I know I don't have a business degree
or an accounting degree or an MBA,

91
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,802
but this looks very, very bad.

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,922
These are hard times
for everyone in Star City.

93
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,531
This company is not immune.

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,161
Fortunately, Mr. Holt
has devised us a way out.

95
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,965
Oh. Goody.

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,931
Um... Hello. I'm actually not
a member of the board.

97
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,367
I work in the
Design Innovations department.

98
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,489
Tell Ms. Smoak about your algorithm.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,970
It's pretty simple, actually.

100
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,162
I used specialized A.l.
to determine maximum profits

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,800
which can be derived with a minimal
amount of workforce reduction.

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,609
Sorry. I probably could've
explained that better.

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,841
<i>No. I got the gist.</i>

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,202
You came up with a list
of people that you'd like me to fire.

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,291
"Workforce reduction"
has a nicer sound to it.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,284
It's just kind of rolls off the tongue.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,331
Yeah. Well, the only thing
we'll be reducing

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,681
is all of your bonuses, to start.

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,566
We've already been down that road and
exhausted all other avenues, Ms. Smoak.

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,202
I didn't come back to this company to put
the people who work here out of work.

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,011
I came here to protect
Ray Palmer's legacy.

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,204
And if we do not dramatically reduce our
costs or increase our profits,

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
there won't be a legacy to protect.

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,887
Am I the only one that has
a bad feeling about this?

115
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,562
I mean, signing up to be mayor of this
town is like asking to be part of Titanic.

116
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,564
You heard me try to talk
her out of running.

117
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,241
I'm pretty sure that got covered up

118
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,005
by you telling her we'd be at her big
announcement.

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,009
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Jessica Danforth.</i>

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,209
<i>Thank you. Thank you all so much.</i>

121
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,761
<i>For the past six months, the mayor's
office at City Hall has stood vacant,</i>

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,409
<i>waiting for someone to step forward
on behalf of Star City.</i>

123
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,602
<i>And today, I am here with all of you
to tell you that I am stepping forward.</i>

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,562
<i>Two years ago, I lost my good friend,
Moira Queen,</i>

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,243
<i>who was also a candidate for mayor.</i>

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,042
<i>And I remain inspired by her kind heart
and her selfless devotion to this city.</i>

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,921
Shots came from up there. No, no, no.
You protect Jessica, okay? I've got this.

128
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,641
The shots are just a distraction!
There's no Ghosts up here.

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,127
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
You're not on her detail.

130
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,967
Get back to the atrium!

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,246
Oliver, how...

132
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,805
Uh... Self-defense classes.

133
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,011
She announces her candidacy

134
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,003
and two seconds later
someone's trying to kill her?

135
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,525
That must be a record, even for our city.

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,887
And she's not dropping out of the race,
so this isn't over.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,884
My father has a protective detail on her.

138
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,884
Yeah, but even with protection
at the announcement,

139
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,167
she didn't seem to be too safe.

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,521
Is it just me or is the shooting of a

141
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,523
potential city leader
feeling a little Ghost-y?

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,683
This guy wasn't wearing a mask so...

143
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,323
There was something else different
about him. He left behind evidence.

144
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,521
<i>Fingerprints.</i>

145
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,205
How'd you get the
owner to part with his windshield?

146
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,084
I bought his truck.

147
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,924
It's one of the benefits
of your girlfriend inheriting

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,210
a multibillion dollar conglomerate.
We have money now.

149
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,886
I don't exactly think
that was money well spent.

150
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,883
I don't think these prints
are gonna do us any good.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,047
What the hell?

152
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,090
I'm not an expert, but I think our new
friend may have cut off his fingertips

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,049
and played a little bit of mix and match.

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,881
I'll keep digging. Maybe this is an M.O.
that'll tell us something.

155
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,042
In the meantime, we backstop the SCPD.

156
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,561
Thea was right. Jessica needs
more than the police can offer.

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,884
She's in protective custody and I'm
pretty sure my father wouldn't be in favor

158
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,724
of us staking out his precinct.

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,006
I'll talk 110 him.

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,924
Oh, yeah. That'll definitely go over well.

161
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,524
Mrs. Danforth is under our protection,
24/7,

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,131
until this nutbar's in cuffs.

163
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,244
Do you have a minute?

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,404
Caught your TV debut.
Guess you decided to stick around.

165
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,086
It's gonna be different this time.

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,210
Yeah, yeah, sure it will, 'cause you got
a new name, now, right? With a color.

167
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,410
"Green Arrow." It's catchy.

168
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,602
Jessica Danforth is a friend.

169
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,961
We would like to help keep her safe.

170
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,326
With everything this city's facing,

171
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,800
I thought you could use
all the help you could get.

172
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,611
You've been gone.
You don't know what this city's facing.

173
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,922
Well, I'm not saying
it doesn't need saving.

174
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,245
But a guy hiding behind
a mask isn't gonna get it done.

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,602
What this city needs is someone willing to
stand up in the light of day,

176
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,603
not a guy lurking around in the shadows.

177
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,811
You say you're gonna be different
this time, huh? How?

178
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,401
You're late.

179
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,688
I know. Sorry. I was looking at
the numbers again and...

180
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,248
Oh, you mean the "numbers" of people that
your magic "downsizing algorithm"

181
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,686
is making us fire today.

182
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,242
- Downsizing... You think I... I didn't.
- Let's get one thing straight.

183
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,649
The only person who is allowed to talk in
sentence fragments around here is me.

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,851
I developed my algorithm
to create a value matrix.

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,731
To argue for company-wide
pay increases. Raises.

186
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,049
Mr. Dennis turned it around and had me
use it to figure out who to fire.

187
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,211
So this wasn't your idea?

188
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,523
I was trying to get people to get paid
more, not paid nothing.

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,682
Hi. I'm Karla Groves.
My supervisor asked me to come see you.

190
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,442
Hi. Yes. Um...
I don't know quite how to say this...

191
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,249
I'm fired.

192
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,726
But clearly you do.

193
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,406
As rumors go,
downsizing ones tend to go viral.

194
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,967
I'm very sorry. I didn't come back here to
put people out of work.

195
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,081
But I am hoping that by losing a fewjobs,
I can save many, many more.

196
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,249
That looks like a little more than a few.

197
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,600
Yes. The company is going
through a difficult time.

198
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,881
I know.

199
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,606
And when we heard you were coming back,
we thought things were going to get

200
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,086
a lot better.

201
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,086
Guess we were wrong.

202
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,488
I'm still hungry.
Is it wrong that I'm still hungry? John?

203
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,402
Shift change is in 10 minutes.

204
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,288
You know, for the past week, you've been
pretty intense.

205
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,285
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

206
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,609
And don't tell me
it's because Oliver is back.

207
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,649
Well, I'm not happy Oliver's back.

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,968
Yeah, you weren't exactly
subtle about that.

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,851
Just let it go, Laurel.

210
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,123
No, because we don't keep secrets,
remember?

211
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,090
John, what's going on?

212
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,091
Remember last week,
when Oliver was telling us about Darhk?

213
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,203
He said he had a hive of followers.

214
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,771
An organization called
H.l.V.E. killed my brother.

215
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,808
I didn't know.

216
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,690
Do you think it's some
kind of coincidence?

217
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,885
No. I've been looking into this
organization for two years now.

218
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,645
<i>All dead ends.</i>

219
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,123
But what I did manage to dig up tracks
with what we know about Darhk's Ghosts.

220
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,691
They're H.l.V.E.

221
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,011
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

222
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,691
No.

223
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,005
You've been investigating this for
two years and you haven't told anyone?

224
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,531
This is a family thing, Laurel,

225
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,687
I would think you of all people would
understand keeping secrets

226
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,166
when it comes to the death of a sibling.

227
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,811
I do.

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,641
And because I do, I can tell you,
carrying a burden like that,

229
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,084
it never ends in any way but bad.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,565
That was quite the show.

231
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,207
False machine gun.
Impersonating a bodyguard.

232
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,405
You've the flair for the dramatic,
Mr. Machin. I will give you that.

233
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,927
Too bad it was all for nothing.

234
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,202
Half of your fee has been
wired into your account.

235
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,090
This isn't about money for me.

236
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,085
I know. You came to me with promises.

237
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,087
You wanted to impress yourself
to my organization, and you failed.

238
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,882
I'm not done yet. Just give me more time.

239
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,885
I will make sure that Jessica Danforth
does not run for mayor.

240
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,569
Very well. However, a word of caution.

241
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,088
I'm not sure how Rick Pinzolo runs his
operation, but H.l.V.E. does not believe

242
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,527
in third chances. Good night.

243
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,770
Spoke to Diggle.
No movement at the precinct.

244
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,043
That's all right.
I may have some movement here.

245
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,886
I noticed something tacky on the palm
print our guy left on the windshield.

246
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,449
- Tacky?
- Like a residue.

247
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,291
What kind?

248
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,482
Cellulose.
Oh, except this formulation is special.

249
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,290
The molecular structure's been patented.

250
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,606
BY Who?

251
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,126
Palmer Technologies.

252
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,725
A subsidiary, actually. Palmer Paper.

253
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,486
I had to shut down the mill a couple
months ago as a cost-cutting measure.

254
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,491
Where's the paper mill?

255
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,164
Hey, stay sharp.
He has some sort of electricity weapon.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,923
The man in the photo, have you seen him?

257
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,489
I don't see much. I like my sleep.

258
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,842
But that guy, he sees a lot. He deals
outta here. Does a lot of business.

259
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,491
Hey, we need to ask you a few questions.

260
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,011
Step off, freak.

261
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,201
Have you seen this guy here?
I want a name.

262
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,329
You masks, you think you're in charge.

263
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,170
Yeah, well, maybe you were,
but not anymore.

264
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,330
There are new masks in charge.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,324
I asked you. Have you seen this guy here?
Do you still wanna use your arm?

266
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,010
Let him go!

267
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,810
You still think you're in charge?

268
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,805
Hey! Get out of here!

269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,405
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

270
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,529
I thought his fingerprints were
all screwed up.

271
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,484
Mixed up. But I have an obsession
with jigsaw puzzles.

272
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,204
Lonnie Machin. Part-time mob enforcer,
full-time crazy-pants.

273
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,242
Done jobs for the Bertinellis,
the Triad, Rick Pinzolo...

274
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,206
We're going to talk about this.

275
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,921
We're going to have a conversation
about what just happened.

276
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,361
What just happened was that guy had

277
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,443
information and I was
trying to get it out of him!

278
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,051
- You broke his arm.
- He was stalling!

279
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,526
He was scared. Come here!

280
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,727
What are you doing?

281
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,406
I'll just show you something.
At the water-plant, you took down a Ghost.

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,491
You could have done it with a very
simple disarming technique. Like this.

283
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,722
Thea, that's not what you did.

284
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,207
You went overboard

285
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,048
with a series of techniques
designed to do one thing, cripple!

286
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,527
Oliver!

287
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,526
That's enough!

288
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,682
- Come on! Come on!
- That's enough!

289
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,000
Demonstration's over.

290
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,611
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

291
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,250
After Ra's hurt you,

292
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,128
Malcolm warned me
not to take you to Nanda Parbat.

293
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,210
He said that when people go in the Pit,

294
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,290
they don't come out the same.

295
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,450
And I didn't tell you because
I didn't wanna worry about you.

296
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,563
You seemed normal, Thea.

297
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,768
And I swear to God,
I thought everything was gonna be fine.

298
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,643
And then you left. So you know what?

299
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,811
It doesn't really qualify you to judge me,
or anyone else!

300
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,764
What's going on?
What happened to Thea in Nanda Parbat?

301
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,767
I did what I had to do to save my sister.

302
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,324
That was six months ago.

303
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,164
Why is the Pit only affecting her now?

304
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,251
It's probably been showing up over time.
Subtly.

305
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,925
So what do you want to do about it?

306
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,684
You! Hey! Stay down!

307
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,081
I guess you know what happened to Kenny.

308
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,850
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Just shut up!

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,004
That's a minefield, all right?
That's what killed your friend.

310
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,651
And who the hell are you?

311
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,851
My name is Oliver Queen.

312
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,849
Three years ago, the yacht that I was on
went down in a storm.

313
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,765
I washed up here. I survived.

314
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,531
Let's take him to Reiter.
He'll know what to do with him.

315
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,803
Wow. You look like someone who has
to fire a whole mess of people today.

316
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,202
What? Oh, no. I mean, yes.
But this isn't about this.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,890
Not that firing a dozen people is going
to do much for my mood.

318
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,530
Actually, it's two dozen.

319
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,002
- What?
- The pages are double-sided.

320
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,051
But there has to be another way.

321
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,011
This many intelligent people in the
company, there has to be someone who...

322
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,531
Ms. Smoak? Are you all right?

323
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,411
Absolutely.

324
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,243
- It's okay.
- What is?

325
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,851
I'm on the list, aren't I?

326
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,244
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

327
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,282
It's okay. It means one less person that
you have to fire today, right?

328
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,648
You know, actually, this is good news
in a way. My husband'll be thrilled.

329
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,491
I mean, this way, we can take that trip
that he's been wanting to go on.

330
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,889
Of course, I'll have to drive.

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,367
You don't have to try and make me feel
better about this.

332
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,684
About what? I sort of fired myself.

333
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,164
Come to visit me in my confinement?

334
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,251
I thought you could use some company.

335
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,925
And a little, "I told you so"?

336
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,209
Oh, I didn't bring it.

337
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,680
You know, that being said,
it's not too late for you to drop out.

338
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,566
And send what message?

339
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,281
That on top of the city's other problems,
we give in to terrorism?

340
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,360
The people here deserve better.

341
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,124
They deserve someone to be brave for them.

342
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,601
That's what the Green Arrow is for.

343
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,290
He's not enough.

344
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,123
Yes, the Green Arrow risks his life to
keep the people of the city safe,

345
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,926
but who inspires them?

346
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,646
You know, who works to make sure
that there's a city worth saving?

347
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,643
Who's there to make Star City a place
that my daughter wants to call home?

348
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,965
Where is Madison?

349
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,284
Oh. Library. Poor kid has finals
so I sent her back to school.

350
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,803
Don't worry. Captain Lance sent her with
more than enough cops to keep her safe.

351
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,122
Maybe you should call her.

352
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,529
To the man who took my daughter, please,
lam begging you. Please let my baby go.

353
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,011
She's all I have. She's my whole world.

354
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,448
Killed the officers escorting her
with some kinda weapon.

355
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,530
Shot them up with five thousand volts,
slit their throats for good measure.

356
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,890
His name is Lonnie Machin.

357
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,610
Do I even want to know
how you got that intel?

358
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,606
You can't do this alone. You know that.
Now, two of your guys are down.

359
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,490
Now let us help.

360
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,686
What is this place?

361
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,120
Over there.

362
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,042
Baron, this guy says he's...

363
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,329
Oliver Queen. You don't recognize him?

364
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,367
This man's a minor celebrity
on the other side of the world.

365
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
You're supposed to be dead.

366
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,205
Nearly was.

367
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,850
Thank you for rescuing me.

368
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,848
I'm sorry, but we're not rescuing you.

369
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,925
The first thing you do once you get home

370
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
is tell people what
it is we're doing here.

371
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
I don't know what you're doing here.

372
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,365
Be that as it may, I can't send you home.

373
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,210
Not right now.

374
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,851
Good news, though,
I've no reason to kill you.

375
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,046
So what are you gonna do to me?

376
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,006
Good question.

377
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,210
You've survived three years here.
All alone.

378
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,206
That requires fortitude, intelligence.

379
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,885
Qualities that are of use to me.

380
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,404
As it happens, one of my men
stepped on a land mine.

381
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,611
How would you like his job?

382
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,206
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

383
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,371
What did you do?
Where is Jessica Danforth's daughter?

384
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,050
Did you catch the news earlier?

385
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,041
Ms. Danforth,
begging for her daughter's life.

386
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,966
She'll do anything to get her back.

387
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,330
Or not do anything. Like run for mayor.

388
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,245
All I have to do is make a phone call.

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,722
Now I see why Rick Pinzolo banished you.

390
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,085
You're unaware that there are lines
one does not cross.

391
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,803
I met one of your Ghosts.

392
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,965
After I took his tooth, we had an
interesting conversation about H.l.V.E.

393
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,760
I wasn't led to believe
you respected lines.

394
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,406
I respect order, Mr. Machin.

395
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,167
Discipline. Precision. You are sloppy.

396
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,642
All you represent is anarchy. You made
a mess. I suggest you clean it up.

397
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,765
Either way, our relationship is concluded.

398
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,367
Wait. You can't.

399
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,366
You know your hand is on me?

400
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,331
Clean it up.

401
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,280
<i>To the man who took my daughter,</i>

402
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,726
<i>please,</i>

403
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,007
<i>"I am begging Yo" -</i>

404
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,810
That's heartbreaking.

405
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,240
<i>Please let my baby go.</i>

406
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,040
Hey-

407
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,000
Are you okay?

408
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,764
Just can't stand watching
Jessica go through that.

409
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,168
I feel like that's what my mom felt like
when Slade Wilson abducted me.

410
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,642
That's not what you asked, though. Um...

411
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm fine.

412
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,486
Well, you could have fooled me.

413
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,207
Thea.

414
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,485
What happened to you on Nanda Parbat?

415
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,571
Ollie didn't tell you?

416
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,886
It's Ollie.

417
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,004
I guess I really am his sister
since I didn't tell you either.

418
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,803
I just didn't want to relive it.

419
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,686
Relive what?

420
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,651
Ra's, he...

421
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,207
He killed me.

422
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,046
Or almost did.

423
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,284
Ollie said that it was pretty bad.

424
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,211
And then Ra's

425
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,085
offered to use something...

426
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,130
I don't know, to bring me back.

427
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,648
Something he calls a "Lazarus Pit."

428
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,688
Wait, so what's happening to you now is...

429
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,444
is a side-effect from this Pit?

430
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,605
And Malcolm tried to warn Ollie,
lguess, buthe

431
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,766
didn't listen.

432
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,890
No, of course he didn't.

433
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,009
He would do anything to save his sister.

434
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,531
I swear, if there is even
a scratch on that girl, so help me...

435
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,370
I'm afraid that is out of my control.

436
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah, well, so am I. lam out.
Lam all the way out!

437
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,246
Well, I suppose you need a reminder
that Madison Danforth is not the only

438
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,324
vulnerable daughter in this city.

439
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,246
You stay the hell away from my daughter,
you son of a bitch!

440
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,120
Language.

441
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,001
What is this?

442
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,725
The location of the Danforth girl.

443
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,882
My sincere threat
against your daughter notwithstanding,

444
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
this abduction lacks taste.

445
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,809
The next time we meet, and make
no mistake, there will be a next time,

446
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,447
remember to mind your tone.

447
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,166
Any news?

448
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,328
Only the bad kind.

449
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,329
Hey, we're going catch this guy.

450
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,090
Yeah. And when we do,
there'll be another one waiting for us.

451
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,725
And another. And another.

452
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,725
It's like the most depressing game
of Whack-A-Mole ever.

453
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,729
Can't say we didn't know
what we were getting into.

454
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,607
Or back into.

455
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,804
When we decided to stay in Starling,

456
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,764
I mean, Star City,

457
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,769
I was excited.
I thought it meant a new beginning.

458
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,611
And now, we've only been back a week,
John,

459
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,484
still mad at you, Thea's gone Pit-crazy.

460
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,808
I've spent the last two days
putting people out of work.

461
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,809
If you think that we made a mistake,
we didn't.

462
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,003
Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy.

463
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,765
We said that we're going
to do things differently.

464
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,646
We just need time to figure out how.

465
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,327
Captain.

466
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,403
Heavy Heavy Club, Fourth and Pierce.

467
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,886
<i>What about it?</i>

468
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,731
It's where Lonnie Machin is
holding Jessica Danforth's daughter.

469
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,641
You said you're doing things
differently now?

470
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,490
Here's your chance to prove it.

471
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,890
Sorry to leave you hanging.
I had a meeting. Didn't go well.

472
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,409
Turns out, I can't sit
at the cool kids' table.

473
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,682
When trillions and trillions of
molecules exploded from a pinhead,

474
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,207
were there rules dictating how
to establish a universe?

475
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,046
No.

476
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,488
They found their way through the chaos.

477
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,287
Please, you can still let me go. Please!

478
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,848
Only if you promise not to tell
anybody about me.

479
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,726
Okay. Please.

480
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,690
Pinky swear?

481
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,640
I changed my mind.

482
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,286
My God!

483
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,609
The things I'm about to do to you...

484
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,605
Something wrong with the front door?

485
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,763
Get away from the girl.

486
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,362
Could you come back in an hour?
We were just getting started.

487
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,640
Let's get her down.

488
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,047
Felicity.

489
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,329
So now, madman du jour knows
you're working with a Felicity.

490
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,726
This is why I need a codename.

491
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,331
We have Madison, but he's split.

492
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,082
No movement outside the club.
He must still be in there with you.

493
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,361
She needs medical attention.

494
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,801
Get her to safety. We've got this.

495
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,721
Hey, can you handle this?

496
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,886
I'm good.

497
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,409
(%GR0ANs)
- Speedy!

498
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,807
Speedy, don't!

499
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,884
- Baby!
- Mom!

500
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,080
- Baby!
- Mom!

501
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,047
My baby!

502
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,043
I'm okay. I'm okay.

503
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,649
Madison, are you all right?

504
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,730
Yeah, bumps and bruises.

505
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,763
Probably the world's worst
case of insomnia.

506
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,728
I'm really sorry, but I got
an army of reporters out there

507
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,410
and they wanna know
if you want to make a statement.

508
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,721
Yes. I'll be out in a few minutes.

509
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,001
You don't have to do that tonight.

510
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,283
Yes, I do. Oliver, I have to tell them
what I've decided.

511
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,884
I have to tell them
I'm withdrawing my candidacy.

512
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,325
I'm not running for mayor.

513
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,560
Come on.

514
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,886
Thank you for trusting me.

515
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,321
You weren't kidding about
doing things differently, were you?

516
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,441
Instead of pin cushioning guys,
now you're burning them alive?

517
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,647
Yeah, Captain...

518
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,285
You're lucky Major is on his way to
Starling General,

519
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,244
or I would be booking you for murder.

520
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,041
Just so you're clear
where we stand with each other.

521
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,729
This man needs some water.
Did you hear me?

522
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,651
Yeah, I heard. Get back to work!

523
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,526
What are you going to do when all your
workers are dead from heat stroke?

524
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,930
Not your concern.

525
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,602
Like the man said, get back to work!

526
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,007
Ms. Smoak,

527
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,686
what's this we're hearing about
you halting the workforce reduction?

528
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,086
I thought we agreed...

529
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,806
You talked and I listened.
I wouldn't hardly call that an agreement.

530
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,126
With that said,
I did get around to firing a few people.

531
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,731
They've all been hired back, BTW.

532
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,046
And one of them reminded me that

533
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,129
Ray Palmer never would
have approved of this.

534
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,762
Ray Palmer is dead.
And this company will be too, unless...

535
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,008
I am going to stop you right there.

536
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,608
I'm sorry, Ms. Smoak,
you asked to see me. Uh...

537
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,161
I think there's been a mistake.

538
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,885
No. Actually, you have perfect timing.

539
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,088
I was just about to tell
Mr. Dennis about your project.

540
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,521
After I fired Mr. Holt, I had the
opportunity to review his active projects.

541
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,165
Turns out he is working
on something that is going to

542
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,522
revolutionize technology
and save this company.

543
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,845
Neither of which he can do with
a reduced workforce supporting him.

544
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,210
Intriguing. So what's this revolutionary
technology, Mr. Holt?

545
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,847
- Uh... It's...
- That is proprietary.

546
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,201
But I can assure you,
it will astonish the world.

547
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,962
Our annual shareholder's meeting
is in six months.

548
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,683
Present it there. Astonish us.

549
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,645
Oh, we will.

550
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,323
You don't even have an idea for some
"world-astonishing" technology, do you?

551
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,528
Nope. But I'm betting that you do.

552
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,690
Pretty bold move, Ms. Smoak.

553
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,047
Yeah, well, I'm trying to do things
a little differently.

554
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,406
Hello. Hey! How are you?

555
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,849
I guess I was wrong when I told you
not to worry about me.

556
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,049
Right or wrong, I'm still gonna worry.

557
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,927
It's right at the top of the
big brotherjob description.

558
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,521
Thea. I should have told you
about the Pit immediately.

559
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,206
That was the old me.

560
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,603
And who are you now?

561
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,724
Ollie 2.0?

562
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,365
No. I'm more like

563
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,891
Ollie 1.0
who's trying to do things differently.

564
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,243
<i>Look, whatever you are going through,</i>

565
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,447
we will get through it together.

566
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,930
I thought Thea could use some time out of
town. A spa getaway to clear her head.

567
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,726
As long as it's not near any hot tubs.

568
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,406
'Cause that's what got me
in this situation.

569
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,726
I think it's a good idea.

570
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,565
Can you and John handle things
while we're away?

571
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,127
Yeah. As long as we don't
kill each other first.

572
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,246
Bye.

573
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,086
I'm kidding, by the way.
We'll be fine. Probably.

574
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,286
Take care of her, okay?

575
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,926
Okay.

576
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,244
I like a spa as much as anybody, but I

577
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,249
think we both know whatever is going on

578
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,086
with me will not be fixed
with a mani-pedi.

579
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,811
That's why we're not going to the spa.

580
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,080
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

581
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,764
Thea, whatever is going on with you,

582
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,920
the League, they'll know what to do.

583
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,286
Why are we not telling my brother?

584
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,161
Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.

585
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,887
What happened?

586
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,485
The ambulance didn't make it to
Starling General.

587
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,960
We tried to get the paramedics
on the radio,

588
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,487
and then we got a 911 call reporting this.

589
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,564
Machin, he...

590
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,646
I don't really know how to describe
what he did to them.

591
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,810
I'm not sure what that symbol means.

592
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,485
It means "anarchy."

593
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,880
Hello!

594
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,320
Hey, I'm out here.

595
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,484
You look happy.

596
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,323
Don't tell me you started
enjoying firing people?

597
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,165
No more firing.

598
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,046
Good.

599
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,171
I figured out another way.

600
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,685
Wow. Maybe you could share
your secret with me.

601
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,241
Doing things differently
is what I promised myself.

602
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,525
You are doing things differently.

603
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,609
Not different enough, apparently.

604
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,564
Both Lance and Jessica Danforth
said something to me

605
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,851
about this city needing something
that the Green Arrow can't offer.

606
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,850
A decent sushi restaurant?

607
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,521
Hope. Inspiration.

608
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,046
Someone who can do things in the light,
who isn't afraid and...

609
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,566
Someone who can protect himself.

610
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,202
- Felicity.
- Mmm?

611
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,569
I'm going to run for mayor.

612
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,765
Are you sure you want to do this?

613
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,001
English - SDH
