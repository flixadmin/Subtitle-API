00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,018
I'll just go.

655
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:07,063
HUGHIE: They're all like that?

656
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,566
All of them? Even Homelander?

657
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,986
Homelander's the exception.

658
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:15,030
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

659
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:17,157
Man's a saint.

660
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,867
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

661
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,286
Pardon my French, fuck those fuckers.

662
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:22,871
Here.

663
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,290
Have a shufti of that.

664
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:27,292
- What are these?
- That's the police log

665
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,794
the day that Robin got murdered.

666
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:33,089
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

667
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,592
But you know what's not in there?

668
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,345
No bank alarms going off.

669
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,639
No one charged at Central Booking.

670
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,974
A-Train stopped two
bank robbers, my arse.

671
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:45,352
Someone's fucking hiding something.

672
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:47,479
- Hiding what?
- Well, I don't know,

673
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,357
whatever dodgy shit he
was up to that night.

674
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,734
Why couldn't he stop? I
mean, what was in that bag?

675
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,778
You know? Who was he running from?

676
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:57,364
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

677
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:01,159
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

678
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:03,036
Okay.

679
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,748
Okay, so, um...

680
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,833
what can I do to help?

681
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,169
Here's what you do.

682
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:14,172
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

683
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:17,258
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

684
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,653
Why does A-Train need to be there?

685
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:19,946
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

686
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,179
through security, mate,

687
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,181
- and then you're gonna plant a bug.
- A bug?

688
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:25,392
A bug. And we'll have a little listen.

689
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,644
See what's really going on.

690
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,313
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

691
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:33,817
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

692
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:36,152
and-and you want me to plant a bug,

693
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,780
like I'm... what, like
I'm fuckin' James Bond?

694
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:41,408
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

695
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,118
If you're FBI, then get a warrant.

696
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,429
- Why do you... why do you even need me?
- Hughie, Hughie,

697
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:47,914
look, mate, I got a warrant, all right?

698
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:50,625
But that place is
firewalled, untappable,

699
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,387
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

700
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,546
I couldn't get myself in
there in a million years.

701
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,214
But you, son, you could do it.

702
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:58,008
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

703
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,135
I can't. No. You didn't
see A-Train covered in...

704
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,345
And-and I'm, what, I'm just
supposed to go in there,

705
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,723
and I'm supposed to... I'm
supposed to shake his hand?

706
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,766
- And smile?
- Yeah.

707
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:09,185
I'm not... Do you know who
my favorite musician is?

708
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,979
- Who?
- James Taylor.

709
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:13,940
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

710
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,609
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

711
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:18,945
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

712

713

You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

714
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,575
No. No. No.

715
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,869
No, I can't. I can't do that.

716
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,038
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna fuck it up,

717
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,040
and you're not gonna have your bug...

718
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,083
(PANTING): ... and I'll be dead.

719

00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:46,056
Thank you for this. My
kid is gonna lose his mind.

All right. What are you thinking?

00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,607
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:58,359
But you've got a problem.

730
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:02,322
Your homicide rates are up, what, 62%?

731
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,074
The police are not closing cases.

732
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:05,968
You're on the verge of
needing a federal lifeline.

Who are you proposing?

735
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,248
Nubian Prince.

736
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,209
Fits your population's demo,

737
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,044
but not too militant.

738
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,213
Caucasians love him, too, with a...

739

59% approval rate.

740
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:24,594
I am willing to give you a
three-year exclusive contract

741
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,638
with full PR support,

742
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,307
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

743
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,434
of the merchandising.

744

I thought he was in Detroit.

745

Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

746

How much?

747
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,776
- $300 million a year.

But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

751

$200 million for Nubian Prince.

00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,209
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

753

I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

And why is that?

757
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:11,057
I happen to know about Compound V.

758
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,979
What is Compound V?

759
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,897
It's the type of rumor

760
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:20,150
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

761

People need heroes.

763
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,322
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

764
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,324
because I'm a friend.

765
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:31,619
But friendship does cut both ways.

I'm sorry, Steve, I don't
know what you're talking about.

767
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:38,459
$300 million is the price,

768
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:41,087
or we go to Atlanta.

Uh... he's busy.

on about how her daughter

did you want to tell me?

skating at Rockefeller,

with this death grip on the rails.

She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

a lot...

"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

Saw it on, uh, Jimmy Fallon.

1138
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,586
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

1139
00:56:07,627 --> 00:56:08,962
Good job.

1140
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:10,297
Let's get him in the boot.

1141
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:12,549
Wait, wait, what? Wait, what? What?

1142

(GRUNTS) The trunk.

1143
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:15,903
No, no, I mean, what
are we... what are we...

1144
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,471
what are we doing with him?

1145
00:56:17,512 --> 00:56:19,931
Well, Hughie, you just
offed one of The Seven, mate.

1146
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:21,350
Me? I...

1147
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,227
You-you hit him with a fucking car!

1148
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:26,605
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

1149
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:28,398
We're both in a shitload of trouble.

1150
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,025
No, no, no, we're not! It's... It...

1151
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,527
He-he attacked us, okay?

1152
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,988
And you're-you're a
federal officer, you know?

1153
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,657
Just-just call the fucking FBI.

1154
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:39,493
Yeah, o-okay, so, look,

1155
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:42,329
technically, I'm not a Fed.

1156
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,832
What?!

1157
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,920
Then who the fuck are you?!

00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,807
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

1160
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,267
It'll be okay.
