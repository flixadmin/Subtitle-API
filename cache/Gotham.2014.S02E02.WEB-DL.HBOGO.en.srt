00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,480
My best wishes
to Commissioner Essen.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,360
Welcome back, Jim.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,760
I don't know how you pulled this off,
but I'm glad you did.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,440
Sometimes the right way
is also the ugly way.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,640
There's been an incident
at Arkham Asylum,

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,920
six inmates have escaped.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Barbara Kean was one of them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,160
The world sees criminal lunatics.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,240
I see brilliance.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,800
Gotham will tremble before you.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>"I beg of you, my son,
please, choose happiness.</i>

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,120
<i>Unless you feel a calling,
a true calling."</i>

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,160
Mr. Mayor, you wanna know
what I really am?

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,080
Yes, sir.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
- Shall I tell you?
- Please, please.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,080
At heart, I'm an ardent student
of human nature.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,120
Fascinating paradox we are.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,560
So wise, yet so foolish,
so brave, and yet so fearful.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,440
For instance, this is a glass jar

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,840
inside of it, is a hairy spider,
a tarantula, I guess

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
but I'm no expert.

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,360
In a minute,
I'm gonna open that little hatch

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,680
in the front of your box,

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm gonna drop the spider inside,
and I'm gonna close it.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,960
That's choice A.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,600
Choice B, I open the hatch

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,040
you speak to your lovely secretary,
Maggie, on the telephone

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
you tell her you've run away
with some woman

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,120
and you'll be sending
written instructions shortly.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
So which is it, Choice A or Choice B?

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,640
Choice B, please. Please, Choice B.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,160
The Telephone.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Of course...

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,440
it's human nature.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880
See? There is no spider.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,960
But if you don't do what I ask,
you'll wish there was one.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
Why are you doing this to me?

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,280
Don't fret so.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
You're part of a great endeavor.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
A great cleansing.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,440
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.
Monsters.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Cleanse the city, implied and fire.

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
What the hell is this?

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,680
<i>"Where is Mayor James?
Who is his mystery lover?"</i>

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,360
No one cares
who the mayor is banging!

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
You can do better than this,
people.

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Now, go out and get me
some headlines, damn it!

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
What the heck?

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes, all right, all right.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh, my God.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,880
Perfect. Next.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Mister X.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A little to the right.

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, that's the spot.

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Perfect.

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,320
What shall we do with the spare?

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
I know.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Aaron, would you kindly...

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Maniax!

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Now that's a headline.

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,800
You all know what we're facing here.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,320
48 hours ago,
six criminally insane inmates

65
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
{\an5}were busted out of Arkham Asylum.

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,400
{\an5}Yesterday, four of those inmates
broke in to Yellen Shipyard,

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,960
{\an5}kidnapped seven workers,

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,760
{\an5}then dropped them off the roof
of the Gotham Gazette.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,680
{\an5}As of now, we still have no leads

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,320
{\an5}on the person or persons
behind the breakout.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
{\an5}Jim Gordon's lead. Jim.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
{\an5}These are our targets.

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
{\an5}Jerome Valeska,
18 years old, matricide.

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,280
{\an5}Arnold Dobkins, schizophrenic,
poisoner, rapist.

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,880
Aaron Helzinger...

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,080
killed his entire family
with his bare hands.

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,280
Robert Greenwood,
killed and then ate a dozen women.

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
{\an5}Barbara Kean...

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
killed her parents.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,960
{\an5}We'll gonna work this
in groups of four.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,920
{\an5}I'll hand out assignments
throughout the day.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
{\an5}Alvarez is my coordinating officer.

83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
{\an5}Any questions?

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
Let's get to work.

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,120
{\an5}Fine job yesterday, gentlemen.
We opened big.

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,160
{\an5}The whole city knows your name now.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,920
{\an5}So bravo. Let's give ourselves
a round of applause.

88
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,640
{\an5}Now that we have Gotham's attention,

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,960
{\an5}it's time for The Maniax
to make a grand entrance.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
{\an5}Wasn't that it?

91
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,120
{\an5}That was the overture.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,440
{\an5}Now, the audience is hushed,
expectant.

93
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,840
The curtain rises.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
{\an5}Then what happens?

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,440
{\an5}Oh, then, we confront Gothamites
with their most primal fears.

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,560
{\an5}Take from them
all they hold dear and sacred.

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,960
And then what happens?

98
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Right then, we offer them salvation.

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,840
And then they are ours.

100
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,680
Let's get busy, man.

101
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
{\an5}Patience.

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,360
First, you gentlemen need to learn
a little stagecraft.

103
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,200
{\an5}- Stagecraft?
- You're going to be on TV.

104
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
{\an5}You have to present yourselves
with style and vigor.

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,200
{\an5}Dobkins, say "Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen."

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

107
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
Again, with a smile.

108
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,560
{\an5}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,720
Now you.

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,520
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,960
Not bad. Sinister and authoritative.

112
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Never mind.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Jerome.

114
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,400
Very good.

116
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
Boyishly charming.

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,760
The laugh is fabulous. Use that.

118
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,560
Now, me.

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,280
I am so glad that you two
are getting along.

120
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
We're a little busy here.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,800
So if you could leave
the poor mayor alone.

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
- We're bored.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Why do the boys
get to have all the fun?

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Your time is coming, I told you.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
You haven't killed him, have you?

126
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
No, I don't think so.

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,560
Nope, hanging in there.

128
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
When?

129
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
When is my time coming?

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Soon.

131
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Very soon.

132
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Would you tell me
about James Gordon?

133
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
What do you wanna know?

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
It's hard to believe.

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,640
My father has been sneaking down
here for years

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,840
and I never even knew about it.

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
That makes two of us, isn't it?

138
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,480
Wait, let's just think about this.

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you certain you wanna turn
that bloody thing on?

140
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Of course, I'm certain.

141
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,000
Have you thought it through,
Master Bruce?

142
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,800
This computer could contain
all my father's research

143
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,920
into Wayne Enterprises.

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,400
All this time, I've been looking
for a smoking gun

145
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,880
and here it is.

146
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
Exactly, a smoking gun.

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,080
Now, guns are for grown-ups,
aren't they?

148
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,440
That's a metaphor, Alfred,
not an argument.

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Here it is.

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
It's working!

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
What are you... what are you doing?

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,280
Alfred, stop, what are you doing?

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,040
What are you doing, Alfred?
Please, stop it!

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,760
It's ruined. It's ruined.
What's wrong with you?

155
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,040
Why did you do that? Answer me!

156
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Had to be done, Master Bruce.

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,760
This was the key
to exposing Wayne Enterprises.

158
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Everything that I've worked for.

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,600
Everything my... everything my dad
worked for is now gone.

160
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Because of you!

161
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,600
If I'd known what was down here,
I'll never helped get you in.

162
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,280
Well, look around you,
look, look. Liters of blood.

163
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,080
A bulletproof vest
with two slugs in it!

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,920
Guns, weapons.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,720
I mean, whatever is on that computer
probably killed your father.

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
And I'll be damned
if I see you suffer

167
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,320
with the same fate, Master Bruce.

168
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm trying to protect you.

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm trying to keep you safe.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
I want you to go.

171
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
- No, I know that you're...
- No.

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
- That you're upset...
- Alfred...

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,960
I want you to go and never come back.

174
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Do you understand me?

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
You're fired.

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
Very well, Master Bruce.

177
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
As you wish.

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,680
Oh, shiny.

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
Give that back.

180
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
I saw it first.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,560
No, you didn't. I said give it back.

182
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Make me, you little brat.

183
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,240
Your samurai skills
are excellent, Greenwood San.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,360
But they are nothing compared to me.

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
Prepare to die!

186
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,600
That's enough!

187
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
That's good.

188
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
I tried to stop them.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,600
Boys, we're a team.

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
We can't fight amongst ourselves.

191
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,440
Yeah, we're a team, boys.

192
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,760
And I'm the captain.

193
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
Captain of my foot.

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,840
I've murdered a dozen women.

195
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,280
Terrorized the city.

196
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,000
What have you done?

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Chopped up your mummy.

198
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,600
Everybody has to start somewhere.

199
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,640
See, I have vision,
and ambition, and brains.

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,800
You're just a nutty old cannibal.

201
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,040
How many people can you eat
before that shtick gets old?

202
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
I could eat one more.

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,040
I can see we're gonna have
to resolve this one

204
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,200
once and for all.

205
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,880
You all know this game, right?

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Over it.

207
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Who wants to be the boss?

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
Ladies first.

209
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,840
Hey, Greenwood,
what's the secret to good comedy?

210
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,680
Timing.

211
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,280
And what's courage?

212
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,640
Grace under pressure and...

213
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,360
Who's the boss?

214
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm the boss.

215
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
I believe you are, Jerome.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
I believe you are.

217
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,080
<i>Arigato, sensei.</i>

218
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,360
Five lunatics and Barbara?
Brother, you got no luck.

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,600
I told you civilian life
was better, didn't I?

220
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Yeah, you did. Actually,
that's kind of why I'm here.

221
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,360
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,240
Jim, you remember Scotty,
my girlfriend.

224
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,000
- Fiancée.
- Right.

225
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,240
My fiancée.

226
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Yeah, Scotty. Good to see you.

227
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
Relax, honey, we'll just talk.

228
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,200
Oh, like hell, you are.

229
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,760
He's gonna ask you
to come back to work.

230
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,560
He didn't asked me anything.
We're just having a chat.

231
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,400
Is that right?
Is that why you're here, detective?

232
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,560
Just to have a chat?

233
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,720
No, no, she's right.

234
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,040
Harvey, I need your help, okay?
She said it better.

235
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm short-handed
and I was thinking maybe you...

236
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,480
He has a life, the answer is no.
He is not coming back.

237
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,320
Hon. I'm telling him no.

238
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
And it's like what she said...

239
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,200
I have a life.

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I get it.

241
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,280
Okay. I'm happy for you.

242
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,840
Just a thought.

243
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

244
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,040
Jim, one last thing,
one last thought

245
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
from your Uncle Harvey.

246
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,640
These Maniax killed a bunch of people
from the shipyard, right?

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,120
Yellen shipyard, yeah.

248
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Why there?

249
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
They could have gone anywhere
and killed anyone.

250
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,000
But these lunatics specifically
chose that shipyard, eh?

251
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Wonder why?

252
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Good to see you. Scotty.

253
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
Yeah, I'll call you back.

254
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,640
- Commissioner!
- Tell me something good, please.

255
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
- Harvey isn't coming back.
- That's not good.

256
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,920
But he did suggest a lead
that panned out nicely.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
Turns out, the Maniax
stole a refueling truck

258
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
from the shipyard yesterday.

259
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,000
Why wasn't it reported?

260
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880
It was one of over
a hundred service vehicles.

261
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,880
It took a while to track down
the entire fleet.

262
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,160
But when we did,
we found that one was missing,

263
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,040
fully-loaded with gasoline.

264
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
You get a license plate?

265
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,120
And a description of the vehicle.

266
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,360
Put out an APB.

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,800
- God, I'm so glad you're back, Jim.
- Me too.

268
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,240
Wish I could say
the same for Bullock.

269
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,520
I can't believe he's really gone.
I mean, he's a cop.

270
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,280
He was born to be a cop.

271
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,520
Not anymore. He's a happy man.

272
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
I didn't have it in me to push him.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
You ever think about that?
Walking away, I mean.

274
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,640
No, you?

275
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,840
I did for a long time.

276
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,440
But not anymore?

277
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,200
I've sat back and watched old,
corrupt, lazy men

278
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,920
buy their way into this job
and waste it.

279
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,880
Not me, Jim. Not me.

280
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,840
- A new day.
- You're damn right.

281
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,560
I just want to say it's been
an honor and a privilege

282
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,840
to serve you and your family, sir.

283
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Thank you.

284
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,640
If you need any references,
I'll be happy to provide them.

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,680
Is that all you're taking with you?

286
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,960
That's what I have, sir.

287
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
All right, well then.

288
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,480
Oh, dear, yes, I'll best be off,
I've got a train to catch.

289
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Goodbye, sir.

290
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Goodbye, Alfred.

291
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I beg your pardon, sir?

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
I said, goodbye.

293
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Yes.

294
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Goodbye, sir.

295
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,480
I spy with my little eye,
something that is...

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,240
Yellow.

297
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,800
Score, Gotham, score! We want more!

298
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,960
Hit them where it hurts
and knock them to the floor!

299
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,640
Yay, Gotham!

300
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
Oh, hello, Ms. Kringle.

301
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

302
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,080
How is your day going?

303
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Fine.

304
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Question for you.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Yes?

306
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,920
Did you know that house flies
hum in the key of F?

307
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
No.

308
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,920
No, I did not know that.

309
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Okay then.

310
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
Well...

311
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

312
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,320
Dammit! We agreed
you were gonna ask her out!

313
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,400
We didn't agree to ask her.

314
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
We agreed to think about asking her.

315
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
But there's no point.
She doesn't like you.

316
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,400
Maybe she'll like me.
You ever consider that?

317
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,400
Maybe she'll like me.

318
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
I got confidence, ladies love that.

319
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,200
No, she won't like you.

320
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,480
She won't. Go away.

321
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,000
Please, just go away!

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Hey!

323
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,120
What's going on?

324
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
Is that a gun?

325
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
What's he doing?

326
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,440
We got a sighting
of the stolen truck.

327
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,600
Yeavely Park.

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,560
I want you all to know this was
a very difficult decision for us.

329
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,360
It was between you
and a senior citizen bingo party.

330
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
In the end, we decided
to skew a little younger.

331
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,160
Youth one today, sorry.

332
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Give me an O!

333
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,760
- I said give me an O!
- O!

334
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,800
- Give me an N!
- N!

335
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
- Give me another O!
- O!

336
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,040
What does that spell?

337
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh, no!

338
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Do it. Do it. Do it.

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
Ready? Okay.

340
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,040
This is so embarrassing.

341
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,080
Anyone got a light?

342
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
I do. I got.

343
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,840
Stand your ground, boys.
They can't shoot at the bus.

344
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,200
Hold your fire, hold your fire.

345
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,360
Aaron, Greenwood,
get the truck started.

346
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,080
We're gonna blow this barbecue.

347
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Light them up.

348
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,920
Everybody, okay?

349
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,320
Who broke you out, Dobkins?

350
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
You're gonna have to talk sooner
or later, tell me now.

351
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,640
I am a victim here, sir.
I was coerced.

352
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
- Abducted and coerced.
- By who?

353
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,920
If I tell you that, I got to get
some kind of guarantee...

354
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,040
I understand that you were
just trying to protect me.

355
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,600
But there's nothing, nothing,

356
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,880
that you can do to stop me
from carrying out my father's work.

357
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
I know that now.

358
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,720
I don't want you to go, Alfred.

359
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,880
But you're either with me
or you're against me.

360
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,840
And if you're against me,
I don't have a choice.

361
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,160
I'm with you, Master Bruce.
I've always been with you.

362
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
But what you're doing
is tantamount to suicide.

363
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,560
This is big boy's stuff.

364
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,120
You're too young
and you're not ready.

365
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,520
Then make me ready.

366
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,480
You, you've lived a dangerous life
and you survived.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
So teach me.
Teach me how to do the same.

368
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll do whatever it takes,
I'll train every day.

369
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, but you said that before,
hadn't you?

370
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
That was before.

371
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,320
Now I know the truth.

372
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,760
And I know what I have to do.

373
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
I'll even go back to school,
if you want.

374
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
School even?

375
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,720
If I agree to help you
to make you ready...

376
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,200
You must do exactly as I say
and when I say it,

377
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,560
with no exceptions,
is that understood?

378
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Understood.

379
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,040
But in return,
you must fix that computer.

380
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Fix it?

381
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,640
How on Earth am I gonna do that?

382
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,760
That's not my problem.

383
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm not the one who broke it.

384
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,440
High caliber, high velocity.

385
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,840
Charged by the size of the wounds,

386
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,840
he was definitely shot
from some distance,

387
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,040
someone knew how to shoot.

388
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,960
Who, dammit. And why cheerleaders?

389
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,080
Where's the motive?

390
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,040
They didn't even ask for a ransom.

391
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,720
They want headlines.
They want mass panic.

392
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,920
- They got it.
- Yeah.

393
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,560
Let's see if you can ID that bullet.
You never know your luck.

394
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,720
- You holding up?
- Holding up.

395
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,440
I love you.

396
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,560
Likewise.

397
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,000
Gin and tonic, please, sir, governor.
Ice and slice.

398
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Nice place.

399
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
It is.

400
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,160
- Been here before, then, have you?
- It's my regular spot.

401
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,560
Oh, well, you're a local. Nice.

402
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Don't I know you?

403
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
Do you?

404
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Yeah.

405
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,000
You're that Mr. Fox,
that scientific chap

406
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,920
from Wayne Enterprises, ain't you?

407
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
That is me.

408
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,520
Alfred Pennyworth.

409
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian.

410
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,880
Oh, yes?

411
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,000
It's funny how it came, knowing him.

412
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,920
Coincidence, I mean, me bumping
into you like this, I mean...

413
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
I was just thinking about you.

414
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,240
Okay, Mr. Pennyworth, I'll bite.

415
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
What were you thinking about me?

416
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,040
Oh, no, Alfred, please.

417
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,720
Please, Lucius.

418
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Lucius.

419
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,960
Lucius.

420
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
You know...

421
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,600
I once knew this guy,
he's called Onslow

422
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,400
in the Isle of Dogs
in East End of London.

423
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,840
Larry little scallywag he was,
you see, too smiley by half.

424
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,240
I never trusted him.

425
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,560
Okay, when one day, Lucius,
he comes bowling up to me

426
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,440
and he asked me to do him
this right iffy favor.

427
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,120
No, it doesn't matter what it was.

428
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,920
The point being against
my better judgment...

429
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
I agreed to do it.

430
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,040
But, Lucius, I told him,
I told him straight, I said,

431
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,560
"If you let me down Onslow,

432
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,760
I will tuck you up sunshine
like a kipper."

433
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,400
He swears blind,
swears on his mother grave

434
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,720
he never do such a thing,
but of course, he did,

435
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Couldn't help himself
if he'd let me down.

436
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
So I tucked him up.

437
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Like a kipper.

438
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
What is a kipper?

439
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,000
It's a type of smoked fish.

440
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,560
Very nice with eggs
and brown toast for breakfast.

441
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,360
But what I learnt
from Onslow is this.

442
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,120
There are two types of people
on this planet, you see.

443
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,160
Them you can trust...

444
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,360
And them you can't.

445
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
I cannot disagree.

446
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Which kind are you?

447
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,640
Both kinds of people would give you
the same answer, wouldn't they?

448
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
Exactly.

449
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,680
Exactly right.

450
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,360
There lies the problem, Lucius.

451
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,560
You see, I need to confide in you.

452
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,160
But I need to know
that you are trustworthy.

453
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,280
Perhaps I should decline
your confidence.

454
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't like the sound
of these kippers.

455
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Yeah, well, it's just a little
bit late for that unfortunately.

456
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,400
I mean, it's you after all, Lucius,

457
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,920
that created this mess
when you told Young Master Bruce

458
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,840
that his dear old dead dad
was a stoic.

459
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Oh, exactly.

460
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
You see, that's the problem.

461
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,160
I got no one else to turn to.

462
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,160
I have to confide in you.

463
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,600
- I see.
- Do you?

464
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,640
I mean, just to be crystal clear
about on this.

465
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,280
If it turns out...

466
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,320
that I can't trust you...

467
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,240
I swear on my mother's grave,
you, my old sausage...

468
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
are a dead man.

469
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,000
I have only the best intentions
for Bruce Wayne.

470
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,320
Well, another gin and tonic,
please, sir, governor,

471
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,640
and whatever this young man
is drinking, one for himself.

472
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,000
How are you at fixing computers?

473
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Hey, Alvarez. You.

474
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,000
Let ballistics know we got
a red ball for him, will you?

475
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
On it.

476
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,280
Gordon.

477
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,680
<i>Hello, Jim. It's Barbara.</i>

478
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Hi, Barbara. How are you?

479
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,240
<i>Oh, me? I am fabulous. How are you?</i>

480
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm good. What's new?

481
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,480
<i>Mr. cool guy, huh?</i>

482
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,360
<i>You must be mad at me.</i>

483
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,080
Listen to me, if you turn
yourself in, I can help you.

484
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,840
<i>How, Jim?
By taking me back to Arkham?</i>

485
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
<i>I don't think so.</i>

486
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,320
You're sick.

487
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,440
<i>Of course.
Everything is always my fault.</i>

488
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
<i>So typical.</i>

489
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Listen to me.

490
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,280
I know you Barbara, I know you.
You're a good, kind woman.

491
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
This isn't you.

492
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,120
<i>You could always make me laugh.</i>

493
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,360
How do I look?

494
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
I need to talk to
Commissioner Essen right away.

495
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,800
- It's an emergency.
- Yeah, go ahead.

496
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
She's right upstairs.

497
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,960
Yo, Commish.

498
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah.

499
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,760
I heard you were looking for us.

500
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
What...

501
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,320
Barbara...

502
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Don't move.

503
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,160
You're wrong about me, Jim.

504
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,840
I tried telling you,
but you never listen.

505
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,200
I'm listening now.

506
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,640
Yeah, sure you are. Now.

507
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Come on.

508
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,960
Let's go talk this through, huh?

509
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,640
Oh, it's too late for that.

510
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
Aaron...

511
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
That's enough.

512
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
I'm not sick, I'm free.
You don't get that.

513
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
I could explain it,

514
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,680
but you should probably
get back to work.

515
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,800
Who knows what went wrong
while you're gone.

516
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,360
Hell of a first week
you're having, Commissioner.

517
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,520
I wish I could tell you that things
were gonna get better for you.

518
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,880
But they're not.

519
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,640
Here, bring that up here,

520
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
you'll get a better good angle
of the room.

521
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
Why are you doing this?

522
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,840
To rule the world, blah, blah, blah.

523
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,240
But we'll settle for some dead cops
and some good PR.

524
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,080
- Kidding!
- Yeah, whatever, I get it.

525
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
You're just crazy.

526
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,880
Crazy?

527
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,720
Look at me.

528
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,520
You can see I'm not crazy.

529
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Very soon, little man,
you will be dead.

530
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,240
And the world will go on without you,
you'll be nothing.

531
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,800
No one will even remember your name.

532
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,080
No, that is where you're wrong,
old lady.

533
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,920
We will leave a mark on the city.

534
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,680
We will spread across like a virus.

535
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,560
And do you know why?

536
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,640
There's nothing more contagious
than laughter!

537
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
My line.

538
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,000
There's nothing more contagious
than laughter.

539
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,840
That was strangely pleasant.
Do it again.

540
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,400
That's gonna leave a mark.

541
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,120
You got me.

542
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
My turn.

543
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Lee!

544
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Jim!

545
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,920
- Are you hurt?
- No. I...

546
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I was in my office
and I heard gunfire and I hid.

547
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,120
Where were you?

548
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,720
Barbara was here. She lured me away.

549
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
Essen!

550
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
Hang on, Cap. Hang on.

551
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,160
Boss, boss, stay with me.

552
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,360
Breathe.

553
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,240
It's a new day, Jim.

554
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,160
This is indeed broken.

555
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,720
I have a lot of questions for you.

556
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
Oh, I imagine so.

557
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,920
- Did my father tell you everything?
- Heavens no.

558
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,080
Your father,
he was a very private man.

559
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,400
He had to be.

560
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,720
I simply helped with technical
resources, like this computer.

561
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,200
Do you know what's on it?

562
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,320
No, I didn't want to know,
to be honest.

563
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,520
- But you could fix it?
- I should think so.

564
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,640
But it is going to take some time.

565
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,240
Well, thank you for your help.

566
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
I loved your father.

567
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,880
I regret that I never told him so.

568
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,080
I regret that I didn't help him more.

569
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Hand me the soldering iron, will you?

570
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Yeah.

571
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Master Bruce.

572
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
What is it, Alfred?

573
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,800
How are you doing, Mr. Nygma.

574
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,280
Here's your aspirin.

575
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Thank you.

576
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Detective Gordon!

577
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Bruce.

578
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,440
I heard the news.

579
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,680
I was worried
something happened to you.

580
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,040
I'm very relieved.

581
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Me too.

582
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,720
The last time that we met,
I was very hard on you.

583
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,720
I wanted to apologize.

584
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,880
You've been a really good friend.

585
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,520
She was a good woman.

586
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Good cop.

587
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
It's good to see you
but you don't have to do this.

588
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,480
Let's not talk about it.

589
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,160
We are who we are, right?

590
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,760
No use fighting it.

591
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,720
What does Scotty say?

592
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,760
She'll understand or she won't.

593
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,600
Guys, you need to see this.

594
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,640
<i>I'm reporting live from the
scene of the GCPD massacre.</i>

595
