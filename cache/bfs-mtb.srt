Core Contents Media Presents

2
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,790
In association with Showbox

3
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,090
A Core Contents Media Production

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,090
Co-produced by
Goldenthumb & Poibos

5
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,630
Hey, Jung-sik?

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,880
How is it?

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,410
What do you think.

8
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,750
I need it for the drama next week

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,180
so tell him it's great!

10
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,020
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,320
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,620
But the lyrics are weak, man.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,230
What the suits say
goes. That's show biz.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,220
Whatever, man!

15
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,100
- Hold up!
- What is it?

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,230
You like this song?

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,470
Of course! Why?

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,070
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,770
My heart this and tears that...

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,770
Isn't it childish?

21
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,040
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,740
It's great.

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,980
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,980
But I don't feel anything!

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,680
You can do it, man. Feel me?

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,690
- It's great!
- No.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,680
It's not working for me.

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,090
Seung-chul! Come on!

29
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,420
Get him!

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,820
Seung-chul!

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes, director.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,300
I see.

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,570
KWON Sang-woo

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,630
KWON Sang-woo Next Tuesday?

35
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,470
The song's a killer.

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,110
LEE Bo-young

37
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,110
LEE Bo-young Nothing but
the best from LEE Seung-chul.

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,340
Nothing but the best
from LEE Seung-chul.

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,280
Of course.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,210
LEE Beom-soo

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,310
LEE Beom-soo
No problems whatsoever.

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,550
Yes, sir. Take care.

43
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,250
JUNG Ae-yeon, LEE
Han-wui Yes, sir. Take care.

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,690
JUNG Ae-yeon,
LEE Han-wui

45
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,960
See? He's asking for
the song. Do it for me?

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,480
Executive Producer KIM Gwang-soo
See? He's asking for the song. Do it for me?

47
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,160
You always do this to me.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,870
Please?

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,530
So get me a good song
and I'll sing it! Damn!

50
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:27,830
Producer HONG Jung-pyo So get
me a good song and I'll sing it! Damn!

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,740
Producer HONG Jung-pyo So get
me a good song and I'll sing it! Damn!

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,810
What about 'Hee-ya'?

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,440
'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,080
Give me a break.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,710
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

56
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,250
Wanna hear this song I got?

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,350
What is it?

58
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,750
It's off a flopped album.

59
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,950
Forget it, kid!

60
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,260
Let's hear it.

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,520
Really? Turn it on.

62
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,430
To give you everything
and all my love...

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,340
Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

64
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,030
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,640
Who wrote this?

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,110
Not sure. I got this off someone.

67
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,910
Who?

68
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,450
Min-chul. He used to
work for KIM Gap-sik.

69
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,680
Gap-sik? I know him well.

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,720
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

71
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,990
Who does your friend work for now?

72
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,260
He left the biz, too.

73
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,290
What does he do?

74
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,490
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,390
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

76
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,860
- Know where it is?
- Yes.

77
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,670
Lead the way.

78
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,230
Director WON

79
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,100
Got the album?

80
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,440
Ah, here.

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,510
What's the title?

82
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,410
It's the second track.

83
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,980
Second track?

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,530
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

85
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,930
What's her real name?

86
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,860
I think it was EUN
Won. Yeah, that' s it.

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,860
Got her number?

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
She's gone.

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,810
Gone? To where?

90
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,470
Right after KANG Chul-kyu left...

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,640
KANG knows her well?

92
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,610
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,110
Do you have KANG's number?

94
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,750
- He died.
- He's dead?

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,120
When?

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,620
About a month after
he married off EUN Won.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,760
Mr. KANG!

98
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,330
What was the name of his show?

99
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,400
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,740
Yeah, that's it!

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,940
He married off the woman he loved?

102
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,810
- What does that mean?
- Well...

103
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,050
Tell us what happened.

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,410
It's a long story.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,130
Hi, Chul-kyu!

106
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,220
KANG said he saw stars

107
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,590
when he first met Cream.

108
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,580
Why you little punk!

109
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,030
Like he'd been slapped
on the back of his head.

110
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,260
He said it was love
at first sight.

111
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,100
Without even talking to her.

112
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,800
I asked,

113
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,770
'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first? '

114
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,470
Then he said...

115
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,370
If you need words,
then how can mutes love?

116
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,700
How did you know my name?

117
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,930
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

118
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,740
Want me to live with you?

119
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,400
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,490
We can't change our names.

121
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,390
Why not?

122
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,870
Her name is Cream
and my name is K.

123
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,770
She was cold like ice cream,

124
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,580
- but also sweet like ice
cream. - The curtains won't do.

125
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,780
We're changing everything.

126
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,370
And she was
soft like ice cream.

127
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,680
And I'm not A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...

128
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,750
But just K.

129
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,700
We had a lot in common.

130
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,130
We were the same age.
We both liked noodles.

131
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,810
We loved listening to
music on rainy days.

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,710
We loved coffee.

133
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,490
We hated school.

134
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,790
She liked me.

135
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,800
And I liked her.

136
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,870
And we were both orphans.

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,310
Prison and love...

138
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,180
Once you're stuck,
you can't get out.

139
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,340
I fell in love with Cream.

140
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Even the very air she breathed.

141
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,570
Romeo must've been so worried...

142
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Ioving Juliet, but
afraid he might lose her.

143
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,780
Why did he drink the poison?

144
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,350
Perhaps he knew.

145
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,160
To love someone

146
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,390
- is to give her
everything. - I'll visit often.

147
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,900
I received so much from her
like the catcher who gets the ball.

148
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,270
Love was like dry ice.
Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.

149
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,330
Wait!

150
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,270
Cream was so loveable.

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,040
But I couldn't tell her
that I loved her.

152
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:06,690
Cuz I had cancer cells in me
ready to strike at any time.

153
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,200
More than Blue

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,170
Thank you, Mr. KIM.

155
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,640
It's the least I can do.

156
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,010
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

157
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,550
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

158
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,650
Is this your new singer?

159
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,080
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

160
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,400
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

161
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,590
Damn right you should.

162
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,940
Great outfit.

163
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,030
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

164
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,340
It's Cat Girl.

165
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,810
This gal's got brains.

166
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,920
She's a student at Seoul University.

167
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,580
Really?

168
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,920
It's Seoul University of Arts.

169
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,950
Who's side are you on?

170
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,730
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

171
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,230
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

172
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,290
Sorry.

173
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,970
Mr. Kang!

174
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,970
How are you?

175
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,170
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

176
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,780
- It's a sure hit.
- I'm sure it's great.

177
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,850
- Say hi.
- Hello.

178
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,110
Call me K.

179
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,480
Let's go for drinks some time.

180
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,210
- Sounds great.
- Bye.

181
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,090
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

182
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,390
That's right.

183
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,820
Did you eat, sir?

184
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,830
Mr. Kang!

185
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,130
- How've you been?
- I waited so long for you.

186
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,800
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

187
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,890
It's Cat Girl, sir.

188
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,800
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

189
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,710
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

190
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,880
Thank you.

191
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,540
Of course you should.

192
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,780
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

193
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,120
See you folks later.

194
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,920
- Come on, what are pals for.
- I can't.

195
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,860
It's just a show of my appreciation.

196
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,660
The album's finished?

197
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,370
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

198
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,600
You know me, I get what I want.

199
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,270
How is she?

200
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,780
Oh, her? Not bad.

201
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,780
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

202
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,120
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

203
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,710
Of course. Anything for you.

204
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,960
- But do this for me.
- I can't.

205
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,450
It's not much. Please, take it!

206
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,700
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

207
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,070
My dear love.

208
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,580
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

209
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,570
You'll scare 'em off.

210
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,210
How, sir?

211
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,920
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

212
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,600
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

213
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,290
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

214
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,030
- That's not what I meant!
- Roll it!

215
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,420
What's she so good at?

216
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,410
Drop it will ya, man?

217
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,850
Come on. Just between us?

218
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,300
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

219
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,970
Did you fix the second verse?

220
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,570
What?

221
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,310
The climax on the second verse.

222
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,740
'AIways like yesterday'?

223
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,010
It's a little corny, isn't it?

224
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,910
'A world without love? ' How's that?

225
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,920
Like that's not corny?

226
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,760
It's just a suggestion.

227
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,860
Let's not get too excited here.

228
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,510
You two write it, then. I'm out.

229
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,580
What?

230
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,820
So feisty.

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,580
Do you have to become a singer?

232
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,070
What?

233
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,490
Got enough medication left?

234
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,170
My damn connection to your family.

235
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,510
First your father, now you.

236
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,410
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

237
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,670
What's wrong?

238
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,040
What is it?

239
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,250
Don't cry.

240
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,780
Stop crying.

241
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,220
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

242
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,920
'lf I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

243
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,070
'lf I could live again? '

244
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,070
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

245
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,210
Besides a person?

246
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,940
Anything.

247
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,120
Well...

248
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,020
If I could live again...

249
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,260
A ring?

250
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,660
Wait.

251
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,000
Start over.

252
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,740
If I could be born again...

253
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,310
A ring.

254
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,410
A pair of glasses.

255
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,550
A bed.

256
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,090
A diary.

257
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,730
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

258
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,290
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

259
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,070
So sensible.

260
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,490
Did you eat?

261
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,400
Of course, I did.

262
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,240
Well, I didn't.

263
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,180
Then let's eat.

264
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,590
Is there anything you want to tell me?

265
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,320
Like what?

266
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,190
A deep, dark secret?

267
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,460
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

268
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,260
I'll be the priest and listen.

269
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,200
A deep, dark secret?

270
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,810
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

271
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,440
I like you.

272
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,580
I want to ask you something.

273
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,510
Do you have a wish?

274
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,310
A wish?

275
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,220
If you could have anything in the world?

276
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,090
First, hold up your spoon.

277
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,090
Then?

278
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,800
Eat all your food.

279
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,270
Then?

280
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,780
Meet a great guy and get married.

281
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,250
Can't I marry you?

282
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,410
I'm not a great guy.

283
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,600
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

284
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,970
to fall in love with you.

285
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:22,400
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

286
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,800
ID: Little Mermaid.

287
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,640
Now, for the requested song.

288
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,750
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

289
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,330
That means your mom will outlive you.

290
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,060
Who says that?

291
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,300
I think I read it somewhere.

292
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,300
It's a lie.

293
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,170
Why?

294
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,880
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

295
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,610
If you...

296
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,450
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

297
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,320
Here's another requested song.

298
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,730
Are you finished?

299
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,700
Excuse me?

300
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,530
The coffee.

301
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,550
Then can I have the cup?

302
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,210
Which side did you drink from?

303
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,310
Pardon?

304
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,260
This isn't kissing, is it?

305
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,340
- Hey.
- Yeah?

306
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,470
- You know the guest doctor?
- Yeah?

307
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,920
What kind of doctor is he?

308
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,680
Huh?

309
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,360
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

310
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,570
We kiss on the first day.

311
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,210
You see inside me, on the second day.

312
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,180
What should we do on the third day?

313
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,460
What?

314
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,490
We'll decide when the time comes.

315
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,570
I'm in love!

316
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,970
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

317
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,920
Pass me the toothbrush?

318
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,390
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

319
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,830
- As you're out driving...
- Did you eat?

320
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,270
Oh, hi.

321
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,900
- Got a show to record, today?
- No.

322
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,140
The guest doctor on your show...

323
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,110
Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan?

324
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,180
How is he?

325
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,270
He's a great guy. Why?

326
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,620
Just wondering.

327
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,820
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

328
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,860
And he's a famous dentist.

329
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,330
You look a little sad today.

330
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,140
Good job, bro.

331
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,900
It was fun.

332
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,640
- Great show.
- Cut it short.

333
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
Hey, nice seeing you.

334
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,180
Let's go out for drinks.

335
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,580
Not if it's just a few drinks.

336
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,540
- How much then?
- All night?

337
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,120
All night! Alright!

338
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,060
What's his social
security number?

339
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,300
- 730313105... 
- 730313...

340
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,100
Sure you can get his medical records?

341
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,660
Insurance companies
get everything.

342
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,140
But why do you want
to check out a guy?

343
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,840
I'll tell you later.

344
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,340
Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.

345
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,880
No record of family illness
or any operations.

346
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,750
He has an impeccable
health record.

347
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,090
You sure?

348
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,490
Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.

349
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,260
KANG!

350
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,760
If he has a hospital
record, we'll see it.

351
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,790
KANG!

352
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,660
Thanks. I owe you one.

353
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,900
Got a minute Mr. KIM?

354
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,770
For you, any time!

355
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,030
It's a gift.

356
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,250
Ah, thank you.

357
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,280
Just a thank you?

358
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,550
First my lips, then my insides...

359
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,720
Now, you're in my head.

360
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,160
Buy me a drink?

361
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,540
A drink?

362
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,470
I don't get it.

363
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:19,950
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

364
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,490
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

365
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,790
Man, I gotta change that name!

366
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,760
It's Cat Girl, sir.

367
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,930
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

368
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,940
Call me whatever you want, hon.

369
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,700
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

370
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,840
That's my pretty.

371
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,010
My sweet Cats.

372
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,990
We're changing the name.

373
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,090
- Ah, sir?
- I said, I know!

374
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,290
Not that. The phone.

375
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,730
Sorry, Producer KANG! I checked and...

376
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,630
You kids scram for a sec.

377
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,230
I gotta take this call. Go!

378
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,810
CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

379
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,420
He even has a hot fiancé.

380
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,790
He's got it made.

381
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,190
Fiancé?

382
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,090
Is something up?

383
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,660
Oh, you dropped your candy.

384
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,900
Let's put it in your pocket.

385
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,010
Have you ever been in love?

386
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,250
Like a rock thrown into the river.

387
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,290
Give me the ring.

388
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,720
Excuse me?

389
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,490
Your ring.

390
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,650
Like this.

391
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,730
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

392
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,370
I'm engaged.

393
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,110
It doesn't matter.

394
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,680
Let's keep drinking.

395
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,790
It's so cold.

396
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,440
Did you drink?

397
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,300
What do you like so much about him?

398
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,490
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

399
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,320
Sterilized?

400
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,380
Sterilized.

401
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,160
Perfect.

402
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,010
- Let's eat.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

403
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,880
- You're not eating?
- I can't.

404
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,110
What about all this food?

405
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,090
You eat it all.

406
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,480
I'll see you later.

407
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:30,690
ABCDEFGHIJK...

408
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,290
Hello?

409
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,570
Is this EUN Won's number?

410
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,270
Yes, it is.

411
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,230
May I speak to her, please?

412
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,240
She's not here.

413
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,880
My name's CHA Joo-hwan.

414
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,350
We were supposed
to meet today

415
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,560
but something came
up at the clinic.

416
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,290
Is there any way
I can reach her?

417
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,730
Where were you going to meet?

418
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,700
So cold.

419
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,530
Hey.

420
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,040
He can't come.

421
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,670
Who?

422
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,230
Him.

423
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,450
The doc.

424
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,560
Where are you going?

425
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,220
I gotta go.

426
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,020
Sit down. The curry here is great.

427
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,900
You know I don't eat curry.

428
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,030
Then what do you want?

429
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,170
What else is there?

430
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,160
What do you want to eat?

431
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,830
Kimbap.

432
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,570
So boring.

433
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,570
Just eat curry.

434
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,370
You're buying.

435
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,650
Come on Producer KANG. Spill it.

436
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,090
Did he rip you off or something?

437
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,730
Then, why didn't you say so!

438
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:26,460
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

439
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,230
It's not that.

440
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,270
Then what is it?

441
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,070
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

442
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,180
Are you interested in his fiancé?

443
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,980
Just find out, please.

444
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,750
Fine, then.

445
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:55,230
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

446
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,600
Let's cook up something with your show

447
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,970
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

448
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,040
I'm sure it'll do well.

449
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,800
Of course.

450
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,510
Hey, Min-chul!

451
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,710
Did you like the house?

452
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,310
Mother said she liked it.

453
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,350
It's not bad.

454
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,920
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

455
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,790
I'm tired of putting on shows.

456
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,960
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

457
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

458
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,830
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

459
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,340
That's sad.

460
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,210
- Let's have fun together from now on.
- Sure.

461
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,850
Can I get an ashtray here?

462
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,120
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

463
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,350
The world's such a bore.

464
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,330
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

465
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,460
Yes, sir.

466
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,790
Interesting.

467
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,540
Keep smoking.

468
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,070
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

469
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,040
She's got men coming out of her ears.

470
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,720
I told 'em to take some good pics.

471
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,920
It won't be long.

472
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,560
How did you pose
for your album cover?

473
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,830
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

474
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,930
Exactly how?

475
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,030
- Here?
- Pardon?

476
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,590
Men are all the same.

477
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,590
Okay, then.

478
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,000
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

479
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,650
Like this.

480
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,210
- Ah, Cat Girl?
- Then...

481
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,320
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

482
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,290
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

483
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,050
You can just tell us.

484
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,960
But my boss said a star

485
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,490
- has to speak with
the body. - See that?

486
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:09,930
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

487
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,530
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

488
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,980
- Ah, sir?
- KANG!

489
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,940
- What's wrong?
- KANG!

490
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,550
Where is he?

491
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,550
- Hey!
- I'm dead beat.

492
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,390
What's wrong with you!

493
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,350
What's with you!

494
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,200
Don't start.

495
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,040
Why does he keep fainting like this?

496
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,350
It's hereditary, but it could also be

497
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,950
not enough calcium in his diet.

498
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:05,660
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

499
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,120
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

500
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,530
You eat way more than I do.

501
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,000
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

502
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,540
You!

503
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,560
Yes?

504
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,650
What did he just say?

505
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,830
To break off your engagement...

506
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,200
- Stop! Please!
- Who are you!

507
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,570
What the hell are you trying to pull!

508
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,770
You don't wanna mess with me!

509
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,850
Get the hell out of my sight!

510
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,620
I said, get lost.

511
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,770
Why are you doing this?

512
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,710
Huh?

513
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,850
You're a successful radio show producer.

514
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,420
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

515
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,530
Aren't you embarrassed?

516
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

517
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,960
What are you talking about?

518
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,100
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

519
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,540
Ow, my head.

520
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,850
Does it hurt?

521
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,880
I'm hurt, too.

522
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,220
What's with me today?

523
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,150
It's cuz we're sad.

524
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,390
Then cry instead of making jokes.

525
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,270
I don't want to cry.

526
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,340
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

527
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,150
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

528
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,480
Chul-kyu!

529
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,660
Mom left me a year
after Dad died.

530
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,070
It probably wasn't
cuz she resented me.

531
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,500
She was sick of
everything cuz of Dad.

532
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,210
I understand. I was
sick of everything, too.

533
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,090
But when she left me all alone...

534
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,520
I was so Ionely.

535
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,960
People...

536
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,070
should never be alone.

537
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm sorry.

538
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,130
I want you to leave your fiancé.

539
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,570
The girl that I love
is in love with him.

540
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,130
- Medical records- The girl
that I love is in love with him.

541
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,570
I beg you.

542
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,490
Under one condition.

543
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,990
But...

544
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,550
But?

545
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,100
No, please! Tell me.

546
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,710
I want to take your pictures.

547
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:10,350
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

548
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,400
Now, that's an interesting model.

549
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,470
I think it'll be fun.

550
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,270
I don't think it'll be fun.

551
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,680
Then the deal's off.

552
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,810
Drink up, first!

553
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,780
Give me a drink, too!

554
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,760
- Hi! Hi!
- Hi! You're late!

555
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,100
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

556
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,240
Oh, hi.

557
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,510
I'm KANG Chul-kyu.

558
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,940
CHA Joo-hwan.

559
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,480
- Thanks again for that day.
- Anytime.

560
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,450
You know him?

561
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,220
The sterilizer?

562
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,060
- Did you eat?
- No, I'll eat now.

563
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,820
Why are you so late?

564
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,360
- Still recording a show.
- What?

565
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,930
You said you're done.

566
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,460
Not yet. I gotta go back.

567
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,830
- Here.
- Thank you.

568
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,070
The song's great.

569
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,550
'lf I can live again'?

570
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:38,710
Of course, I wrote it.

571
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,550
Sorry, I gotta run.

572
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,610
- Come on.
- Don't go.

573
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,120
I'll see you later.

574
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,720
Bye.

575
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,060
- See you next time, then.
- Sure.

576
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,930
Be careful in the snow!

577
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,280
Why are you back so early?

578
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,580
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

579
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
Change of plans.

580
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,720
Me, too.

581
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,190
Drink this.

582
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,530
Didn't you eat?

583
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,940
I did, but I'm still starving.

584
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,150
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

585
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,380
Just wanted something simple.

586
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,930
It's good, huh?

587
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,330
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

588
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,400
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

589
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,880
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

590
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,710
Don't you want to live?

591
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,850
Not talking to me?

592
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,420
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

593
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,430
Okay, I can understand that much.

594
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,630
But still...

595
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,000
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

596
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,310
Isn't that going overboard?

597
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,290
You're not dead, yet.

598
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,480
- How can you watch that?
- Ah, Jenna?

599
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,390
Let's just stick to ourjobs.

600
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,130
What's love?

601
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,440
Like brushing your teeth.

602
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,610
Brushing your teeth?

603
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,050
But you do that alone.

604
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,350
Do you brush to show someone?

605
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,550
Why didn't you come yesterday?

606
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,350
Pardon?

607
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,830
I said, did you wait for me?

608
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:33,170
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

609
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,380
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

610
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,850
What?

611
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,760
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

612
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,270
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

613
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,860
Do you wonder about every patient?

614
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,060
Well...

615
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:58,210
You're blushing. It's love all right.

616
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,680
Hey, KANG Chul-kyu!

617
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,340
Yes, boss.

618
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:06,480
How much did you get from KIM Gap-sik?

619
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,550
Should've been more discreet!

620
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,110
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

621
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,190
Think people will stay still?

622
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:22,400
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

623
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,160
What's got into you all of a sudden?

624
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:30,260
You of all people!

625
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,710
When are you going to break it off?

626
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,270
In a rush?

627
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,310
You saw my medical records.

628
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,320
I want to keep playing.

629
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,350
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

630
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,530
Under one condition.

631
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,080
Now, what.

632
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,180
I'll tell you after I break it off.

633
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,880
A promise is a promise.

634
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,600
Since when was it no smoking in here.

635
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,570
No idea.

636
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,650
Our parents will be shocked.

637
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:08,640
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

638
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,970
Yell at you or something?

639
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:24,050
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

640
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,380
I'm going out for a smoke.

641
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,130
So uncomfortable.

642
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,930
My engagement's off.

643
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,950
I don't have parents.

644
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,410
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

645
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,020
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

646
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:10,000
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

647
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,060
Like in the movies, you know?

648
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,210
Anyway, he told me

649
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,810
to go to the hospital right away.

650
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:27,120
When I asked why...

651
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,420
if he said my parents and

652
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,860
sister died in a car accident...

653
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:39,660
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

654
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,900
I see...

655
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,130
K's been with me ever since.

656
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,570
K?

657
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,910
You saw him, Producer KANG Chul-kyu?

658
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,580
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him K.

659
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,590
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

660
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,020
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

661
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,760
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

662
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,530
Can I kiss you?

663
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,730
You wanna kiss me?

664
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,720
Stupid.

665
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,420
Let me see.

666
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:42,950
Oh, no.

667
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,090
That's right, I'm stupid!

668
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,000
Open the door. Are you okay?

669
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,180
Don't look! Stupid!

670
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,460
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

671
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,930
I was born to love you.

672
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,990
Heaven sent me to love you.

673
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,340
Cat Girl's 'lf
I could live again'

674
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,500
requested by
ID: Little Mermaid.

675
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,680
- You wrote this song, Cream?
- Yes.

676
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,240
Let's hear, 'lf I could live again'.

677
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,120
(Did you eat?)

678
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,220
(I'm almost done!)

679
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,310
Yes, boss.

680
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:47,080
Come to my office, now.

681
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,380
Okay.

682
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,760
Producer KANG!

683
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,590
KANG!

684
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:08,440
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

685
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,430
How can he fire a genius like you!

686
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,510
I'm not getting fired.

687
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,320
Same difference.

688
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,010
- You can't go like this!
- I'm taking a break.

689
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:26,720
Really? That's not what I heard.

690
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,350
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

691
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:37,630
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

692
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,310
Thank you for everything, Mr. KIM.

693
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,740
- Anytime. - You
too, Min-chul.

694
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,240
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

695
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,380
Producer CHOI! Hold on! Wait!

696
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,020
Min-chul...

697
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,350
It's a ballad.

698
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,290
Write up a good song.

699
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,690
What's marriage?

700
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,490
Marriage?

701
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,300
Marriage.

702
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,300
- Marriage...
- Wait!

703
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,820
A toothbrush holder.

704
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,660
What?

705
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:18,870
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

706
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,240
What's that got to do with marriage?

707
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:30,470
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

708
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,520
Then I must be married, already.

709
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,350
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

710
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,530
Really?

711
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,320
I gotta pee.

712
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,430
No one else but Thee.

713
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,060
'Thee' is a lucky person.

714
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,710
Wanna hear it?

715
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:14,410
EUN Won and I living
together probably got to you.

716
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,020
But there's nothing to worry about.

717
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,680
I'm okay with that.

718
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,120
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

719
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,990
Let's get together often.

720
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,630
Go on trips together and stuff.

721
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,770
Sounds good.

722
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:40,410
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

723
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,410
Gotta love her wild ideas.

724
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,540
Why me?

725
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,550
I want what she wants.

726
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,020
Please do it for her.

727
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:04,900
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

728
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,730
Sure. Please take good care of her.

729
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,970
Of course. She's my woman, now.

730
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,640
Let's drink.

731
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,890
What do you think?

732
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,530
Very pretty.

733
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:49,310
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

734
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,620
I'm not the groom.

735
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,210
Try it on.

736
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,160
Come up here.

737
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,420
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

738
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:15,100
On three. One, two, three!

739
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,680
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

740
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,960
Why are all the clocks stopped?

741
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,670
No reason.

742
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:12,550
Can I turn one on?

743
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,090
Why?

744
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,150
No reason.

745
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,650
No reason?

746
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,220
Sure.

747
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,890
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

748
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,430
What is it?

749
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:07,230
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

750
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:14,310
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

751
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:20,710
I had one more condition. Remember?

752
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,520
What is it?

753
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,540
Please die at my side.

754
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:01,250
You booked the tickets?

755
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:07,090
I'm running low on battery.

756
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:09,930
Hey.

757
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,670
What are you making?

758
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,430
My phone battery ran out.

759
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:28,380
I'll charge it and call you back later.

760
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,950
Bye.

761
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,250
Hi.

762
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,390
Why'd you leave me there like that?

763
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,000
It's for you.

764
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,410
Who do you think you are!

765
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,740
What's with you?

766
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,750
Who says you can touch my phone!

767
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,850
The hell you...

768
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,720
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

769
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,760
Can I help you?

770
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,490
Is K home?

771
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,690
K?

772
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,090
Someone's here.

773
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:38,400
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

774
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:44,810
You think she's happy?

775
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:47,790
What are you saying?

776
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,620
She didn't seem happy.

777
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,060
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

778
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,330
It's pretty.

779
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,570
Maybe too pretty.

780
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,970
It looks fake. Like your love.

781
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:11,980
Then what's real?

782
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,490
Real?

783
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,950
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

784
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:29,320
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

785
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:33,400
You really wanna die like this?

786
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,630
No!

787
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,710
I don't want to die like this.

788
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,310
I want to live a happy life.

789
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,220
I want to be the one marrying EUN Won...

790
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,380
...instead of him, tomorrow.

791
01:12:57,730 --> 01:12:59,190
But...

792
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,120
That's just a dream.

793
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,490
A sad dream.

794
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,070
I'm done with dreaming.

795
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,960
Sleep tight and sweet dreams.

796
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,350
Did you eat? 
- Cream

797
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,760
Thanks.

798
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,040
I'm not talking to you.

799
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:09,010
I'm sorry.

800
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:17,500
For what?

801
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:21,930
For everything.

802
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,480
I'm sorry, too.

803
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,510
For what?

804
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,910
For everything.

805
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,280
I love you...

806
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,830
I like you.

807
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,500
Me, too.

808
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,910
That's some story.

809
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:18,510
KANG... amazing guy. I had no idea.

810
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:26,580
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

811
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,260
Wonder what happened to her.

812
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,840
Let's record it.

813
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,370
Really? I'll call right now.

814
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:54,740
No, the other song.

815
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,610
Oh, that song.

816
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,840
I gotta go, I'm late.

817
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,210
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

818
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,170
What's this?

819
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:33,770
Ah, Vitamin ABC. It
helps me get smarter.

820
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,980
Where'd you get these pills?

821
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:26,660
They're my friends' pills.

822
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,820
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

823
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,260
Why?

824
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:39,240
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

825
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:41,800
What?

826
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:47,870
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

827
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,240
Terminal patients.

828
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,290
Have you heard of
the hospice ward?

829
01:22:56,230 --> 01:23:00,030
It's where dying patients stay...

830
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:04,520
with consent from their families.

831
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,780
Mom!

832
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,520
Watch the house while we're out.

833
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,920
See you later, sis!

834
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,530
No!

835
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:01,310
When I found out what
Vitamin ABC really was...

836
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,430
When I finally realized
what they were...

837
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:10,220
When my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...

838
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,130
What's wrong?

839
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:15,060
I died before K.

840
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:25,710
I met K a year after my
whole family passed away.

841
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:31,440
Though almost 3 hours passed...

842
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:35,880
he stood there frozen like stone.

843
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:39,730
Crying and looking in the
direction his mother went.

844
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:44,530
This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.

845
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,700
He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.

846
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,940
He needed a hug
more than me.

847
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,210
Is there anything you want to tell me?

848
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,510
Like what?

849
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:08,380
A deep, dark secret?

850
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,620
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

851
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:17,660
I like you.

852
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:20,600
Stupid idiot.

853
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,000
Do you have a wish?

854
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,670
What's with you?

855
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:27,800
Just curious all of a sudden.

856
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:33,310
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

857
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,910
K is dying.

858
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,720
Meet a great guy and get married.

859
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:40,760
Can't I marry you?

860
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,950
I'm not a great guy.

861
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,430
Then who is?

862
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:49,330
Someone who is healthy and nice.

863
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,390
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

864
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,800
I already met a great guy.

865
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,300
But K told me to
meet someone else.

866
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,270
He said that was his wish.

867
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:10,790
KANG Chul-kyu

868
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,550
When I heard K fainted...

869
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,830
I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.

870
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,300
But I...

871
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,840
... couldn't even go crazy.

872
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
No, doc.

873
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,500
But she should know.

874
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,970
What are you going to do?

875
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,740
I don't know.

876
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:46,050
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

877
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,120
Right here.

878
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,020
It gets stuck right here.

879
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,130
I can't say it.

880
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,640
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

881
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,840
She's different.

882
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:14,270
She needs someone beside her.

883
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,090
- Hello.
- There goes Mr. Perfect.

884
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,800
Glowing from head to toe!

885
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,910
I picked a man.

886
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:54,850
Which side did you drink from?

887
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,190
Pardon?

888
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,590
I'm engaged.

889
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:09,500
Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?

890
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:14,400
Just play along and
meet me. For K.

891
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,500
Am I a bitch?

892
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,720
I don't have time
to worry about that!

893
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,080
The man I love is dying!

894
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,760
If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?

895
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:45,570
A bed? A diary?

896
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,740
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

897
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:54,640
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

898
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:14,470
What's wrong? Are you okay?

899
01:29:16,570 --> 01:29:17,830
Let me see your hand.

900
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,700
Where are you going?

901
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,400
I made a deal with myself.

902
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,610
If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.

903
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,510
If he turns around, I'd
hug him and stop everything.

904
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,240
But K didn't look back.

905
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:07,040
And there was nothing
I could do.

906
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:15,200
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

907
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,360
Just wanted something simple.

908
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:24,460
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

909
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:31,640
As I sat eating the
noodles with him...

910
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:35,220
I'd think, 'Don't
die you bastard'

911
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:38,080
and drank some water instead.

912
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:43,350
'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you! '

913
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:48,150
'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me! '

914
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,160
Instead, I just drank the water.

915
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,830
And finished the noodles.

916
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:05,640
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

917
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:10,050
What's that got to do with marriage?

918
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:17,480
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

919
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,560
Then I must be married, already.

920
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:28,900
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

921
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:32,400
Really?

922
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,000
Can we get married, soon?

923
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:33,160
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

924
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,730
The hell you...

925
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:17,540
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

926
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,480
I'm sorry.

927
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,160
I want to tell him I love him.

928
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:43,940
I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.

929
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:49,280
But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.

930
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:53,010
So I kept silent, again.

931
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,590
When are you going to talk to me?

932
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,590
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

933
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,640
What?

934
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,800
Stupid.

935
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,480
I didn't hear anything.

936
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,810
Then how can mutes love?

937
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,860
I love you.

938
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,270
Me, too.

939
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:13,590
We became a real couple.

940
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:15,960
Cuz we made it down the aisle.

941
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,420
Heaven's Gate Resting Place

942
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,500
Wait!

943
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,940
You never learn!

944
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:14,910
How can you write
with a brain like that?

945
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,560
This isn't kissing, is it?

946
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,300
Can you take a picture of us?

947
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,980
On three. One, two, three!

948
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:52,950
I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.

949
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:55,320
- EUN
Won -

950
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:57,050
I'm making noodles.
Want some?

951
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:59,120
No, I gotta work.

952
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,490
You sure?

953
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:02,250
Yes, I'm working!

954
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:06,350
- Then I'm just making
one! - Okay.

955
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:09,060
Don't come beggin'later.

956
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,200
- Hey!
- What?

957
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,360
No eggs! Give me that.

958
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:19,330
Wonder who invented noodles.

959
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:22,040
You said you didn't want any.

960
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,640
Changed my mind.

961
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,070
Is there any rice?

962
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,110
Hold on. There's
some in the fridge.

963
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:37,380
Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.

964
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:41,190
Don't worry.

965
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,630
I trust you. You
were always my compass.

966
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:53,470
Remember when I said
I can see you

967
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:56,670
even when you're not with me?

968
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:00,780
Go wherever you want.

969
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:04,580
I'll find you, soon.

970
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:10,360
Don't get mad when you see me.

971
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:19,430
Don't ask me why I followed
you or get angry at me.

972
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:27,830
After everything to come to
you, if you get mad I'll cry.

973
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:34,210
When we meet again on the other
side, let's not cry again.

974
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:37,370
Wait for me.
I'll be right there.
