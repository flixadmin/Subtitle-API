1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
the alternate timeline Flashpoint.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things weren't as I left them.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,387
I am The Flash.

28
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:00,389
&nbsp

29
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,855
Previously on "The Flash"...

30
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:01,857
&nbsp

31
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:04,391
This has been a really amazing date, Flash.

32
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:04,393
&nbsp

33
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:06,693
Cecile, thanks for stopping by.

34
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:06,695
&nbsp

35
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:08,328
Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

36
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:08,330
&nbsp

37
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,530
You restored the timeline,
and things were different?

38
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:10,532
&nbsp

39
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,765
Exactly.

40
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:12,901
&nbsp

41
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,601
Jesse, you're a speedster.

42
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:14,603
&nbsp

43
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:17,237
When I came back, things weren't the same.

44
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:17,239
&nbsp

45
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:18,738
You mean people.

46
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:18,740
&nbsp

47
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,706
Yeah.

48
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:31,954
&nbsp

49
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:32,953
How do I look?

50
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:32,955
&nbsp

51
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:34,888
Better.

52
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:34,890
&nbsp

53
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,957
How much?

54
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:36,959
&nbsp

55
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,327
Do we really need to ask that question?

56
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:40,329
&nbsp

57
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,562
Our take wasn't that big.

58
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:42,564
&nbsp

59
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,664
Big enough.

60
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:44,666
&nbsp

61
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:49,102
But the only question
you should be asking is,

62
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:49,104
&nbsp

63
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:53,607
what size rock you want dangling
from this beautiful neck?

64
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:53,609
&nbsp

65
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,408
A kiss from you makes my world spin.

66
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,778
&nbsp

67
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,712
You're so full of it, you know that?

68
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:58,714
&nbsp

69
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,413
I got to be honest.

70
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:00,415
&nbsp

71
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:04,951
I never understood...this.

72
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:04,953
&nbsp

73
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,453
But like my sister says,

74
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:06,455
&nbsp

75
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,989
anyone can stoop over and pick up nothing.

76
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:08,991
&nbsp

77
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,957
What do you want, Snart?

78
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:10,959
&nbsp

79
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,160
I told you two
to sit on your cut for a while,

80
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,162
&nbsp

81
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:15,762
until things cool down.

82
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:15,764
&nbsp

83
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:18,031
Some of us like to actually spend the cash

84
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:18,033
&nbsp

85
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:19,432
we get from these jobs.

86
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:19,434
&nbsp

87
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:22,502
Not when it's from the ones with me.

88
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:22,504
&nbsp

89
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,871
You didn't pull 'em off yourself.

90
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:24,873
&nbsp

91
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:28,708
Without us, you'd still be
kicking down liquor stores.

92
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:28,710
&nbsp

93
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,176
I think you've spent too much time

94
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:30,178
&nbsp

95
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:31,911
staring at yourself in the mirror,

96
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:31,913
&nbsp

97
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:35,315
because your perception
of reality is a bit warped.

98
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:35,317
&nbsp

99
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,783
You know the rules.

100
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:36,785
&nbsp

101
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:38,818
I don't give a damn about your rules,

102
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:38,820
&nbsp

103
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,620
or laying low.

104
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,622
&nbsp

105
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,490
There's no one in this city who can stop us.

106
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,492
&nbsp

107
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,225
Including you, Snart.

108
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:45,227
&nbsp

109
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,627
It sounds to me like
you're saying you want out.

110
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:47,629
&nbsp

111
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,597
- Mm.
- Guess so.

112
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:50,599
&nbsp

113
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,399
Well, if you're out...

114
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,736
&nbsp

115
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:55,669
You're out.

116
00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:23,899
&nbsp

117
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,432
No!

118
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:33,442
&nbsp

119
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:35,008
You lost, Scudder.

120
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:35,010
&nbsp

121
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,009
Sam!

122
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:41,583
&nbsp

123
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,049
Go.

124
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:43,051
&nbsp

125
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,150
Go!

126
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:58,233
&nbsp

127
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,299
Sam?

128
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:05,707
&nbsp

129
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,173
Give me a hand here.

130
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:12,414
&nbsp

131
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:15,281
Demo starts in a month.
Get everything out of here.

132
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:19,221
&nbsp

133
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,187
The hell?

134
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:29,531
&nbsp

135
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,930
Where's Snart?

136
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:30,932
&nbsp

137
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,766
Where's Snart?

138
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:37,038
&nbsp

139
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,039
This is from a security camera
inside Iron Heights.

140
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:40,041
&nbsp

141
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,042
Forensic analysis indicates
that the footage is genuine,

142
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:43,044
&nbsp

143
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,911
no evidence of tampering.

144
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:44,913
&nbsp

145
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:48,014
And we're pretty sure this is
Doctor Alchemy that did this?

146
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:48,016
&nbsp

147
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:50,417
The last thing Clariss said before he died.

148
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:50,419
&nbsp

149
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,419
Unless someone else killed him.

150
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:52,421
&nbsp

151
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,320
Like a meta with telekinesis

152
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,322
&nbsp

153
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,822
or cloaking abilities.

154
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:55,824
&nbsp

155
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,090
We've got both on our Earth.

156
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,092
&nbsp

157
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,291
So what do we do now?

158
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:58,293
&nbsp

159
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,393
Our meta-human specialist at CCPD,

160
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:00,395
&nbsp

161
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,229
Julian Albert, he prefers to work alone,

162
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:03,231
&nbsp

163
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,432
but I got feelers out on his investigation.

164
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:05,434
&nbsp

165
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,734
I'm gonna go there now
and see if he dug up anything.

166
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:07,736
&nbsp

167
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,969
All right.

168
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:09,971
&nbsp

169
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,439
Okay, well, until then,
you guys want to train?

170
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:12,441
&nbsp

171
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,840
Well, now, we have to think about

172
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:13,842
&nbsp

173
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,108
getting back to our Earth.

174
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:15,110
&nbsp

175
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,409
We've been here long enough.

176
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:16,411
&nbsp

177
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,578
I've still got a lot to learn.

178
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:18,580
&nbsp

179
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,213
Your words, not mine.

180
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:20,215
&nbsp

181
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,148
I...

182
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:22,150
&nbsp

183
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,183
Fine.

184
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:23,185
&nbsp

185
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,285
Well, if you want to train,

186
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:25,287
&nbsp

187
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,853
let's train...

188
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:26,855
&nbsp

189
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,455
speedster style.

190
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:37,098
&nbsp

191
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,499
Damn, Jesse's almost as fast as Barry.

192
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:39,501
&nbsp

193
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,067
Velocity's just under Mach 3.

194
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:41,069
&nbsp

195
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,403
Heart rate, 100 BPMs. Her vitals are normal.

196
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:43,405
&nbsp

197
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:44,804
Yeah, no, we already know all that.

198
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:44,806
&nbsp

199
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,539
Cisco, we need to test her reflexes.

200
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:46,541
&nbsp

201
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,776
Can we test her reflexes?
Patience, Harry, patience.

202
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:49,778
&nbsp

203
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,078
If anyone's gonna teach Jesse
the ways of the Speed Force...

204
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:52,080
&nbsp

205
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,713
- It's Barry.
- Thank you.

206
00:04:53,723 --> 00:05:07,562
&nbsp

207
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,262
Aah!

208
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:17,706
&nbsp

209
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:19,472
Okay. Well, that wasn't very heroic.

210
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:19,474
&nbsp

211
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:20,840
Nope.

212
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:20,842
&nbsp

213
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:22,642
But there is a lesson in there somewhere.

214
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:22,644
&nbsp

215
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,810
What's that?

216
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:23,812
&nbsp

217
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,411
The difference between having powers

218
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:25,413
&nbsp

219
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,579
and having precision.

220
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:26,581
&nbsp

221
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,047
Well, what do you mean?

222
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:28,049
&nbsp

223
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,716
I mean, it's gonna take more than speed

224
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:29,718
&nbsp

225
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,017
to take down some of these metas.

226
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:31,019
&nbsp

227
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,452
You got to think, anticipate.

228
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:32,454
&nbsp

229
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:33,786
When you enter a new environment,

230
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:33,788
&nbsp

231
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,088
you got to case every inch of it.

232
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:35,090
&nbsp

233
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,990
You never run in blind.

234
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:36,992
&nbsp

235
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,791
Oh, my God.

236
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:38,793
&nbsp

237
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,393
I've become Oliver.

238
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:40,395
&nbsp

239
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,095
Huh.

240
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,999
&nbsp

241
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,232
Maybe we should stay a little bit longer.

242
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:46,234
&nbsp

243
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,934
Yeah, I guess so.

244
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:47,936
&nbsp

245
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,169
It's gonna take some time
to master your powers, Jesse.

246
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:50,171
&nbsp

247
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:52,171
You'll get the hang of it.
Yeah, I know, thanks.

248
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:52,173
&nbsp

249
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,274
Well, since I will be here for a while,

250
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:54,276
&nbsp

251
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,376
do you want to get out of here?

252
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:56,378
&nbsp

253
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,078
- Where to?
- Does it matter?

254
00:05:59,088 --> 00:05:59,080
&nbsp

255
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,447
No touching.

256
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,684
&nbsp

257
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:05,184
Not what I meant by staying longer!

258
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:05,186
&nbsp

259
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:06,686
I should probably get back to CCPN.

260
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:06,688
&nbsp

261
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,121
- All right.
- I'll see you tonight?

262
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:08,123
&nbsp

263
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,089
- Can't wait.
- Okay.

264
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,726
&nbsp

265
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,293
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah?

266
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:13,295
&nbsp

267
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,194
Are you really sure you have to leave?

268
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:15,196
&nbsp

269
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,130
Just a lot I still have to fix on my Earth.

270
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,132
&nbsp

271
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,798
Yeah, but you know it's more fun

272
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:18,800
&nbsp

273
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,800
when you're here helping us
fix stuff on our Earth.

274
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:20,802
&nbsp

275
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:22,235
He is right.

276
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:22,237
&nbsp

277
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,536
It hasn't been the same without you.

278
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:23,538
&nbsp

279
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,604
The team doesn't feel complete

280
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:24,606
&nbsp

281
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:27,073
without Harrison Wells.

282
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,075
&nbsp

283
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:29,108
Then change that.

284
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:29,110
&nbsp

285
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,977
There's a whole multiverse of Harrison Wells

286
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:30,979
&nbsp

287
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,912
out there at your fingertips.

288
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:32,914
&nbsp

289
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,548
You want one? Let's go get one.

290
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:42,090
&nbsp

291
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,790
Yeah, now I remembered it.

292
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:43,792
&nbsp

293
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,059
Thank you, Officer Mayer.

294
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:46,061
&nbsp

295
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,760
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

296
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:47,762
&nbsp

297
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,662
So sorry. I got held up at the courthouse.

298
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:49,664
&nbsp

299
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:50,863
No problem.

300
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:50,865
&nbsp

301
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,298
You're the one doing me the favor.

302
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:52,300
&nbsp

303
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,534
Yeah, I wouldn't thank me just yet.

304
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:54,536
&nbsp

305
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,636
Oh, you couldn't find anything.

306
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:56,638
&nbsp

307
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,071
Nope, no one at the DA's office

308
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:58,073
&nbsp

309
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,340
knows anything about anybody named Alchemy.

310
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,342
&nbsp

311
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,241
Oh, damn.

312
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:02,243
&nbsp

313
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,811
This is, um...

314
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:04,813
&nbsp

315
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,313
Meta-human related, I assume?

316
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:07,315
&nbsp

317
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:08,781
- It appears to be.
- Yikes.

318
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:08,783
&nbsp

319
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,683
- I know.
- Okay.

320
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:10,685
&nbsp

321
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:13,820
You let me know if there's
anything I can do for you, yeah?

322
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,822
&nbsp

323
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:16,255
Yeah, thanks for bringing it
yourself, Cecile.

324
00:07:16,265 --> 00:07:17,592
&nbsp

325
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,592
It was my pleasure.

326
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:27,702
&nbsp

327
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,168
This is really nice.

328
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:29,170
&nbsp

329
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,773
Staying in is so much better than going out.

330
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:33,775
&nbsp

331
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,475
When you have jobs like ours? Yes.

332
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:35,477
&nbsp

333
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:38,511
Yes.

334
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:43,852
&nbsp

335
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,752
What?

336
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:45,754
&nbsp

337
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:47,687
You're just really handsome.

338
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:50,692
&nbsp

339
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:54,827
You are not so bad yourself.

340
00:07:54,837 --> 00:08:17,919
&nbsp

341
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:20,720
Hey, hey... Hi. I thought...

342
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:20,722
&nbsp

343
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,022
I didn't think you were gonna
be home for a while, right?

344
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:23,024
&nbsp

345
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,023
My plans changed.

346
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,994
&nbsp

347
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,094
Unfortunately. I'm just gonna go upstairs.

348
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:28,096
&nbsp

349
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:31,364
You can have a beer, sit with us.

350
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:31,366
&nbsp

351
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,766
Have a good night.

352
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:33,768
&nbsp

353
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:34,834
I... I know.

354
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:34,836
&nbsp

355
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,070
I'm...I'm sorry.

356
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,072
&nbsp

357
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,138
I... I... should we rain check, or...

358
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:39,140
&nbsp

359
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,674
Barry, I am not upset because
our date got interrupted.

360
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:41,676
&nbsp

361
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,543
- That, I understand.
- What do you mean?

362
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:43,545
&nbsp

363
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,978
You, speeding away when my dad walks in.

364
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:45,980
&nbsp

365
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,580
- Yeah.
- Because, what, we're kissing?

366
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,582
&nbsp

367
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,415
Yeah, Iris, exactly.

368
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:49,417
&nbsp

369
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:50,917
What, you don't want to kiss me?

370
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:50,919
&nbsp

371
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,485
Of course I want to kiss you.

372
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:52,487
&nbsp

373
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,986
But not in front of him.

374
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:53,988
&nbsp

375
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,488
What does that matter?

376
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:55,490
&nbsp

377
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,558
He's your... he's our...

378
00:08:58,568 --> 00:08:58,560
&nbsp

379
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,759
Joe.

380
00:08:59,769 --> 00:08:59,761
&nbsp

381
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:00,893
Joe. I don't know.

382
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:00,895
&nbsp

383
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,696
- Barry, we are adults.
- I know.

384
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:03,698
&nbsp

385
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,098
- We are dating.
- Yeah.

386
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:05,100
&nbsp

387
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,600
We should be able to kiss.

388
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:07,602
&nbsp

389
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,469
I agree.

390
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:09,471
&nbsp

391
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,037
Okay, yep.

392
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:11,039
&nbsp

393
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,106
Yep. You should talk to him.

394
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:13,108
&nbsp

395
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,907
I... about?

396
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,111
&nbsp

397
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,744
For real? Yeah.

398
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:17,746
&nbsp

399
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,479
Go talk to him.

400
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:19,481
&nbsp

401
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,614
- Yeah, sure, I'll talk to him.
- Okay.

402
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:21,616
&nbsp

403
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,116
- About us kissing.
- Yeah.

404
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:23,118
&nbsp

405
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,551
It's not gonna be awkward at all.

406
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:25,553
&nbsp

407
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:27,086
Let me know how it goes.

408
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:27,088
&nbsp

409
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,122
It's gonna be awkward, that's how.

410
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:45,774
&nbsp

411
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:49,275
Where's Snart?

412
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:49,277
&nbsp

413
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,011
Who said that?

414
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,013
&nbsp

415
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,379
Where are you?

416
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:58,019
&nbsp

417
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,852
Boo.

418
00:09:59,862 --> 00:09:59,854
&nbsp

419
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,020
Scudder?

420
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,022
&nbsp

421
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:03,990
Where's Snart?

422
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:03,992
&nbsp

423
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,591
I don't know, man.

424
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:10,565
&nbsp

425
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,865
Then I guess I'll just have to
find someone who does.

426
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:22,477
&nbsp

427
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,243
And I know just the girl.

428
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:29,836
&nbsp

429
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,736
Yeah, Sam Scudder.
He threw me into a mirror.

430
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:31,738
&nbsp

431
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:33,705
I fell out of a second-story window.

432
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:33,707
&nbsp

433
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,574
So Scudder's going after
everyone in Snart's old crew

434
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:36,576
&nbsp

435
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,842
to track him down?

436
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:37,844
&nbsp

437
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,043
Yeah, but the only problem is,

438
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:39,045
&nbsp

439
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,211
Scudder's not gonna find him.

440
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:40,213
&nbsp

441
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,679
Snart's gone.

442
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:41,681
&nbsp

443
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:42,780
What do you mean, he's gone?

444
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,782
&nbsp

445
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,816
He's gone. I thought I...

446
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:44,818
&nbsp

447
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,552
Oliver told me that Snart left

448
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:47,554
&nbsp

449
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,988
with some friends of ours on a... trip.

450
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:50,990
&nbsp

451
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,790
I don't even want to know.

452
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:52,792
&nbsp

453
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,592
One of Snart's old crew is at Iron Heights.

454
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:54,594
&nbsp

455
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:55,827
I'll go see if I can talk to her.

456
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:55,829
&nbsp

457
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,295
Okay, I'll see if I can locate

458
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:57,297
&nbsp

459
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,063
any others at S.T.A.R. Labs.

460
00:10:59,073 --> 00:10:59,065
&nbsp

461
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,633
Hey, um, hey, actually...
I'm sorry, I just...

462
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:02,635
&nbsp

463
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,336
I need to talk to you
about something really quick.

464
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:05,338
&nbsp

465
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:07,071
Um...

466
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:07,073
&nbsp

467
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,740
Okay, so I... I know

468
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:08,742
&nbsp

469
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,308
it's probably awkward

470
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:10,310
&nbsp

471
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,411
seeing me and Iris kiss.

472
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:13,413
&nbsp

473
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,779
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

474
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:14,781
&nbsp

475
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,382
So I... I was just thinking, maybe...

476
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:17,384
&nbsp

477
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,784
did it have to be awkward?

478
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:19,786
&nbsp

479
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,252
Do you mean like this conversation?

480
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:21,254
&nbsp

481
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,588
Yeah, like this conversation.

482
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:23,590
&nbsp

483
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,924
I don't know, just 'cause
the next time, um, you see us,

484
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:26,926
&nbsp

485
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,260
we may kiss again in front of you.

486
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,262
&nbsp

487
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,261
Okay.

488
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:30,263
&nbsp

489
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,896
So I just want to make sure

490
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:31,898
&nbsp

491
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:35,533
that that is... okay with you.

492
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:35,535
&nbsp

493
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:38,936
- Look, Bar.
- Uh-huh.

494
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:38,938
&nbsp

495
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,838
- You're an adult.
- Yes.

496
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:40,840
&nbsp

497
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,540
Do what you got to do.

498
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,542
&nbsp

499
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,975
I love you. I love you too.

500
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:43,977
&nbsp

501
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,777
I love her.

502
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:45,779
&nbsp

503
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,580
I don't love watching you two make out.

504
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,582
&nbsp

505
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,315
Um, okay, and just... just so you know,

506
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:51,317
&nbsp

507
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,218
I am gonna tell Iris that...
that we talked about this.

508
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:54,220
&nbsp

509
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,654
Yeah, like I said. Do what you got to do.

510
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:56,656
&nbsp

511
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,623
Okay.

512
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:58,625
&nbsp

513
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,791
Wow.

514
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,060
&nbsp

515
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,761
How sure are you that this will work?

516
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:03,763
&nbsp

517
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,263
Pretty sure.

518
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:05,265
&nbsp

519
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,864
Okay, but how's this going to help us

520
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:06,866
&nbsp

521
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,599
find another Harrison Wells?

522
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:08,601
&nbsp

523
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,034
You ever go fishing, Snow?

524
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:10,036
&nbsp

525
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,536
- No.
- No, all right.

526
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:11,538
&nbsp

527
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:12,737
When you go fishing, you use lures.

528
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:12,739
&nbsp

529
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:13,938
Lures attract fish.

530
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:13,940
&nbsp

531
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,273
Fish end up on your fishing pole.

532
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:15,275
&nbsp

533
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,141
This satellite is our fishing pole,

534
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:17,143
&nbsp

535
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,343
through which we're going
to cast our very tempting bait

536
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:19,345
&nbsp

537
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,579
out into the world's largest ocean.

538
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:21,581
&nbsp

539
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,514
Okay, how?

540
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:23,516
&nbsp

541
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,416
How? Cisco will open a breach,

542
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:25,418
&nbsp

543
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,052
and this satellite
will shoot a message embedded

544
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:28,054
&nbsp

545
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,555
with a tachyon-enhanced laser
out into the multiverse,

546
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:30,557
&nbsp

547
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,824
and any Earth that is
technologically advanced enough

548
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:32,826
&nbsp

549
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,126
should be able to receive it.

550
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:35,128
&nbsp

551
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:38,296
Okay, let's say this somehow works.

552
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:38,298
&nbsp

553
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,865
Just 'cause they can solve a riddle

554
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:40,867
&nbsp

555
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,800
doesn't mean they're
a right fit for the team.

556
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:42,802
&nbsp

557
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,335
A riddle. Did you say riddle?

558
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:44,337
&nbsp

559
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,003
- Yeah.
- How dare you, sir.

560
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:46,005
&nbsp

561
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,405
This is not a riddle.

562
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:47,407
&nbsp

563
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:50,274
This is a complex algorithmic cryptogram

564
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:50,276
&nbsp

565
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,043
designed to test deductive reasoning,

566
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:52,045
&nbsp

567
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,578
IQ, problem-solving skills,

568
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:53,580
&nbsp

569
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,848
anything that our team
will need to combat threats,

570
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:56,850
&nbsp

571
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,317
meta-human or otherwise.

572
00:12:59,327 --> 00:12:59,319
&nbsp

573
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,853
Okay, so you're just sending
out an intergalactic IQ test

574
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:01,855
&nbsp

575
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,754
to all of your doppelgangers
in the multiverse.

576
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:03,756
&nbsp

577
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,923
Not just a test.
Think of it as an invitation.

578
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:05,925
&nbsp

579
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:08,960
Think of it as an elaborate
"help wanted" ad.

580
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:08,962
&nbsp

581
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,795
Will it test their attitudes, too?

582
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:10,797
&nbsp

583
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,363
'Cause I'm not sure
I can stomach another Wells

584
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:12,365
&nbsp

585
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,664
with your bedside manner.

586
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:13,666
&nbsp

587
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:16,067
I care for you too, you jack wagon.

588
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:16,069
&nbsp

589
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,502
System is calibrated.

590
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:17,504
&nbsp

591
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,370
What are you waiting for?

592
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:27,714
&nbsp

593
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,880
And...

594
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,585
&nbsp

595
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,051
That's it.

596
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:34,053
&nbsp

597
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,887
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

598
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:35,889
&nbsp

599
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,921
So now what?

600
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:36,923
&nbsp

601
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,657
Now...

602
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:39,659
&nbsp

603
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,926
we go get a Big Belly burger.

604
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:47,567
&nbsp

605
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,166
- That's insane. What a rush.
- I know.

606
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:49,168
&nbsp

607
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,868
I mean, it took me a while
to get used to it.

608
00:13:50,878 --> 00:13:50,870
&nbsp

609
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,104
I can't believe you're not sick at all.

610
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:53,106
&nbsp

611
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,039
I must have an iron stomach.

612
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:55,041
&nbsp

613
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,474
Okay, so you're telling me

614
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:56,476
&nbsp

615
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,776
that Barry has never taken you on a run?

616
00:13:58,786 --> 00:13:58,778
&nbsp

617
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,012
No.

618
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:01,014
&nbsp

619
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,881
Well, then, I guess
it's a good thing you've got me.

620
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:03,883
&nbsp

621
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:05,283
Guess so.

622
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,153
&nbsp

623
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,287
Whoa, um, hold up.

624
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:09,289
&nbsp

625
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,289
Oh...I'm sorry.

626
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:11,291
&nbsp

627
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,424
Am I... am I reading this, like,
really wrong or something?

628
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:13,426
&nbsp

629
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,692
No, no.

630
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:14,694
&nbsp

631
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:17,128
I like you, Jesse. It's just...

632
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:17,130
&nbsp

633
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,763
It's just what?

634
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:18,765
&nbsp

635
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,232
You're going home soon.

636
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:21,234
&nbsp

637
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:22,700
To another Earth.

638
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,702
&nbsp

639
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,669
Ah, right. Yeah.

640
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:24,671
&nbsp

641
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,138
Yeah, no, it's... it's cool, yeah.

642
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:27,140
&nbsp

643
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,439
- Jesse, I...
- No, no, no.

644
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:28,441
&nbsp

645
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,874
It's... it's totally cool.

646
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:29,876
&nbsp

647
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:31,075
I get it.

648
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,980
&nbsp

649
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,013
So... so friends, then?

650
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:36,015
&nbsp

651
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,916
Friends.

652
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:38,918
&nbsp

653
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:41,185
Well, as friends, I mean,

654
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:41,187
&nbsp

655
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,588
we can still run around the city, right?

656
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:43,590
&nbsp

657
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,822
Sure.

658
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,159
&nbsp

659
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:48,392
Good-looking guy.

660
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:48,394
&nbsp

661
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:49,961
For a criminal.

662
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:49,963
&nbsp

663
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,696
Well, he's more than just a criminal now.

664
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:51,698
&nbsp

665
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,832
Apparently, he's a meta
who can travel through mirrors.

666
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:54,834
&nbsp

667
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:56,767
Oh, oh, I got this one. He's, uh...

668
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:56,769
&nbsp

669
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,102
- Mirror Master.
- What the...

670
00:14:58,112 --> 00:14:58,104
&nbsp

671
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,503
- Boom.
- That's good.

672
00:14:59,513 --> 00:14:59,505
&nbsp

673
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:01,205
Thank you, we had
a Mirror Master on our Earth,

674
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:01,207
&nbsp

675
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:02,940
Evan McCulloch. Wasn't a meta, though.

676
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:02,942
&nbsp

677
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,843
He had some kind of mirror gun that he used.

678
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:05,845
&nbsp

679
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:08,245
- How'd it work?
- Must've had dimensional

680
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:08,247
&nbsp

681
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:11,449
warping tech that changed
everything into two dimensions.

682
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:11,451
&nbsp

683
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,684
Well, Scudder is hell-bent on finding Snart,

684
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:13,686
&nbsp

685
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:14,885
and he's going after anybody
that worked with him

686
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:14,887
&nbsp

687
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,354
in the past.

688
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:16,356
&nbsp

689
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,688
Joe's interviewing one of 'em right now.

690
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:17,690
&nbsp

691
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,190
Well, all of Snart's known associates

692
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,192
&nbsp

693
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:24,128
are either presumed dead
or gone AWOL, except for one.

694
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:24,130
&nbsp

695
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,297
- That's her.
- Rosalind Dillon.

696
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:26,299
&nbsp

697
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,333
Says she has the ability
to induce crippling vertigo.

698
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:29,335
&nbsp

699
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,068
- Oh, um, uh...
- She's, uh...

700
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:31,070
&nbsp

701
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,570
Top, like a top. She's The Top.

702
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:32,572
&nbsp

703
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,305
That's her name. Top. Amazing.

704
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:34,307
&nbsp

705
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,840
What, you want to go?

706
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:35,842
&nbsp

707
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,742
Okay.

708
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:37,744
&nbsp

709
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,510
Do we think that she can lead us to Scudder?

710
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,512
&nbsp

711
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,979
I'll have to see if Joe gets
any answers out of her.

712
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:46,919
&nbsp

713
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,786
Heard your ex is back in town.

714
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:48,788
&nbsp

715
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:51,722
You know anything about that?

716
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:51,724
&nbsp

717
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,658
He pay you a visit, Ms. Dillon?

718
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:56,295
&nbsp

719
00:15:56,305 --> 00:16:00,398
They don't let people like me
have visitors here, Detective.

720
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:00,400
&nbsp

721
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,935
All day, all night,
in my boring little cell.

722
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:06,339
&nbsp

723
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,105
Makes a girl go crazy.

724
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:08,107
&nbsp

725
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,942
Scudder tried to kill one of
your old crewmates last night.

726
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:11,944
&nbsp

727
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,612
Leon Williams? Tried? Too bad he failed.

728
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:14,614
&nbsp

729
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,514
He's gonna try to kill more.

730
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:16,516
&nbsp

731
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,583
Any idea who? Give us a name.

732
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:19,585
&nbsp

733
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,819
I'll see what we can do
about your current situation.

734
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,924
&nbsp

735
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,557
Okay.

736
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:26,559
&nbsp

737
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,293
Let us know if you change your mind.

738
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:31,497
&nbsp

739
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,764
- Sorry, Joe.
- It's all right.

740
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:33,766
&nbsp

741
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,933
I appreciate your setting up
the interview, though.

742
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:35,935
&nbsp

743
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:37,368
It looks like I owe you another one.

744
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:37,370
&nbsp

745
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,638
You know, these IOUs
are starting to pile up.

746
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:40,640
&nbsp

747
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,706
I have an idea about that.

748
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:41,708
&nbsp

749
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:44,041
Do you?

750
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:44,043
&nbsp

751
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,243
- Scudder?
- You want me?

752
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:46,245
&nbsp

753
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,179
Come and get me.

754
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:56,672
&nbsp

755
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,532
So you saw Sam Scudder and Rosalind Dillon

756
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:58,554
&nbsp

757
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,488
escape through a glass window?

758
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:00,490
&nbsp

759
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,356
Like I said, he grabbed her hand.

760
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:02,358
&nbsp

761
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,925
They walked to the window,
and then poof, they were gone.

762
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:04,927
&nbsp

763
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,028
So, mirrors, windows.

764
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:07,030
&nbsp

765
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,496
It sounds like he can travel
through anything

766
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:08,498
&nbsp

767
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:09,964
that has a reflective surface.

768
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:09,966
&nbsp

769
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,465
How exactly does he do that?

770
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:11,467
&nbsp

771
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,668
He must be able to link
Einstein-Rosen bridges

772
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:13,670
&nbsp

773
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,670
to anything with high solar
reflectance, right?

774
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:15,672
&nbsp

775
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,105
So he creates wormholes through reflections.

776
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:18,107
&nbsp

777
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,140
That's a new one.

778
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,142
&nbsp

779
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,241
Look, I can't pretend

780
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:20,243
&nbsp

781
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,909
to understand or care

782
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:21,911
&nbsp

783
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:23,577
about the science of it all,
but we need to find Dillon

784
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:23,579
&nbsp

785
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,379
and Scudder before something
really bad happens.

786
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:25,381
&nbsp

787
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,748
So I'm gonna go old-school at the precinct.

788
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:27,750
&nbsp

789
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,949
I'll see you later.

790
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:28,951
&nbsp

791
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,185
Oh, my God.

792
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:31,187
&nbsp

793
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:32,586
Pings. We got pings.

794
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:32,588
&nbsp

795
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,488
Looks like some of
your doppelgangers out there

796
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:34,490
&nbsp

797
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,057
actually cracked your code, Harry.

798
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:36,059
&nbsp

799
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,159
That was fast.

800
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:38,161
&nbsp

801
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:40,327
Let's go take a look.

802
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:40,329
&nbsp

803
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,063
Guys? We're...

804
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,267
&nbsp

805
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,500
Um... Dad seems fine.

806
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:46,502
&nbsp

807
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,804
Um, yeah, no, he's still
a little weird about it.

808
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:49,806
&nbsp

809
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,238
You talked to him, though, right?

810
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:51,240
&nbsp

811
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,974
Um, yeah, I did.

812
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:53,976
&nbsp

813
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,176
Yeah, it'll be good.

814
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:55,178
&nbsp

815
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,744
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

816
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:56,746
&nbsp

817
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,913
- Then I'll see you tonight.
- All right.

818
00:17:58,923 --> 00:17:58,915
&nbsp

819
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,748
You'll pick a good movie?

820
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:00,750
&nbsp

821
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,416
- I'll try.
- Okay.

822
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:04,053
&nbsp

823
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,687
I'm also gonna try to find our meta-humans

824
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:06,689
&nbsp

825
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:10,558
that apparently no one else
cares about right now.

826
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,096
&nbsp

827
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:15,129
Well the hell did you go?

828
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:15,131
&nbsp

829
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,799
How many times do I have to tell you, Rosa?

830
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:18,801
&nbsp

831
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,135
I was stuck in there.

832
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:21,137
&nbsp

833
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:25,506
Whatever it was that hit me
gave me this crazy ability.

834
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:25,508
&nbsp

835
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,275
And to me, all this
just happened last night.

836
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:28,277
&nbsp

837
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:31,479
It's been three years, Sam.

838
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:31,481
&nbsp

839
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,047
So many things are different now.

840
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:33,049
&nbsp

841
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,583
You were hit too, weren't you?

842
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:35,585
&nbsp

843
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,785
You can do things like me?

844
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:37,787
&nbsp

845
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,987
- Yeah.
- Show me.

846
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:49,432
&nbsp

847
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,332
You might want to hold onto something.

848
00:18:51,342 --> 00:19:01,778
&nbsp

849
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,177
Whoa.

850
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:03,179
&nbsp

851
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,512
Oh.

852
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:11,320
&nbsp

853
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,654
See, Sammy?

854
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:13,656
&nbsp

855
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,356
Too much has changed.

856
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,394
&nbsp

857
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,328
Then let's change it back.

858
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:21,330
&nbsp

859
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,830
Huh?

860
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:22,832
&nbsp

861
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:24,298
I can stop Snart, Rosa.

862
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:24,300
&nbsp

863
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,735
We... can stop Snart.

864
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:27,737
&nbsp

865
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:31,472
Snart? He's gone.

866
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:31,474
&nbsp

867
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,040
Long gone.

868
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,042
&nbsp

869
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,143
Then let's take this city.

870
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:36,145
&nbsp

871
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:37,711
We can be who we want to now.

872
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:37,713
&nbsp

873
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:40,848
We can be in control.

874
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:40,850
&nbsp

875
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,952
There's no one in this city
who can stop us now.

876
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:44,954
&nbsp

877
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:47,888
There's one person who can.

878
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:47,890
&nbsp

879
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,157
Who?

880
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:50,159
&nbsp

881
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:52,893
The Flash.

882
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:52,895
&nbsp

883
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:54,962
Well, hey, now.

884
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:54,964
&nbsp

885
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:57,331
I... I solved the derivative
you done beamed up.

886
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:57,333
&nbsp

887
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:00,100
My name is Wells, Harrison Wells.

888
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,102
&nbsp

889
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,569
You can call me Hell's Wells.

890
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:01,571
&nbsp

891
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:03,237
They call me that 'cause of my past.

892
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:03,239
&nbsp

893
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:06,574
I won't get into it
with you now right and proper.

894
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:06,576
&nbsp

895
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,742
I'd like to hitch wagons and...

896
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:08,744
&nbsp

897
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:11,278
I had a bad dinner.

898
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:11,280
&nbsp

899
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,813
- Pass.
- All right.

900
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:12,815
&nbsp

901
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:14,415
This is Earth-17.

902
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:14,417
&nbsp

903
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:16,083
I'll be in touch.

904
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:16,085
&nbsp

905
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,220
Salutations to all of you
out there in the multiverse.

906
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,222
&nbsp

907
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,889
I have of late, wherefore I know
not, received a communiqué

908
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:21,891
&nbsp

909
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,426
from the citizens of Terra-Prime.

910
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:25,428
&nbsp

911
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:26,560
Terra-Prime?

912
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:26,562
&nbsp

913
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:29,096
- Nerd.
- Pass.

914
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:29,098
&nbsp

915
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,866
Bonjour. Moi, je suis Harrison Wells.

916
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:32,969
&nbsp

917
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,235
You can't trust a mime.

918
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:34,237
&nbsp

919
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:35,569
- Can't argue with that.
- Pass.

920
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:35,571
&nbsp

921
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,404
Okay, guys. We're 0 for 3 now.

922
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:37,406
&nbsp

923
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,241
This is our last one.

924
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:40,243
&nbsp

925
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,444
It's coming from Earth-19.

926
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:43,446
&nbsp

927
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,412
Hello, hello, hello.

928
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:45,414
&nbsp

929
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,514
Hello, out there in the multiverse,

930
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:47,516
&nbsp

931
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:49,016
whoever you may be.

932
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:49,018
&nbsp

933
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,151
Um...

934
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:51,153
&nbsp

935
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:54,555
I really enjoyed cracking
the cryptogram you broadcast.

936
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:54,557
&nbsp

937
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,056
I like the cute trick,

938
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:56,058
&nbsp

939
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,558
embedding the secondary measures

940
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:57,560
&nbsp

941
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,493
in the primary data string. It's clever.

942
00:20:59,503 --> 00:20:59,495
&nbsp

943
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:00,928
Most people wouldn't have caught it.

944
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:00,930
&nbsp

945
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,396
I caught it. But that's the point.

946
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:02,398
&nbsp

947
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:05,933
You need a genius, I guess,

948
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:05,935
&nbsp

949
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,669
to help you in your fight

950
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:08,671
&nbsp

951
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,038
against these awful meta-hominids.

952
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:11,040
&nbsp

953
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,974
Well, I got to tell you...
I got to tell you, to me,

954
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:13,976
&nbsp

955
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:15,843
that sounds like fun.

956
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:15,845
&nbsp

957
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:19,380
So... I'll enclose my curriculum vitae.

958
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:19,382
&nbsp

959
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,148
You already know we speak the same language.

960
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:21,150
&nbsp

961
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,250
But take a look. Tell me what you think.

962
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,252
&nbsp

963
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,019
Until our next communion.

964
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,021
&nbsp

965
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,921
Oh, where are my manners?

966
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:26,923
&nbsp

967
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,455
Thank you.

968
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,092
&nbsp

969
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:32,860
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

970
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,330
&nbsp

971
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,596
Harry?

972
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:35,598
&nbsp

973
00:21:35,608 --> 00:21:37,131
- Pass.
- What?

974
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:37,133
&nbsp

975
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,566
- Pass.
- Wait, what? Wait a minute.

976
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:39,568
&nbsp

977
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:41,802
That guy cracked the code,
and he wants to do it.

978
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:41,804
&nbsp

979
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,004
And he's nice, and he's not evil.

980
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:44,006
&nbsp

981
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:47,207
And that's a combination of
Wells we haven't had thus far.

982
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:47,209
&nbsp

983
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,677
All my life, everyone
I've ever hired to work for me,

984
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:49,679
&nbsp

985
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:51,779
I have trusted my gut.

986
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:51,781
&nbsp

987
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,113
My gut tells me that's not the guy.

988
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:53,115
&nbsp

989
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,648
Keep looking.

990
00:21:54,658 --> 00:22:04,493
&nbsp

991
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,961
It's all right. He's my friend.

992
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:08,798
&nbsp

993
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:10,664
Sorry. I'm just gonna get...

994
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:14,170
&nbsp

995
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,336
Oh, for God's sake.

996
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:15,338
&nbsp

997
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:16,670
Okay, you know what?

998
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,840
&nbsp

999
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,206
I can't take this anymore.

1000
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:19,208
&nbsp

1001
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,741
What?

1002
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:20,743
&nbsp

1003
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:23,043
I thought you guys
were supposed to talk about us.

1004
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:23,045
&nbsp

1005
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,278
- We did.
- We did.

1006
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:24,280
&nbsp

1007
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,213
Then why are you being so weird?

1008
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:26,215
&nbsp

1009
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,148
I'm not.

1010
00:22:28,158 --> 00:22:28,150
&nbsp

1011
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,249
Dad?

1012
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:29,251
&nbsp

1013
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,784
Iris.

1014
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:30,786
&nbsp

1015
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:35,689
I already told him,
if you two want to cuddle,

1016
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:35,691
&nbsp

1017
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,157
make out, do whatever,

1018
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:37,159
&nbsp

1019
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,738
I... I... go for it.

1020
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:38,761
&nbsp

1021
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:39,693
I don't care.

1022
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:39,695
&nbsp

1023
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:41,662
- Barry?
- Hey.

1024
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:41,664
&nbsp

1025
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,230
Should we give you guys a minute?

1026
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,232
&nbsp

1027
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:46,033
- Yeah.
- No, no, it's fine.

1028
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:46,035
&nbsp

1029
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,901
Look, Barry, this isn't
about my dad anymore.

1030
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:47,903
&nbsp

1031
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,036
He's fine with it.

1032
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:49,038
&nbsp

1033
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,337
I'm not totally fine with it.

1034
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:50,339
&nbsp

1035
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,940
So why do you have a problem with this?

1036
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,410
&nbsp

1037
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,610
Thank God.

1038
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:56,612
&nbsp

1039
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,345
There's a robbery at First National.

1040
00:22:58,355 --> 00:22:58,347
&nbsp

1041
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:01,882
Suspects match Scudder
and Dillon's description.

1042
00:23:01,892 --> 00:23:01,884
&nbsp

1043
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:03,917
Scudder and Dillon, yeah,
I'm sorry, I got to go.

1044
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:03,919
&nbsp

1045
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:04,918
Okay.

1046
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:04,920
&nbsp

1047
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,387
Hey... let me help.

1048
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:06,389
&nbsp

1049
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,055
We've been training for a reason, right?

1050
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:08,057
&nbsp

1051
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,857
- I've got to try.
- Yeah, all right, cool.

1052
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:09,859
&nbsp

1053
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,558
Just follow my lead. Okay.

1054
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:16,198
&nbsp

1055
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,432
We keep this up,

1056
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:18,434
&nbsp

1057
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,300
baby, we'll be set for life.

1058
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,302
&nbsp

1059
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:21,802
Then what are you waiting for?

1060
00:23:21,812 --> 00:23:26,575
&nbsp

1061
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:27,841
Let's do it again.

1062
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,480
&nbsp

1063
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,048
Anything for you, baby.

1064
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:34,050
&nbsp

1065
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,684
Yeah, so we're not gonna
let you leave here with that.

1066
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:37,686
&nbsp

1067
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,921
Hey, Flash.

1068
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:40,923
&nbsp

1069
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,156
Heard a lot about you.

1070
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:42,158
&nbsp

1071
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,590
That's great.

1072
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,592
&nbsp

1073
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:45,926
Can't say the same for you, though.

1074
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:45,928
&nbsp

1075
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,361
The name's Jesse Quick.

1076
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:47,363
&nbsp

1077
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:49,630
- Oh.
- So... I'm sorry, Scudder,

1078
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:49,632
&nbsp

1079
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:52,533
but your little crime spree,
it's gonna have to end here.

1080
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:52,535
&nbsp

1081
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:55,035
Oh, I don't think
you have much of a say in it.

1082
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:55,037
&nbsp

1083
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,470
I'm gonna take whatever I want.

1084
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,472
&nbsp

1085
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:58,305
I thought you were looking
for Leonard Snart.

1086
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:58,307
&nbsp

1087
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:01,175
Why bother? His reign is over.

1088
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:01,177
&nbsp

1089
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,677
There's a... a new king in town.

1090
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:03,679
&nbsp

1091
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,112
And I'm the queen.

1092
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:05,114
&nbsp

1093
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,247
Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

1094
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:07,249
&nbsp

1095
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,049
Oh, I would, little girl.

1096
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:15,491
&nbsp

1097
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,957
Where'd they go?

1098
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:16,959
&nbsp

1099
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,826
There.

1100
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:18,828
&nbsp

1101
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:20,127
Stay here.

1102
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:20,129
&nbsp

1103
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:21,361
I'm not kidding.

1104
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:57,533
&nbsp

1105
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,266
Nice skirt, Top.

1106
00:24:59,276 --> 00:24:59,268
&nbsp

1107
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,101
Top.

1108
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:01,103
&nbsp

1109
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:02,703
I like it.

1110
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:02,705
&nbsp

1111
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:07,508
Because they spin, spin, spin.

1112
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:07,510
&nbsp

1113
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,076
What? What's happening?

1114
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,846
&nbsp

1115
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:12,913
Aah... aah!

1116
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:25,294
&nbsp

1117
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,360
I can't get my balance.

1118
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:26,362
&nbsp

1119
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:27,661
I know. It's okay.

1120
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:27,663
&nbsp

1121
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,096
You're gonna be okay.

1122
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:29,098
&nbsp

1123
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:30,030
But you won't.

1124
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,032
&nbsp

1125
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,032
Oh!

1126
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:32,034
&nbsp

1127
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,068
Good luck getting him out.

1128
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:35,070
&nbsp

1129
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,537
Barry!

1130
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:44,313
&nbsp

1131
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:45,746
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1132
00:25:45,756 --> 00:25:45,748
&nbsp

1133
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,314
I don't know, okay? I looked at Dillon,

1134
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:47,316
&nbsp

1135
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,882
- and I lost my balance.
- She's a meta-human

1136
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:48,884
&nbsp

1137
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:50,884
who induces vertigo.

1138
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:51,845
&nbsp

1139
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,311
She just whammied you.

1140
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:53,313
&nbsp

1141
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:54,779
Yeah, I guess so.

1142
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,781
&nbsp

1143
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,748
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1144
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:56,750
&nbsp

1145
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,818
Because now Barry's trapped
in there and it's because of me.

1146
00:25:59,828 --> 00:25:59,820
&nbsp

1147
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,052
Well, you know,

1148
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:01,054
&nbsp

1149
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,287
I...

1150
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:02,289
&nbsp

1151
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,888
I'll go talk to her.

1152
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:10,230
&nbsp

1153
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,463
What is he saying?

1154
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:11,465
&nbsp

1155
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:12,831
Is that some sort of mirror language?

1156
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:12,833
&nbsp

1157
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:15,500
Mirrors show objects in reverse.

1158
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,502
&nbsp

1159
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:17,035
Maybe that's what we're hearing here.

1160
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:17,037
&nbsp

1161
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,771
Only one way to find out.

1162
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:19,773
&nbsp

1163
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:21,172
What are you looking for, Cisco?

1164
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:21,174
&nbsp

1165
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:22,474
You ever seen "Twin Peaks"?

1166
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:22,476
&nbsp

1167
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,542
Of course not. Why do I ask?

1168
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:24,544
&nbsp

1169
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:26,711
This is an old backmasking trick

1170
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:26,713
&nbsp

1171
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:29,114
they used for the Man from Another Place,

1172
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:29,116
&nbsp

1173
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:30,915
where they record his audio backwards

1174
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:30,917
&nbsp

1175
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,083
and then play it forwards.

1176
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:32,085
&nbsp

1177
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:34,619
Like the Ozzy Osbourne records.

1178
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:34,621
&nbsp

1179
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:35,854
Sure, let's go with that.

1180
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:35,856
&nbsp

1181
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,422
Okay, Barry, say something.

1182
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:38,492
&nbsp

1183
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,557
Oops.

1184
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:39,559
&nbsp

1185
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:41,059
Say it again.

1186
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:41,061
&nbsp

1187
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:42,927
Um, get me out of here.

1188
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:42,929
&nbsp

1189
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:44,829
Now we can understand you.
How do we get him out of there?

1190
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:44,831
&nbsp

1191
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,431
Barry, have you tried to phase out yet?

1192
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:46,433
&nbsp

1193
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:47,899
Yes. It's not working.

1194
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,901
&nbsp

1195
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:49,801
If Scudder used this mirror as a wormhole,

1196
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:49,803
&nbsp

1197
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,337
then these molecules are in a
hyper state of flux, so all...

1198
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:52,339
&nbsp

1199
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:55,240
We need is something
really cold to slow them down.

1200
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,242
&nbsp

1201
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:57,342
I can help with that. Let's go.

1202
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:59,980
&nbsp

1203
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,880
Keep him company.

1204
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:09,322
&nbsp

1205
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:11,489
Aren't you gonna need that?

1206
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,826
&nbsp

1207
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:14,492
What's the point?

1208
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:14,494
&nbsp

1209
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,862
You know, I thought I was ready,
but clearly I'm not.

1210
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:17,864
&nbsp

1211
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:20,298
Jesse, you can't blame yourself for this.

1212
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:20,300
&nbsp

1213
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,668
- What happened to Barry...
- It was totally my fault.

1214
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:23,670
&nbsp

1215
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,037
I mean, he told me to stay back,
but I didn't listen, you know?

1216
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:26,039
&nbsp

1217
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,473
I just ran in blind, and...

1218
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:28,475
&nbsp

1219
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,875
and now he's stuck, so...

1220
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:30,877
&nbsp

1221
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,812
Look, you made a mistake. So what?

1222
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:33,814
&nbsp

1223
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:37,148
I mean, I'm sure Barry made
a lot of mistakes at first too.

1224
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:37,150
&nbsp

1225
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,317
Yeah.

1226
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:39,319
&nbsp

1227
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,952
Don't let this destroy your confidence.

1228
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:40,954
&nbsp

1229
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:42,220
You're meant to do this, Jesse.

1230
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,222
&nbsp

1231
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:46,124
You're meant to be a speedster.

1232
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:46,126
&nbsp

1233
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:49,894
That's why you have these powers
and I don't.

1234
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:49,896
&nbsp

1235
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,896
You're just trying to cheer me up.

1236
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:51,898
&nbsp

1237
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:54,065
I know you said
you don't want to hang, so...

1238
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:54,067
&nbsp

1239
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:58,303
No, I said I didn't want to
hang out because I was scared.

1240
00:27:58,313 --> 00:27:58,305
&nbsp

1241
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:02,173
Because you live on another Earth, but...

1242
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,944
&nbsp

1243
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:06,277
I realized I don't want
to be scared of that anymore.

1244
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:21,928
&nbsp

1245
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:23,595
I don't think it's gonna work.

1246
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:23,597
&nbsp

1247
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:24,896
What do you mean,
you don't think it's gonna work?

1248
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:24,898
&nbsp

1249
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:26,331
I built this to go to absolute zero.

1250
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:26,333
&nbsp

1251
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:27,899
I realize that. But we need the mirror

1252
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,901
&nbsp

1253
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:29,467
to maintain zero-point energy long enough

1254
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:29,469
&nbsp

1255
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,536
for Barry's molecules to pass through it.

1256
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:31,538
&nbsp

1257
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:33,238
Absolute zero's more
than cold enough to do that.

1258
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:33,240
&nbsp

1259
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,173
Normally, but we have to
account for the internal energy

1260
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:35,175
&nbsp

1261
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:36,975
of the mirror's molecules, as well.

1262
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:36,977
&nbsp

1263
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,611
So while absolute cold might be
the lowest possible temperature,

1264
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:39,613
&nbsp

1265
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:40,845
it's not the... It's not the lowest

1266
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:40,847
&nbsp

1267
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,414
- enthalpy state possible.
- Exactly right.

1268
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:43,416
&nbsp

1269
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:44,916
So what are we gonna do?

1270
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:44,918
&nbsp

1271
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,885
I don't know... yet.

1272
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:46,887
&nbsp

1273
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,119
Okay, go with me here.

1274
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:48,121
&nbsp

1275
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:49,921
What if we send this to the other Wells

1276
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:49,923
&nbsp

1277
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,055
and see if he can figure something out?

1278
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:51,057
&nbsp

1279
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,857
- Yeah.
- What? No.

1280
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:52,859
&nbsp

1281
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,492
What? Oh, everybody's
replaceable now, is that right?

1282
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:54,494
&nbsp

1283
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:56,294
- Is that what this is?
- What are you talking about?

1284
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:56,296
&nbsp

1285
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:58,229
What are you talking about?
That's what you said.

1286
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:58,231
&nbsp

1287
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,764
That's not what I said.
I'm saying we need to figure out

1288
00:28:59,774 --> 00:28:59,766
&nbsp

1289
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,599
a solution to this problem, and time's not

1290
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:01,601
&nbsp

1291
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:03,401
- on our side right now.
- That's not gonna help... you're

1292
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:03,403
&nbsp

1293
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:04,969
not contributing to the problem.
You're making things worse.

1294
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:04,971
&nbsp

1295
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,504
- You know what I think?
- What do you think?

1296
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:06,506
&nbsp

1297
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,072
I think you don't like the idea of someone

1298
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:08,074
&nbsp

1299
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:09,607
- taking your place here.
- What are you talking about?

1300
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:09,609
&nbsp

1301
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,042
This is why you don't like the other Wells.

1302
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:11,044
&nbsp

1303
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:12,544
What are you talking about? It was my idea.

1304
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:12,546
&nbsp

1305
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:14,045
But that doesn't mean you have to like it.

1306
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:14,047
&nbsp

1307
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,046
It's got nothing to do with liking, okay?

1308
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:15,048
&nbsp

1309
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:16,681
You know what it has to do with?

1310
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:16,683
&nbsp

1311
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:18,449
A molecular decelerator.
A molecular decelerator.

1312
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:18,451
&nbsp

1313
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,518
If we augment the molecular decelerator

1314
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:20,520
&nbsp

1315
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,353
- on the cryogenic generator...
- Of the cold gun...

1316
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:22,355
&nbsp

1317
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:25,223
I can build that. I can build that.

1318
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:25,225
&nbsp

1319
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:26,190
Great.

1320
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:34,768
&nbsp

1321
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:36,034
What are you doing?

1322
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:36,036
&nbsp

1323
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:37,936
Do these pants make my butt look big?

1324
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:37,938
&nbsp

1325
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,972
I'm literally stuck in a mirror.

1326
00:29:40,982 --> 00:29:40,974
&nbsp

1327
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:42,440
Sorry, yeah.

1328
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:48,682
&nbsp

1329
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:49,814
What's it like in there?

1330
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:49,816
&nbsp

1331
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:53,151
Um...

1332
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:53,153
&nbsp

1333
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,185
dark.

1334
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:56,022
&nbsp

1335
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:59,524
Look, Iris, I'm...

1336
00:29:59,534 --> 00:29:59,526
&nbsp

1337
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:03,394
I'm sorry that I'm... stuck right now.

1338
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:03,396
&nbsp

1339
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:04,829
Oh, honey, I know that you're stuck.

1340
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:04,831
&nbsp

1341
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,497
It's okay, we are gonna
get you out of there.

1342
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:06,499
&nbsp

1343
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,700
No, I mean... no.

1344
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,702
&nbsp

1345
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:09,901
That was misleading.

1346
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:09,903
&nbsp

1347
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:12,136
Not the mirror. I mean, with us.

1348
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:12,138
&nbsp

1349
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:16,040
This thing with Joe, and you were right.

1350
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,042
&nbsp

1351
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:17,709
I mean, it's not Joe.

1352
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:17,711
&nbsp

1353
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:18,810
It's me. It's my problem.

1354
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:18,812
&nbsp

1355
00:30:18,822 --> 00:30:21,179
I've just been feeling nervous

1356
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:21,181
&nbsp

1357
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,647
about this new dynamic

1358
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:22,649
&nbsp

1359
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:24,882
between the three of us.

1360
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:24,884
&nbsp

1361
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,618
I... I don't know.

1362
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:26,620
&nbsp

1363
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,255
I have everything that
I have ever wanted right now.

1364
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:31,257
&nbsp

1365
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:32,991
And I've never had that in my life.

1366
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:32,993
&nbsp

1367
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:36,027
In a lot of ways,

1368
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:36,029
&nbsp

1369
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,331
it's scarier than having nothing, because...

1370
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:40,333
&nbsp

1371
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:43,968
it's easier to fail than succeed.

1372
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:43,970
&nbsp

1373
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,870
And I really want to succeed.

1374
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,643
&nbsp

1375
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:53,011
What could you possibly be
laughing about right now?

1376
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:53,013
&nbsp

1377
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,545
I am so sorry, Barry.

1378
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:54,547
&nbsp

1379
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:55,813
You are really sweet.

1380
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:55,815
&nbsp

1381
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,249
But it is weird talking to you

1382
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:58,251
&nbsp

1383
00:30:58,261 --> 00:31:00,218
through a mirror and a speaker,

1384
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:00,220
&nbsp

1385
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,354
and I really want to kiss you right now.

1386
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:03,356
&nbsp

1387
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:06,924
But can we please talk about this later?

1388
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:06,926
&nbsp

1389
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:10,061
Yeah. We can talk about it later.

1390
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:10,063
&nbsp

1391
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:12,630
Guess it is pretty weird.

1392
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,632
&nbsp

1393
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:15,133
It's like I'm here, but I'm not.

1394
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:19,906
&nbsp

1395
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,472
What?

1396
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:21,474
&nbsp

1397
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:24,075
I just thought of a way to stop Scudder.

1398
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:24,077
&nbsp

1399
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,309
What is that?

1400
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:25,311
&nbsp

1401
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:28,312
This is how we get him out of there.

1402
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:28,314
&nbsp

1403
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:30,548
All right. Let's do it.

1404
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,689
&nbsp

1405
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,688
Okay.

1406
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:39,159
&nbsp

1407
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,458
Try it now.

1408
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:44,030
&nbsp

1409
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,897
It's only negative 280 degrees Fahrenheit.

1410
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:45,899
&nbsp

1411
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:47,165
We got to get it colder somehow.

1412
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:47,167
&nbsp

1413
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:48,599
I thought you guys said this thing

1414
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:48,601
&nbsp

1415
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,634
could get him out of there.

1416
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:49,636
&nbsp

1417
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,069
Okay, this thing

1418
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,071
&nbsp

1419
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,071
is a highly advanced molecular decelerator

1420
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:53,073
&nbsp

1421
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,572
that's being powered by a cryo-engine,

1422
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:54,574
&nbsp

1423
00:31:54,584 --> 00:31:56,507
and we just kind of improvised
it in the last 30 minutes,

1424
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:56,509
&nbsp

1425
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,509
so let's just... just cut us
some slack, please?

1426
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:58,511
&nbsp

1427
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:01,045
Just keep trying, Barry.

1428
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:02,015
&nbsp

1429
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:03,114
Meta-human alert.

1430
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:03,116
&nbsp

1431
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:04,282
Oh, for God's sake.

1432
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:04,284
&nbsp

1433
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:05,516
If it's not one thing...

1434
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:05,518
&nbsp

1435
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:06,617
It's the other.

1436
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:06,619
&nbsp

1437
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:07,618
Hold on, Bar.

1438
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,456
&nbsp

1439
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,856
Guys?

1440
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:11,858
&nbsp

1441
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,891
Hello?

1442
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:42,578
&nbsp

1443
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,778
Central City Municipal Bank just got robbed.

1444
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:44,780
&nbsp

1445
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,779
Let me guess by who.

1446
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,449
&nbsp

1447
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:50,217
Guys.

1448
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:50,219
&nbsp

1449
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,818
- Barry.
- Hey.

1450
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:53,289
&nbsp

1451
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,589
- How?
- Let's figure it out later.

1452
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:55,591
&nbsp

1453
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,591
Right now we need to stop
Scudder and Dillon.

1454
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:57,593
&nbsp

1455
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,459
Okay, so... so what do we do?

1456
00:32:59,469 --> 00:32:59,461
&nbsp

1457
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:00,761
We're gonna use mirrors,

1458
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:00,763
&nbsp

1459
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,930
an old trick, and an old friend.

1460
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,970
&nbsp

1461
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,504
- Yeah?
- It's Snart.

1462
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:10,506
&nbsp

1463
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:13,407
I heard you were back in town.

1464
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:22,017
&nbsp

1465
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:25,185
- Snart?
- Scudder, Rosa.

1466
00:33:25,195 --> 00:33:25,187
&nbsp

1467
00:33:25,197 --> 00:33:26,587
Long time.

1468
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:26,589
&nbsp

1469
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,956
Not long enough.

1470
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:28,958
&nbsp

1471
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,024
Hang back.

1472
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:31,026
&nbsp

1473
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,326
This guy owes me.

1474
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:36,665
&nbsp

1475
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:40,100
So you called us.

1476
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,102
&nbsp

1477
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:41,235
The hell you want?

1478
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:41,237
&nbsp

1479
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,636
Same thing.

1480
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:42,638
&nbsp

1481
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:45,205
You two, gone.

1482
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:45,207
&nbsp

1483
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:47,374
Things have changed.

1484
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:47,376
&nbsp

1485
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:48,775
This is our town now.

1486
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:48,777
&nbsp

1487
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:51,178
- Is that right?
- Yeah, it is.

1488
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:56,185
&nbsp

1489
00:33:56,195 --> 00:33:57,884
And that little cold gun of yours

1490
00:33:57,894 --> 00:33:57,886
&nbsp

1491
00:33:57,896 --> 00:33:59,920
isn't gonna save you from me.

1492
00:33:59,930 --> 00:33:59,922
&nbsp

1493
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:02,122
We'll see about that, now, won't we?

1494
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:07,162
&nbsp

1495
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,528
Bang!

1496
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:09,365
&nbsp

1497
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:12,599
Funny thing about holograms.

1498
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:14,703
&nbsp

1499
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:16,903
They're just pale reflections
of the real deal.

1500
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:24,580
&nbsp

1501
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,313
Hello again.

1502
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:26,315
&nbsp

1503
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,248
Jesse Quick.

1504
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:28,250
&nbsp

1505
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,818
Quick to run, quick to fall.

1506
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:46,268
&nbsp

1507
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,434
Quick to learn.

1508
00:34:47,444 --> 00:35:06,755
&nbsp

1509
00:35:06,765 --> 00:35:08,155
Uh-oh.

1510
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:09,158
&nbsp

1511
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,457
Well played, Flash.

1512
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,394
&nbsp

1513
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:15,062
Oh.

1514
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,064
&nbsp

1515
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:17,464
- What?
- I know, right?

1516
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:17,466
&nbsp

1517
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:19,866
This is the, uh, Droste effect.

1518
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:19,868
&nbsp

1519
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:21,068
I'm sure you've heard of it, right?

1520
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:21,070
&nbsp

1521
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,670
It's an infinite reflective loop

1522
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:23,672
&nbsp

1523
00:35:23,682 --> 00:35:26,039
that even you can't escape.

1524
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,011
&nbsp

1525
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:30,477
Good luck getting out.

1526
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:40,983
&nbsp

1527
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:42,382
So you're sure he can't

1528
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:42,384
&nbsp

1529
00:35:42,394 --> 00:35:44,451
Mirror Master his way out of this cell?

1530
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:44,453
&nbsp

1531
00:35:44,463 --> 00:35:45,953
No, it's impossible.

1532
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:45,955
&nbsp

1533
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:47,221
Every inch has been modified

1534
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:47,223
&nbsp

1535
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,156
with an anti-reflective material.

1536
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:49,158
&nbsp

1537
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:52,126
Even Scudder's gonna forget what
he looks like after a while.

1538
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:52,128
&nbsp

1539
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:54,294
Well, I should go.

1540
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,764
&nbsp

1541
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:57,498
Hey. So, thank you for everything.

1542
00:35:57,508 --> 00:35:57,500
&nbsp

1543
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,066
Oh, no. Thank you.

1544
00:35:59,076 --> 00:35:59,068
&nbsp

1545
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:01,001
We got another bad meta
right where he belongs.

1546
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:01,003
&nbsp

1547
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:03,937
- Yep, all right.
- Hey, Joe.

1548
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:03,939
&nbsp

1549
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:06,073
We have an awful lot of IOUs.

1550
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:06,075
&nbsp

1551
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:07,875
Do you maybe want to grab
some dinner tonight?

1552
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:07,877
&nbsp

1553
00:36:07,887 --> 00:36:09,209
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

1554
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:09,211
&nbsp

1555
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:12,212
Yeah, I... well, I've got movie night

1556
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:12,214
&nbsp

1557
00:36:12,224 --> 00:36:14,047
with my kids tonight.

1558
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:14,049
&nbsp

1559
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,349
Rain check?

1560
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:15,351
&nbsp

1561
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,851
Yeah. Of course.

1562
00:36:17,861 --> 00:36:17,853
&nbsp

1563
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:20,621
Another time, then.

1564
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:24,460
&nbsp

1565
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,894
Yo. What was that about?

1566
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:26,896
&nbsp

1567
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,196
- Why didn't you just say yes?
- I don't know.

1568
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:29,198
&nbsp

1569
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,198
You're not the only one
that gets nervous around here.

1570
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:36,238
&nbsp

1571
00:36:36,248 --> 00:36:39,139
You guys, I've never vibed
across 18 dimensions before.

1572
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:39,141
&nbsp

1573
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:41,742
Just a little bit longer.

1574
00:36:41,752 --> 00:36:48,250
&nbsp

1575
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,652
Greetings, earthlings.

1576
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:53,289
&nbsp

1577
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,855
Just kidding. I don't really talk like that.

1578
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:54,857
&nbsp

1579
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,090
I've just always wanted to say that.

1580
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,092
&nbsp

1581
00:36:57,102 --> 00:36:59,259
Earthlings.

1582
00:36:59,269 --> 00:36:59,261
&nbsp

1583
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:01,562
Wells with a sense of humor. That's new.

1584
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:01,564
&nbsp

1585
00:37:01,574 --> 00:37:03,530
Hey, sharpshooter.

1586
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,202
&nbsp

1587
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,701
You.

1588
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:07,703
&nbsp

1589
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:11,305
You're... handsome.

1590
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:11,307
&nbsp

1591
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:13,407
I know.

1592
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:13,409
&nbsp

1593
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,042
I know.

1594
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:15,044
&nbsp

1595
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:16,877
- Likewise, I'm sure.
- Yeah.

1596
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:16,879
&nbsp

1597
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:18,912
Harrison.

1598
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:18,914
&nbsp

1599
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,080
Harrison.

1600
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,082
&nbsp

1601
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,481
You can call me HR.

1602
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:21,483
&nbsp

1603
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:23,617
HR it is.

1604
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:23,619
&nbsp

1605
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:26,186
This is the team, then. Um...

1606
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:26,188
&nbsp

1607
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:28,455
This is Cisco Ramon. He can do anything.

1608
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,559
&nbsp

1609
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:31,892
Okay.

1610
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:31,894
&nbsp

1611
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:33,594
This is Dr. Caitlin Snow.

1612
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:33,596
&nbsp

1613
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:34,494
She is brilliant.

1614
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:34,496
&nbsp

1615
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:36,063
- Hi.
- Single.

1616
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:36,065
&nbsp

1617
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:37,764
Don't... all right, that's my daughter.

1618
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:37,766
&nbsp

1619
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,032
You don't have to shake her hand.

1620
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:39,034
&nbsp

1621
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,434
That gentleman there is Wally West.

1622
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:40,436
&nbsp

1623
00:37:40,446 --> 00:37:42,636
This is Barry Allen, or as we call him

1624
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:42,638
&nbsp

1625
00:37:42,648 --> 00:37:44,471
on this Earth...

1626
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:44,473
&nbsp

1627
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:46,340
The Flash.

1628
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,645
&nbsp

1629
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:51,345
- Welcome to Earth-1.
- Thanks.

1630
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:51,347
&nbsp

1631
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:54,481
Earth-1, that's weird.

1632
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:54,483
&nbsp

1633
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,583
Okay, well, we don't have
to stand on ceremony.

1634
00:37:56,593 --> 00:37:56,585
&nbsp

1635
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:58,852
We don't have to go through all
the tears again, do we, gang?

1636
00:37:58,862 --> 00:37:58,854
&nbsp

1637
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:00,287
- Right?
- Well, did I...

1638
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:00,289
&nbsp

1639
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,788
did I cry last time you left?

1640
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:01,790
&nbsp

1641
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,590
- I was talking about myself.
- Oh, gotcha.

1642
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:03,592
&nbsp

1643
00:38:03,602 --> 00:38:05,425
Hey, listen.

1644
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:05,427
&nbsp

1645
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,661
Don't worry about it, okay?

1646
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:07,663
&nbsp

1647
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:09,396
There's only one Harry.

1648
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:14,803
&nbsp

1649
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:16,403
Oh, I wanted to tell you.

1650
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:16,405
&nbsp

1651
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:19,606
The molecular decelerator,
it wasn't working.

1652
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:19,608
&nbsp

1653
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:21,141
Okay, what does that mean?

1654
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:21,143
&nbsp

1655
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:23,310
It means that we did not
get Barry out of that mirror.

1656
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,312
&nbsp

1657
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,245
It wasn't us.

1658
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:25,247
&nbsp

1659
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:26,847
Then who did it?

1660
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:26,849
&nbsp

1661
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:29,716
You tell me.

1662
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:29,718
&nbsp

1663
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:31,184
- See you later.
- Yeah.

1664
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:33,155
&nbsp

1665
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,656
Earth-2's gonna have one hell
of a speedster protecting it.

1666
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:35,658
&nbsp

1667
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:37,424
Well, I did learn from the best.

1668
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:37,426
&nbsp

1669
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:39,426
If you ever need any help,
you know how to get back.

1670
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:39,428
&nbsp

1671
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:43,130
Yeah. Yeah, definitely, I'll be back.

1672
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,132
&nbsp

1673
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:44,765
All right.

1674
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:44,767
&nbsp

1675
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:47,434
Okay, you guys.

1676
00:38:47,444 --> 00:38:47,436
&nbsp

1677
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:48,802
Ready?

1678
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:48,804
&nbsp

1679
00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:50,437
Yeah, yeah.

1680
00:38:50,447 --> 00:38:50,439
&nbsp

1681
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:51,972
Okay, Cisco.

1682
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:51,974
&nbsp

1683
00:38:51,984 --> 00:38:54,341
Out with the old, in with the new.

1684
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:54,343
&nbsp

1685
00:38:54,353 --> 00:38:55,742
Aw.

1686
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:55,744
&nbsp

1687
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:57,477
You'll never be old to us, Harry.

1688
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:02,284
&nbsp

1689
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:03,550
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1690
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:03,552
&nbsp

1691
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:06,053
Okay, let's do this.

1692
00:39:06,063 --> 00:39:06,055
&nbsp

1693
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,154
Oh, one more thing.

1694
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:07,156
&nbsp

1695
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,889
While I'm gone, never, ever,

1696
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:08,891
&nbsp

1697
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:10,390
no matter what...

1698
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,795
&nbsp

1699
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:14,828
Oh, oh.

1700
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:14,830
&nbsp

1701
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,430
What... what was he gonna say?

1702
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:16,432
&nbsp

1703
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:19,833
And we're all like, "What was he gonna say?"

1704
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:19,835
&nbsp

1705
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:22,769
That's cool, though. I'm starving.

1706
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:22,771
&nbsp

1707
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:25,205
Do you guys have Big Belly Burger?

1708
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:25,207
&nbsp

1709
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,874
Some things never change.

1710
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:27,876
&nbsp

1711
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:28,975
Famished.

1712
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:30,713
&nbsp

1713
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:31,978
Did Barry say anything about

1714
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:31,980
&nbsp

1715
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,847
this embarrassing moment with Cecile?

1716
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:33,849
&nbsp

1717
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:34,815
- Mm-mm.
- Hey.

1718
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:34,817
&nbsp

1719
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

1720
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:36,518
&nbsp

1721
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,719
How did your first meeting go
with the new Wells?

1722
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:38,721
&nbsp

1723
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:40,887
Uh, good.

1724
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:40,889
&nbsp

1725
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,789
Yeah, I think he'll work out fine.

1726
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:42,791
&nbsp

1727
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,524
Oh, good. I look forward to meeting him.

1728
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:44,526
&nbsp

1729
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,727
- Whoa.
- What?

1730
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:46,729
&nbsp

1731
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:47,694
I'm just kidding.

1732
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:49,198
&nbsp

1733
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,131
I got to be honest, it's gonna take a bit

1734
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:51,133
&nbsp

1735
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:52,165
for me to get used to that.

1736
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:52,167
&nbsp

1737
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:53,800
Um...

1738
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:53,802
&nbsp

1739
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:56,169
I actually have something
to run by you guys that

1740
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:56,171
&nbsp

1741
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:57,471
- I think might help with that.
- Really?

1742
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:57,473
&nbsp

1743
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:59,373
- Yeah.
- What up?

1744
00:39:59,383 --> 00:39:59,375
&nbsp

1745
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:01,908
Well, I've just been thinking
that maybe for all of us...

1746
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:01,910
&nbsp

1747
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,212
that I should probably, um...

1748
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:05,214
&nbsp

1749
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:07,280
get my own place.

1750
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:07,282
&nbsp

1751
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:08,515
- Really?
- Yeah.

1752
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:08,517
&nbsp

1753
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:10,183
What do you think?

1754
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:11,487
&nbsp

1755
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:13,854
- I say yes.
- I thought you'd never leave.

1756
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:13,856
&nbsp

1757
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,322
- Seriously?
- Dad.

1758
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:15,324
&nbsp

1759
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,490
- Wow.
- Look, Bar, come on.

1760
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:16,492
&nbsp

1761
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:17,591
I'm gonna miss you, but damn.

1762
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:17,593
&nbsp

1763
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:18,925
You grown. About time.

1764
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:18,927
&nbsp

1765
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:20,727
I can't tell if I'm leaving

1766
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:20,729
&nbsp

1767
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:22,195
or if I'm getting kicked out.

1768
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:22,197
&nbsp

1769
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:24,097
- You feel like you feel.
- Feel like I'm

1770
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:24,099
&nbsp

1771
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:25,599
- getting kicked out.
- I mean, yeah, I feel like

1772
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:25,601
&nbsp

1773
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:26,600
you're getting kicked out too.

1774
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:26,602
&nbsp

1775
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:27,634
Like, it's pretty obvious

1776
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:27,636
&nbsp

1777
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:29,069
you're getting kicked out.

1778
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:29,071
&nbsp

1779
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:30,137
Dad.

1780
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:30,139
&nbsp

1781
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,471
You're grown.

1782
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:31,473
&nbsp

1783
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,906
Oh, well. Cool.

1784
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:37,916
&nbsp
