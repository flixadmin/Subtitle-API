1
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,341
<i>"Will I always digress?</i>
<i>I think so.</i>

2
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,759
<i>Impossible not to.</i>

3
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,763
Ideas take hold of me.
I am a woman. I tell my story.

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,647
Consider my words.

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,819
See how little I misuse
the privileges this gives me."

6
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,361
<i>Start over from "I am a woman."</i>
<i>But first say it to yourself.</i>

7
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,364
<i>"I am a woman" is a truth.</i>

8
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,032
<i>Understand, Saïda?</i>

9
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>Start from there.</i>
<i>You tell your story.</i>

10
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,866
<i>It's a truth.</i>

11
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,587
"I am a woman.
And I tell my story.

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,210
Among the young men I attracted

13
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,170
was one I myself noticed.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,170
My gaze fell upon him
in particular.

15
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,096
I didn't realize
the pleasure I procured.

16
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,804
I flirted with others,
not with him.

17
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,310
I wanted to watch him,
not please him."

18
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,472
<i>Thank you, Saïda. Maëlisse?</i>

19
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:30,855
<i>"It seems</i>

20
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,438
first love begins
with this sincerity.

21
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,609
Perhaps its sweetness
curtails the desire to please.

22
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,610
In turn, he observed me

23
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,238
differently from other young men.

24
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,870
More reservedly,
yet more thoughtfully.

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,541
There was something more serious
between him and me.

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,665
Others welcomed my charms.

27
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,294
I felt at times
he was not indifferent to them,

28
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,545
but so confusedly,
I could not say what I thought of him

29
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,054
nor of myself."

30
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,425
"We left the church.
I remember walking slowly.

31
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,093
I reduced my pace.

32
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,637
I was sorry
to be leaving that place.

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:16,147
My heart was missing something,
but it did not know what it was.

34
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,321
I say it did not know.
Perhaps it did,

35
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:25,282
for as I left, I often turned around
to see the young man I left behind

36
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,867
without knowing
I did so for him."

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,451
What does it mean

38
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,288
that her heart
was missing something?

39
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,466
When you exchange glances,
when you cross paths

40
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,840
and you both exchange glances
spontaneously,

41
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,684
like with love at first sight,

42
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,356
is there something
less or more in your heart?

43
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,062
Eli...

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,483
Regret?

45
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,989
Regret about not speaking
to the person.

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,740
For you it's regret?

47
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,782
So regret is something less
in your heart.

48
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,286
Regret about not filling
the emptiness in your heart.

49
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,658
Thank you, Eli.

50
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,251
Let's stay on this passage
and compare it

51
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,170
to <i>The Princess of Clèves.</i>

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,046
Particularly when she first meets
the Duc de Nemours.

53
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,673
Furthermore,
I want you to think

54
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,845
about the idea of predestination
in their encounters, okay?

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,854
Which happens, for example,
with love at first sight.

56
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,777
Honestly,
if I can get laid, I will.

57
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,025
But I won't wait three months.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,236
Four days is all it takes.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,614
Who needs to wait
three months to get laid?

60
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,871
He seems a little wishy-washy.

61
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,326
A little?

62
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,366
He just sat there for an hour!

63
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,288
Just a second.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,370
Thomas keeps looking at you.

65
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,537
Behind me?

66
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,419
Look. He can't see.

67
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,670
He keeps staring.

68
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,086
Yeah, and it's not the first time.

69
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,096
He's totally into you.

70
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,843
- Never noticed?
- Come on!

71
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,645
Give me a break.
I've seen him do it.

72
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,481
It could be any of us.

73
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,070
He's sneaking a peak.
You can look.

74
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,447
I don't believe you.

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,573
- I'm sure you can.
- Can what?

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,030
What do you think?
Play cards?

77
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,039
It's obvious
you're both into each other.

78
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,624
He's cool.
It's totally possible.

79
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,922
Seriously, he's hung up on you.

80
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,633
You think you like him?

81
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,507
Sure, physically.

82
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,714
Yeah, he's cute.

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,382
More than just "yeah."

84
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,927
He's cute,
but he's not Brad Pitt.

85
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,520
Pretty close!

86
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,771
Honestly, he is.

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,898
Our choices at school suck.

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,650
Yeah, and then?

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,395
So he called and I told him off.

90
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,438
He's gone.

91
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,778
I swear, it is so in the bag!

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,373
Stop turning around, Amélie.

93
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,876
She is so heavy-handed.

94
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,792
I checked out his friend.

95
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,422
He's not bad either.

96
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,673
Hugo?

97
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,425
He is totally cute.

98
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,803
No more Vincent. It's Hugo now.

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,804
Vincent's with his sister.

100
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,469
He's so hot.

101
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,409
Can I have some more?

102
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,502
It's so good.

103
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,629
Some more?

104
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,064
Thank you.

105
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,478
What's up? Can I sit here?

106
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,687
If you want to.

107
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,323
This weather sucks.

108
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,032
It's crazy.

109
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,620
What's the book?

110
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,625
Marivaux's
<i>Life of Marianne.</i>

111
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,538
We have to do
a presentation on it.

112
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,458
- Interesting?
- It's amazing.

113
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,132
- You're a junior?
- Yeah, and you?

114
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,135
Senior. In science.

115
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:21,974
Like it?

116
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,511
It's not that I like it.

117
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,350
I'm just good in math.

118
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,974
And after high school?

119
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,480
I'd like to work in music.

120
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,610
Start a record label.

121
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,606
Discover artists,
start a production company.

122
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,741
And do you --

123
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,370
- You play, or just want to produce?
- I play too.

124
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,495
What?

125
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,076
I play percussion...

126
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,999
guitar, piano.

127
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,952
I'm not a pro, but --

128
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,171
Where did you learn?

129
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,958
On my own. With videos.

130
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,134
By listening.

131
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,843
You play anything?

132
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,895
I'd like to, but I'd have
to start with music class.

133
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,183
It's not for me.

134
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,684
It's awful.

135
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,726
My mom made me go.
I hated it.

136
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,940
Turned me off for 10 years.

137
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,696
What do you listen to?

138
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,360
Everything.

139
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,196
I can get into reggae, gypsy music,

140
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,782
classical, dubstep.

141
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,496
Everything.

142
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,417
Only thing I really can't stand
is hard rock.

143
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,832
People with long hair
who scream.

144
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,543
No words, no melody --
not my thing.

145
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,679
It's annoying.
But everything else.

146
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,135
Oh, fuck.

147
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,010
Why?

148
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,057
Because...

149
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,553
my big thing is hard rock.

150
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,394
I mean it. It's no joke.

151
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm into the hard stuff.

152
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,487
Hard rock, hard metal.

153
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,484
You said it's lots of screaming.

154
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,827
You may not like my stuff.

155
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,453
I associate it with guys
with long hair who scream.

156
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,457
So I pass.

157
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,710
Maybe your stuff is different.

158
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,461
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,250
- I was kidding.
- You don't play it?

160
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,878
I was trying to fix things.

161
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,092
I couldn't.
I kept blabbering on.

162
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,054
You really think
they all have long hair?

163
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,183
Almost.

164
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,724
I don't play it, but it's not true.

165
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,435
But you don't play it?

166
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,934
I'll play you my stuff.

167
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,068
Yeah, cool. I'd like that.

168
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,233
That way we have
to get together again.

169
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,130
Sorry.

170
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,649
You okay?

171
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,059
Fine, and you?

172
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,822
- Sorry, I got held up.
- No problem.

173
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,324
The train was late.

174
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,405
Been waiting long?

175
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,828
What now?

176
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,412
You want to eat something?
A waffle, a crepe.

177
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,417
We can sit outside.

178
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,128
But a gyro instead.

179
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,221
You got me slaving away
this weekend.

180
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,388
Why?

181
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,433
<i>Life of Marianne.</i>

182
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,855
- You read it?
- I tried. I started.

183
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,860
And?

184
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,272
It's pretty tough. Slow-going.

185
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,444
You mean you don't like it?

186
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,275
Thick books like that...

187
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,573
they put me off.

188
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,157
I put down some short books
after two pages.

189
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,160
But how can anyone not like it?

190
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,623
I didn't say that.

191
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,706
It's all that...

192
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,922
that vocabulary,
the long sentences, the old stuff.

193
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,929
There's lots of description.

194
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,175
He explores sentiments
but gets under her skin.

195
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,927
Who knows?
Maybe you'll make me like it.

196
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,687
I'll try to read it all.

197
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,015
Ever read a book you liked?

198
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,267
Have you read a book you liked?

199
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,855
I never read a book!

200
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,646
You never finished
a book you liked?

201
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,278
Never?

202
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,864
There was one book I got into.

203
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,245
But I didn't read it alone.

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,871
What was it?

205
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,116
<i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

206
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,910
Choderlos de Laclos.

207
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,496
You learned that by heart.

208
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,462
Alone, I'd have missed out.

209
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,845
Maybe you'd have found
your own reasons for liking it.

210
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,183
He explained each chapter,
each letter, analyzed stuff.

211
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,344
It's a bunch of letters.

212
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,014
You don't find it a pain,
a teacher explaining it all?

213
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,057
It made it come to life.

214
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,070
I got into the double-dealing.
At one point he writes

215
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,572
to the "Marquise de Merqueuil."

216
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,532
He says he loves her,
but he's writing on a whore's back.

217
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,867
When you read every other line,

218
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,749
it's another letter,
but she doesn't know.

219
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,910
I'd never have gotten that.

220
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,379
That stuff goes over my head.

221
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,836
But in the end I got really into it.

222
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,967
I'm the opposite.

223
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,553
- You read a lot?
- I love to.

224
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,138
When a teacher makes me
overanalyze a book

225
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,384
or a text,

226
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,393
tying everything
into the author's life,

227
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,559
it closes off my imagination.
I don't like it.

228
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,570
But why <i>Marianne</i> in particular?

229
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,234
I was going to ask.

230
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,782
Why that one?

231
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,859
Finish and you'll see why.

232
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,323
I'll read it.

233
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,781
I swear I'll read
<i>Life of Marianne.</i>

234
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,209
Careful what you say.
It's 600 pages.

235
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,829
I'll read it.
I don't give a fuck.

236
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,713
You look like crap.

237
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,506
You didn't sleep?

238
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,419
You fucked. I smell it on you.

239
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,467
How did it go with Thomas?

240
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,048
Sleep with him?

241
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,177
That's not an answer.

242
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,436
I'm pregnant.

243
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,973
I'm pregnant.
We're tying the knot.

244
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,187
Sleep at his place?

245
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,020
- Details.
- There are none.

246
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,029
What did you two do?

247
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,690
Spent the afternoon together.

248
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,574
No afternoon fucks?

249
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,070
So you deny it.

250
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,412
What are you, a sex cop?

251
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,953
I want details.

252
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,956
It's obvious you fucked.
Why not say so?

253
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,837
I didn't or I'd say so.

254
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,506
You didn't sleep.
What did you do?

255
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,008
Go on, say it.

256
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,835
Come on.

257
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,171
Because it sucked?

258
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,299
I'd tell you, whatever happened.
I promise.

259
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:30,968
I don't buy it.

260
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,645
With her face, the smell on her --

261
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,647
I'm going in. And you?

262
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,100
We're coming.

263
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,610
I smell it from here.

264
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,025
You are so gross.

265
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,816
Since when is fucking a crime?

266
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,442
He's following her.

267
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,656
Straight to the bathroom!

268
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,009
Adèle?

269
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,095
Got a sec?

270
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,678
I feel like you're avoiding me.

271
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,351
I don't know, maybe...

272
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,564
you misunderstood,
or I went about it too fast.

273
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,446
In fact I like you a lot.

274
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,455
Nothing to say?

275
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,092
It wasn't good?

276
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,843
Yes.

277
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,654
It was great.

278
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,954
Say something.

279
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,427
I feel like I'm faking.

280
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,968
Faking everything.

281
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,426
If he's getting you
so worked up --

282
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,844
No, it's me.

283
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,980
He's not the problem.
I'm missing something.

284
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,563
I'm all messed up.
I'm crazy.

285
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,068
There's a reason.

286
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,817
You're not sad out of the blue.

287
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,532
There have to be reasons.

288
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,213
Come on,
stop torturing yourself.

289
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,439
I look like crap.

290
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,729
Come on, you're gorgeous.

291
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,614
- Stop.
- I mean it.

292
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,821
- Think I don't see myself?
- How can you?

293
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,363
My nose is running,
my hair's all oily.

294
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,952
My face is a mess.

295
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,622
Adds to your charm.

296
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,338
Thank God I have you.

297
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,423
You'll make him dump you.

298
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,632
Bastard.

299
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,637
I won't have to tell him.

300
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,342
If he sees me like this,
he'll say, "Beat it."

301
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,353
I'll answer,
"Okay. You sure?"

302
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,020
It's over.

303
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,726
All settled.

304
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,650
I'm sorry. I swear I am.

305
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,188
Students, take to the streets!

306
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,817
No to privatization!

307
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,943
No to job cuts!

308
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,657
No to austerity measures!

309
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,785
More money for education!

310
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,356
<i>From the city projects</i>
<i>to the faraway countryside</i>

311
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,988
<i>We're society's rejects,</i>
<i>always on the outside</i>

312
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,705
<i>We cannot find our place</i>
<i>We do not have the right face</i>

313
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,366
<i>Born without a silver spoon</i>
<i>inside a gilded cocoon</i>

314
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,204
<i>Got no home, got no job</i>
<i>Got no papers, we're the mob</i>

315
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,832
<i>They don't want us to unite</i>
<i>They've done it, all right</i>

316
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,629
<i>Their world is dog eat dog</i>
<i>In their machine we're a cog</i>

317
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,344
<i>Let's fix a new goal</i>
<i>Let's make their heads roll</i>

318
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,010
<i>We won't give up!</i>
<i>We won't give up!</i>

319
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,769
They look quadriplegic!

320
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,525
<i>"Little"is a word</i>
<i>that comes back over and over</i>

321
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,730
<i>in the play.</i>

322
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,116
<i>It's a word that stigmatizes</i>

323
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,652
childhood,
and powerlessness too.

324
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,077
Childhood is a time --
no longer for you --

325
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,329
when we're helpless.
Not big enough,

326
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,086
not mature enough,
not strong enough.

327
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,293
Antigone is still a child.

328
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,584
She's still little.
"Too little," as she says.

329
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,467
But she refuses to be little anymore.
Not that day.

330
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,799
It's the day she will say no.

331
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,810
The day she says no,
the day she dies.

332
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,387
What we have here

333
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,307
is a perfect example of tragedy.

334
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,521
Tragedy is the unavoidable.

335
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,819
It's what we cannot escape,

336
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,819
no matter what.

337
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,526
It concerns eternity.

338
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,698
It concerns what is timeless.

339
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,615
It concerns the mechanism,
the essence,

340
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:56,911
of humankind.

341
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,390
- You okay?
- And you?

342
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,597
I was bored stiff in French.

343
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,638
Got a light?

344
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,990
You okay? Not too cold?

345
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,196
We're fine.

346
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,199
Alice is cute.

347
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,659
She has a nice little ass.

348
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,798
Checking out her ass?

349
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,555
I just noticed it
when she walked by.

350
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,223
The kind of girl I like.
Something cool about her.

351
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,271
Don't be jealous.
You're cute too.

352
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,061
I'm not jealous.

353
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,275
You sure?

354
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,237
You know it anyway.

355
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,444
Know what?

356
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,284
That you're really cute.

357
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,246
You're one of the prettiest girls
in our grade.

358
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,664
It's true.

359
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,000
Surprised to hear me say it?

360
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,885
I like that mysterious side of yours.

361
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,222
I bet the guys love it.

362
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,219
Not really.

363
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,932
Anyway, I find you cute.

364
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,066
Thanks.

365
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,108
Even cuter than Alice.

366
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,028
Are you blushing?

367
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,661
Not at all.

368
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,291
You are too!

369
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,463
Let me see.

370
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,127
Am I?

371
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,987
It's freezing.

372
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,532
- I'm dying to skip English.
- Me too.

373
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,004
See you later?

374
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,330
Bye.

375
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,034
The drumstick?

376
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,570
I don't care.

377
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,620
Give me your plate.

378
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,214
I'll give you potatoes after.

379
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,342
What's wrong with it?

380
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,213
No idea.
It cooked long enough.

381
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,255
It's hard to take apart.

382
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,804
- Want some?
- Yes, please.

383
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,071
Give me your plate.

384
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,987
You seem out of it, Adèle.

385
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,491
Enjoy.

386
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,160
Want some?

387
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,404
Yes, please.

388
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:17,834
What?

389
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,758
You look like you had a great day.

390
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,802
I guess so.

391
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,464
It shows.

392
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,893
Not hungry?

393
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,315
I'd like some salad.

394
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,133
How are you?

395
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,803
And you?

396
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,460
Sorry, I didn't think...

397
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,337
that you'd get so hooked.

398
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,344
What happened
yesterday was just --

399
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,348
It happened
on the spur of the moment.

400
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,861
I didn't think
you'd make much of it.

401
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,869
Understand?

402
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,959
Nothing will change between us.
I won't tell anyone.

403
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,797
I'm sorry.

404
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,722
See you later.

405
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,771
Come here.

406
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,409
Can't she hear me?

407
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,088
Why did you ignore me?

408
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,462
What is it?

409
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,591
Nothing.

410
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,845
- Tell me what it is.
- Nothing.

411
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,430
- Talk to me.
- Let's go out.

412
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,530
What's up?

413
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,825
Adèle, my friends.

414
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,332
How are you?

415
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,750
Nice to see you.

416
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:27,960
You okay?

417
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,636
Come on and dance a little.

418
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,841
Want to dance?

419
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,018
I'll finish my drink first.

420
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,561
Let's all dance.

421
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,518
I'll watch you, then I'll come.

422
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,231
Promise?

423
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,409
Love has no gender.
Take whoever loves you.

424
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,279
Whatever makes you happy.
Who cares?

425
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,577
True love.

426
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,410
Even if we have to die tomorrow,
who cares?

427
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,564
How are you?
Looking for someone?

428
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,199
I'm meeting a friend.

429
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,405
Too bad.

430
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,989
Enjoy your evening.

431
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,038
First time here?

432
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,495
You seem lost.

433
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,246
I'd buy you a drink,
but you've got one.

434
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,457
Are you okay?

435
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,582
Yeah.

436
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,545
Talking to my cousin?

437
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,838
Your cousin?

438
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,848
Can I go?

439
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,478
Be my guest.

440
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,722
Be good.

441
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,860
Sophie, strawberry milk, please.

442
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,985
Why are you here all alone?

443
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,701
I don't know.

444
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,779
I came in here by chance.

445
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,704
By chance.

446
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,543
You're drinking a Bulldog.

447
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,874
Bull dyke beer.

448
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,714
I had no idea.

449
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,962
Sure is.

450
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,308
Taste this.

451
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,315
So?

452
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,147
You like it?

453
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,854
Honestly?

454
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,564
You won't be upset?

455
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,233
No, go ahead.

456
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,238
It's gross.

457
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,871
I love it.

458
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,747
Your type is rare here.

459
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,425
What's my type?

460
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,757
Your type...

461
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,846
I don't know, underage...

462
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,882
hanging out in bars at night.

463
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,357
How do you know I'm underage?

464
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,359
I can just tell.

465
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,277
Or else...

466
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,368
a straight girl who's a little

467
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,070
curious.

468
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,704
Like I said,
I came in here by chance.

469
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,461
No such thing as chance.

470
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,124
Think so?

471
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,134
What's your name?

472
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,016
Adèle.

473
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,601
Pretty name, Adèle.

474
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,648
Adèle means something in Arabic.
I think it means

475
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,483
sun.

476
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,768
Hope.

477
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,815
Love.

478
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,652
It means justice.

479
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,815
I was close.

480
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,316
Sun...

481
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,824
What's your name?

482
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,917
My name's Emma.

483
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,121
What do you do?

484
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,836
What do you think?

485
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,213
Hairdresser?

486
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,426
Fourth year of Fine Arts.

487
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,852
Fine Arts?

488
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,013
You like it?

489
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,269
Yeah, I do.

490
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,186
Why is it called Fine Arts?

491
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,446
Are there arts that are ugly?

492
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,450
No ugly arts. I mean...

493
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,494
some can be ugly.

494
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,865
But it's subjective.

495
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,202
Because there are also
Decorative Arts, Applied Arts.

496
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,211
There's no Ugly Arts school.

497
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,459
Why not?

498
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,712
That's a good point.

499
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,879
At the time of the Impressionists,

500
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,880
everyone who was rejected

501
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,554
from the Salon
for beautiful paintings

502
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,310
and everyone who was considered...

503
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,556
"ugly" went to the Salon of the...

504
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,723
Ugly.

505
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,269
Sort of the Salon of the Ugly.
The best artists.

506
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,903
You like painting?

507
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,697
I don't know much, but I like it.

508
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,403
What do you know?

509
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,360
Picasso.

510
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:01,779
And...

511
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:02,946
Picasso.

512
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,416
So you already know...

513
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,825
Picasso.

514
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,748
What do you do, Adèle?

515
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,963
I'm in school.

516
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,345
Oh yeah? What are you studying?

517
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,141
Literature.
I haven't graduated yet.

518
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,431
I'm in high school.
I'm doing French lit.

519
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,940
Okay, I see.

520
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,567
What's your favorite subject?

521
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,313
Depends on the teacher.

522
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,606
If the teacher inspires me,

523
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,526
I like it all.
I find it interesting.

524
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,322
It's a problem,
because my grades can vary.

525
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,575
They can drop
from 15 to 4 in a year.

526
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,167
From 15 to 4?

527
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,249
With you it's all or nothing.

528
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,087
But...

529
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,473
they don't vary in French,
because I love to read.

530
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,887
And languages too.

531
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,178
Because --

532
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,473
- In fact I love English.
- I'm lousy at English.

533
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,978
Really?

534
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,061
It's something I'd really like to --

535
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,192
I should take English classes.

536
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,858
My accent is shit.
It's horrible.

537
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,820
- I'm really good.
- Really?

538
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,904
Lucky you.

539
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,911
And since I love American movies,

540
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,215
now I can watch movies
without subtitles. It helps me.

541
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,042
What was that?

542
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,849
I can't remember.

543
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,135
Say it.

544
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,345
I love American movies.

545
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,850
Like what?

546
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,934
I love it all. Scorsese, Kubrick...

547
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,477
Hey, honey.

548
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,521
What're you up to?

549
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,815
Not saying hi to my cousin?

550
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,109
Cut it out.

551
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,029
How old is your cousin?

552
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,198
Allowed to be here?

553
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,959
Girls, show some respect.

554
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,707
We're going clubbing in Belgium.
Want to come?

555
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,338
- Good for you.
- What? You coming?

556
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,174
Come along with us, honey.

557
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,510
You can bring your cousin.

558
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,924
Hey, cousin...

559
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,928
She's cute!

560
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,232
We'll be waiting.

561
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:40,696
Five minutes!

562
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,201
What high school?

563
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,487
Pasteur.

564
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,740
Damn it, Emma!

565
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,995
I can't talk for five minutes!

566
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,697
What do I owe you?

567
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,194
It's paid for.

568
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,297
How did you do?

569
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,805
I flunked it big-time.
And I studied during break.

570
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,382
You cheated.

571
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,848
You were caught red-handed,
like an asshole.

572
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,532
- How are you?
- And you?

573
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,874
I was nearby.
I thought we'd have a drink.

574
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,875
Adèle, you know her?

575
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,683
See that tomboy?

576
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,057
Where are they going?

577
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,481
Can I move?

578
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,440
- Sure you can.
- Really?

579
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,894
No, stay like that.

580
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,282
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you can move.

581
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,120
Thanks.

582
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,781
Thanks for what?

583
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,325
Just thanks.

584
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,120
Embarrassed?

585
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,206
A little.

586
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,590
Really?

587
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,791
Yeah.

588
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,176
It doesn't make you happy?

589
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,588
It does.

590
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,590
Doesn't show.

591
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,886
I don't get sketched every day.

592
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,233
You often draw people you meet?

593
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,360
No, not often.

594
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,821
I just felt like it.

595
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,829
- My hair isn't a mess?
- It's pretty. Don't touch.

596
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,382
I rarely do portraits.

597
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,342
I pick a detail.

598
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,719
And I use it again after.

599
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,676
Differently.

600
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,181
It can be...

601
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,013
a skin fold by the lips

602
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,433
or an emotion in the eyes.

603
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,523
"The mysterious weakness
of man's face."

604
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,272
- Know that?
- I don't think so.

605
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,561
Sartre.

606
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,780
- Know him?
- Yeah, but I never heard that.

607
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,866
I tried his essays,
but I didn't understand.

608
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,207
I prefer his plays.
You know <i>Dirty Hands?</i>

609
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,417
- Like it?
- Love it.

610
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,702
Me too.

611
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,879
Try <i>Existentialism is a Humanism.</i>

612
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,590
Good introduction.

613
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,758
And not too hard.

614
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,970
The idea behind Sartre is that

615
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,214
existence precedes essence.

616
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,475
We're born, we exist...

617
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,886
and then define ourselves
by our actions.

618
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,555
It gives us a great responsibility.

619
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,898
I think I read it. I'm sure.

620
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,435
But I didn't understand.

621
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,239
Maybe I'm bad
at philosophy, but for me,

622
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,527
existence, essence
is like the chicken and the egg.

623
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,243
I don't think we can
ever know what came first.

624
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,866
You're funny.

625
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,044
None of that stuff matters much.

626
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,169
He started an intellectual revolution

627
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,547
that set an entire generation free.

628
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,296
He said we can choose our lives

629
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,510
without any higher principle.

630
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,559
I was big on Sartre in high school.

631
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,846
- Really?
- It did me good.

632
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,774
Especially in affirming

633
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,276
my freedom and my own values.

634
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,322
And the rigorousness
of his commitments.

635
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,900
I agree with it.

636
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,659
Sort of like Bob Marley.

637
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:04,867
Almost.

638
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,865
I'm not so sure of that.

639
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,753
I'm almost sure of that.
Their ideas are similar.

640
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,875
You know "Get Up, Stand Up"?

641
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,460
Yeah, I know it.

642
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,462
He's committed.

643
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,671
It's true.

644
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:18,710
Same as Sartre.

645
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,722
Philosopher, prophet --
same thing.

646
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,055
You can help me with philosophy,
because you seem --

647
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,937
Whenever you want.

648
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,064
I have to go.

649
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,905
I was supposed to meet Sabine
15 minutes ago.

650
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,490
Want to see?

651
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,079
You don't have to like it.

652
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,622
Yeah, I like it.

653
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,339
It's strange,
because it's me and it isn't.

654
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:01,504
It's a sketch.
It needs some work.

655
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,767
I'll give it to you.

656
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,522
Been with Sabine long?

657
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,816
It's been...

658
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,317
about two years.

659
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,777
Why?

660
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,775
I have to go.

661
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,195
What's your schedule like?

662
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,029
I'm studying for exams.

663
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,000
But maybe I can squeeze you in.

664
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,370
Yeah, I'll have time.

665
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,040
Here's my number.

666
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,134
Promise you'll call?

667
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,214
I swear.

668
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,748
See you soon.

669
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,037
Deal.

670
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,612
<i>Here she is. Speak of the devil.</i>

671
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,155
<i>A friend of yours.</i>

672
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,869
<i>Someone named Emma.</i>

673
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,076
<i>You're welcome. Good-bye.</i>

674
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,123
<i>Just checking</i>
<i>you gave me the right number.</i>

675
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,211
Think I'm avoiding you?

676
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,539
<i>I don't know.</i>

677
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,132
<i>Since I'm the weird</i>
<i>and imposing type.</i>

678
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,336
You think you're a certain type?

679
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,095
<i>Maybe.</i>

680
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,303
<i>The type who's over 18</i>
<i>and hangs out in gay bars.</i>

681
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,639
<i>I think we're pretty different.</i>

682
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,395
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

683
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,897
<i>You can't tell from one meeting.</i>

684
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,158
How are you?

685
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,322
And you?

686
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:45,959
Got a light?

687
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,087
Who was that girl who came?

688
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,254
With blue hair.

689
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,093
A little bit dykey.

690
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,262
- Whatever.
- Totally.

691
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,222
Blue hair doesn't mean dyke.

692
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,763
It's obvious she eats pussy.

693
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,435
Where did you meet?

694
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,641
I met her in a café.

695
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,021
In a café?

696
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,438
Not in a gay bar,
by chance, with Valentin?

697
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,782
He said you went out with him.

698
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,361
Why hang out there?

699
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,996
But I don't.

700
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,119
You didn't go with him?

701
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,708
He told us all.

702
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,870
I don't know why he said that.

703
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,254
Valentin!

704
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,626
You go to a gay bar with Adèle
the other night?

705
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,633
- Yeah, so what?
- Just asking.

706
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,720
You lied. It's not good.

707
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,601
I didn't lie. It's just that...

708
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,024
we were out walking,
and we had a drink, that's all.

709
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,895
- That was all.
- Just a drink in a gay bar.

710
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,654
- Okay, no problem.
- End of story.

711
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,407
We're just asking.

712
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,153
Why did she come meet you here?

713
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,117
Because we're friends.

714
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,198
Why don't we know her

715
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,036
if you're friends?

716
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,919
I only just met her.

717
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,955
You already eat her pussy?

718
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,045
- What bullshit.
- You're fast.

719
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,293
You were this close!

720
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,303
We were just talking.

721
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,680
Talk to friends like this?

722
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,599
You talk to me like this?

723
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,430
You blew me off and ran after her.

724
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,270
Is she the new woman in your life?

725
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,606
Fess up and tell us.

726
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,151
Nothing to fess up to.

727
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,533
She's a friend.
We were talking, so we were close.

728
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,944
What you're saying sounds phony.

729
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,080
I don't know.
It sounds phony because...

730
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,290
you're all grilling me.

731
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,746
Admit you eat pussy.

732
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,204
I don't care if you're a lesbo.
It's your life.

733
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,466
But you've slept naked
a few times in my bed.

734
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,001
That's harder.

735
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,090
- I'm a friend.
- I know.

736
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,508
I prefer to be clear.

737
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,967
So admit it.

738
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,178
I won't admit to what I'm not.

739
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,435
Give us a break, Adèle.

740
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,186
Some lesbo comes
and picks you up at school --

741
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,645
She's not a lesbo.

742
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,486
Don't deny it.
You can see it from a mile away.

743
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,692
You're a lesbo?

744
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,399
Fess up.

745
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,034
I don't care,
but keep me out of it.

746
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,991
You'll never eat my pussy.

747
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,622
I'd never touch you.
I'm no lesbian!

748
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:22,908
Chill out.

749
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,454
Don't tell me to chill.

750
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,836
She's talking crap.
I'm fighting back.

751
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,337
You're freaking out!

752
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:32,592
You're talking crap in front of everyone.
I'm not a lesbian!

753
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,377
Relax.

754
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,217
- You relax.
- We're talking.

755
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,380
Just fess up.

756
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,595
She jumped down my throat!

757
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,430
Relax. How old are you?

758
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:45,142
How old are you?
I'm not a lesbian. Are you stupid?

759
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,482
You see what's going on?

760
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,767
She's a whore.

761
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,354
She sleeps naked in my bed,
checks out my ass.

762
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,489
Cut the shit!

763
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,445
Whores like you
are into ass.

764
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,201
Does your bitch
have a blue pussy?

765
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:05,496
Fucking cunt!

766
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,790
Fucking lesbo!

767
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,252
Go eat pussy!

768
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,887
What the hell?

769
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:23,302
Why tell everyone we went to a gay bar?
Why the fuck did you do it?

770
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,596
It's not the end of the world.

771
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,856
It is! They all think
I'm a lesbian, that I eat pussy.

772
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,808
She thinks I check out her ass.

773
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,810
You said we'd ask calmly.

774
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,773
Don't look. Listen to me.

775
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,740
You're not talking.
You attacked her.

776
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,579
She attacked us.

777
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,919
She attacked physically.
But you did verbally.

778
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,080
- We asked nicely.
- You did not.

779
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,842
If I were a closeted fag,
I'd have done the same.

780
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,465
Come on, let's fight.

781
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,548
You'll never touch my pussy!

782
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,053
Dirty dyke!

783
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,684
Shut your face!

784
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:11,350
<i>He mentions "a pathological scruple."</i>
<i>What is that?</i>

785
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,902
<i>Does that mean gravity, for you?</i>

786
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,070
<i>Louis?</i>

787
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,822
<i>In stanza two, he says...</i>

788
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,284
<i>"The only vice of water</i>
<i>is gravity."</i>

789
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:26,239
He associates natural law,
the universal law of gravity,

790
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,162
with a vice, as if...

791
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,254
everything natural is perverted,
and vice versa.

792
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,959
It's sort of the opposite of...

793
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,128
Catholic conservatism,

794
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,924
which would say
that vice is not natural,

795
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,679
and you have to...

796
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,350
repress it, reject it.

797
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,730
He says that

798
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,817
gravity itself is a vice.
It can't be avoided.

799
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,646
<i>It's totally intrinsic to water.</i>

800
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,610
<i>Adèle, what do you think?</i>

801
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,071
<i>About what Louis said.</i>

802
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,072
I agree.

803
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,959
<i>Are you following any of this?</i>

804
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,286
No.

805
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,511
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>a vice intrinsic to water. Gravity.</i>

806
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,345
<i>Start reading from "This vice..."</i>

807
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,846
<i>Page 62.</i>

808
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,242
Throwing away the skin?

809
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,653
Yeah, why?

810
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,867
You don't eat it?

811
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,451
I don't like it.

812
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,409
I love it. I eat all the skins.

813
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,795
Rinds too.

814
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,294
As a kid I even ate my scabs.

815
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,834
I loved them.

816
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,674
You're funny.

817
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,964
So you're really into eating.

818
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,179
You can't imagine.

819
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,300
I can see.

820
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,637
I eat everything.

821
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,481
I could eat nonstop all day.

822
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,313
It's scary.
Even when I'm full.

823
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,227
Everything but shellfish.

824
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,271
- Really?
- That's all.

825
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,277
That's what I like most.

826
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,658
It's beyond me.

827
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,945
I love oysters.

828
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,283
Really?

829
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,657
The texture alone grosses me out.

830
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,206
That's the best part.

831
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,921
They're like little snot balls.

832
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,626
Big snot balls.

833
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,500
They remind me of something else.

834
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,215
I don't want to know.

835
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,851
Something to say?

836
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,853
I don't know.

837
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,017
What?

838
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,942
I wanted to know

839
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,274
when was the first time

840
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,240
that you tasted --

841
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,034
Tasted a sausage?

842
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,574
Tasted a girl.

843
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,741
A girl?

844
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:43,504
You mean kiss?

845
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:44,663
Or taste?

846
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,250
Kiss.

847
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,006
To start with. Then we'll see.

848
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,889
I was fourteen.

849
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,680
Sometime around then.

850
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,680
There was a party.
All the girls had guys.

851
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,388
And I...

852
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,017
I went out with Louise.

853
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,481
That was her name.

854
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,405
We didn't kiss
during the party, but...

855
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,782
I asked her to sleep over.
That's when we kissed.

856
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,032
You've always preferred girls?

857
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,123
I tried both.
I dated boys, girls...

858
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,830
and I realized I preferred girls.

859
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,920
For sure.

860
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,408
It's nice being here.

861
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,454
A little too nice.

862
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,500
I guess so.

863
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,601
It's here.

864
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,149
Mom?

865
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,399
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

866
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,116
Adèle...

867
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,531
my mom, Catherine.

868
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,579
We've heard good things about you.

869
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,210
I'm glad to be here.

870
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,962
- For you.
- I'll take that.

871
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:39,877
Very nice, thank you.

872
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,667
Hi, honey.

873
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,043
How are you?

874
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:44,882
- And you?
- I'm fine.

875
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:47,718
- We've been waiting.
- What's to eat?

876
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,382
Your favorite.

877
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,057
Vincent, my stepdad.

878
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,607
The family cook.

879
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,269
We're having white.
Okay with you?

880
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,066
- Sure.
- White's fine.

881
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,488
White too?

882
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,241
Tell me what you think of it.
I like it.

883
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,867
Vincent's new pick.

884
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:12,077
We drank a lot
while we were waiting for you.

885
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,078
- Not that much.
- True.

886
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,409
We were reasonable.

887
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,417
But it's always nice
to cook with a glass of white.

888
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:21,047
My dad's the same.

889
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,461
Really?

890
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,256
Shall we toast?

891
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,341
To love.

892
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,348
Welcome, Adèle.

893
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,929
Big words. To love.

894
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,844
Yes, to love, my love.

895
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:34,936
To love, then.

896
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,109
How is it?

897
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,274
- Delicious.
- Very good.

898
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,363
Good, isn't it? I like it a lot.

899
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,621
Me too.
I don't know wine, but it's good.

900
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,705
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

901
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,370
Adèle...

902
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,254
I went and bought

903
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,299
the best I could find at Trière.

904
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,630
You know it?

905
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:07,551
Just by name.

906
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,884
- Help yourself.
- I'm fine.

907
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:13,934
Shit, I forgot to tell you
that Adèle...

908
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,554
doesn't like shellfish.

909
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:20,098
I'm so sorry.

910
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,146
No big deal.

911
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,687
Seafood isn't really my thing.

912
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,401
But don't worry.

913
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,566
A nightmare.
It's all we have.

914
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,442
You're a pain.

915
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,278
I go all out,
then you come and say...

916
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:34,663
"Adèle hates oysters."

917
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,373
I'll have other stuff.
The entree too? No problem.

918
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,785
- Even jumbo shrimp?
- Especially.

919
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,340
No biggie. Perfect occasion
to initiate her. It's fine.

920
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,879
Like at the school cafeteria.

921
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,882
You squeeze lemon on the oyster.

922
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:55,184
And usually,
if it's really good and fresh,

923
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:56,805
it moves.

924
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:58,937
That means...

925
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,346
it's good. See?

926
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,514
Look.

927
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,775
- It's moving.
- Why tell me this?

928
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,149
- It's alive.
- Exactly.

929
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,356
It has to be alive.

930
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,990
Don't eat it otherwise.

931
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,030
Alive is good.
You can eat the muscle too.

932
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,072
I'm fine.

933
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:18,789
Go on.

934
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:20,750
The juice too.

935
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:21,876
Well?

936
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:24,871
Well?

937
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,165
- Are you okay?
- It's good.

938
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,710
- You seem to enjoy it.
- It's good.

939
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,296
I'll try another.

940
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,713
Great.

941
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,008
These are excellent oysters.

942
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,313
You have beautiful paintings.

943
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,942
My ex-husband was an art lover.

944
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,196
Emma gets a lot of that
from her father.

945
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,606
Your ex loved art

946
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,366
but your new husband --

947
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:54,905
A lover as well.

948
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:58,033
But most of the paintings here --

949
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,580
Lover of what?

950
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,117
They come from her father.

951
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,249
A lover of food and wine.
That counts.

952
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,629
I agree.

953
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,755
And also...

954
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,044
culture.

955
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,423
Tell us about yourself.

956
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,927
We want to know about your life,

957
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,221
what you want to do.

958
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:19,968
I want to teach.

959
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,355
Nursery school. I love kids.

960
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,559
You love kids.

961
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,903
Have you always wanted to teach?

962
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,778
It's not that
I loved the school system,

963
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,277
but school means a lot to me.
It's taught me a lot.

964
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:40,410
It helped expose me to things

965
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,788
that my parents or friends
didn't show me.

966
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,286
I want to pass that on.

967
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,459
What do you need to do?

968
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,880
I'll get a masters
and then do teacher training.

969
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,718
That way I can start
by being an assistant teacher.

970
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,222
And honestly,
I don't see myself...

971
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,388
going to school
for 10 or 15 years

972
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:07,391
just to end up unemployed.

973
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,193
I want something concrete.

974
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:12,228
Does the job market scare you?

975
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,735
I sense it in what you say.

976
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:19,866
Maybe you'll go to school and see
that something else interests you.

977
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,331
For now it's what interests me.

978
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,992
At least you know
where you're going.

979
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,213
And that's important, I think.

980
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:04,799
Mom?

981
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:33,837
<i>Happy Birthday, my sincerest wishes</i>

982
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:39,089
<i>May these flowers bring you joy</i>

983
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:44,472
<i>May your year be sweet and carefree</i>

984
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:48,430
<i>And next year may we all meet again</i>

985
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,693
Happy 18th, Adèle!

986
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,656
Mom? Cheers.

987
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,011
- He's the king of bolognese.
- Hope you like it.

988
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,816
Help yourself.

989
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:01,609
Some wine?

990
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,103
Yes, please.

991
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:04,813
Nice to meet you, Emma.

992
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,607
We've heard about you for months.

993
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,533
Here you are at last.

994
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,368
It's great to...

995
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:15,031
to put a face
to everything you've said.

996
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,282
Really.

997
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,705
I'm the one who --

998
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,624
Thanks for having me.

999
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,501
It's our pleasure.

1000
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,220
Eat. It'll get cold.

1001
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:39,272
It's nice of you
to help her with philosophy.

1002
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,226
It's a really hard subject.

1003
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:46,020
She was having
a tough time, but now...

1004
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,405
it seems to be going well.

1005
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,651
Your grades are up.
Thanks to you.

1006
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,490
It's a pleasure for me.

1007
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:58,241
I wasn't going about it right.
She taught me...

1008
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,206
to make outlines.

1009
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:01,665
That's important.

1010
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:05,832
I don't know how
they can do that subject

1011
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,797
in just a year.
I don't see the point.

1012
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,678
You can't do it in depth.

1013
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:12,839
One year isn't enough.

1014
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,382
- Well?
- It's delicious.

1015
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,557
I knew it.

1016
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,303
So you're at Beaux-Arts.

1017
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,106
- It shows.
- Really?

1018
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,025
It's artistic.

1019
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,856
Not everyone likes it.

1020
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,607
It suits you well.

1021
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,282
Do you do it...

1022
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,659
yourself?

1023
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,074
Her stuff is great.
She's having a show.

1024
01:36:39,294 --> 01:36:40,329
Already?

1025
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,040
At the end of the year
we show our work.

1026
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,873
You have to let us know.
We'll come see.

1027
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:51,836
Living off painting
is pretty hard nowadays.

1028
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,383
It's difficult.

1029
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:57,888
The people who make
a living off it are all dead.

1030
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,017
It's true.

1031
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,896
I'm a graphic artist too.

1032
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:08,069
And it's easier these days
to live off graphic arts

1033
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,319
than off painting.

1034
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,652
There are openings in that.

1035
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,534
It's important
to have an artistic side.

1036
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:22,750
But you need a real job too.
To earn a living.

1037
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,082
So if things ever get bad,

1038
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,666
you make a living.

1039
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:34,132
Not to pry,
but your boyfriend --

1040
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,465
what does he do?

1041
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,425
He works in business.

1042
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:42,137
That's good. It's reassuring.

1043
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,733
That way you can do
your painting and he --

1044
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,981
If you want to be an artist,

1045
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:52,397
it's nice to have a husband
who pays the bills.

1046
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,204
We're not married.

1047
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,160
You have time.

1048
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:03,783
Take your time.

1049
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,667
- You never know.
- True!

1050
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,960
The pasta is delicious.

1051
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:13,918
Simple but...

1052
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:16,425
very good.

1053
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,439
My love.

1054
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:14,278
You scared me.
I thought you were going to scream.

1055
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:16,193
I was going to shriek.

1056
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,068
Good thing you didn't.

1057
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:30,161
You're beautiful.

1058
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,376
So soft.

1059
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:43,049
My mom thinks
you're sleeping in the bed there.

1060
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,221
On the cot.

1061
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,848
Enjoying philosophy?

1062
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,643
I love it.
It's incredibly enriching.

1063
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,861
Very deep.

1064
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,279
Very intense.

1065
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,899
Orgasm precedes essence...

1066
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,569
Your grade better be good.

1067
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:03,907
Give me a grade.

1068
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,116
Fourteen.

1069
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,412
Just fourteen?

1070
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,091
You still need some practice.

1071
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,927
I'll give it all I've got.

1072
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:53,270
<i>This time it must be the wolf.</i>

1073
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:56,937
"It's Mrs. Goat,
with my seven kids.

1074
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:59,981
Let us hide.
Have you heard the bad news?"

1075
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:02,981
The wolf is coming back!

1076
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,821
"Come inside,"
says Mr. Rabbit.

1077
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,826
Everyone sits down,
and suddenly --

1078
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,789
Knock, knock, knock.

1079
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:15,452
It's the wolf!

1080
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:17,248
It must be the wolf.

1081
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:18,503
Must be.

1082
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,415
"It's me, Little Lamb.

1083
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:22,424
I was down by the stream.

1084
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,052
But I cannot go home, because...

1085
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:27,679
the wolf is coming back!"

1086
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:32,177
"Come in," says Mr. Rabbit.
"Come sit by the fire."

1087
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:38,225
Little Lamb sits by the fire
when suddenly --

1088
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,780
Bang it.

1089
01:42:57,254 --> 01:42:58,334
Keep moving.

1090
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,254
Keep using your hands!

1091
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:06,589
Play your drums.
Don't stop.

1092
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:17,263
Keep on moving!

1093
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:39,831
You don't want to play?

1094
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,704
Want to stay here?

1095
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:42,959
Hey, you.

1096
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,374
Alone as usual.

1097
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:47,467
Best behaved.

1098
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:48,961
Always has been.

1099
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:54,554
What are you doing tonight?

1100
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:56,556
I don't know.

1101
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:58,478
We're going out for a drink.

1102
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:01,433
Sylvie, Quentin, Anabelle...

1103
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,941
Want to come?

1104
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,317
But tonight I have a family dinner.

1105
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:10,949
You have a lot
of family dinners.

1106
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,235
These days I do.

1107
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,913
Maybe after. Around what time?

1108
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:17,824
Are you avoiding us?

1109
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,666
Why do you say that?

1110
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:23,004
Whenever I suggest something,
you're busy.

1111
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,875
Just bad timing, that's all.

1112
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,005
Is your family far?

1113
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:32,342
No, pretty close.

1114
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,881
A few miles.

1115
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:39,679
Okay, then.

1116
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,644
I hope you'll be able

1117
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,188
to get free.

1118
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:47,937
I'll do my best.

1119
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:50,189
I swear I will.

1120
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,530
<i>It's gorgeous!</i>

1121
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:20,534
I've seen you on canvas.
Finally in flesh and blood.

1122
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:29,963
Congratulations!

1123
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:49,225
There's champagne.

1124
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,985
You made them?

1125
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:54,104
- Like it?
- Delicious.

1126
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:55,614
It's chicken inside?

1127
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,776
There's chicken,
tuna, and shrimp.

1128
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:05,867
- Good to see you.
- Same here. It's great.

1129
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:08,869
Soon.

1130
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,625
In two months I've gotten big.

1131
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:16,592
Come here.

1132
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:19,171
This is Lise.

1133
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,346
It's nice to see you.

1134
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,680
Want to touch it?

1135
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:26,345
Go on.

1136
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:28,514
- You don't mind?
- Not at all.

1137
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,479
- Feel it?
- Yes. Boy or girl?

1138
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:33,269
I don't want to know.

1139
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,358
To keep it a mystery?

1140
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:42,407
Does it hurt? Want to sit?

1141
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:43,699
- I'm fine.
- Sure?

1142
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,284
Playing with baby?

1143
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,538
- Is he the dad?
- Not at all.

1144
01:47:48,712 --> 01:47:50,168
You thought it was him?

1145
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:52,416
Not him.

1146
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,755
I'm sorry.

1147
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:55,503
He's an uncle.

1148
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:56,713
Exactly.

1149
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:00,717
What you do is really nice.

1150
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:02,638
What do I do?

1151
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:03,883
On the paintings.

1152
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,393
Your presence, your poses.
Stunning.

1153
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:07,769
Thanks. That's nice.

1154
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,929
It's normal.

1155
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:11,856
It's especially Emma
who did it all.

1156
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:12,933
Very powerful.

1157
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:15,189
Joachim, she writes very well.

1158
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:16,524
Really?

1159
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:19,322
Can I read your stuff sometime?

1160
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,734
For the time being,

1161
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,324
all I've written is my diary.

1162
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,658
She's shy.

1163
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,531
I want her to write more.

1164
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:28,950
I see you here

1165
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:31,876
with a desire to appear on canvas.

1166
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:35,126
Your writing must be wonderful.
I want to read it.

1167
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:37,507
Want a drink?

1168
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,259
- A glass.
- Champagne?

1169
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,761
And that painting?

1170
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,592
That last one is amazing.

1171
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,102
First of all,
thanks for being here.

1172
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:55,150
Thanks for being on time.

1173
01:48:57,781 --> 01:49:00,113
I'd especially like
to thank my muse,

1174
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:03,200
my source of inspiration
who makes me happy today --

1175
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:04,280
Adèle.

1176
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:06,904
Welcome, Adèle!

1177
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,918
I'd also like to say
she did all the cooking.

1178
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:18,298
Speech!

1179
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:20,959
It's your turn now.

1180
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:24,846
I'm really thrilled
to meet you all,

1181
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:26,803
and I hope you like it.

1182
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:29,601
Don't cry.

1183
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:30,807
Cheers.

1184
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,642
Let's have a toast.

1185
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:36,816
To Adèle!

1186
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:38,943
To Emma and Adèle!

1187
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:40,980
To love!

1188
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:50,580
She's in a trance!

1189
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,833
And not even drunk yet!

1190
01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:03,759
Anything else?

1191
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:05,675
Come sit down a little.

1192
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:07,009
Join us.

1193
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:15,897
What do you do?

1194
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:18,309
I teach nursery school.

1195
01:50:21,323 --> 01:50:22,438
And you?

1196
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:25,407
I'm doing a Ph.D.

1197
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,988
Both art history
and philosophy.

1198
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:31,322
I'm doing a Ph.D. on --
You know Egon Schiele?

1199
01:50:33,502 --> 01:50:35,584
- I told you about him.
- Maybe.

1200
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:36,667
He does nudes,

1201
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:40,005
emaciated,
in unlikely positions.

1202
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:44,051
I'm working on morbidity
in Schiele's oeuvre.

1203
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,926
Didn't you show her some stuff?

1204
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,215
Yeah, but I prefer Klimt.

1205
01:50:50,727 --> 01:50:52,638
Klimt is so --

1206
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:54,724
There's something so...

1207
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:57,059
florid... decorative.

1208
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,063
Florid and decorative?
You and I can't talk.

1209
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:03,483
You hate it
when people disagree.

1210
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:04,897
I like Schiele a lot.

1211
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:07,482
It's more twisted.

1212
01:51:07,953 --> 01:51:10,069
It's darker, more obscure.

1213
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:12,533
That's the reason I like Klimt.

1214
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,243
It's that --

1215
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,918
The problem
with that florid stuff --

1216
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,498
It's not florid.

1217
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:21,504
You can't say it's florid.

1218
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:26,752
I'm hungry!

1219
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,762
I'm starving.

1220
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:33,262
Some sauce too.

1221
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,101
Any Parmesan?

1222
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,269
Get in line.

1223
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:49,069
That's fine.
Perfect. Thank you.

1224
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:50,901
You're welcome.

1225
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:53,528
It's so good!

1226
01:51:55,334 --> 01:51:57,791
Adèle, it's out of this world!

1227
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:58,791
Thank you so much.

1228
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:00,373
You're welcome.

1229
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,290
- Good?
- Excellent.

1230
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:09,924
A worm crawls out
of a plate of spaghetti and says,

1231
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,422
"That was some gangbang!"

1232
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:13,886
How sweet!

1233
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,760
"Sweet" may not be the word.

1234
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,600
What a pleasure to share this.

1235
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:21,311
Our kind of pleasure.

1236
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,562
Can pleasure be shared?

1237
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:27,354
We each experience it differently.

1238
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:28,567
My pleasure

1239
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:30,531
isn't the same as yours.

1240
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,368
I don't get
the same pleasure as you.

1241
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:35,412
Find the Parmesan?

1242
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:38,119
...between the sexes,
a quality of pleasure

1243
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:39,620
so different

1244
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:41,831
that we attain differing realities.

1245
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,541
Over and above orgasm.

1246
01:52:44,132 --> 01:52:46,168
I'm curious.
Why do you think that?

1247
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:49,209
Because --

1248
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:50,714
We make faces?

1249
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,052
- We make more noise?
- Big difference!

1250
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,966
Something to drink?

1251
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,219
Every time I slept with a woman,

1252
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:00,929
I noticed something

1253
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,188
that's not --

1254
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:03,849
She enters another world.

1255
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,016
That's it.

1256
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:07,481
Orgasm is
an out-of-body experience.

1257
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:10,154
Our orgasm is limited.

1258
01:53:10,367 --> 01:53:12,858
For you,
female orgasm is mystical.

1259
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:15,027
I'm totally sure of it.

1260
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:17,199
Anyone need anything?

1261
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,784
Sit down.
You've been serving everyone.

1262
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,830
Here, eat.

1263
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:27,415
Relax a little.
You cooked for everyone.

1264
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:35,006
...insofar as I'm a man,
everything I glimpse is frustrated

1265
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:37,424
by the limits of male sexuality.

1266
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,890
Even though I've done it
with men and women.

1267
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:44,852
I remember the story of Tiresias,
who was lucky enough

1268
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:47,855
to be a man, then a woman,
then a man again.

1269
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,986
When he was asked

1270
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:53,027
who gets more pleasure,
man or woman,

1271
01:53:53,201 --> 01:53:54,782
he answered categorically

1272
01:53:55,203 --> 01:53:58,115
that women get nine times
more pleasure than men.

1273
01:53:58,999 --> 01:54:02,082
Ever since women
have been shown in paintings,

1274
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:06,871
their ecstasy is shown more than men's,
which is shown via woman.

1275
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:09,836
We see women bathing,
we see --

1276
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,716
<i>The Origin of the World.</i>

1277
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:14,424
Men try desperately
to depict it.

1278
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:16,842
Meaning they saw it.

1279
01:54:17,017 --> 01:54:19,258
- Or imagined it.
- Or wished for it.

1280
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,434
It could be their fantasy.

1281
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,598
- So it's based in --
- Look in their eyes.

1282
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,062
That gaze into another world.

1283
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,103
Art by women
never tackles female pleasure.

1284
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:32,691
Excellent pasta.

1285
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,072
Want some more?

1286
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,900
Yeah, I'd like a little.

1287
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:39,156
Not too spicy?
You like spicy?

1288
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:41,242
It's a little spicy.

1289
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:43,289
But just spicy enough.

1290
01:54:43,585 --> 01:54:45,541
You see, Emma, your paintings

1291
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:47,794
of Adèle seem to illustrate this.

1292
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,501
I know I'll never experience that,

1293
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:52,540
because I'll always be a man.

1294
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:57,133
I love the sauce.
Make it with fresh tomatoes?

1295
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:58,296
From the market.

1296
01:54:58,517 --> 01:54:59,723
I can tell.

1297
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,392
Had you ever posed before?

1298
01:55:06,525 --> 01:55:07,480
Never.

1299
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:09,141
It's your first time?

1300
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:10,650
I don't really pose.

1301
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:12,061
Just with Emma.

1302
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:15,522
You seem comfortable
in the paintings.

1303
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:18,859
Because they were
at times when I --

1304
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,110
I don't know.

1305
01:55:20,288 --> 01:55:22,950
I can't imagine doing it
with someone else.

1306
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:25,332
I know
it's a stupid question...

1307
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:28,118
but have you been
with girls for long?

1308
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:32,797
Is Emma the first,
or were there any before?

1309
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:34,504
She's the first.

1310
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,089
Is it different?

1311
01:55:40,225 --> 01:55:41,681
- From what?
- Guys.

1312
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,007
Yes.

1313
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:45,928
A little.

1314
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:49,931
Is it gentler?

1315
01:55:51,278 --> 01:55:52,643
It depends.

1316
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:54,610
I have no idea.

1317
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,779
Sorry to ask like this.

1318
01:55:57,576 --> 01:55:59,191
You don't have to answer.

1319
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:02,027
I don't think I could explain.

1320
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:04,954
What do you do?

1321
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:06,956
I teach nursery school.

1322
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,370
You like kids.

1323
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:11,916
Would you like to have some?

1324
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:17,543
What do you do?

1325
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,631
I'm an actor.

1326
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:21,046
I do action movies.

1327
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,222
I did an action movie,

1328
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:25,179
my first, in the States,

1329
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:28,390
that I got because I speak Arabic.
They dig that.

1330
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:29,972
The beard thing.

1331
01:56:30,275 --> 01:56:32,641
We were terrorists, hijackers.

1332
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:36,061
They love it when we say
<i>Allah al akbar.</i>

1333
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,854
So we did that.

1334
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,275
I'm serious.

1335
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,695
It was fun to see
how the Americans work.

1336
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:48,031
Where in the States?

1337
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:52,623
We shot it in a studio in L.A.

1338
01:56:53,465 --> 01:56:55,080
But it took place
in New York.

1339
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,590
They rebuilt the city.
It's wild.

1340
01:56:57,761 --> 01:57:01,253
It's like you're walking
down the streets of New York.

1341
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:04,180
Then I was
in New York on vacation.

1342
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:06,470
I really, really loved it.

1343
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:09,598
I'm sure
it's a city you'd adore.

1344
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,597
- I'm dying to go.
- Really?

1345
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:14,019
So go. Why wait?

1346
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:17,102
It's a total trip.

1347
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,110
It's amazing.

1348
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:21,235
It's like walking on a film set.

1349
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:22,448
I swear.

1350
01:57:22,661 --> 01:57:25,118
Such energy.
Everything seems possible.

1351
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:26,869
You can do whatever.

1352
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:29,072
Like there are no barriers.

1353
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:31,954
There's a huge bug on you.

1354
01:57:34,756 --> 01:57:35,541
What was it?

1355
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:36,663
I don't know.

1356
01:59:26,618 --> 01:59:28,028
What are you reading?

1357
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:31,945
A piece on Schiele, the guy
Lucie and I were talking about.

1358
01:59:35,251 --> 01:59:36,957
Your friends are nice.

1359
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,580
They're funny.

1360
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,962
They talk about so much stuff.

1361
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:43,418
They seem so knowledgeable.

1362
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,421
So cultured.
I felt uncomfortable.

1363
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:48,803
You were perfect.

1364
02:00:25,677 --> 02:00:27,588
You made a good impression.

1365
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,170
Especially on Joachim.

1366
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:32,137
Really?

1367
02:00:34,477 --> 02:00:35,887
What does he do?

1368
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:38,268
I was afraid to ask.

1369
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,983
- Biggest gallery owner in Lille.
- In Lille?

1370
02:00:43,319 --> 02:00:47,107
He's extremely cultured.
A genius. He knows everything.

1371
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:51,316
He shows only the crème de la crème.
Believe me...

1372
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:54,327
if he ever shows my work,
I've got it made.

1373
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:55,953
He'll show your work.

1374
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,156
- Think so?
- Of course.

1375
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:00,917
He talks about you
as if you were Picasso.

1376
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:03,544
It's business above all
for those guys.

1377
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:07,131
- He's your friend. Why wouldn't --
- My friend...

1378
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:10,339
Our relationship
is mostly professional.

1379
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,467
Not really a friendship.

1380
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,678
But he can change things.

1381
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:18,093
Just believe in it.

1382
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:19,852
Knock on wood.

1383
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:29,900
You should also do

1384
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:32,065
something you really like.

1385
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:34,446
I work.

1386
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:36,577
I know. I don't mean that.

1387
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:39,239
You write really well, for example.

1388
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:41,037
Why not write some stuff?

1389
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,709
Even short stories --

1390
02:01:43,922 --> 02:01:46,379
I've always just written for myself.

1391
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:50,042
It's a shame
to waste your talent like that.

1392
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:53,883
I write what I feel.
I can't expose my life to the world.

1393
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:56,256
You can invent rather than expose.

1394
02:01:56,392 --> 02:01:58,257
I don't know how.

1395
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:01,894
You love inventing stories
and telling them to kids.

1396
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:03,979
You like doing that.

1397
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:08,393
But for kids. Constructing
a storyline isn't my thing.

1398
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,353
Anyway, it's up to you.

1399
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:12,902
I don't know.

1400
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:15,112
I'd like you to be --

1401
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:18,403
- Be what?
- I don't know.

1402
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:20,196
Fulfilled.

1403
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:22,331
I am fulfilled with you.

1404
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:26,791
I like it that you're here,
cooking and stuff...

1405
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:29,418
but I'd like to see you happy.

1406
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:31,382
I am happy.

1407
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:34,590
I'm happy with you, like this.

1408
02:02:34,806 --> 02:02:36,512
It's my way of being happy.

1409
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:39,807
If you say so.

1410
02:02:41,563 --> 02:02:43,645
It hurts when you insist.

1411
02:02:43,815 --> 02:02:44,975
I'm not insisting.

1412
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:46,605
A little.

1413
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:57,359
Kiss me.

1414
02:03:01,165 --> 02:03:02,575
A real kiss.

1415
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:12,624
I want you.

1416
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:14,424
I can't.

1417
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:16,044
Why not?

1418
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:17,629
I'm having my period.

1419
02:03:19,434 --> 02:03:21,265
Why now?

1420
02:03:21,686 --> 02:03:23,642
I don't know. It happens.

1421
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:24,635
You're early.

1422
02:03:25,023 --> 02:03:27,560
What can I say?
I have no idea.

1423
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,191
Is Lise your ex?

1424
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:45,448
She paints too.

1425
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:49,669
<i>Monday is all gray.</i>

1426
02:03:49,839 --> 02:03:52,421
<i>Tuesday, yellow like hay.</i>

1427
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,459
Pink Wednesday,
stay home and play.

1428
02:03:55,637 --> 02:03:57,093
Blue Thursday

1429
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:58,423
comes our way.

1430
02:03:58,598 --> 02:04:00,680
Thursday green is next seen.

1431
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:04,141
Friday green!

1432
02:04:05,897 --> 02:04:07,012
Who's first?

1433
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:14,022
Sana, stand up.

1434
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:20,695
In the morning?

1435
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:24,029
We come to school.

1436
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:27,706
She's telling us
what we do during the day.

1437
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:29,492
Listen up.

1438
02:04:29,671 --> 02:04:32,458
Stop pinching, Maxence.
Come here.

1439
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:34,835
Go on, Sana.

1440
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,256
We play.

1441
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:42,472
After we get here, we play.

1442
02:04:43,393 --> 02:04:45,475
We do our activities. And then?

1443
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:47,931
We go outside for --

1444
02:04:48,356 --> 02:04:49,812
Recess.

1445
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:50,930
Then?

1446
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,932
We have gym.

1447
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:54,768
After gym?

1448
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:57,437
We take a nap,

1449
02:04:57,573 --> 02:05:01,157
and then we work
with Thérèse and Madame.

1450
02:05:19,971 --> 02:05:21,802
Time to stop talking.

1451
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:26,598
Do they have everything?

1452
02:05:26,769 --> 02:05:28,509
I had three dollies.

1453
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,832
I can watch them now.

1454
02:05:52,003 --> 02:05:53,368
- Really?
- Sure.

1455
02:05:53,546 --> 02:05:55,002
I'll meet you after.

1456
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,369
<i>One new message.</i>

1457
02:06:31,209 --> 02:06:32,324
<i>Honey, it's me.</i>

1458
02:06:32,502 --> 02:06:36,370
<i>I'm still with Lise, working</i>
<i>on the mock-up I mentioned.</i>

1459
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:40,002
<i>It's a big job,</i>
<i>and it has to be perfect.</i>

1460
02:06:40,676 --> 02:06:42,587
<i>Don't wait up. I'll be late.</i>

1461
02:06:42,762 --> 02:06:44,844
<i>Call if you want.</i>

1462
02:06:45,848 --> 02:06:47,008
<i>Take care.</i>

1463
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:12,135
It's hot.

1464
02:10:48,924 --> 02:10:53,088
What's his problem with me?
He has a thing with lesbians!

1465
02:10:54,305 --> 02:10:58,298
I'm happy to explain my paintings,
to say what inspired me,

1466
02:10:58,517 --> 02:11:01,429
but I can't get
into intimate details.

1467
02:11:01,937 --> 02:11:04,599
I don't have to justify who I am.

1468
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:07,516
There are things
I don't want to tell him!

1469
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:19,152
I can't sell myself.

1470
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,288
When I see someone
constantly needling me --

1471
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,032
He meant to put me down!

1472
02:11:25,169 --> 02:11:26,659
That's the thing.

1473
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:34,549
He has to respect my work.

1474
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:38,884
It's my freedom of expression,
my artistic freedom.

1475
02:11:39,058 --> 02:11:40,594
I can paint what I want!

1476
02:11:41,685 --> 02:11:43,516
You don't want some coffee?

1477
02:11:43,687 --> 02:11:45,097
Too bad if it's no.

1478
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,722
But he can't say,
"I'll buy your painting,

1479
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:50,312
but accentuate the line...

1480
02:11:50,986 --> 02:11:54,729
or make it blurrier here,
or use this or that color."

1481
02:11:55,157 --> 02:11:56,693
I'm not saying that.

1482
02:11:56,867 --> 02:11:58,573
I'm open to criticism.

1483
02:11:58,744 --> 02:12:00,484
I saw his questions coming.

1484
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:02,577
How can I answer that?

1485
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,830
Asshole.

1486
02:12:09,338 --> 02:12:10,828
Bread and butter?

1487
02:12:11,298 --> 02:12:14,085
It's crazy.
They don't understand anything.

1488
02:12:15,594 --> 02:12:19,007
There's a fad in painting.
You have to follow it.

1489
02:12:19,181 --> 02:12:20,671
I don't care about fads.

1490
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:21,839
Want one?

1491
02:12:22,893 --> 02:12:24,383
I don't give a shit.

1492
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:27,686
People only think
in terms of business.

1493
02:12:27,857 --> 02:12:32,021
They have no --
I don't know how to explain it --

1494
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:34,359
They have no taste.

1495
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,191
They just have no taste.

1496
02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:39,740
It's normal to be tense at times.

1497
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:42,360
I get tense with colleagues too.

1498
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:50,914
Did you put your pacifier
in the binky box?

1499
02:12:59,388 --> 02:13:00,878
Say good-bye to Mommy.

1500
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:03,843
Thank you. How nice.

1501
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:12,856
Hang up your coat.

1502
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:27,284
Luna, go find your name.

1503
02:13:31,295 --> 02:13:32,375
Friends?

1504
02:13:33,172 --> 02:13:35,629
I wore my pants.

1505
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:39,591
Did you wear your pants?

1506
02:13:39,762 --> 02:13:41,753
I wore this again.

1507
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:20,124
Thanks a lot.

1508
02:14:57,506 --> 02:14:58,712
Anything wrong?

1509
02:15:02,136 --> 02:15:03,251
I went out

1510
02:15:03,387 --> 02:15:05,048
for a drink with my coworkers.

1511
02:15:05,681 --> 02:15:07,546
After work.
Why didn't you call?

1512
02:15:09,685 --> 02:15:11,391
Did someone drop you off?

1513
02:15:16,025 --> 02:15:17,185
Who?

1514
02:15:18,485 --> 02:15:19,474
A girl from work.

1515
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:20,938
A girl?

1516
02:15:26,702 --> 02:15:29,364
Why'd she drop you off
down the street?

1517
02:15:31,165 --> 02:15:34,202
I didn't want to say
I went out with a girl.

1518
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:35,365
Really?

1519
02:15:35,919 --> 02:15:37,705
Why am I whispering?

1520
02:15:38,088 --> 02:15:40,204
You ashamed
to be with a girl?

1521
02:15:40,716 --> 02:15:43,173
No, but they don't all
need to know.

1522
02:15:43,344 --> 02:15:45,209
Afterwards they start blabbing.

1523
02:15:48,098 --> 02:15:49,963
You think I'm ashamed?

1524
02:15:53,145 --> 02:15:54,100
Who is he?

1525
02:15:54,647 --> 02:15:55,636
Who?

1526
02:15:55,898 --> 02:15:57,763
The guy who dropped you off.

1527
02:15:59,234 --> 02:16:00,223
Just a coworker.

1528
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,526
You think I'm stupid?

1529
02:16:04,615 --> 02:16:07,277
- Think I didn't see?
- He's a coworker, I swear.

1530
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:08,695
I saw him.

1531
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:10,401
We work together.

1532
02:16:10,579 --> 02:16:13,571
Come see.
He's a coworker in another class.

1533
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:17,081
How long have you been
seeing him?

1534
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:21,329
Since I started there.

1535
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:22,796
Really?

1536
02:16:25,177 --> 02:16:27,293
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not.

1537
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:29,423
So why are you crying?

1538
02:16:30,432 --> 02:16:31,797
I'm not crying.

1539
02:16:32,101 --> 02:16:33,637
Then why the tears?

1540
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,601
I'm tired.

1541
02:16:39,441 --> 02:16:42,228
I'm not dumb. How long
have you been sleeping with him?

1542
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:45,443
I'm not sleeping with him.

1543
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:48,314
How long have you been
lying to me?

1544
02:16:50,786 --> 02:16:52,617
I'm not sleeping with him.

1545
02:16:57,751 --> 02:16:59,833
We shared a drunken kiss once.

1546
02:17:00,129 --> 02:17:01,585
So why are you crying?

1547
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:02,915
I regret it.

1548
02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:03,878
I'm not dumb!

1549
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:05,459
- I swear.
- Don't lie!

1550
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:06,168
I swear.

1551
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:07,958
How long have you been
sleeping with him?

1552
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:10,468
How many times
have you slept with him?

1553
02:17:10,848 --> 02:17:12,054
Tell me!

1554
02:17:12,766 --> 02:17:15,132
How long have you been
lying to me?

1555
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:18,682
- Since when do you think I'm dumb?
- I've never thought that.

1556
02:17:18,939 --> 02:17:21,146
Get out of here! Get out.

1557
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:24,897
I don't want a liar here!
Pack your stuff and go.

1558
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:26,150
Get going.

1559
02:17:28,115 --> 02:17:29,400
Get lost!

1560
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:36,328
I slept with him two or three times.
I can't remember.

1561
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:38,496
Two or three times?

1562
02:17:38,667 --> 02:17:42,000
I didn't tell you because --
I don't know --

1563
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:45,541
I couldn't explain it.
I knew it was stupid.

1564
02:17:47,176 --> 02:17:49,167
I felt so alone.

1565
02:17:52,931 --> 02:17:54,421
Are you in love?

1566
02:17:54,933 --> 02:17:56,173
Of course not!

1567
02:17:56,351 --> 02:17:58,387
I just felt all alone.

1568
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:01,762
I never meant to hurt you.

1569
02:18:04,985 --> 02:18:06,020
Fuck.

1570
02:18:06,528 --> 02:18:07,688
I'm sorry.

1571
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:10,775
It's just that --

1572
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,690
Fuck this!

1573
02:18:15,412 --> 02:18:17,744
He's nothing, just a colleague.

1574
02:18:17,956 --> 02:18:20,038
It was a stupid mistake.

1575
02:18:26,006 --> 02:18:28,748
I swear I never meant
to hurt you.

1576
02:18:28,884 --> 02:18:30,465
I promise I didn't.

1577
02:18:30,636 --> 02:18:32,126
Adèle, stop.

1578
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:34,261
Wait.

1579
02:18:34,807 --> 02:18:36,172
You hurt me. It's done.

1580
02:18:37,226 --> 02:18:38,682
No, I swear.

1581
02:18:39,019 --> 02:18:41,431
It wasn't on purpose.
There's no reason.

1582
02:18:41,647 --> 02:18:43,228
You're a little slut.

1583
02:18:44,233 --> 02:18:45,473
Little whore.

1584
02:18:45,692 --> 02:18:47,353
You get fucked, right?

1585
02:18:48,278 --> 02:18:49,814
You like that.

1586
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,567
You suck him off in his car
and then kiss me?

1587
02:18:53,742 --> 02:18:55,232
You dare kiss me?

1588
02:18:56,036 --> 02:18:58,243
You dare touch me
and look at me?

1589
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:01,367
You do stuff like that?

1590
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:04,583
And then you lie,
you talk bullshit, you talk crap!

1591
02:19:04,753 --> 02:19:05,663
I'm sorry.

1592
02:19:05,838 --> 02:19:07,078
You're a slut!

1593
02:19:07,256 --> 02:19:09,747
I don't know
how to ask for forgiveness.

1594
02:19:10,175 --> 02:19:11,631
There is no forgiveness!

1595
02:19:11,802 --> 02:19:14,589
I never want
to see your face again!

1596
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,095
Pack your bags and get out!

1597
02:19:19,434 --> 02:19:20,970
Get out of my life!

1598
02:19:25,274 --> 02:19:27,515
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything.

1599
02:19:27,734 --> 02:19:29,270
Get out of here.

1600
02:19:29,444 --> 02:19:30,524
Stop it.

1601
02:19:31,488 --> 02:19:34,446
Get out of here now.
Out of my house.

1602
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:36,528
Pack up and get out.

1603
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:40,444
I don't want a slut, a whore!
Pack your stuff!

1604
02:19:40,622 --> 02:19:43,079
Let me talk.
He means nothing.

1605
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,205
I won't talk!

1606
02:19:44,334 --> 02:19:46,620
Get the hell out!

1607
02:19:46,753 --> 02:19:49,119
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.

1608
02:19:49,548 --> 02:19:50,663
Take your clothes.

1609
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:52,209
Let me explain.

1610
02:19:54,636 --> 02:19:55,546
Get lost!

1611
02:19:57,139 --> 02:19:59,130
I never want to see you again!

1612
02:20:00,434 --> 02:20:03,050
Never again.
Get out of my life!

1613
02:20:04,855 --> 02:20:06,891
Think you're the only one
who suffers?

1614
02:20:08,025 --> 02:20:10,186
It was nothing.
Just let me --

1615
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:12,480
It's too late!

1616
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:15,483
Take your stuff and get out.

1617
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:17,147
No sluts here!

1618
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:19,734
I didn't do anything!

1619
02:20:20,162 --> 02:20:22,073
Stop! I'm not an idiot!

1620
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:24,579
Don't do this.
Where do I go without you?

1621
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,456
Go see that guy!

1622
02:20:27,169 --> 02:20:29,000
I don't love him!

1623
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:31,745
It's you I love!
I can't go! What will I do?

1624
02:20:31,924 --> 02:20:34,290
What will I do?
I'm begging you!

1625
02:20:34,468 --> 02:20:36,333
Get out!

1626
02:20:44,895 --> 02:20:46,385
Open the door!

1627
02:20:51,068 --> 02:20:53,275
I'm sorry.
Let me talk to you.

1628
02:20:54,112 --> 02:20:55,101
I'm sorry.

1629
02:20:55,238 --> 02:20:56,978
You're just a whore!

1630
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:13,495
Leave now, Adèle!

1631
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,468
Did you pick these out?

1632
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:45,925
So pretty.

1633
02:22:46,224 --> 02:22:48,260
I have so many
I can make a garden.

1634
02:22:48,518 --> 02:22:50,725
It's really nice of you.

1635
02:22:50,979 --> 02:22:52,810
I can't even hold them all.

1636
02:22:53,315 --> 02:22:54,930
Bye-bye, Lili Rose.

1637
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:57,811
That was a great dance you did.

1638
02:22:58,153 --> 02:22:59,734
Bye-bye, Maxence.

1639
02:23:08,330 --> 02:23:09,536
Enjoy your summer.

1640
02:24:36,376 --> 02:24:37,582
Careful.

1641
02:24:45,177 --> 02:24:47,509
Not in the face or eyes.

1642
02:24:49,931 --> 02:24:52,422
If you get it in her eyes,
no swimming.

1643
02:25:27,427 --> 02:25:29,964
- How's it going?
- Fine.

1644
02:25:33,016 --> 02:25:35,052
Can you watch mine for a minute?

1645
02:25:35,227 --> 02:25:37,092
No problem at all.

1646
02:27:58,953 --> 02:28:01,319
Concentrate on our dictation.

1647
02:28:02,832 --> 02:28:05,164
No drawing on your slates!

1648
02:28:05,335 --> 02:28:07,542
"In the kitchen..."

1649
02:28:08,588 --> 02:28:10,328
Go on.

1650
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:16,126
"In the kitchen, Mommy..."

1651
02:28:21,643 --> 02:28:23,304
Start with a capital letter.

1652
02:28:24,270 --> 02:28:26,511
"...is peeling...

1653
02:28:30,276 --> 02:28:32,141
an onion."

1654
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:34,690
Eyes down.

1655
02:28:36,282 --> 02:28:38,944
No need to talk during dictation.

1656
02:28:39,452 --> 02:28:43,536
"In the kitchen, Mommy
is peeling an onion." Period.

1657
02:28:48,962 --> 02:28:52,295
"Laura is playing the violin."

1658
02:28:58,888 --> 02:29:00,344
Is there an O?

1659
02:29:00,765 --> 02:29:03,222
What vowel
is in the word "long"?

1660
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:05,179
Concentrate.

1661
02:29:06,604 --> 02:29:09,562
Say it again for her.

1662
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:19,364
Shemzeddine, quiet.
You think I enjoy this?

1663
02:29:27,584 --> 02:29:29,040
Ready?

1664
02:29:29,169 --> 02:29:32,036
If we're behind, it's your fault.

1665
02:29:33,506 --> 02:29:34,336
God bless you.

1666
02:29:34,507 --> 02:29:36,919
You're not concentrating.
You're distracted.

1667
02:29:37,093 --> 02:29:39,835
Dictation is taking an hour.

1668
02:29:40,013 --> 02:29:43,676
We could have done it in 15 minutes
and had time for fun.

1669
02:29:45,268 --> 02:29:48,476
Who sees mistakes in her sentence?
Are there any?

1670
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:52,268
"In kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1671
02:29:52,442 --> 02:29:54,148
You forgot the word "the."

1672
02:29:54,319 --> 02:29:57,937
It's not a big mistake.
You just weren't paying attention.

1673
02:29:58,948 --> 02:30:02,315
"In the kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1674
02:30:02,494 --> 02:30:04,075
How did you spell "onion"?

1675
02:30:05,914 --> 02:30:07,654
How did you spell it?

1676
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:09,326
It's like this.

1677
02:30:12,545 --> 02:30:14,456
Did anyone spell it right?

1678
02:30:15,298 --> 02:30:16,913
- Me.
- Really?

1679
02:30:18,468 --> 02:30:20,629
Who'll write the next sentence?

1680
02:30:20,929 --> 02:30:22,260
Go ahead, Renda.

1681
02:32:03,364 --> 02:32:04,604
How are you doing?

1682
02:32:23,926 --> 02:32:25,666
It's been too long.

1683
02:32:28,056 --> 02:32:29,296
Sit down.

1684
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:44,732
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah, sure.

1685
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:47,526
I got a glass of white.

1686
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,564
I see.

1687
02:32:48,743 --> 02:32:50,734
Taste it. I think you'll like it.

1688
02:32:51,746 --> 02:32:52,986
No thanks, I'm okay.

1689
02:32:53,164 --> 02:32:55,280
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm fine.

1690
02:32:55,708 --> 02:32:58,666
I called your stepdad.
He said you'd like it.

1691
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:02,003
What do you want?

1692
02:33:04,676 --> 02:33:06,166
I'll have a coffee.

1693
02:33:06,469 --> 02:33:08,676
Excuse me.
A coffee, please.

1694
02:33:15,436 --> 02:33:16,551
You doing well?

1695
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:18,932
I am. And you?
Are you okay?

1696
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:28,028
You have a new hairdo.

1697
02:33:31,494 --> 02:33:33,485
It makes me look old.

1698
02:33:34,163 --> 02:33:35,152
Not too much.

1699
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:37,117
You still look as young.

1700
02:33:37,583 --> 02:33:39,699
It's hard to lose these cheeks.

1701
02:33:40,253 --> 02:33:42,289
I wanted to look more ladylike.

1702
02:33:42,463 --> 02:33:46,456
I changed my hair to be taken
seriously. But apparently...

1703
02:33:46,759 --> 02:33:47,714
I was wrong.

1704
02:33:50,638 --> 02:33:51,753
It looks good.

1705
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,972
You know,
it happens faster than you think.

1706
02:33:55,601 --> 02:33:56,716
Really?

1707
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:05,642
I've never met anyone
who wanted to look older.

1708
02:34:08,197 --> 02:34:10,358
What about
your shows and stuff?

1709
02:34:10,533 --> 02:34:12,023
Is all that going well?

1710
02:34:12,201 --> 02:34:13,190
It's fine.

1711
02:34:14,162 --> 02:34:15,322
It's all fine.

1712
02:34:16,706 --> 02:34:17,616
Tell me.

1713
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,405
It's a little...

1714
02:34:20,334 --> 02:34:22,746
a little complicated to organize.

1715
02:34:22,962 --> 02:34:24,998
Press, journalists.

1716
02:34:25,631 --> 02:34:27,041
The price of success.

1717
02:34:27,175 --> 02:34:29,507
I see what your fans write
on your site.

1718
02:34:29,761 --> 02:34:31,376
Bunch of dykes.

1719
02:34:32,847 --> 02:34:34,587
Hey, you asked for it.

1720
02:34:41,022 --> 02:34:43,058
I saw your latest paintings.

1721
02:34:43,232 --> 02:34:44,347
Really?

1722
02:34:45,485 --> 02:34:48,101
You blow me away.
It's new, yet it's still you.

1723
02:34:48,279 --> 02:34:50,770
I'm lousy at explaining it.

1724
02:34:51,699 --> 02:34:53,860
I'll buy one
once I have some money.

1725
02:34:54,076 --> 02:34:56,283
Come on, I'll give you one.

1726
02:34:57,413 --> 02:34:58,869
I'll pay you.

1727
02:34:59,791 --> 02:35:00,997
Yes.

1728
02:35:01,334 --> 02:35:02,699
It's important for me.

1729
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:05,243
I can pay in flesh and blood.

1730
02:35:11,052 --> 02:35:13,213
It was a joke. A bad joke...

1731
02:35:13,387 --> 02:35:14,502
but a joke.

1732
02:35:15,014 --> 02:35:16,220
It was funny.

1733
02:35:18,893 --> 02:35:20,724
And you're doing well?

1734
02:35:21,646 --> 02:35:23,227
Still with my kids.

1735
02:35:23,606 --> 02:35:25,847
I have first-graders now. Older.

1736
02:35:27,026 --> 02:35:28,562
I'm a beginner, but...

1737
02:35:29,111 --> 02:35:31,523
it's great.
Them too, with their ABCs.

1738
02:35:33,407 --> 02:35:34,613
During school break,

1739
02:35:34,742 --> 02:35:38,030
I have a support group
for the ones with problems.

1740
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:39,702
They're my favorites.

1741
02:35:40,122 --> 02:35:41,908
Very special cases, but...

1742
02:35:42,375 --> 02:35:43,740
they're magical.

1743
02:35:44,377 --> 02:35:46,368
So gratifying
when you can help.

1744
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:48,870
I'm having a blast.

1745
02:35:49,090 --> 02:35:50,500
They put me to the test,

1746
02:35:50,675 --> 02:35:52,211
push my limits.

1747
02:35:52,343 --> 02:35:54,254
But it's fascinating.

1748
02:35:54,428 --> 02:35:55,884
It's what you wanted.

1749
02:35:56,764 --> 02:35:58,095
Yeah, I think.

1750
02:36:02,103 --> 02:36:03,138
That's good.

1751
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:04,518
Yeah, it's great.

1752
02:36:04,689 --> 02:36:07,772
But time-consuming.
I have no time for myself.

1753
02:36:08,192 --> 02:36:09,523
You don't go out?

1754
02:36:09,694 --> 02:36:11,901
I do, but with other teachers.

1755
02:36:12,321 --> 02:36:14,937
Nightclubs,
Vieux-Lille, restaurants.

1756
02:36:15,908 --> 02:36:17,068
But...

1757
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:20,447
I often go home alone.

1758
02:36:20,955 --> 02:36:22,536
I mean, I'm all alone.

1759
02:36:25,126 --> 02:36:26,957
And no boyfriend?

1760
02:36:29,964 --> 02:36:31,204
Girlfriend?

1761
02:36:36,345 --> 02:36:38,381
I had some stupid flings, but...

1762
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:40,096
nothing concrete.

1763
02:36:40,224 --> 02:36:42,215
Anyway, I have a hard time

1764
02:36:42,476 --> 02:36:43,966
getting attached.

1765
02:36:45,938 --> 02:36:47,803
I can understand.

1766
02:36:47,982 --> 02:36:50,143
It's not easy to be a couple.

1767
02:36:53,446 --> 02:36:56,438
You still with the girl
who was at our place?

1768
02:36:56,616 --> 02:36:57,651
Lise?

1769
02:37:02,622 --> 02:37:03,828
You happy?

1770
02:37:05,166 --> 02:37:06,372
Yeah.

1771
02:37:09,754 --> 02:37:11,335
That's good, then.

1772
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:15,464
Is she nice?

1773
02:37:15,635 --> 02:37:17,125
Yeah, she's nice.

1774
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:21,839
I can see her cooking for you
when you get home at night,

1775
02:37:22,016 --> 02:37:24,177
giving you flowers
in the morning.

1776
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,762
That's her style.

1777
02:37:27,313 --> 02:37:29,770
It's especially the kid, Aude...

1778
02:37:30,191 --> 02:37:31,522
that I like a lot.

1779
02:37:31,692 --> 02:37:33,182
Yeah, she has a kid.

1780
02:37:33,361 --> 02:37:34,851
She was very pregnant.

1781
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:37,941
- How old is she?
- Three.

1782
02:37:38,658 --> 02:37:41,695
I like her a lot. She's funny.
We get along great.

1783
02:37:42,036 --> 02:37:44,027
We clown around together.

1784
02:37:44,789 --> 02:37:46,199
I teach her a lot.

1785
02:37:47,166 --> 02:37:48,622
And Lise yells at us.

1786
02:37:48,793 --> 02:37:50,203
No way.

1787
02:37:51,045 --> 02:37:53,206
Two kids in the house is a lot.

1788
02:37:58,886 --> 02:38:00,751
It's my family.

1789
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:18,898
And sexually?

1790
02:38:20,741 --> 02:38:21,981
Do you enjoy it?

1791
02:38:28,499 --> 02:38:29,579
It's...

1792
02:38:32,461 --> 02:38:33,450
Lousy?

1793
02:38:34,213 --> 02:38:36,249
It's not lousy, but it's --

1794
02:38:37,508 --> 02:38:38,714
It's boring.

1795
02:38:40,261 --> 02:38:42,422
I don't know, Adèle.

1796
02:38:43,931 --> 02:38:45,671
It's not like with you.

1797
02:38:57,319 --> 02:38:58,684
I miss you.

1798
02:39:01,949 --> 02:39:03,940
I miss touching each other,

1799
02:39:04,285 --> 02:39:07,277
seeing each other,
breathing in each other's scent.

1800
02:39:19,300 --> 02:39:20,915
I want you.

1801
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:22,841
All the time.

1802
02:39:24,096 --> 02:39:25,927
No one else.

1803
02:39:30,311 --> 02:39:31,767
I miss everything.

1804
02:39:32,313 --> 02:39:34,929
But I have to say,
I miss this a lot.

1805
02:39:43,365 --> 02:39:44,946
Let me touch you.

1806
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:10,510
Stop.

1807
02:40:10,643 --> 02:40:13,680
Don't say you don't want to.
I don't believe it.

1808
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:16,808
I know you miss it too.

1809
02:40:22,029 --> 02:40:23,018
Touch.

1810
02:40:59,692 --> 02:41:00,772
Stop it.

1811
02:41:39,565 --> 02:41:41,021
I can't.

1812
02:41:46,363 --> 02:41:48,194
Forgive me. I don't know.

1813
02:41:48,866 --> 02:41:50,106
I don't know.

1814
02:41:53,579 --> 02:41:55,285
It's beyond my control.

1815
02:41:57,249 --> 02:41:58,785
You're forgiven.

1816
02:42:00,878 --> 02:42:02,743
You won't see me anymore?

1817
02:42:07,968 --> 02:42:09,048
No.

1818
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,555
You haven't forgiven me.

1819
02:42:23,651 --> 02:42:25,437
Yes, I have.

1820
02:42:33,994 --> 02:42:35,700
You don't love me anymore.

1821
02:42:58,352 --> 02:42:59,717
Are you sure?

1822
02:43:01,981 --> 02:43:03,187
Yes.

1823
02:43:10,698 --> 02:43:12,689
I'm with someone else now.

1824
02:43:16,704 --> 02:43:18,069
You know that.

1825
02:43:26,213 --> 02:43:28,829
But I feel an infinite
tenderness for you.

1826
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,125
I always will.

1827
02:43:34,346 --> 02:43:36,052
My whole life.

1828
02:44:00,247 --> 02:44:01,737
I'm sorry.

1829
02:44:03,042 --> 02:44:04,623
You know me.

1830
02:44:08,047 --> 02:44:10,083
Sometimes I cry for no reason.

1831
02:44:10,507 --> 02:44:12,543
Yeah, I know you
pretty damn well.

1832
02:44:18,307 --> 02:44:20,423
Happens to me every time.

1833
02:44:21,393 --> 02:44:22,508
I know.

1834
02:44:22,811 --> 02:44:24,642
You're always blubbering.

1835
02:44:29,610 --> 02:44:31,601
Leave whenever you want.

1836
02:44:31,779 --> 02:44:33,315
Yeah, right.

1837
02:44:34,656 --> 02:44:36,021
No, really.

1838
02:44:37,951 --> 02:44:39,691
I won't bother you again.

1839
02:44:41,997 --> 02:44:43,783
You're not bothering me.

1840
02:44:46,502 --> 02:44:47,787
Okay, I'm going.

1841
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:13,066
Get going.

1842
02:45:14,279 --> 02:45:16,110
Go on, beat it.

1843
02:46:36,945 --> 02:46:39,402
Alexandre, wake up.
You just got here.

1844
02:46:50,792 --> 02:46:53,283
"No Need" by Alain Bosquet.

1845
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:55,164
Take your time.

1846
02:46:55,339 --> 02:46:58,957
What's the hurry?
Pronounce so we all understand.

1847
02:46:59,343 --> 02:47:02,176
"No Need" by Alain Bosquet.

1848
02:47:02,429 --> 02:47:06,297
"The elephant's trunk

1849
02:47:06,433 --> 02:47:09,846
is for picking up pistachios.

1850
02:47:10,354 --> 02:47:13,266
No need to bend down."

1851
02:47:14,233 --> 02:47:16,565
Adam, can you continue?

1852
02:47:17,528 --> 02:47:19,143
You know where we are?

1853
02:47:19,863 --> 02:47:21,728
"The giraffe's neck is --"

1854
02:47:21,865 --> 02:47:24,732
Louder, please.
Start from the beginning.

1855
02:47:25,369 --> 02:47:28,953
"The giraffe's neck
is for grazing on the stars.

1856
02:47:29,122 --> 02:47:30,862
No need to fly."

1857
02:47:31,041 --> 02:47:32,121
Very good.

1858
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:34,699
Prune?

1859
02:47:35,045 --> 02:47:36,876
"The chameleon's skin,

1860
02:47:37,047 --> 02:47:39,083
green, blue, purple, white,

1861
02:47:39,258 --> 02:47:41,624
is for hiding from animals.

1862
02:47:41,885 --> 02:47:43,546
No need to run away."

1863
02:47:45,305 --> 02:47:46,385
Wassila?

1864
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:51,429
"The poem of the poet
is to say all this

1865
02:47:51,603 --> 02:47:54,390
and thousands and thousands
of other things.

1866
02:47:54,523 --> 02:47:56,138
No need to understand."

1867
02:49:23,695 --> 02:49:26,903
I can't believe she came.
It's been ages.

1868
02:49:33,705 --> 02:49:36,492
Myrième, exactly.
I haven't seen you in ages.

1869
02:49:37,584 --> 02:49:41,327
What a pretty dress.
I love the color blue.

1870
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:43,086
Thanks.
That's nice of you.

1871
02:49:43,215 --> 02:49:44,500
Can I ask you something?

1872
02:49:44,675 --> 02:49:47,587
My nephew, Nicolas Rouillard.
Ring a bell?

1873
02:49:47,803 --> 02:49:50,636
He said his teacher
was named Adèle. You?

1874
02:49:51,056 --> 02:49:53,217
Seriously. What's he like?

1875
02:49:53,392 --> 02:49:54,632
Adorable.

1876
02:49:55,102 --> 02:49:56,182
My sister's son.

1877
02:49:56,311 --> 02:49:59,394
I wanted you to give me
the scoop on him.

1878
02:49:59,523 --> 02:50:00,387
How funny.

1879
02:50:00,524 --> 02:50:02,856
Is he a good worker?
Really?

1880
02:50:03,193 --> 02:50:04,273
A sweetheart.

1881
02:50:07,447 --> 02:50:09,859
I'm going to go mingle.
We'll talk later.

1882
02:50:10,033 --> 02:50:11,273
See you.

1883
02:50:12,327 --> 02:50:13,442
Are you okay?

1884
02:50:14,246 --> 02:50:15,326
And you?

1885
02:50:16,081 --> 02:50:17,696
How did you get here?

1886
02:50:17,999 --> 02:50:19,455
By foot. I live nearby.

1887
02:50:20,794 --> 02:50:22,125
Nice neighborhood.

1888
02:50:25,132 --> 02:50:25,996
Welcome.

1889
02:50:27,050 --> 02:50:28,290
Thanks for inviting me.

1890
02:50:29,302 --> 02:50:30,462
It's normal.

1891
02:50:31,012 --> 02:50:34,220
So here are my paintings.

1892
02:50:34,725 --> 02:50:38,013
And behind you is a painter
named Adé Bernard.

1893
02:50:38,145 --> 02:50:39,134
Okay.

1894
02:50:42,107 --> 02:50:43,813
That one is awesome.

1895
02:50:45,652 --> 02:50:46,858
It's amazing.

1896
02:50:47,028 --> 02:50:47,938
Really.

1897
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:50,028
Everything.

1898
02:50:52,826 --> 02:50:54,817
Hello. How are you?

1899
02:50:55,579 --> 02:50:56,910
Remember me?

1900
02:50:57,372 --> 02:51:00,330
We love it,
but we have a few questions.

1901
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:02,331
That's why I'm here.

1902
02:51:03,170 --> 02:51:04,285
Excuse me.

1903
02:51:05,005 --> 02:51:07,917
I see old Emma, new Emma,
blue and red.

1904
02:51:08,091 --> 02:51:09,297
The life bearer.

1905
02:51:09,843 --> 02:51:11,754
She seems totally at peace,

1906
02:51:11,970 --> 02:51:16,259
yet there's something
troubling in her eyes.

1907
02:51:16,933 --> 02:51:19,800
I like it. I was wondering
what she's thinking.

1908
02:51:21,855 --> 02:51:24,517
There's an incipient
happiness, but also

1909
02:51:24,691 --> 02:51:26,056
a lot of anguish.

1910
02:51:27,152 --> 02:51:30,394
Her gaze is absent,
yet it seems to beckon us

1911
02:51:30,781 --> 02:51:32,396
amid all the colors.

1912
02:51:32,699 --> 02:51:33,688
I'll be right back.

1913
02:51:33,909 --> 02:51:35,365
We'll talk afterwards.

1914
02:51:35,911 --> 02:51:37,617
Sarah went to Beaux Arts too.

1915
02:51:38,997 --> 02:51:40,703
I love what you do.

1916
02:51:40,874 --> 02:51:44,617
I feel a passion,
a movement...

1917
02:51:45,086 --> 02:51:46,496
in the lines.

1918
02:51:46,713 --> 02:51:48,044
Too much talk.

1919
02:51:48,215 --> 02:51:50,001
What a pickup artist.

1920
02:51:55,222 --> 02:51:56,507
It's nice to see you.

1921
02:51:57,057 --> 02:51:58,513
How do you like it?

1922
02:52:00,435 --> 02:52:01,971
It's breathtaking.

1923
02:52:02,229 --> 02:52:04,390
And Joachim's showing her work.

1924
02:52:04,523 --> 02:52:08,061
When I got the invitation,
I thought of you both.

1925
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:10,021
She really wanted it.

1926
02:52:11,905 --> 02:52:13,441
It was perfect timing.

1927
02:52:13,824 --> 02:52:15,064
It's really good.

1928
02:52:17,953 --> 02:52:20,194
And you see... you're still here.

1929
02:52:26,628 --> 02:52:28,368
It's nice to see.

1930
02:52:30,757 --> 02:52:31,712
See you later.

1931
02:52:31,842 --> 02:52:33,048
Sure thing.

1932
02:53:07,127 --> 02:53:08,287
You doing okay?

1933
02:54:03,767 --> 02:54:04,847
How are you?

1934
02:54:05,018 --> 02:54:06,098
Yeah, great.

1935
02:54:06,853 --> 02:54:08,013
Good to see you.

1936
02:54:08,188 --> 02:54:09,177
Same here.

1937
02:54:12,108 --> 02:54:14,190
Are you still in movies?

1938
02:54:14,986 --> 02:54:16,317
Real estate now.

1939
02:54:17,572 --> 02:54:20,530
I'm still doing movies,
but very little.

1940
02:54:21,534 --> 02:54:24,697
I was sick of...
rubbing everyone the right way.

1941
02:54:24,871 --> 02:54:26,702
Ball-busting directors.

1942
02:54:27,874 --> 02:54:28,738
It was a pain.

1943
02:54:28,959 --> 02:54:31,245
Better to be a hypocritical salesman.

1944
02:54:32,837 --> 02:54:34,043
Like the show?

1945
02:54:34,589 --> 02:54:37,376
Not bad.
It's not really my thing.

1946
02:54:40,512 --> 02:54:42,218
You're still as beautiful.

1947
02:54:43,098 --> 02:54:44,053
Think so?

1948
02:54:44,224 --> 02:54:45,384
Even in real life.

1949
02:54:47,852 --> 02:54:49,763
That makes you laugh?

1950
02:54:50,063 --> 02:54:51,894
At least you're smiling again.

1951
02:54:55,485 --> 02:54:58,192
It's not that hard seeing Emma?

1952
02:54:58,571 --> 02:55:00,732
Things are settled between us.

1953
02:55:00,907 --> 02:55:02,522
As long as they're settled.

1954
02:55:08,498 --> 02:55:10,238
You ever get to New York?

1955
02:55:11,584 --> 02:55:12,790
Not yet.

1956
02:55:13,378 --> 02:55:14,743
Traveling opens your mind.

1957
02:55:15,588 --> 02:55:17,078
Yeah, I know.

1958
02:55:18,758 --> 02:55:20,168
Let me steal him.

1959
02:55:20,343 --> 02:55:21,958
Come on.
- One sec.

1960
02:55:43,116 --> 02:55:44,356
It was great.

1961
02:55:52,375 --> 02:55:53,956
I saw you in a movie.

1962
02:55:54,127 --> 02:55:56,118
Acting suited you.
- Really?
