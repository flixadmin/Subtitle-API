ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,218
Hurry! Get in!

3
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,057
Do you have a license?

4
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,192
- I passed the written.
- And the driving test?

5
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,148
Hold on tight.

6
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,090
Ji-su, I'm sorry.

7
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,395
I got you!

8
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,184
Mr. Han!

9
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,032
Mr. Han!

10
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,487
Shouldn't you go and help?

11
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,821
Why don't you go, then?

12
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,776
Why aren't you doing as we practiced?

13
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,286
Shut up, you freaking dog!
You're the same as your owner!

14
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,251
Move aside.

15
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,500
You'll get us all killed.

16
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,380
What was all that practice for, then?

17
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,672
Do you really want to live like this?

18
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,189
- Mr. Han...
- Go! I'm fine.

19
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,099
Hurry.

20
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,169
Die, you monster!

21
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,019
One, two...

22
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,830
If you were going to lock him up,
why did you save him?

23
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,051
Hyun-su...

24
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,300
Sorry.

25
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,385
We made things more difficult for you.

26
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,636
You can choose this time.

27
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,547
Thank you.

28
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,932
It's nothing.

29
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,978
It's not the time to be treating others.

30
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,689
You seemed to have a hard time breathing.

31
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,863
I'm fine.

32
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,012
Do you want to die, by any chance?

33
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,928
You might not have any desire to live,

34
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,140
but don't show that to everyone else

35
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,145
struggling to survive.

36
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,770
Why shouldn't I?

37
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,898
That's just manners.

38
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,074
Why would you care about manners
in a world like this?

39
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,656
Because we survived

40
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,946
in this world.

41
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,956
We should live more decently
as human beings.

42
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,143
You have asthma, right?

43
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,642
Are you going to die?

44
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,190
I've never thought of dying.

45
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,936
You can treat me.

46
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,903
Please.

47
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,251
Would you...

48
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,576
like some of mine?

49
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,035
No, it's fine.

50
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,933
These spoons aren't helpful at all.

51
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,600
You're right.
It'll be faster to just drink it.

52
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,860
Why do you keep staring at him like that?

53
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,360
I can't help it, you know.

54
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,501
Do you have anywhere else to go?

55
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,716
Sit down. You're distracting me.

56
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,064
That was a nice meal.

57
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,283
What's wrong with you two?

58
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,699
Everyone's uncomfortable around you.

59
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,701
Be comfortable alone at least.

60
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,622
Don't just sit there frowning
with that scary scarred face.

61
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,828
You're making me lose my appetite.

62
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,288
And why do you have
those scars on your arm?

63
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,093
I can't back down from a challenge.

64
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,680
What do you think? Do I scare you?

65
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,064
There wasn't a single healthy organ
inside my body.

66
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,275
The stupid doctor told me
I couldn't even last six months.

67
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,029
I made him look like a quack

68
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,448
by living until this age.

69
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,989
Should I tell you my secret?

70
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,619
My secret is eating well, you punks.

71
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,839
Just gobble up your food!

72
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,455
We're all struggling
to eat and survive, you know.

73
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,705
SECURITY OFFICE

74
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,348
Let me.

75
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,338
Come on, let's do it together.

76
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,304
Su-yeong, you promised to play with me.

77
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,217
Do you really want a scolding?

78
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,095
You're a liar, just like Dad!

79
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,603
Go away!

80
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,402
Su-yeong...

81
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,996
SKY

82
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,205
Play.

83
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,875
It's okay for kids to play.

84
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,758
Give me a gun instead.

85
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,546
Give me something for killing monsters.

86
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,225
Later, when you're older.

87
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,979
What if I die before that?

88
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,150
If I die, Yeong-su will die, too.

89
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,065
I'm all he has.

90
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,958
SHOWER ROOM RULES

91
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,262
Once every three days?

92
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,258
My skin will get all ruined.

93
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,472
What about my dream? It'll be ruined, too.

94
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,433
Damn it. Whatever.

95
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,746
ELECTRONICS

96
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,292
The water tank's been contaminated.

97
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,053
I thought it'd last 15 days
if we save water.

98
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,104
That's a disaster.
Water's most important right now.

99
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,009
You're right.

100
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,442
How's your leg?

101
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,850
This?

102
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,652
I don't know if it's okay
because I can't feel anything.

103
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,151
It could get infected,
so make sure to get it treated.

104
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,702
Okay.

105
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,198
What happened to your glasses?

106
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,333
Give it to me. I'll fix it.

107
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,381
I like it this way.

108
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,224
But why did you come here?

109
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,755
I think you should come to the basement.

110
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,565
Everything fine?

111
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,069
Right, well... What are you doing here?

112
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,279
Be careful.

113
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,832
I bet everyone will like this. It's...

114
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,583
What's this?

115
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,592
You said the basement's safe now.

116
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,667
Some people said they were waiting
for their packages, so...

117
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,300
You shouldn't do things alone.

118
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,097
Yes, that's why we came together...

119
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,529
HAN DU-SIK

120
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,948
Excuse me...

121
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,427
It'll withstand some weight.

122
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,757
If you strengthen the windows
and add weapons,

123
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,255
it could withstand monsters outside.

124
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,893
When can you finish it?

125
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,061
So you want it done soon, right?

126
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,730
Yes.

127
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,194
We have lots of people and no time.

128
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,485
At this rate, all of us will end up
dying in here.

129
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,373
We have to leave
before people start to panic.

130
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,714
Kim Ji-eun.

131
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,625
- Yes.
- Here.

132
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,008
This one is mine.

133
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,467
And this one is mine, too.

134
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,229
This is mine, too.

135
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,532
This is...

136
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,164
- mine again.
- How is everything yours?

137
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,569
Let me see.

138
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,238
Hey. It's not yours!

139
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,989
It's not yours!

140
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,578
Room 502, Nam Sang-won.

141
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,583
Who's Nam Sang-won?

142
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,423
It's Yi-kyung's dead fiancé.

143
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,306
YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR WEDDING

144
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,349
Where do you think she went?

145
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,391
She'll be okay, right?

146
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,325
Get out.

147
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,801
We called them "special infectees."

148
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,765
We had several,

149
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,268
but they all became monsters
or lost control and died.

150
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,943
The 15th day since the first symptom
was the toughest.

151
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,570
Was there anyone who lived past that?

152
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,451
There was one,
but he disappeared without a trace.

153
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,950
That boy you mentioned.

154
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,703
He better have survived
longer than 15 days.

155
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,533
LACK OF WATER AND FOOD

156
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,445
SEPARATE FOOD STORAGE

157
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,583
MOVE WITH MINIMUM NUMBER

158
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,139
Stop.

159
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,401
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if you ran away?

160
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,821
Give me my share!

161
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,994
Please stop.

162
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,411
Fuck! I can't trust anyone anymore!

163
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,240
Calm down. Let's talk.

164
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,333
You shit. Don't touch me.

165
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,909
I'm not going to die here like this.

166
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,210
I'm going to leave by myself.

167
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,674
You. Give me the car keys.

168
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,506
Give me the car keys, you asshole!

169
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,141
Give me the keys! You son of...

170
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,056
You...

171
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,113
Why don't you go out there then?

172
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,656
You don't know how it feels

173
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,042
to have your life in someone else's hands!

174
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,714
What are you doing?

175
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,040
Aren't you ashamed to face the kids?

176
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,089
What does age matter right now?

177
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,171
We're all going to die anyway!

178
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,222
No.

179
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,524
Not all of us.

180
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,400
People like you who act stupid
out of fear are the ones who die first.

181
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,700
Get a grip!

182
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,243
Take care of your own life.

183
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,804
We need...

184
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,550
to venture outside.

185
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,095
We only have five days' worth of food.

186
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,852
We'll search
the nearest convenience store first.

187
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,385
Isn't it too dangerous?

188
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,193
We made some preparations.

189
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,359
Mr. An scouted the area.

190
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,738
And Mr. Han is working on the car.

191
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,703
Hang on, four-eyes.

192
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,414
Who's going, then?

193
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,537
Are we drawing straws?

194
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,708
It's an important mission,

195
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,173
so the ones most likely
to succeed will go.

196
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,471
- Why me?
- You're in charge of the food.

197
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,020
And you're the one most likely to succeed.

198
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,898
Do you know what kind of person I am?

199
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,735
I don't care.

200
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,831
But...

201
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:00,786
have you ever saved

202
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,121
someone's life?

203
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,843
I deserved to be punched.

204
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,008
I'm sorry.

205
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,690
Me, too.

206
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:12,978
I'm sorry

207
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,028
I punched you.

208
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,122
You have better manners now.

209
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,127
Aren't you leaving?

210
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,496
I should finish this first.

211
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,590
I'm not getting better at drinking.

212
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,506
It's been a long time since I heard music.

213
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,135
It was abandoned in a corner somewhere.

214
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,893
What song was that?

215
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,437
I just improvised.

216
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,942
There are only four strings, anyway.

217
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,943
The melody was a bit dull, wasn't it?

218
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,614
I'd like

219
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,696
to hear the whole song.

220
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,121
Really?

221
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,083
Are you hurt?

222
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,579
It's nothing serious. I'm fine.

223
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,020
What?

224
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,855
This song.

225
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,317
It makes me feel like I'm home.

226
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,664
Thanks.

227
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,501
For what?

228
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,253
I didn't have

229
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,331
a title for this song.

230
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,838
But you just gave it one.

231
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,582
GREEN HOME MANSION APARTMENT

232
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,120
CHILDREN'S LIBRARY

233
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,411
Are you still not done?

234
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,405
Nope.

235
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,203
I need more time.

236
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,287
Hey.

237
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,801
Fuck. It's really urgent!

238
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,545
Oh, that's too bad.

239
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,050
You should've come yesterday
if it was so urgent.

240
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,965
Hey. Do you have a death wish?

241
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,555
What? I'm pooping to survive, you know.

242
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,563
Hey, Eun-yu.

243
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,516
Hey! Hurry up! Come on.

244
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,255
Hey.

245
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,602
Hey, what's wrong? Come on. Wake up.

246
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,561
Are you turning, too?

247
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,228
Because you couldn't poop?

248
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,651
Hey, wake up. Yoon Ji-su.

249
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,395
What's wrong? Wake up!

250
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,568
How long have you been hurting?

251
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,526
I'm fine.

252
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,332
Let's see if it hurts
when I remove my hand.

253
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,301
I think it's appendicitis.

254
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,841
Appendicitis?

255
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,052
- Your appendix.
- What do we do?

256
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,887
But how do you know?

257
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,522
He should know that much.

258
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,596
He got into medical school
when we were so poor.

259
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,646
What do we do?

260
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:48,991
She'll be okay.

261
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,950
The golden hour...

262
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,325
is running out for both sides.

263
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,335
If her appendix ruptures,
it'll become serious.

264
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,591
She could get an infection
in her peritoneum,

265
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,054
and bacteria could spread
throughout her entire body.

266
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,559
Then she needs surgery?

267
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,270
There's nothing we can do here.

268
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,061
I'm not that capable, either.

269
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,397
So?

270
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,486
Are you saying you won't do anything?

271
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,697
Just do something!

272
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,123
Do whatever you can.
I need to get revenge on her.

273
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,799
So I might die?

274
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,298
Yes.

275
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,763
There's a higher chance
of dying than surviving.

276
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,678
You still want to do it?

277
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,563
Yes.

278
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,851
If I don't, there's no chance
of surviving at all.

279
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,794
I'll perform the surgery.

280
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,619
I need anesthetics, antibiotics,

281
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,124
saline, and surgical instruments.

282
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,076
I'll go.

283
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,588
Are you trying to die?

284
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,887
You'll just be a burden in that state.

285
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,724
I'll go, too.

286
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,056
No, you will not.

287
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,556
There are dozens
of different surgical tools.

288
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,687
Unless you're going to bring
the whole hospital,

289
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,315
someone who knows what you need should go.

290
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,285
Help us.

291
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,077
God, she's heavy.

292
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,347
If things go south,
just go to the hospital.

293
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,233
Getting food is the subgoal.

294
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,818
Saving Ji-su is the main goal.

295
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,416
When did you start using swords?

296
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,760
It's been about 30 years.

297
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,886
I'm serious.

298
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,425
I grabbed a knife
at my first birthday ceremony.

299
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,685
You nearly made my appendix burst.

300
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,740
What did you pick at your ceremony?

301
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,531
I picked

302
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,497
the thread, for a long life.

303
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,420
That's nice.

304
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,538
The thread...

305
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,899
It's August 25th.

306
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,477
I was planning on killing myself today.

307
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,998
You're the new student, right?

308
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,159
Why are you just standing there?

309
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,342
I don't know how much more you need,
but take this.

310
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,760
No need to pay me back.

311
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,970
You're pretty arrogant.

312
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,379
What?

313
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,547
What did I do wrong back then?

314
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,719
Watch out!

315
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,442
Be careful, guys!

316
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,228
Sorry! Are you okay?

317
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,112
Are you okay?

318
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,572
If I hadn't held out my hand,

319
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,485
would my life have been
a little bit different?

320
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,793
I guess you don't know
why I'm doing this to you.

321
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,205
But I have a good reason for this.

322
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,338
You son of a bitch...

323
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,878
You look pretty angry.

324
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,804
I guess you weren't beaten enough.

325
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,008
KIM DO-HUN

326
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:50,926
Four-eyes.

327
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,852
You.

328
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,191
Yes, you.

329
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,814
It's your turn now.

330
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,862
But he looks...

331
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,527
Why?

332
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,199
Were you close with that jerk?

333
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,868
These guys all used
to be friends with him, too.

334
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,998
Don't do it if you don't want to.

335
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,746
I'm not forcing you.

336
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,126
By the way,

337
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,141
who were your friends again?

338
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,500
PARK JU-YEONG

339
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,302
I'm sorry...

340
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,966
You shit.

341
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,137
Oh, gosh. He looks so pitiful.

342
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,897
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,362
I'll tell you if you jump.

344
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,700
From now on, I'll kill anyone
who talks to Cha Hyun-su.

345
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,576
Why aren't your parents doing anything
when they know what you're going through?

346
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,918
Are they too busy?

347
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,549
Your dad works at my dad's company.

348
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,920
Should I get him fired?

349
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,183
I heard that people who get fired

350
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,929
at that age commit suicide a lot.

351
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,845
You asshole!

352
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,387
Do whatever you want to me, but
don't touch my dad, you son of a bitch!

353
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,983
You really know your place.

354
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,686
I'll tell you

355
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,358
why I'm doing this to you.

356
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,241
The day

357
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,405
you offered me those dirty coins,

358
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,996
the sky was so clear.

359
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,834
That's my reason.

360
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,423
Because the sky was so clear.

361
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,677
You're really something.

362
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,604
So you want to protect your family.

363
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,685
But

364
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,226
would your family do the same for you?

365
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,519
Forgive him.

366
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,277
I hated my father for that.

367
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,409
Your father is doing this
to protect our family.

368
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,908
You understand, right?

369
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,450
And I hated my mother for it, too.

370
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,452
Cha Hyun-su is my brother?

371
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,036
What stupid bitch said that?

372
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,002
Ji-yeon?

373
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,828
That's ridiculous. I don't have a brother!

374
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,253
I hated my sister, too.

375
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,842
After my father visited my school,

376
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,045
the bullying stopped.

377
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,717
But...

378
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,230
I couldn't live as my old self anymore.

379
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,265
That was

380
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,315
what upset me the most.

381
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,744
I'll give you money
for your mom's surgery.

382
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,656
Okay? Just run into the road
when a car comes.

383
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,094
You go instead.

384
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:01,967
My father was fired the next day.

385
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,269
Hyun-su, your friend's here.

386
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,233
It's your fault!

387
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,405
My mom died because of you.

388
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,124
I wanted

389
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,203
to become a decent person,

390
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,075
but there was nothing I could do...

391
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,343
but try to kill myself.

392
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,059
But today,

393
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,309
I'm leaving this place

394
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,686
to survive.

395
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,805
