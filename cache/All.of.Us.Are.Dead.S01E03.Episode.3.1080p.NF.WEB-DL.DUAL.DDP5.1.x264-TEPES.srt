1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,434
A virus, huh?

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,982
So you're telling me,

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,569
that this whole mess started with a virus
made by a high school science teacher?

4
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,908
This virus.

5
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,661
Tell me why?
Why would you do something like this?

6
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,495
Detective.

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,376
Do you have any kids?

8
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,386
Yes, sweetheart.

9
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,141
Yun-a.

10
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,269
Oh, no. Be careful.

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,564
You should watch where you're going.

12
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,569
<i>Could you let your child die?</i>

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,616
No parent on Earth could do that.

14
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,202
I don't wanna hear that bullshit.
Just answer the question.

15
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,306
What is the virus and how...

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,165
Jae-ik. Code red.

17
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,751
Chief needs everyone right now.
Come on, hurry.

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,628
It's too late.

19
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,715
We're all dead.

20
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,426
There's no hope for survival.

21
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,119
Oh, shit.

22
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,655
Cheong-san!

23
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,324
Look down. Down, down, down.

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,618
I know.

25
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,953
She's got your foot, moron. Look!

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
- I see that.
- Kick her off or something, idiot.

27
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm trying.

28
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,004
What the hell is it taking you so long?

29
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,553
Hey!

30
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,349
Hey. I'm coming down.

31
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,227
No, stay there.

32
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,229
No. I said, don't do it.

33
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,439
- I'm coming.
- Don't!

34
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,111
- Stay there.
- Oh, shit.

35
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,114
Hold on.

36
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,244
Hey, Bare-su, look up.

37
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,222
My back.

38
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,766
Just stay still. I'm helping.

39
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,270
What are you doing?

40
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,772
Hold on, moron.

41
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,781
- Guys, look, Bare-su. Bare-su!
- Cheong-san!

42
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,329
Hang on, Bare-su!

43
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,831
Are you okay?

44
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,543
Shit. Why can't you just kick her...

45
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,461
...like I said?

46
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,214
Hey. Stop hugging me.

47
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,009
I'm not hugging you.

48
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,179
Fuck off.

49
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,473
You like it?

50
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,038
- Are you okay?
- Close it.

51
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,106
Close it before they get in!

52
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,568
Would you just close it already?

53
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,504
What's wrong with you?
Cheong-san still out there.

54
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,946
You want us just to shut him out?

55
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,240
Is it a crime to want the window close?

56
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,825
How can you be so selfish?

57
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,328
I can't stand you, stupid welfie.

58
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,961
- What did you just call me?
- Hey, come on.

59
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,171
What's happening?

60
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,089
- You just hit me?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,716
Call me that again.

62
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,926
Hey, knock it off.
What's going on over here, guys?

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,303
He just hit me.

64
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,096
Only 'cause you called me a welfie.

65
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,974
- Is it not true?
- You just can't say shit like that.

66
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,892
What's a welfie?

67
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,478
Tell me.

68
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,188
What is it?

69
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,233
What's a welfie?

70
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,821
A person on welfare.

71
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,492
- What?
- It means, a person on welfare.

72
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,911
"Welfie" for short.

73
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,585
Na-yeon, that was wrong.
Don't ever say that again.

74
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,753
And Gyeong-su.

75
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,773
When you hit people,
you're the one who ends up losing.

76
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,299
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't.

77
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,278
Listen, we can't be fighting
each other in a moment like this.

78
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,988
We don't know what's going on
out there with those...

79
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,097
Are they zombies?

80
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,390
What about the other teachers?

81
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,059
Has anyone called the cops?

82
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,269
Don't worry, I'm sure someone already has.

83
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,039
I just don't have
my phone on me, right now.

84
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,898
We called them, but they're not coming.

85
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,567
Neither the police nor first responders.

86
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,362
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
We just have to wait a little longer.

87
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,115
Ms. Park. Hyeon-ju's hands were cold too.

88
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,033
So were I-sak's.

89
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,994
What if all of this started with Hyeon-ju?

90
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,746
She went to the hospital.

91
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,374
What if it spread in there as well?

92
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,497
Maybe that's why no one's coming.

93
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,587
But wait. They still work, right?

94
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,339
Uh, internet. The internet.

95
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,633
- Let's see. Sorry, Ms. Park.
- Oh.

96
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,436
- Here. Sit.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,138
It should work. Is it on?

98
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,305
I think so.

99
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,617
What's the problem?
Why is it not turning on?

100
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,059
- It just did.
- Oh, sorry.

101
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,562
School ones are so slow.

102
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,732
Maybe it's not online?

103
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,192
It must be.

104
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,795
It's gonna take all day.

105
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,112
Is it still loading?

106
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,173
- Su-hyeok, did you see it?
- I don't think it's working.

107
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,197
What?

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,366
In the science lab.

109
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,681
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE
BROADCASTING ROOM - NAM-RA

110
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,331
Well, I was actually in the art room.

111
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,421
What's in the science lab?

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,587
Uh, well...

113
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,430
It worked.

114
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,508
- Okay. Open the browser.
- The browser.

115
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,678
Look up "zombie virus."

116
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,240
- Yeah, "zombie virus."
- But...

117
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,742
- No. Try "Hyosan."
- See what's trending.

118
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,077
No.

119
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,996
- I'm checking the news first.
- Look up the emergence alerts.

120
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,330
- The news.
- There'll be no articles yet.

121
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,314
- Yeah, go to the news.
- What are we looking up?

122
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:06,943
See you later.

123
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,171
- Are you okay? Let me help you.
- Come on.

124
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,589
Stand up. Can you stand?

125
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,805
- Call an ambulance.
- Let's get out of the way first.

126
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,220
- See that?
- What's going on?

127
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,977
Sir, are you all right? Do you need help?

128
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,618
Oh, shit.

129
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,962
No. No, please!

130
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,735
I'll try Facebook.

131
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,408
Or Instagram.

132
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,867
Do you have followers?

133
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,119
Let's do Facebook.

134
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,954
Hmm...

135
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay.

136
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
How many friends do you have?

137
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
Look at your notifications.1,700?

138
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,674
Strange.

139
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,038
Okay, let's check messages first.

140
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,391
- What the hell?
- Oh, shit.

141
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,663
What was that?

142
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,127
Get over here. Come here.

143
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,566
Did someone not make it in?

144
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,110
No. No one.

145
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,905
Wait. Don't go too close!

146
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,990
Cheong-san.

147
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,908
Be careful.

148
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,583
Do you see anything?

149
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,007
It's just the wind.

150
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,800
That scared me.

151
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,194
Look, it's coming in!
Watch out, watch out!

152
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,020
Cheong-san, get back. Get back here.

153
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,522
Look out, look out!

154
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,108
Cheong-san!

155
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,736
- Cheong-san!
- Get back here!

156
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,029
Wait. w-w-wait, wait!

157
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,241
- Push it! Push it off.
- Did you get it?

158
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,427
Push it!

159
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,891
Push it off.

160
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,830
Push it off!

161
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,166
Push it! Come on.

162
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,959
Go! Harder!

163
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,130
- Watch out!
- Remove her hand!

164
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,175
Shit!

165
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,302
Stay back!

166
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,818
Don't go near it!

167
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,612
- Should I go?
- Stay back.

168
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,447
No. Hold on.

169
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,883
Go, Dae-su.

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,994
Give me.

171
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,296
Shit. We're completely fucked.

172
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,349
Just push it!

173
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,809
Push it! Push it off!

174
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,145
Push it away already!

175
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,584
- It's coming in.
- Su-hyeok! Watch out for your hand!

176
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,192
Su-hyeok! Fuck it!

177
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,657
Is it gone?

178
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,501
That was crazy.

179
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,753
I'm so dead.

180
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,286
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

181
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,873
Where did it come from?

182
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,223
- Hey, you good?
- That was scary. I'm good.

183
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
Hey.

184
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,813
You...

185
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,737
RESCUE

186
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,698
HYOSAN CITY COUNCIL

187
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,370
You have to understand
he's the youngest aide we have.

188
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,641
When he got back from the Council building
he just collapsed and started convulsing.

189
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,586
Captain. He smells like a rotting corpse.

190
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,463
And then he got back up, and went like...

191
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,633
...and just attacked Assemblywoman
out of nowhere.

192
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,276
So we tied him up to that chair.

193
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,845
But we didn't know
if we should call the police. You know?

194
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,129
Why are you telling them that?

195
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,265
He'll bite his tongue.

196
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,726
- We have to gag him.
- Copy.

197
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,482
- Ready?
- Yes.

198
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,401
One, two, three.

199
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,199
- Did it get you?
- It's okay. A little.

200
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,283
Wrap him up!

201
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,326
Now.

202
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,537
<i>Message from headquarters. Come in.</i>

203
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,547
Rescue Team One.

204
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>Level-three disaster in Hyosan.</i>

205
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>Report to temporary headquarters.</i>

206
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,136
Did you say level-three disaster?

207
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,717
<i>I repeat.</i>

208
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,307
<i>Level-three disaster in Hyosan.</i>

209
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,309
<i>Report to temporary headquarters.</i>

210
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
What is it?

211
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,497
- <i>This is the director's order.</i>
- Where are they sending you?

212
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,690
- <i>Mobilize immediately. That is all.</i>
- Uh...

213
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,626
The fire department headquarters

214
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,944
was moved out of the city
for an emergency.

215
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,531
The Disaster and Safety Control
will manage the situation.

216
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,199
Is evacuation really necessary?

217
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,703
All right. All right, all right. Hang on.

218
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,082
Okay, so they think
it's an acute infection.

219
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,377
They're saying there will be
an evacuation order for Hyosan soon.

220
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,756
Gyeong-su, you're bleeding.

221
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,799
I am?

222
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,971
Right, it's because

223
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,890
Su-hyeok hit me with a fucking mop.

224
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,350
Stay back. Stay where you are.

225
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
You were bitten, weren't you, Gyeong-su?

226
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,687
I wasn't. I wasn't.

227
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,010
Didn't you see Su-hyeok hit me?

228
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,902
What is your fucking problem with me?

229
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,361
You were bitten!

230
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,949
I-sak got a nosebleed
just before she turned.

231
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,784
On-jo. You saw it, right?

232
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,120
That's the same thing
that happened to I-sak.

233
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,413
Gyeong-su.

234
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,624
I-I'm telling you! I swear I wasn't bit!

235
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,670
Shit.

236
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,130
Look.

237
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,633
Your hand. Explain that?

238
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,051
What is it?

239
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,055
I got it from the computer.
Didn't you see that?

240
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,768
Don't you trust me?

241
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,980
I can't believe this.
I got this trying to save all of you.

242
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,697
It's not a bite. It's a scratch.

243
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,075
Whoever wants to check, come look.

244
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,411
It's a scratch?

245
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,831
Yeah, definitely. Just a scratch.

246
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,000
- Ms. Park, look.
- Mm.

247
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,505
Well, it really doesn't look like a bite.
Thank god. It's a scratch.

248
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,090
He's okay.

249
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,803
Done yet?

250
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,473
I said, are you done with me now?

251
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,186
Wait. This means the computer's gone.

252
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,396
No internet...

253
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,875
Couldn't you have thrown something else
instead of the computer?

254
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,859
What was I supposed to do?
It's trying to get in.

255
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,780
No, you did good. Thank you. Don't be mad.

256
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,074
Hey, Na-yeon.

257
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,576
Look. Say sorry. End this.

258
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,412
Why should I?

259
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,372
He did it to save us all.

260
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,095
Why can't you just say that you're sorry?

261
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,625
Because I'm not sorry.

262
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,003
I saw everything.

263
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,326
I saw the creature grabbed you.

264
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,009
<i>I'm right.</i>

265
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,844
He could be infected.

266
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,387
Na-yeon, enough.

267
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,556
It really did.
That thing grabbed his hand.

268
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,642
Wait, can touching his hand infect him?

269
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,185
I have no idea but maybe.

270
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,312
I held I-sak's hand when she fell.

271
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,207
Why is nothing happening to me?

272
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,025
Because he has a cut on his hand.

273
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,670
And since there's an open wound,
it's probably gonna be different.

274
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,987
- That's fucking...
- Don't.

275
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,698
Stop blaming me.
Why don't you just think for yourselves?

276
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,324
Na-yeon.

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,495
I know you always hated Gyeong-su,

278
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,622
but I think you're really crossing
the line here.

279
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,332
This is about life and death.

280
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,751
She's always like this.

281
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,088
If it weren't for him,
we would definitely all be dead right now.

282
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,466
And now, he might be the one
killing all of us.

283
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,259
Now you're the one who's killing me.

284
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,820
- Just shut up, Na-yeon.
- Look at my hand, I'm totally fine.

285
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,739
- Don't you see that?
- Hey, that's enough, all of you! Okay?

286
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,597
We're ending this.

287
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,890
- Ms. Park...
- Enough.

288
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,973
- But she...
- No!

289
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,651
Let's do this.

290
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,697
Gyeong-su, you're going to wait
in the recording room for ten minutes.

291
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,990
I know it'll be hard,

292
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,302
but at least it's better
than people thinking you're infected.

293
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,496
No one else thinks that I'm infected.
It's only her.

294
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,373
Gyeong-su, would you please do it?

295
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,544
Fuck ten. I'll do half...

296
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,546
I'll just do a full hour.

297
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,008
There's really no point doing an hour
since it takes less than five minutes.

298
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,812
- Stop overreacting.
- It's just to be sure.

299
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,513
Is that enough?

300
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,433
And if nothing happens,
you'll apologize, right?

301
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,477
Yeah.

302
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,482
And everyone else
is okay with that, right?

303
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,775
Yes.

304
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,403
If we do this,
who's gonna step up next time?

305
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,822
We all be too scared.

306
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,449
You're right, but...

307
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,831
Let's consider this a way
to learn to trust each other.

308
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,169
I do... trust Gyeong-su.

309
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,925
See you in an hour.

310
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
Want me to come with you?

311
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,065
What a stubborn asshole.

312
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,234
He only needs to do ten.

313
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,610
He's not that stubborn.

314
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,404
Compared to her.

315
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,010
- Go get it.
- No. I won't.

316
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,094
You stupid little...

317
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,470
Stop. Please.

318
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,139
Go, asshole.

319
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,768
Move. Please don't.

320
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,840
Hey, kid. Down here. Come.

321
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,079
Fuck.

322
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,986
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

323
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,904
<i>Maybe they're drawn to smell.</i>

324
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,323
They do always go after you.

325
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,407
I don't smell.

326
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,827
You sweat a lot, Dae-su.

327
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,537
I sweat, but I don't smell.

328
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,164
What's that smell?

329
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,166
Your sweat.

330
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,921
I think they're more sensitive
to sound than smell.

331
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,798
- Sound?
- Yeah, sound.

332
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,883
This isn't a movie.

333
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,095
That's just how zombies are, you know?

334
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,888
And didn't you see their eyes?

335
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,890
They can't see with those eyes.

336
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,560
- Ms. Park.
- Hmm?

337
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,854
Sound, smell, I don't know.

338
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,856
Some kids probably left school, right?

339
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,899
It's sound.

340
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,277
Mm-hm. Yeah, I think so.

341
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,404
Here, Su-hyeok.

342
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,465
Give me the mirror.

343
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,825
Maybe we're the lucky ones then?

344
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,956
The fact that we're alive

345
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,459
makes us lucky.

346
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,087
Really?

347
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,589
Mm-hm.

348
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,258
Wipe your face.

349
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,500
Are you okay?

350
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,419
I keep thinking about I-sak.

351
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,338
You held on...

352
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,174
until the last possible second.

353
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,970
Stop. That doesn't help.

354
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,681
You didn't do anything wrong.

355
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,893
Stay strong.

356
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,063
Your dad or someone else...

357
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,191
will come save us.

358

CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,472
Oh, for heaven's sake.

361
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,545
Do you have to put
your son's face on the sign?

362
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,889
Is there something wrong
with using his face?

363
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,092
You'll end up becoming
an evil mother-in-law.

364
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,302
All protective of your precious son.

365
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,763
Nagged your daughter-in-law constantly.

366
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,269
Anyway, uh...

367
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,981
better go submit these forms.

368
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,159
<i>The series of incidents
occurring in Hyosan</i>

369
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,329
<i>appear to be due to a mass outbreak
of a highly infectious virus.</i>

370
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,666
<i>We'll speak to the
Disease Control Center for more details.</i>

<i>Director Cha Hyeon-seok,
can you tell us what's going on?</i>

372
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,838
<i>Considering the level of spread,</i>

373
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,674
<i>it appears to be
a highly infectious disease.</i>

374
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,719
<i>Those infected
became unusually aggressive.</i>

375
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,138
<i>Victims showed similar symptoms,</i>

376
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,016
<i>so we suspect secondary infection
is possible.</i>

377
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,060
<i>As you've heard, this is very dangerous.</i>

378

<i>As advised by the KDCA,</i>

379

<i>the government has raised
the infectious disease alert to "serious."</i>

380

they will do everything possible</i>

381
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,987
<i>to prevent the spreading

<i>Breaking news. Just in.</i>

383
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,575
<i>The National Security Council
has officially declared</i>

384

<i>I repeat. The situation
is extremely serious.</i>

388

<i>The National Security Council has decided</i>

389
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:12,928
<i>to issue an evacuation order for the city
of Hyosan in Gyeonggi province.</i>

<i>If you're watching this,</i>

391
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,724
<i>please evacuate the city.
The situation is extremely dangerous.</i>

392
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,688
Hey, I'm just going
to step out for a minute.

393
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,606
Okay.

394
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,402
Are you all right?

395
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,488
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

396
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,702
l should be back soon.

397
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,832
A virus?

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,709
What kind of virus?

399
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,505
<i>I don't think it's airborne,
but it hasn't been confirmed.</i>

400
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,925
It seems like you
get infected if you get bit,

401
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,427
<i>so don't get bit or make physical contact.</i>

402
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,640
<i>We don't know
how much about the virus yet,</i>

403
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,934
<i>so just avoid as much as you can.</i>

404
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,312
<i>I hear an assembly member is there.</i>

405

- Hold still.

Yeong-hwan.

408
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,827
Yeong-hwan, hey, are you okay?

409
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,127
Captain, what do I do?

410
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,749
Yeong-hwan!

411
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,668
Yeong-hwan.

412
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,671
That, that, that's exactly what happened
to our aide, I'm telling you.

413
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,341
It's the same thing.

414
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,636
Oh, shit.

415
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,472
Is he dead?

416
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,657
U-sin!

Rope!

418
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,744
- Hurry!
- Tie him up!

419
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,541
Tie him up! Now!

Hey!

431
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,473
Stop! Stop wait.

432
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,911
- Turn around. You can't go through there.
- I'll be fast. I need to get through.

433
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,936
What's going on?

434
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,579
She says she needs to get through, sir.

435
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,815
Ma'am, you have to turn back.

436
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,567
- But my son...
- You need to evacuate.

437
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,569
- Get her out.
- Yes, sir.

438
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,320
- No. Wait.
- Come on. Let's go.

- Lady, please.

- Wait. My son, Cheong-san. Wait, please.
- Come on. Let's go.

441
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,610
You go to Hyosan High?
What are you doing here?

442
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,362
Is the school okay?

443
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey. Wait.
Do you know my son, Cheong-san?

Oh, no.

446
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,889
Hey. Lift me higher.

447
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,724
I can't go any higher.

448
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,184

I am.

450
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,395
Do you see anything?

451
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,566
Oh, shit.
There's a lot of zombies out there.

452
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,419
- Put me down.
- Okay.

453
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,154
Be careful. Careful.

454
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,656
Okay.

455
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,783
Why is this so hard?

456
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,866
Are you okay?

457
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,536
I'm okay.

458
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,248
What do we do?

459
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,667
Well, first...

460
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,462
- You got a cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

461
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,631
Shit, you look like you do.

462
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,925
Hey, What about you?

463
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,760
I don't smoke.

464
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,513
- Don't mess with me.
- I don't.

465
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,557
Why are you being rude to upperclassman?

466
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,141
Wanna die?

467
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,769
What the hell do you want?

468
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,273
Hey. Who said you can talk like that
to an upperclassman?

469
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,823
- Sorry.
- No.

470
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,284
To me, not to her.

471
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,746
God, why are athletes
always such douchebags?

472
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,874
Watch your mouth.

473
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:16,957
Watch yourself.

474
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,252
You're really going
to fight over these now, huh?

475
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,713
What are you, stupid?
Just get along already.

476
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,424
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,635
I said I was sorry, okay?

478
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,845
We got to go.

479
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,305
How can we leave?

480
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,057
If they see us,
they're gonna attack us all.

481
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,976
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

482
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,102
I'm not going.

483
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,105
- You?
- Leave me alone.

484
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,607
I do whatever I feel like.

485
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,735
Heartless bitch.

486
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,572
Here. Make weapons.

487
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,741
Come on.

488
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,327
Give me that.

489
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,065
Freak.

490
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,650
Han Gyeong-su.

491
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,402
I'll kill you.

492
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,543
What a fucking idiot.

493
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,910
What are you doing?

494
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,925
Thirty minutes.

495
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,761
What's that?

496
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,013
It's been 30 minutes. Come out.

497
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,238
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but he still doesn't want to come out.

498
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,865
I'll see what I can do.

499
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
What's wrong with him?

500
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,666
Looks okay to me.

501
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,626
He's fine. I knew it.

502
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,880
I don't understand
why he's being so stubborn?

503
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:28,964
He won't come out?

504
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,345
He's always like this.

505
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,722
He's too stubborn.

506
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,850
Huh?

507
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,229
So what did he say?

508
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,392
He won't come out?

509
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,191
He said he's staying the full hour.

510
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,693
He's pissed.

511
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,820
I'll go in.

512
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,904
Why would you go?

513
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,866
If anyone should, it's Na-yeon.

514
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,786
Why should I?

515
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,831
He's like this because of you.

516
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,101
- What did I do?
- Like you don't know?

517
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,835
Was it wrong to suspect him?

518
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,254
You did too. Everyone did.
It wasn't just me.

519
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,008
I always believe him.

520
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,091
Me too.

521
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,887
Well, I didn't. She's right.

522
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,181
But I didn't insult him like you did.

523
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,849
Why are you picking on me?

524
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,184
'Cause you deserve it.

525
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,685
That's enough, Ji-min.

526
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,988
You remember your promise, right?

527
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,741
After 30 minutes you'd apologize.

528
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Okay.

529
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,415
It's been 30 minutes.

530
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,044
All right.

531
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,633
She's doing it. Holy shit.
She's really doing it.

532
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,721
Hey.

533
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,684
I'm talking to you.

534
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,647
You're ignoring me?

535
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,150
What do you want?

536
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,154
Oh, yo. They're talking.
That's good. Right?

537
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,780
Why don't you answer me?

538
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,115
Apologize and get out.

539
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,867
How's your cut doing?

540
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,577
Why do you care?

541
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,370
Show me.

542
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,584
Oh, shit. She's touching him.

543
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,670
Well, that's pretty bold of her.

544
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,473
I suspected you
because the situation called for it.

545
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,851
And I was really mad earlier.

546
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,063
I'm still mad at you.

547
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,608
I guess...

548
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,068
She's Gyeong-su type?

549
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,863
I have no idea.

550
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,909
You know I've always looked down on you.

551
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,457
It's fine. It's all in the past.
Let's just go.

552
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,791
I'm not apologizing.

553
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,169
You deserve to be looked down on.

554
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,714
Our complex banned you welfies,
but you force your way in.

555
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,925
And how dare you push me?

556
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,551
Listen, you fucking...

557
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,136
You thought I'd apologize?

558
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,388
Kiss, kiss.

559
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,099
This is so crazy.

560
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,060
Everyone is taking your side.

561
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,022
I was cornered
because of a nobody like you.

562
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,316
Stay the full hour.

563
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,653
I hope you never come out again.

564
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,490
Fucking welfie.

565
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,293
Oh, they're coming.
They're coming.

566
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,243
Hey!

567
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,870
How cute was that? So cute... Whoa, whoa!

568
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,829
- Gyeong-su!
- Come here you piece of...

569
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,098
- Wait, wait, what?
- Gyeong-su, what's wrong?

570
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,125
You're fucking...
you're such a fucking cheat.

571
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,696
- I don't understand why I have to take it?
- Did you really say that?

572
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,722
You promised me you'd apologize to him.

573
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,046
- Dude, forget about her.
- I did nothing wrong.

574
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,851
You only think about yourself.

575
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,938
You said to close the door
before anyone could get in.

576
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,690
You said it would be safer for us.

577
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,899
That's not right.

578
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,279
We almost died
when Gyeong-su pulled Coach Kang in.

579
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,822
Why aren't you mad at him?

580
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,241
That was not his fault.

581
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,302
How is he supposed to know that
that was gonna happen?

582
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,246
- That's enough. Quiet, everyone.
- We'd be quiet if she were gone.

583
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,418
You're all so annoying.

584
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,087
What if I'm right about this?

585
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,799
Then will you finally admit
I saved you all, huh?

586
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,761
I don't understand.
How can you still be like this?

587
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Look.

588
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,438
Guess I was right after all.

589
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,363
What?

590
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,538
Gyeong-su.

591
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,342
<i>Day 26 of infection.</i>

592
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,137
I told you didn't I?
You still think I'm wrong?

593
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,932
The strong cells are attacking
the hosts weak cells.

594
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,770
Every single cell
is struggling just to survive...

595
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,315
they're attacking each other.

596
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,985
<i>This virus in essence
is like the will to live.</i>

597
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,322
<i>It consumes all cells almost instantly.</i>

598
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,122
Hey, hey. What's wrong with me?
Something's wrong.

599
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, shit.

600
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,211
What's wrong?

601
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,255
It's not true.

602
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,176
Come on. Get rid of him.
Get rid of him now!

603
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,470
- I'm not...
- Gyeong-su. Stay where you are.

604
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,390
Stay back.

605
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,810
I swear fucking I'm not.

606
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,521
I'm sorry, Gyeong-su.

607
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,981
Please, stay back.

608
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,366
I've turned, right?

609
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,786
Cheong-san, what do I do?

610
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,961
No, no. This doesn't make any sense.

611
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,212
Why would you...

612
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,171
Cheong-san.

613
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,255
Let go.

614
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,759
This cannot be true.

615
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,886
Why would you suddenly...

616
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,348
<i>The infected human
feels extreme fear...</i>

617
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,438
and then they attack in order to survive.

618
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,942
No, no. Gyeong-su you weren't...

619
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,278
Stay away. Don't come any closer!

620
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,662
What are you doing?

621
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,745
We need to kick him out.

622
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,957
We're all gonna die!

623
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
What...

624
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,254
What's happening...

625
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,047
Fuck.

626
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,513
Get out. I said, get out!

627
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,223
Shut the fuck up!

628
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,683
I'll leave by myself.

629
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,020
I'll leave. I'll go on my own.

630
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,621
Why would I bite you?

631
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,817
We're supposed to be fucking friends.
We're friends.

632
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,280
If I... If I leave,
it will be better for everyone.

633
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,953
Gyeong-su... why don't you just go back

634
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,723
into the recording room
until we can figure out...

635
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,974
If he stays in here
he's gonna kill us all.

636
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,916
Na-yeon!

637
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,542
I'm just trying to stay alive.

638
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,298
I'll leave.

639
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,358
I'll get out of here on my own.
Don't worry.

640
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,362
I'll get out of here.

641
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,449
Gyeong-su.

642
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,577
It's okay.

643
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,206
Thank you for everything.

644
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,375
Stay alive.

645
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,111
- <i>Are you all right, Gyeong-su?</i>
- Stay alive.

646
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,263
<i>What an idiot.</i>

647
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,892
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

648
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,604
Why are you doing that?
You're scaring me. Stop,

649
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,776
Stop it. Cheong-san,
why are you doing this?

650
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,028
Stop it! Please stop!

651
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:40,028
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

652
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,575
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW BEGINNING

653
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,810
- Lift it.
- Okay.

654
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,894
Here.

655
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,624
One more.

656
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,574
Fire and Disasters Headquarters
said not to touch the infected.

657
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,371
As you can see, it's highly contagious...

658
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,289
We were notified too, no need to explain.

659
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,876
How long do we have to stay here?

660
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,837
They're sending over a helicopter,
but it's gonna take time.

661
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,006
So it looks like
you'll have to wait a bit longer.

662
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,010
Did you notify them
that I was here as well?

663
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,094
What?

664
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,848
I'm asking if it's taking time
to get a chopper

665
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,433
even though they know I'm here?

666
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,060
No, I did not tell them who was here.

667
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,729
You should've told them.

668
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,312
That way, they'll send one
right away to pick us up.

669
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,656
Per rules of rescue, the weak and ill
take priority over VIPs.

670
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,035
We'll hear back soon,
so please be patient like everyone else.

671
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,372
Shit.

672
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,877
ON-JO'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

673
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,679
<i>The person you have called
is currently unavailable.</i>

674
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,311
This is Captain Nam So-ju.

675
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,522
If anyone knows the status
of Hyosan High School,

676
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,399
please respond.

677
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:33,160
If anyone knows anything
about the area near Hyosan High School

678
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,119
please respond.

679
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,296
Please respond.

680
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,257
KOREA
RESCUE

681
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,895
That asshole.

682
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,855
Gyeong-su...

683
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,983
...why did you have to turn?

684
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,196
I told you all.

685
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
He was infected.

686
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,909
Well, are you happy now?

687
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,579
You were all wrong.
Only I was right.

688
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,207
What would you even do without me?

689
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,334
Hey.

690
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:26,922
Maybe you did it.

691
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,548
What?

692
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,141
I saw everything.

693
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,478
Na-yeon...

694
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,024
What? What did you see?

695
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,275
You are the one who did it.

696
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,111
Who did what?

697
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,238
I didn't do anything to Gyeong-su.

698
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,841
I didn't say anything about Gyeong-su.

699
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,116
Knock it off.

700
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,785
What do you talking about?

701
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,829
I didn't do anything.

702
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,249
While we were all watching Gyeong-su,
you were in the back alone.

703
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,336
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but he still doesn't want to come out.

704
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,758
I'll see what I can do.

705
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,262
What's wrong with him?

706
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,101
Looks okay to me.

707
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,456
Why is he not coming out then?

708
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,857
He won't come out?

709
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,260
I don't understand
why he's being so stubborn?

710
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,027
He's too stubborn.

711
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,071
He's always like this.

712
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,659
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

713
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,331
No, I didn't.

714
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,459
You wiped that
on the scratches on Gyeong-su's hand.

715
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,670
- I did not.
- It's in your pocket.

716
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,213
- So what?
- Take it out.

717
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,923
- No.
- Take it out.

718
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,008
I said no.

719
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,761
Should I take it out?

720
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,971
Fuck you!

721
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,806
Who the hell do you think you are?

722
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,683
Class president?

723
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,604
You never treated me like president.

724
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,230
Nam-ra, that's enough.

725
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,444
Nam-ra, do you realize
what you're saying right now?

726
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,446
If that is true,

727
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,699
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

728
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,366
It's true.

729
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,245
Na-yeon did it.

730
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,624
She killed him.

731
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,335
You fucking cunt.

732
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,338
There.

733
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,421
Happy?

734
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,762
This is blood.

735
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,722
I wiped Gyeong-su's hand.

736
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,099
This is his blood?

737
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,768
You can't tell?

738
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,604
Then put it on your wound.

739
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,026
Wipe yourself with it
if you're so confident.

740
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,904
Like his blood is so clean?

741
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,656
He was a zombie.

742
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,036
He was just fine until you infected him
with your handkerchief.

743
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,037
Na-yeon, you...

744
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,873
Damn it! It wasn't me!

745
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,214
Don't do it. Stop it.

746
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,423
Let go.

747
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,759
I said to stop it.

748
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,885
Give it to me.

749
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,846
Leave me alone! Fuck!

750
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,474
I should just die too then, huh?

751
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,351
That's what you want, isn't it?

752
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,901
Why is Gyeong-su better than me?

753
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,865
That dirty welfie pushed me.

754
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,203
Na-yeon, you didn't...

755
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,039
So, you did do it.

756
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,624
How could you just fucking...

757
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,293
I didn't kill him, okay?

758
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,921
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

759
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,048
He's still alive.

760
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,134
He didn't die, he just turned.

761
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
Are you kidding me right now?

762
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,220
Stop ganging up on me.

763
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,433
When I said he smelled, you all laughed.

764
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,810
You all made fun of him too.

765
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,520
Don't try to act innocent now.

766
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,647
- Na-yeon...
- Cheong-san, stop.

767
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,858
How could you kill him?

768
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,941
Stop it.

769
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,160
You're...

770
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,164
a murderer.

771
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,063
I...

772
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,942
I have no friends at all.

773
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,113
I don't need any of you.

774
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,491
Fuck you.

775
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,045
Hey!

776
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,103
Listen...

777
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,360
No matter what happens, you stay alive.

778
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,697
Also, you must never take a life.

779
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,918
If you cause
someone else to die,

780
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,255
life becomes completely meaningless.

781
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,799
All right?

782
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,820
Ms. Park! Wait.

783
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,531
Dae-su, don't go.

784
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,491
She's gone.

785
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,104
Fuck!

786
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,061
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

787
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:10,064
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
