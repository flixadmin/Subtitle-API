00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,236
I don't like Nate.
That would be wrong and...

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,596
- Nate likes you.
- [Mona] <i>Why don't you talk to Nate?</i>

You're letting the cold in, man.

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,154
[boy] We found something, sir.

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,036
But it's hard to explain.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,396
Don't stand there like a fool.
Spit it out.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,710
Something was encased in the ice.
It appears to be...

Gold.

Careful, sir.

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,718
It's... incredible.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,517
I haven't the foggiest what it is.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,159
I know exactly what it is.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,993
My greatest discovery.

28

[mummy snarling]

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,271
Yeah. That's what they all say.

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,997
Oh, hey, ladies. Was he any trouble?

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,030
Slam dunk. Honestly, with Neron gone,

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,918
catching fugitives
has never been easier.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,136
I thought it was gonna take all week.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,616
That's great. It means you won't
have to miss book club tonight.

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,678
- That's right. Book club.
- Mmm-hmm.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Whoa! Smells like
somebody hasn't showered

Oh, buddy, don't talk
with your mouth full, am I right?

Mummies are the biggest dummies.
Hey, you big dummy mummy.

Got your containment cell all set up,

- [Nate] Nice.

[Zari clears her throat]
All right, cool.

- Yeah.

- How are you and Nate?

Ah!

in a super platonic way. [clears throat]

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,400
Then why are you guys being so weird?

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,039
[sighs] It was that awkward, huh?

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
Even the mummy thought it was awkward.

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,719
Look, I mean, you like him, right?

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,555
Yeah, I think so. But I don't know
what the next step would be.

64
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,917
Oh, that's easy.
You just jump his bones.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,960
What if I do that
and it screws up our friendship?

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,556
Look, Z. [sighs]

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,477
Sometimes, for the good
of the relationship,

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
you have to put yourself outside
of your comfort zone.

69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,030
For instance,

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,076
I am going to read 500 pages of some
trashy novel by tonight, for Ava.

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,749
And look, with Neron gone,

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
now is the time for us
to get our personal lives into order.

You look like you haven't slept in days.

Oh... Been having weird dreams.

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,718
- How is she?
- No improvements.

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,632
But no setbacks.

88

I'll leave you two alone.

I want you to know that your life
is going to be beautiful from now on.

Wait. What are you doing
with the pillow?

Just Ray and Neron.

No, you're dead.

You're dead. This isn't real.
This isn't real.

- Okay, okay.

[sighs]

121
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,797
You're a reasonable man, Ray Palmer.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,554
So I'm going to make you
a reasonable offer.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,793
Give yourself to me freely.

124
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,994
No. No, this conversation is over.

- [grunting]
- [chuckles]

126

You leave me no choice
but to make you kill someone you love.

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,355
You made me try to kill Nora.

128
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,270
But why?

129
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,593
Because, if you murder someone you love,
your soul will be mine.

[gasps]

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,200
Mick, fancy a brew?

Sorry! Sorry.
I'll be in the science, doing lab.

[Mick] Haircut!

- What's all this ruckus?
- [Mick grunts]

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,760
- [Charlie] Hey!
- [Mick] Hey, I got it!

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,719
- Is this fan mail for Rebecca Silver?
- No.

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,111
It is not. Here. Give me that!

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,193
An invitation for Rebecca Silver
to reveal her identity

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,239
at RomantiCon 2019 for $20,000.

145
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,073
Rebecca doesn't do cons.

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,976
Now, Mick, I realize
that you don't like people knowing

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,856
that you moonlight
as a romance novelist, but...

148
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,656
Do I like look like a romance novelist
to you?

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,478
Oi, listen, don't you get mad at me.

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
Now, this is an easy score,
and we're gonna get that money.

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,714
20K. How?

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, I'll be Rebecca, mate.

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,714
Okay. Page one...

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,476
[beeping]

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
...will have to wait.

156
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,913
All right, people, we've got a hit.

157
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,314
New York City, 1933.
The Adventurers Society.

158

Shut the front door!

159
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
What's the Adventurers Society?

160
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,879
It's a club
for archaeologists and explorers.

161
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,156
It's basically the coolest place
in history.

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,754
Guys, this is gonna be awesome!

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Nate, you're running point on this one.

164
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
With Zari.

165
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,876
- For real?
- For real?

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Um...

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,589
Sara, we did not discuss this.

168
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,559
Look, relax. It's just a cleanup job.
We'll do fine.

169
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,595
Find the fugitive,
bring him in, preferably in one piece.

171
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,476
Now scram.

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
- [Nick] Hmm.
- [Zari] Yeah.

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,236
[Sara sighs]

174
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,835
You're willing to risk an entire mission
to play matchmaker?

175
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I sure am.

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,976
[Agent Sharpe] Honestly, I'm getting
a "just friends" vibe.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,993
I bet you 20 bucks
they hook up on the mission.

178
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,230
I'll take that.

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
You and I running this mission
won't be weird at all.

180
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,959
- Yeah, it's gonna be super chill.
- Yeah.

181
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
[Nate clears throat]

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,156
And just because Sara and Ava are busy
doesn't mean everybody else is.

183
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,280
Yes. Let's rally the troops.

184
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,589
Yes.

185
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,599
Raymond, we've got a legit
Time Bros mission.

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,150
What? Time... Time Bros, that's us.

187
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,910
Um... Look, I just...

188
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,754
I've got some stuff I'm doing here.

189
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,275
Come on, put the "schmience" away.
We got a magic blip.

190
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,149
Look, right now, it's just me and Zari,
and if I'm being totally honest,

191
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,799
it's a little awkward between us.

192
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,553
So I could really use my wing man.

193
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm just doing
some interesting stuff here. I...

194
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,678
It's something that has to do with me.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,630
Busy working on a vaccine for...
N...

196
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
- For what?
- [straining]

197
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,990
Are you all right?

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,157
- I got it.
- You do?

199
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,515
This is about Nora.

200
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm sitting here, going on and on
about me and Zari,

201
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm not even thinking about
what you must be going through.

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,709
I am sorry for being a bad friend.
Bring it in.

203
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,311
What kind of punk-ass hug is that?

204
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,719
Bring it all the way in, Raymond.

205
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Hug me.

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,872
Look, whatever you're working on,

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,275
you're gonna kill it.

208
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,077
You're gonna absolutely murder it.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
- Ah, Ray?
- Yeah, I just sort of

210
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,496
sometimes like
to do a pre-mission massage, you know?

211
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,115
Just to limber up before we get out
in the field. [grunts]

212
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,879
[Ray sighs]

213
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,112
- A little too much?
- Yeah.

214
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,032
Well, say hello to Rebecca Silver.

215
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
[grunts]

216
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,354
Try these.

217
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,000
[Mick grunts]

218
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,990
Perfect.

219
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
[chuckles]

220
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,196
Nice get-up.

221
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,638
So you guys heard we're headed
to the '30s?

222
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
No.

223
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,871
Well, you are.
Sara put me and Nate in charge.

224
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,994
Oh, are you and Nate finally gonna...

225
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,310
Boom, boom.

226
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,073
Stop, stop. Okay.

227
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,669
Guess what. You're on the <i>Waverider,</i>
so you're going.

228
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,399
<i>Jumpship's</i> got
a full tank though, yeah?

229
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,040
Do you have somewhere to be?

230
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,096
Best if you don't pry, love.
Just like I'm not asking

231
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,720
about that naughty little number
Sara left behind for you to wear.

232
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,435
Check your closet.

233
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
- Rory, do you want to...
- [Mick] Plans.

234
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay.

235
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,150
- [people chattering]
- [laughter]

236
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
[Nate scoffs]

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,231
I can't believe
everyone else bailed on the mission.

238
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,354
More Adventurers Society for us.

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,233
[sighs] All right. Let's do this.

240
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,079
- [man] Allow me.
- [Zari] Thank you.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,038
I know. I know. These costumes
are totally ridiculous.

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,113
[stammers] You look absolutely, um...

243
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
yeah, ridiculous.

244
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,636
Uh, apparently, it's all part
of the cover story Sara gave me.

245
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,515
I'm someone named Marion Ravenwood.

246
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Wait.

247
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Wait a second.

248
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,074
Huh. Well, it says here
I am Dr. Henry Jones Jr.

249
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,393
Professor of archaeology,
expert in the occult.

250
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
And how does one say this?

251
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

252
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
How...

253
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,401
It's Indiana Jones.

254
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Yeah.

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,233
- Sara set us up.
- What's that?

256
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,597
Adventurers Society, everyone else
unavailable for the mission,

257
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,911
dressing up like your favorite movie,

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,710
it's all a setup
to send us on the perfect date.

259
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
[gulps]

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,993
I totally get
if you want to go back to the ship.

261
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,279
Or we can see where
this mission takes us.

262
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,920
[upbeat music playing]

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,150
[indistinct chatter]

264
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,710
Oh, Mick, we're gonna make
a killing off of these people.

265
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Does Rebecca Silver belong
in sci-fi erotica or cyber-erotica?

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Rebecca Silver defies all categories.

267
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,040
Excuse me. You are?

268
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,793
It's me
you should be talking to, actually.

269
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,240
I am Rebecca Silver.

270
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,441
And I do not appreciate the tone
that you're taking with my bodyguard.

271
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,079
Oh, goodness, Ms. Silver.
The Recluse of Romance.

272
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,197
We are honored that you will be making

273
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,875
your first public appearance ever
with us.

274
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,475
You look exactly as I dreamed.

275
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm just here for the check, really.

276
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,118
Of course. And you will get it

277
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,510
after your public appearance,
Q&A, and book signing.

278
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,432
Oh, chitchat with a bunch of weirdos

279
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,736
dressed as some ridiculous alien queen
they want to bang.

280
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,720
[chuckles]

281
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,721
No problem.

282
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,870
Number one, Garima is a warrior.

283
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,350
- Number two, you're being rude.
- Rude?

284
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,319
That's rich coming from you.
You're the rudest person I know.

285
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,869
You don't get it. You need training.

286
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
What time's the Q&A?

287
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,509
In two hours.

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Good. We'll be there.

289
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
[sighs]

290
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,310
Let's do this.

291
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,392
Okay. Page one.

292
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Is this on audio book?

293
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,376
[narrator over earphones]
<i>They say your life flashes</i>

294
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,675
<i>before your eyes when you die.</i>

295
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,989
<i>But what if, in that moment,</i>

296
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,033
<i>you finally see everything
life's been trying to show you?</i>

297
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,670
<i>That's how I discovered
that a killer was amongst me.</i>

298
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,056
[increases playback speed] <i>I should have
known something was amiss that night.</i>

299
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,216
<i>I was returning from hot yoga
to my sensational cliffside home,</i>

<i>matcha green tea smoothie in hand,</i>

301
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,976
<i>when I noticed my door
was slightly ajar.</i>

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,096
[increases playback speed]
<i>I entered, wondering if my dog walker</i>

303
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,376
<i>or cat sitter or personal shopper</i>

304
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,576
<i>or astrologer had failed to close it.</i>

305
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,696
<i>That's when I heard him say,</i>

306
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,235
<i>"There's something
I've been meaning to kill you."</i>

307
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,439
[man] Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

308
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,714
My esteemed colleagues,
the honor of having my flag retired

309
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,751
is only rivaled by the honor
of sharing my latest discovery.

310
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,233
To retrieve it required not only besting
the frozen wasteland of the Arctic,

311
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,758
but also the physical limitations
of the human body itself.

312
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,634
But for the sake of exploration,
I prevailed.

313
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,076
And so, without further ado,

314
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,475
I present to you
Gordon Gilchrist's golden mystery...

315
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
egg.

316
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,316
[people chuckling]

317
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Now, Vincent.

318
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,072
[all gasping]

319
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,280
In the words of Ray and Mike Tyson,

320
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,716
"I think we found our Myth-tery man."

321
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,755
Come on, science.

322
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,110
Something's happening.

323
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,351
[panting]

324
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,310
I can feel my hand again.

325
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,470
[chuckles]

326
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,074
No, no, no.

327
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
The infection...

328
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,750
is spreading.

329
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,758
Gideon, where in the timeline
is John Constantine?

330
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,038
[Gideon] His last known whereabouts
were in 2019 with Gary Green.

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,713
Would you like me to connect?

332
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,756
- What are you doing to me Doctor...
- Gideon? Gideon?

333
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What?

334
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
[beeping]

335
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,476
We can't have anyone spying on us now,
can we, Raymond?

336
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,113
You're all alone now.

337
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,432
Well, it's you and me.

338
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,556
Oh, yeah?

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,471
Well, I'll just do this
the old-fashioned way.

340
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,433
[grunts]

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,550
Aha!

342
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,197
- [cell phone ringing]
- [grunting]

343
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,916
- Hello.
- Gary, hi. Ray Palmer here.

344
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,478
By any chance,
have you spoken to Constantine lately?

345
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,994
Worried about Nora, huh?

346
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,391
What? Yes, but no.
I'm calling on a more personal matter.

347
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,759
Say no more. I will be right over.

348
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,509
What? No! No, no, no, Gary.

349
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,795
- No, Gary.
- [crackling]

350
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
How can I help?

351
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Oh, no.

352
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
You hear something?

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,075
[door opening]

354
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,757
- There's a guard.
- Okay.

355
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,958
Don't worry. I can talk my way
into anywhere. [clears throat]

356
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,797
Excuse me, my good man. Can you point me
to the nearest facilities?

357
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,349
I have an urgent need to
relieve my bowel.

358
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's go.

359
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,433
We are crushing this mission,
by the way.

360
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,989
No classic Legends mishaps,

361
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,470
and only one historically insignificant
nobody received

362
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,233
- blunt force trauma to the head.
- Hmm.

363
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,078
And now we get our prize.

364
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Wait.

365
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Trip wires.

366
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,256
This is going to require one of us
to squeeze through these trip wires,

367
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,910
maneuvering our bodies
in unexpected ways.

368
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,872
Are you asking me to do that?

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,719
No. I'm asking you to hold my coat.

370
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,794
When I wrote <i>Uncaged Desire,</i>
I was trying to uncage my own desire.

371
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,432
A desire to... To... To...

372
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,936
Oh, bollocks! What's the next bit again?

373
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,271
To feel life, not just live it.

374
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,080
You still don't know Rebecca.

375
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,231
Well, I know you, and you're Rebecca.

376
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,880
Your primary mode of communication
is grunting like a caveman.

377
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,076
[grunting]

378
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,230
[sighs] Besides, I mean, Rebecca Silver
is whoever we want her to be.

379
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,776
These people,
they don't know anything about her.

380
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,880
What are you talking about?

381
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,949
They read her books.
They read her letters.

382
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Her letters?

383
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,195
Do you answer your fan mail?

384
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,675
[scoffs]

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,480
I just thought all this
was a big laugh at their expense.

386
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,590
Well, it's not.

387
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,236
[exhales]

388
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Hmm.

389
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Be careful.

390
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,556
What the hell?

391
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,119
It's papier-mâché.

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,793
Oh, my God.

393
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,839
She did this all for us.
It's all a setup.

394
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
- No.
- Yeah.

395
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:08,921
- You think?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,880
It was a fake magicometer alert.
Sara concocted this whole thing.

397
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,838
- I bet you they're actors, too.
- Yeah.

398
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,674
Gordon Gilchrist,
with the ridiculous facial hair.

399
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,036
- The only thing that's missing? Nazis.
- Yeah.

400
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,349
[gun cocking]

401
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,994
What did you do with the egg, huh?

402
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,233
The real egg.

403
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,756
Oh, she really went all out.

404
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
[Nate chuckles softly]

405
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,674
[Zari chuckles softly]

406
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,315
[door opens]

407
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,936
- [Sara] Hey.
- [Agent Sharpe] Well, there you are.

408
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,816
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

409
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,911
This is a...
interesting choice of venue.

410
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,071
We can't have book club without Nora.

411
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,470
It takes all three of us
for a book club quorum.

412
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Very sweet.

413
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
[Mona chuckles]

414
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,394
- Cheers, babe.
- [Sara] Thank you.

415
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,877
All right. So who do you guys think
is the real killer?

416
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,599
Because I have my theories.

417
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,716
[cell phone dings]

418
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,517
Oh, my God. This can't be real.

419
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,759
- I have to go, now.
- [Sara] What?

420
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,480
You just said that book club requires
all three of you.

421
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,916
It's Rebecca Silver.

422
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,352
She's revealing her identity
at RomantiCon, tonight.

423
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,549
Rebecca Silver?

424
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,599
The sex-positive novelist
reinventing feminism.

425
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, we know who she is.

426
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,118
Make sure you take lots of pictures.

427
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,312
Oh, my God, thank you.

428
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,675
I can't believe I'm going to be

429
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,837
breathing the same air
as Rebecca Silver.

430
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,115
[squeals, giggles]

431
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
[door opens]

432
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,038
- Okay, so...
- Hmm.

433
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,274
What did you think of the book?

434
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,313
Oh, you wanna keep doing book club?

435
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,517
Babe, we don't have to.
We can just forget it.

436
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,752
I thought it would be nice for us
to be able to do something of yours.

437
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,314
Aw!

438
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,393
That's so sweet, thank you.

439
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,958
- I didn't read the book.
- What?

440
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,198
- Sorry.
- Seriously?

441
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,352
Honestly, I usually just drink rosé

442
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,877
and let Mona go on and on
and use it as a mini-vacay for my brain.

443
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,957
Well, it was actually
a really good book.

444
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,875
Wait, wait. Come on. I can still drink
rosé, and you can go on and on.

445
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,600
- Mmm.
- Come on. Come on.

446
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,756
Okay, fine.

447
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,629
So I think the real killer
was the dog walker.

448
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
No.

449
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,635
Yes, I mean,
all that pent-up frustration.

450
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,237
She treated him like a doormat.

451
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,151
You can't help me. I need Constantine.

452
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,716
Well, I may not be a master
of the Dark Arts,

453
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,996
but I am an intern of the Dark Arts.

454
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,914
You're interning for Constantine?

455
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Yeah.

456
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,256
He's letting me study his spell books
if I water his plants

457
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,033
while he searches for a cure for Nora.

458
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,880
But, besides, what other options
do you have?

459
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,113
Come on. Tell the Gare-Bear
what ails you.

460
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,270
I don't know how to explain it,

461
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,310
but it feels like there's something
inside of me.

462
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,296
Oh, yeah. You know, there's
a beautiful singer inside of me,

463
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,576
but no one's ever going to meet her.

464
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,831
No. No, Gary. No, Gary. This is bad.

465
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,351
This is very bad,
and I don't know how to get it out.

466
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
[snaps fingers]

467
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,234
Indigestion. I know just the spell.

468
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,358
I'll have your pipes cleared out
in no time.

469
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,476
Let me just look it up.

470
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,840
Good thing it's not a demon

471
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,997
because, if it was,
you wouldn't be able to tell me.

472
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,993
Weird rule that keeps the victim silent,

473
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,197
all the while trying to
murder a loved one

474
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,749
in order to seal in
the demonic possession forever.

475
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
[grunts]

476
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,679
Why did you just stab yourself?

477
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,154
I didn't.

478
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,276
[gasps]

479
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,431
- You're possessed.
- Yes!

480
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,154
I... I... I can help.

481
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,076
Where is the egg?

482
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,196
[both chuckle]

483
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,754
Take it easy, Hitler Youth.

484
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,832
The egg's broken. It was a crappy prop.

485
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,513
The real egg.

486
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,160
Do not anger me.

487
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,636
Look, this was a good effort,
like really good.

488
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
But we've done Nazis before,
but like, real Nazis.

489
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,598
So, if it's okay with you,

490
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,149
I would rather just... [clicks tongue]
pull the plug on this.

491
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,879
- Yeah.
- [man] My friend here

492
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,753
- is a surgeon.
- Oh, nice.

493
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,317
He will kill you until you tell me
where the real egg is.

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,151
- Uh, let's tell Sara we're on to her.
- Yeah.

495
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,993
- [beeps]
- Mmm.

496
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,912
- Hello.
- [Zari] <i>Hi, Sara. Nate and Zari here.</i>

497
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,834
<i>Uh, first of all, well-played.</i>

498
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,416
[Nate] <i>Yeah, setting up this
whole adventure for us to go on a date</i>

499
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,715
<i>was way over-the-top,</i>

500
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,870
<i>but, in the same breath,</i>

501
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,912
very sweet.
And if I were to give a note,

502
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,037
the Nazis were just like a tad too much.

503
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
What are you...
What are you talking about?

504
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,310
[Nate] Are they the same theater troop
as Ava's parents?

505
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,676
- [Sara] <i>What?</i>
- Sara, drop the act.

506
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,400
Nazis killing us with throwing daggers.
Come on.

507
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,437
Listen to me.

508
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,399
Look, I did purposely put the two of you
on a mission together,

509
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,994
but this is a real mission,

510
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,116
not a game.

511
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
<i>Those are real Nazis.</i>

512
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
[Nate] Whoa!

513
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,791
And now, young lady, you die.

514
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
[Zari sighs]

515
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,679
- Sorry, Nate.
- For what?

516
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,149
[grunting]

517
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
Wow.

518
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,916
- You okay?
- Yeah, that was actually really intense.

519
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,120
[door opens]

520
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,472
See, they took care of things
on their own.

521
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,633
And they were clearly about to hook up.

522
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,096
- No, they weren't. Wait.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

523
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,040
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

524
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,097
Were you guys about to hook up?

525
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,496
- It was definitely on the table.
- No, no, no, no.

526
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,751
- See. I told you.
- Come on... It doesn't matter.

527
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,256
Okay, now that you know that
it's a real mission, where's the egg?

528
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
Yeah, and where is Ray?

529
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,216
Isn't he supposed to be
quarterbacking on this?

530
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
[groans]

531
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,032
Ray? Ray, come in.

532
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,756
Nate, buddy.

533
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,320
Don't come back to the ship
under any circumstances.

534
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,959
- [Nate] <i>You okay, buddy?</i>
- [Ray] Yeah.

535
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,311
Just cleaning up a storm over here.

536
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,230
<i>I don't want you to trip and break
your neck on the mopped floors.</i>

537
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,879
- Okay, bye.
- [Gary exclaims]

538
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,317
Bye. Okay, that was weird, even for Ray.

539
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,551
- We should check on him.
- You go check on Ray.

540
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
We'll handle the egg.

541
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,475
Um... I'm sorry that our first date
got ruined by Nazis.

542
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,519
Who says it's ruined?

543
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,679
[Agent Sharpe squeals softly]

544
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,912
[clears throat] Okay, what do we know?

545
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,998
We found an egg, but it was fake.

546
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,160
Someone stole the real one.

547
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,709
What about that Gordon Gilchrist guy?

548
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,595
He's the one who found it,

549
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
so I don't know
why he would have stolen it.

550
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,736
Although I sort of think
his poor assistant, Vincent,

551
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
did most of the work.

552
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,915
- Wait. That's just like the book!
- It is?

553
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,914
The book from book club!

554
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,193
Vincent is the doormat!

555
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,192
Look, it's always the doormat.

556
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,272
It was the dog walker in the book,
and, now,

557
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,795
<i>this Vincent guy is mad
that he didn't get any credit.</i>

558
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,152
<i>So we find Vincent, take the egg,
and wipe everyone's memories. Easy.</i>

559
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,157
[Gary] Ray. Ray.

560
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,630
Remember, if you kill a loved one,
Neron will take over.

561
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,399
Oh, well, here's the thing, Gary.
I like you.

562
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
But...

563
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh...

564
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah.

565
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,677
Got it. Old Gare.

566
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,352
Not loved by the Legends.

567
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,952
Bottom of the pecking order
at the Bureau.

568
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,110
Constantine's plant sitter.

569
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,440
Always the butt of the joke.

570
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,592
Gary, it's not like that.

571
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,592
It is like that, Gary.

572
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
No one appreciates you.

573
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,594
They all think you're a fool

574
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,876
that they can use
whenever it's convenient for them.

575
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,474
But I respect you,
and I see your potential.

576
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,114
- Neron?
- Gary, don't listen to him.

577
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,554
He's trying to trick you.

578
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,752
A demon can't renege
on the deals they make.

579
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,753
So you can believe me when I say

580
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,200
I can make you whole again.

581
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,994
"Whole"?

582
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,913
Rebecca, first, let me say

583
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,914
that your novel <i>Uncaged Desires</i>
was a sexual epiphany for me.

584
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,616
[Charlie] I can't say
that I'm surprised.

585
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,313
My writing does have that effect.

586
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,440
But how did Officer Daphne
free Tank Tremors?

587
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,594
Can prison guards release inmates
just because they're in love?

588
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,674
Oh, well, you see, that was a metaphor.

589
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,590
After all, aren't we all
in our own prisons of desire?

590
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,072
Rebecca, in <i>Heatwaves,</i>

591
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,278
who is the unnamed villain
who is stalking Garima?

592
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,638
- Charlie?
- What is a villain?

593
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,315
Is it just someone
with a different point of view?

594
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,838
What's really stalking Garima
are the choices that she made.

595
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,594
So you're the real Rebecca Silver, huh?

596
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,753
Hi. Yes.

597
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,197
I mean, that is what I have embroidered
on my satin pillowcases.

598
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,317
- [all laughing]
- Okay, then.

599
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,633
I have a question
about your novel <i>Raw Hides.</i>

600
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,760
When Captain Cash Harvey
fights the Prairie Bandits,

601
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,635
why does Nasgowa stow away
in his Conestoga wagon?

602
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,600
Well, you see, that is also a metaphor.

603
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,359
That is not a metaphor.
She really did it.

604
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,600
And she died because of it.

605
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,116
The real Rebecca Silver would know.

606
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,636
[Charlie]
I am the real Rebecca Silver.

607
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,355
I have tea with lemon.

608
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
- I have a really small dog.
- You're a fraud.

609
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,989
- [all gasping]
- Where is the real Rebecca?

610
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,916
[all chanting]
Where's the real Rebecca?

611
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,391
- Where's the real Rebecca?
- Where's the real Rebecca?

612
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,075
Right, go to hell,
you stinking mouth-breathers.

613
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,120
[all gasping]

614
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:55,601
Where's the real Rebecca?

615
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,678
[all chanting] Where's the real Rebecca?

616
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,957
Where's the real Rebecca?

617
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,032
Quiet! Give me that.

618
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,632
Nasgowa chased Cash for one reason.

619
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,591
It's the same reason humans have gotten
together since the dawn of time.

620
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,918
It's why people like you
come to conventions

621
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,835
and dress up
as your favorite characters.

622
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,994
Why a man sits behind a desk, typing,

623
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,514
pouring out his heart.

624
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,878
Why an author,

625
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,114
a writer, replies to fans.

626
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,119
It's connection.

627
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,592
Human connection.

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,231
- I am Rebecca Silver.
- [all gasping]

629
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,037
You are Rebecca.

630
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,879
I'd recognize that wisdom anywhere.

631
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,676
[all cheering and applauding]

632
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,075
[sighs]

633
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
I would have come sooner, Nora.

634
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,195
But have you any idea how hard it is
to acquire a phoenix's tail feather?

635
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,878
I didn't. All right.

636
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,160
[exhales]

637
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,153
[chanting]
By the power above and below,

638
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,156
I call on you, Nora Darhk,
to return to this plane and rise reborn.

639
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,949
Come on, love.

640
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,273
Come back to me. Come on, love.

641
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,040
[gasps]

642
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,153
- [Nora grunting]
- [chuckling]

643
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Neron...

644
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,896
No, no, no, it's all right, love.
It's all right.

645
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,115
He's gone. You did it.

646
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,999
- No.
- He's gone.

647
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,475
He has Ray.

648
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,037
Ray?

649
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,517
Gideon, where's Ray?

650
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
[hissing]

651
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,956
[Ray] Nate, you shouldn't have come.

652
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,235
Ray, what's going on?

653
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,590
You should leave. You can't let me get...

654
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,390
Ray, what are you saying?

655
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,800
[panting]

656
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,552
You've been acting so weird lately.

657
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,677
- I thought we were bros.
- It's not me.

658
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,752
Don't you see? It's near...

659
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,360
- What's near? Somebody's nearby?
- No.

660
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,595
[groaning]

661
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,876
[Sara] All right, people. Gather around.

662
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,591
Vincent? What's the meaning of this?

663
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,555
- I found it.
- Hand over the egg.

664
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,078
- I should get credit for it.
- The egg is my accomplishment.

665
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
It belongs to me.

666
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,776
Everyone's memory of the egg
is about to be erased,

667
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,200
so don't get too bent out of shape.

668
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,034
- Not so fast.
- [grunts]

669
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,395
Finally, the egg is ours.

670
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,274
Oh, man, these guys.

671
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
[groans]

672
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,396
I'm Ray. The rest of me isn't.

673
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,552
Nate, you have to get out of here.
You have to leave.

674
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,676
I won't leave you, buddy.

675
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,560
[Nate] Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

676
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,080
You have to go.

677
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,471
- He's gonna make me kill you.
- No, because I believe you,

678
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,149
Raymond, are stronger than he is.

679
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
[groans]

680
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,839
- Nate, I'm so sorry.
- [coughs]

681
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,351
Why are you hitting me?

682
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,713
Can't stop.

683
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,838
- We're bros.
- We are bros.

684
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,273
[panting]

685
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,519
[grunting]

686
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,913
Okay, I give up. I give up.
You hear me, Neron? I give up.

687
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,754
Spare Nate, and I'll let you have me.

688
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,919
Just promise me you won't hurt him,
and I won't resist.

689
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,879
[panting]

690
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,153
[Neron as Ray] Deal.

691
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,750
[laughing]

692
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,070
[sighs]

693
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,557
It's nice to have a willing host.

694
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,079
But a promise is a promise.

695
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,195
[people screaming]

696
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,836
- We gotta get that egg.
- On it.

697
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,435
[grunting]

698
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,835
Okay, I got you.

699
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,636
[grunting]

700
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,749
[sighing]

701
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,671
- See them whip skills?
- That gave me an idea for date night.

702
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Hmm.

703
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,952
Oh, come on now. Don't be shy.

704
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,114
You're a little late, Johnny.

705
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,273
I've sort of taken over jolly old Ray.

706
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,872
[exhales]

707
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,917
- I see you've lost a step.
- [chuckles]

708
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,391
That's the thing about mortals.
They age so quickly.

709
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,157
But don't worry, Johnny.
I won't let you die of old age.

710
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,274
Yeah, well, I might be
a little older, mate,

711
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,273
but I've picked up a few tricks
along the way.

712
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,840
[chanting]

713
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,719
[chuckles]

714
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,439
That one's from Marie Laveau.

715
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,636
[Neron as Ray] Cute trick.

716
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,896
But we both know you won't be able
to hold it for long.

717
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,434
You're a parasite.

718
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,950
And I will separate you from Ray Palmer.

719
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,591
Oh, Gary. Where have you been?

720
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,273
I was hiding in the lab.

721
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,394
Then I heard noises.

722
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,176
Yeah, well, go and get my steam trunk,

723
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,112
and we can exorcise this demon
right now.

724
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,256
Damn it, Gary. Now it's not the time

725
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,954
for you to be standing around
like some hapless idiot.

726
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,555
I can't hold this bastard forever.
Do it, now.

727
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,996
[Neron as Ray] Demands a lot from you,
doesn't he, Gary?

728
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,440
But what has he ever done for you?

729
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,239
I, on the other hand,
brought you a gift.

730
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,039
Go ahead. Open it.

731
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,599
[Constantine] No, no, no.

732
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
[Constantine grunting]

733
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,513
Don't accept anything from him, Gary.

734
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
[gasps]

735
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,559
[chuckling]

736
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,199
My nipple. [gasps]

737
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,000
Gary, listen to me. That part of you,
it belongs to hell now.

738
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,594
All right? Don't let it seduce you.

739
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,519
[Neron as Ray] The same way John
seduced you into being unicorn bait?

740
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,640
- [Gary groans]
- [all screaming]

741
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
[neighing]

742
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,395
It's beautiful.

743
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,360
[Constantine] It's cursed.

744
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,318
Now, back away from it, you bloody fool.

745
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,431
[Neron as Ray] It belongs to you, Gary.

746
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,456
[Constantine] Come on, Gary. Think about
what you're doing, all right?

747
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,760
Don't give in to his temptation.

748
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,074
How did I do?

749
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,516
[Mick] Time dweeb!
What the hell are you doing here?

750
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,592
- What do I do?
- [both] Shut up, Gary.

751
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,477
I'm tired of being a doormat.

752
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,310
[panting]

753
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,595
Gary, no.

754
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,072
Well done, Mr. Green.

755
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,356
I'm whole again.

756
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,834
[powering up]

757
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,912
[Gideon] All systems back online.

758
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,396
So, Zari, some big moves back there.

759
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,200
- Yeah, you were really brave.
- Thanks.

760
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,078
So why are you scared
to make a move on Nate?

761
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,310
[door opens]

762
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Nate.

763
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,994
[groaning]

764
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,194
What happened?

765
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,595
- Where is he?
- [Zari] Who?

766
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,994
Ray.

767
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,233
[panting]

768
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,834
Neron's got him.

769
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,110
[sighs]

770
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,995
Sara, hey!

771
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,834
We got you
a collectible RomantiCon tote bag.

772
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,989
- Who died?
- Yeah, what's going on?

773
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,239
I have some bad news.

774
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,761
- I told you, I'm fine.
- [doctor] She's stable, Director.

775
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,856
- Thank you.
- Ava, you shouldn't be here.

776
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,216
You should be scouring
every second of the timeline for Ray.

777
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,833
Agents are on it as we speak.

778
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,559
Why did he do that?

779
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,576
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
but I need your help.

780
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,434
[chuckles] My help?

781
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Why?

782
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,593
Because, no matter how many agents
I send after Neron,

783
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,736
none of them can do what you do.

784
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,071
None of them have the powers
you have, Nora.

785
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,552
And I trust you.

786
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,876
Nora Darhk, I'm asking you
to face another demon.

787
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,911
But this time, I'm asking you to face it

788
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,914
as a member of the Time Bureau.

789
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,472
Let's do this.

790
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you haven't recovered yet.

791
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,758
[clears throat]
We gotta track down Ray.

792
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,915
[Zari] You will,
when you're better. I promise.

793
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,469
You don't just throw a man down
with these sorts of injuries.

794
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,677
- It's mean-spirited.
- Don't be a baby.

795
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,719
- Does this hurt?
- Yes, Zari. It all hurts.

796
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,357
Where doesn't it hurt, Nate?

797
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,309
- Here?
- Yeah.

798
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,839
Here?

799
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,480
I guess there's an upside
to getting pummeled.

800
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,473
You know how I never let anyone know
what I'm...

801
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,990
really feeling?

802
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,192
It's kind of your thing.

803
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,960
That's how I feel, Nate.

804
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,112
I feel the same.

805
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,997

806
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,479
[exhales] Gideon?

807
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,553
What kind of egg is that?

808
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,552
[electronic whirring]

809
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,280
[Gideon] I believe, Dr. Heywood,
it's a dragon egg.

810
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
Oh...

811
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,676
Of course.

812
