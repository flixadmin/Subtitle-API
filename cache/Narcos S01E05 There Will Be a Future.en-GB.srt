1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,028
Beloved countrymen, the New Liberalism
party is the only force in Colombia

2
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,573
that is not afraid of narco-traffickers.

3
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,534
“There are three ways
the narco-traffickers …

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,289
—try to weaken extradition.”
—… try to weaken extradition.

5
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,624
—“Bribery …”
—Bribery …

6
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,711
—“… intimidation through violence …”
—… intimidation through violence …

7
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,880
—“… and extortion.”
—… and extortion!

8
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:51,218
—“A dark and terrible scourge.”
—A dark and terrible scourge.

9
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,511
What are you doing?

10
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,723
Just making sure he gets it right.

11
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,269
You wrote it, you should know.

12
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,984
Look, I brought you this.

13
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,986
What’s this?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,782
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

15
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,285
How’s Galán doing?

16
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:18,871
All right.

17
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,334
I wish he didn’t focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

18
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,211
There are other things to mention.

19
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,965
Galán’s got some balls.

20
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,636
Brave men have a way of dying.

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,805
Well, then …

22
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,600
you don’t have to worry … do you?

23
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,106
Pass me the socks.

24
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,825
Do you sleep with all your informants?

25
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,955
I’m not your responsibility.

26
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,505
If Pablo Escobar finds you …
he’ll kill you in a heartbeat.

27
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,510
Not if I kill him first.

28
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,550
Look at this shit.

29
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:53,182
We are spending millions of dollars …
and can’t even get a decent meal anywhere.

30
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:58,187
Listen … the problem isn’t the food,
the problem is Noriega.

31
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,524
First chance he gets,
he’ll sell us to the Americans.

32
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,109
You guys stay calm.

33
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,028
Once we reach an agreement
with the government,

34
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,487
we will be back in our homeland.

35
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,700
Pay the Colombian national debt
for amnesty?

36
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,828
I’d rather go live in Spain.

37
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:19,375
I say we go back and fight.

38
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,544
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

39
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,922
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

40
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,803
Let’s see, Gustavo.

41
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,680
None of this would’ve happened

42
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,891
if he hadn’t started
killing politicians and judges.

43
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,227
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

44
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,021
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

45
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,274
You know something, Pablo?

46
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,654
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won’t let you in their club.

47
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,532
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

48
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,430
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

49
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,268
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

50
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,272
It’s not safe to go back home.

51
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,256
They’ve rejected our amnesty deal.

52
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,470
We may have to stay.

53
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,684
I hate this place.

54
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,981
We can go someplace else.

55
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,732
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

56
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,653
In Switzerland, we are nobody, Pablo.

57
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,408
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can’t go home?

58
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,253
If we go back …
I’m going to have to fight.

59
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,930
Do whatever is necessary, my love.

60
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,705
You’re way ahead in the polls.

61
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,917
In my opinion, the outcome is decided.

62
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,213
My question is … why do you keep
getting involved with the narcos?

63
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,049
I want a country at peace.

64
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,135
And if I don’t do it, who will?

65
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,638
You’re pushing them into a corner.

66
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,600
I’m wearing a vest.

67
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,061
I’m afraid that a bulletproof vest …

68
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,273
isn’t enough to ensure
that you have a future.

69
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,279
Don’t worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

70
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,681
Let’s speak clearly, brother.

71
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,602
Galán’s dead.

72
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,062
You had him killed, didn’t you?

73
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,692
You didn’t tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

74
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,486
—I want to go home, Fabio.
—Home?

75
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,113
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

76
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,869
All this shit you like to talk about our
partnership, and then this on your own?

77
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,170
Galán was the only threat.

78
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,215
There is no one left to challenge us.

79
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,509
And you know why, Fabio.

80
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,513
Because no one has the balls that we have.

81
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,434
Going home.

82
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,490
That unique honesty.

83
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,660
The village stands up
and calls for justice.

84
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:50,706
I pray to God …
that this sacrifice will serve at last …

85
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:58,380
for society to react … and bond …
to support the government …

86
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,299
and institutions …

87
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,012
but also …
demanding a more effective work …

88
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:13,687
undeterred by the hitman and hijacking
or any other manifestation of violence.

89
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,733
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

90
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,068
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

91
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,280
to the danger of the narcos.

92
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,536
The assassin’s bullets …
will not stop what my father began.

93
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,998
As he fell, another rises in his place.

94
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,545
I want to tell Dr César Gaviria …

95
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,633
in the name of the people and my family …

96
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,470
that we entrust my father’s ideals to him,

97
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,388
and that he can count on our support …

98
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,601
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

99
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,608
Dr César Gaviria, save Colombia!

100
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,100
Phone!

101
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,896
Let it go to the answering machine.

102
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,276
The machine’s full.

103
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,740
I wish it would stop ringing.

104
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,283
It’s your friends.

105
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,951
They’re calling to offer support.

106
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,374
Or opinions about what I should do.

107
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,628
Why can’t you run
without backing extradition?

108
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,928
—I wrote those speeches.
—Yes …

109
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,681
but do you even believe them?

110
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,269
I don’t know what I believe.

111
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,691
I don’t want the narcos having free reign.

112
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,905
But I don’t want the United States
involved in our affairs.

113
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,699
So say nothing.

114
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,828
That’s the best way to stay alive.

115
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,178
Gentlemen.

116
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,767
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

117
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,727
We’re going home!

118
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,067
—How are you?
—Fine, my love.

119
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,571
What about you?

120
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,697
Give me one.

121
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,200
Margarita, right?

122
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,244
Let’s see.

123
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,415
—Son of a bitch, that’s good.
—Right.

124
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,374
Thank you.

125
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,377
Listen, I’ve got a question for you.

126
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,588
Why are we going back?

127
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,215
We’re walking into a world of shit.

128
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,177
Relax, brother.

129
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:37,015
Spain’s too far away
to protect our interests.

130
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,352
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

131
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,983
We need to be close by. Relax.

132
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,944
Don’t you get it?

133
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,240
He’s only comfortable at war.

134
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,701
He’s taking us to the slaughter.

135
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,397
How’s business?

136
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:32,029
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

137
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:36,407
Gacha’s Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

138
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,038
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

139
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,959
That the situation at home stays calm.

140
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,293
OK.

141
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,853
You should have consulted me about Galán.

142
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,815
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

143
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,195
I would have tried.

144
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,701
The amount of money we are losing
is due to that bullshit.

145
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,915
Are you listening?

146
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,667
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

147
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:38,136
I’ll die …
before I ever leave Colombia again.

148
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,186
What’s happening, Carrillo?

149
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,358
So you practice your English with me?

150
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,711
Yes.

151
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,880
I definitely like the red one best.

152
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,966
Truly?

153
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,635
I prefer the grey.

154
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,388
Red is the colour of the party,

155
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,267
and it makes you more …
sociable and close to the people.

156
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,769
And that’s important.

157
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,775
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

158
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,697
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

159
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:27,495
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth with a new look.

160
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,580
Now you are going to give me image advice?

161
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,499
I’m just thinking about the polls.

162
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,882
Anyway …
Galán had professionals at his side,

163
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,967
but which could he trust?

164
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,430
And you know well
that you can trust me, right?

165
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,021
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or grey?

166
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,574
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

167
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,827
“There will be a future.”

168
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,499
Now let’s see what kind of future it is.

169
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,341
We worked together in the ministry.

170
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:27,222
The idea he’s a presidential candidate
shows you our sad state of affairs.

171
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,808
I need to know which side he is on.

172
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,938
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

173
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,981
They’ll certainly ask his position.

174
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,482
Don’t worry, Pablo.

175
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,776
He’ll be easy to influence.

176
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,319
—No, I disagree.
—Why?

177
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,156
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

178
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,743
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

179
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:54,332
eating a bag of apples …
and reading economic reform textbooks.

180
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,252
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

181
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,588
He’s a bookworm, not a leader.

182
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,549
—No-- No--
—No, you’re missing my point.

183
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,009
He’s not an oligarch.

184
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,096
He’s from modest circumstances.

185
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,098
Like you,
he’s worked for everything he has.

186
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,559
You have to be careful
of people like that.

187
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,779
I want you to deliver a message.

188
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,449
We’ve made a lot of money.

189
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:33,997
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo … or chart our own course?

190
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,294
We should talk to our friends down south.

191
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:43,173
No, no. It’s not time. No.

192
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,009
Whatever you say.

193
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,511
Have you seen Marina?

194
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,180
She told me she was going
to buy a new brush.

195
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:53,016
You know your sister.

196
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,935
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

197
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,904
You don’t have any idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

198
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,075
It seems to be you really wanted to.

199
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,661
—Come here, baby.
—You are very patient.

200
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,038
Yes, of course.

201
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,000
All your people were there,
your brothers …

202
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,220
My brothers are driving me crazy.

203
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,307
—You know what?
—What?

204
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,434
They can go fuck themselves.

205
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,853
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain …

206
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,814
but you’re staying here with me.

207
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,408
Let’s not hide anymore.

208
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,492
Not anymore.

209
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,746
All right.

210
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,750
What do we do about my wife?

211
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,505
Ask Pablo to do us a favour.

212
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,177
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

213
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,937
You …

214
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,148
are very evil for such a young girl.

215
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,988
You’ve moved up, Fernando.

216
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:38,955
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar’s errand boy.

217
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:43,084
I guess the pay is much better.

218
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,753
I’m not doing this for the money.

219
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:51,384
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

220
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,970
I understand your dilemma.

221
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:59,934
Speak out in favour … you’re seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

222
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,439
Speak out against, you anger the US …

223
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,485
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

224
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,071
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

225
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,992
It would be an honour for me,
and would benefit us both.

226
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,454
What a great idea.

227
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,957
You guys are really shameless, aren’t you?

228
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,626
How do you sleep at night?

229
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,920
César, it doesn’t have to be this way.

230
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,841
If Luis had been as smart as you,

231
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,051
perhaps we could have
avoided this horrible tragedy.

232
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,014
We could have had peace.

233
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,390
Easy.

234
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,563
Get out.

235
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,399
Read Pablo’s letter.

236
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,819
Maybe you will have a future.

237
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,232
Cousin, what happened?

238
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:55,901
Where were you?

239
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,696
—In the office.
—In the office?

240
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,905
Yes.

241
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,241
Is that where you were?

242
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:06,996
That’s weird …

243
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,626
because I called
and they said you hadn’t been in all day.

244
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:15,129
I don’t know which office you called,
but I was there.

245
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,132
They’re seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts--

246
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:22,136
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

247
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,722
Relax, Gustavo.

248
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,059
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

249
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,864
What are you going to do?
Are you going to kill us both?

250
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,075
—You afraid to die?
—No. And you?

251
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,878
—Put it out.
—Where were you?

252
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:57,755
Put it out, Pablo.

253
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,717
Put it out, Pablo!

254
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:10,976
Are you with me or what?

255
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,648
And when have I not been with you?

256
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:22,655
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

257
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,077
I cannot do this without you.

258
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,875
You’re doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

259
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,088
No.

260
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,803
But I’m having serious doubts
with the Ochoas.

261
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,772
Time to thin the herd.

262
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,443
But did we score a goal?

263
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,070
The reporter, right.

264
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,701
Let’s make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

265
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:35,872
Come on, come on.

266
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,981
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

267
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,609
I don’t give a fuck.

268
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,612
Horacio … don’t give up.

269
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,283
You’ve always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

270
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,369
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we’ve done?

271
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,496
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

272
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,916
I’m not here for fun.

273
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,584
What happens is the defence minister

274
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,087
gives you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

275
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,341
So … then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

276
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,427
Is that why you’re doing that?
Is that what you want?

277
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,472
Horacio … you remember when were cadets,

278
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:38,434
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country’s most important unit.

279
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:42,354
Horacio, as your friend …
I’m asking you to think about it.

280
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,982
Rodrigo, I don’t even know who Pablo pays.

281
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,359
It could be any of us three.

282
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,445
Horacio, please.

283
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,114
I’ve put my family at risk.

284
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,743
I need the right tools …
if there is going to be a war.

285
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,704
All right.

286
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,038
Perfect.

287
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,166
Then tell me what you need.

288
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,129
Incorruptible men.

289
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,825
Hey, punk. Are you all right?

290
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,994
—Sure.
—Come here.

291
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,231
How are you, son?

292
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,527
How are you?

293
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,839
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

294
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,846
Carrillo’s a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

295
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,806
I’ve tried, believe me.

296
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,391
Then offer more.

297
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:47,938
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

298
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:52,943
That’s true.

299
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:59,324
It’s silver or lead.
That’s the choice for that bastard.

300
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:04,413
Speaking of lead,
I’m getting a shipment of weapons in.

301
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,331
Uzis, grenades …

302
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:12,337
If I could find a nuclear weapon …
But now I’m negotiating a fucking missile.

303
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,507
—A missile? No fucking way.
—Yes.

304
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,884
Boss.

305
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,483
He’s bullshitting, right?

306
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:37,863
He’s smoking that shit …
I guarantee it.

307
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,118
Motherfucker.

308
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:55,131
Mrs Quiroga told me
the neighbours on the block took a vote.

309
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,257
They want us to move.

310
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,804
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

311
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,430
That’s what scares them.

312
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,060
Come here.

313
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,397
It won’t always be so, my love.

314
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,466
—Rodrigo.
—Hello, Horacio.

315
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,426
—Everything good?
—May I speak to you?

316
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,095
Yes, sure. Come in.

317
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,682
Let’s talk about the incorruptibles.

318
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,852
I’m listening.

319
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:01,238
I’ve been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

320
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,825
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

321
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,662
Horacio … that’s US dollars, not pesos.

322
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,083
Instructed by whom?

323
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,962
I think you can guess.

324
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,340
Say the name.

325
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,134
You know who.

326
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,803
Say the name, Rodrigo.

327
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,767
Escobar.

328
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,067
Don’t look at me like that, Horacio.

329
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,485
I’ve always cared for you.

330
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,865
I’m making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

331
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,369
This man has tentacles.

332
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,289
I’m surprised
he hasn’t killed you already.

333
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,333
Get out.

334
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,213
Horacio, please--

335
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:08,847
Horacio …

336
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,857
Take care.

337
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,579
It was about time, Navegante.

338
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:48,853
Finally, a romantic date.

339
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,107
It’s been a long time
since we’ve been alone.

340
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,653
Just you, me …
and our bodyguard.

341
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,952
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

342
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,623
—My father adored you.
—Yeah, right.

343
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,726
Garcia …

344
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,776
THE EXTRADITABLES

345
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:46,786
Hello? Yes.

346
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,459
Yes.

347
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,838
But everything is fine?

348
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,176
All right.

349
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,110
Ana?

350
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,665
Ana?

351
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,175
Ana?

352
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:47,556
Ana!

353
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,479
A little bird … came into the house.

354
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,732
I’m helping it out.

355
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,160
What?

356
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,501
There was an assassination attempt …

357
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:21,047
on Colonel Carrillo.

358
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,424
Did someone die?

359
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,052
One of his men.

360
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:32,058
It must be terrible,
the position you’re in.

361
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,062
I want you to know …
I think you are very brave.

362
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:42,652
I’m not brave. Not like Galán.

363
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,947
That fear keeps you alive.

364
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,076
That’s what none of them understand.

365
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,459
I will support any decision you make.

366
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,409
Hello?

367
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,830
You think you’re hot shit?

368
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,290
You should change your satellite phone.

369
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,585
Who is this?

370
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:13,255
Your mother’s in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.

371
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:17,677
And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.

372
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,762
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that--

373
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:23,725
What, you think because you’re a cop
I’m afraid of you or something?

374
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,477
You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.

375
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:27,770
Don’t forget that.

376
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:29,146
Gonorrhœa bastard son of a bitch.

377
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,399
Why don’t you take money
like everyone else?

378
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,235
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

379
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,741
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

380
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,910
and you should be smart enough to realize

381
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:46,622
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

382
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:49,291
Not everyone’s for sale, Pablo.

383
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,128
You just keep hiding and I will find you.

384
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,629
Don’t know when …

385
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,590
but I will find you.

386
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,051
And when I find you …

387
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:00,970
—I’m going to kill you.
—I’m going to kill you, fag!

388
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:03,681
I’m going to kill
you and your entire family!

389
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,579
This, then, is war.
