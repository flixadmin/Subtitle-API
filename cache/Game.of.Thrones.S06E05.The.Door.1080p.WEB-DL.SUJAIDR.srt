1
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:59,807
Yes?

2
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,811
For you, my lady.

3
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,249
How far is Mole's Town?

4
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:34,592
Sansa.

5
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:40,347
Lady Brienne.

6
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,270
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

7
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,524
You have no idea how happy I am

8
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,276
to see you unharmed.

9
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,646
Unharmed?

10
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:57,448
What are you doing here?

11
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,417
I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

12
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:03,370
<i>They're encamped
at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>

13
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:05,272
To come to my aid?

14
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,610
Did you know about Ramsay?

15
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,945
If you didn't know,
you're an idiot.

16
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,448
If you did know,
you're my enemy.

17
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,918
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

18
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,323
He never hurt my face.

19
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:25,926
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

20
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:33,017
But the rest of me,

21
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,235
he did what he liked
with the rest of me

22
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,606
<i>as long as I could
still give him an heir.</i>

23
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,607
What do you think he did?

24
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,316
I can't begin to contemplate...

25
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,658
What do you think he did to me?

26
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:02,846
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

27
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,415
He beat you.

28
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:05,799
Yes, he enjoyed that.

29
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,401
What else do you think he did?

30
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,637
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

31
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,807
Did he cut you?

32
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,646
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
- I didn't know.

33
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,648
I thought you knew
everyone's secrets.

34
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,068
I made a mistake,
a horrible mistake.

35
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:25,786
I underestimated a stranger.

36
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:28,855
The other things he did,

37
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,741
ladies aren't supposed
to talk about those things,

38
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:33,661
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

39
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,499
I can still feel it.

40
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:41,719
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

41
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:45,673
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

42
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:51,228
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:53,230
You said you would protect me.

44
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,883
And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

45
00:04:56,986 --> 00:05:00,437
I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

46
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,356
You can't protect me.

47
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,324
You won't even be able
to protect yourself

48
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,694
if I tell Brienne
to cut you down.

49
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,664
And why shouldn't I?

50
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,836
Do you want me
to beg for my life?

51
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,255
If that's what you want, I will.

52
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,760
Whatever you ask
that is in my power,

53
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,077
I will do.

54
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,015
What if I want you
to die here and now?

55
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,752
Then I will die.

56
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:37,090
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

57
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:41,228
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

58
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,948
<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>

59
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,451
My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

60
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,102
I never want to see you again.

61
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:52,406
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

62
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,077
I know that I can't.

63
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,882
Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,055
<i>Your great-uncle
Brynden the Blackfish</i>

65
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,809
has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

66
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,061
You might consider
seeking him out.

67
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,464
The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

68
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,566
I have an army.

69
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,601
Your brother's army.

70
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,160
Half-brother.

71
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,141
You're not ready.

72
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,363
You should go home
before it's too late.

73
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:06,340
You'll never be
one of us, Lady Stark.

74
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,223
She has a point.

75
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:32,699
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

76
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,769
They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

77
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,404
Who was the first?

78
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,906
He was no one.

79
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:43,243
The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

80
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,962
and how to give the gift.

81
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,498
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

82
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:52,052
Many served, many more
gifts were given.

83
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:55,005
Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

84
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,307
and the Faceless Men fled.

85
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,226
Where did they go?

86
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,928
Here.

87
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:04,314
They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

88
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,652
These were the faces
they wore in life

89
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,304
when they were not
wearing others.

90
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,157
The first Faceless Men.

91
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,494
And now a girl is one of them,

92
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,780
if a girl desires.

93
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,450
A girl has no desires.

94
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,292
Who?

95
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,502
<i>An actress who calls
herself Lady Crane.</i>

96
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,472
She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

97
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,193
<i>A girl has been given
a second chance.</i>

98
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,512
There will not be a third.

99
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:54,698
One way or another,

100
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,818
a face will be
added to the hall.

101
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:19,423
Ahh!

102
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:24,094
Oh, murdered by a boar.

103
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,763
The great big hairy whore.

104
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:30,434
He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

105
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,987
and soon I am no more.

106
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,990
Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

107
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,993
I love you, Father.
Please don't die.

108
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,747
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

109
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:47,584
I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

110
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:51,088
And our son alone
on that cold, cold throne

111
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,340
without a guiding hand.

112
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:56,710
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

113
00:10:56,795 --> 00:11:00,714
To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

114
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,384
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

115
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:08,772
Ooh!

116
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,441
Ooh, what's happened here, then?

117
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,393
He brought you here, Ned Stark,

118
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,896
'cause you're the brightest
fellow in the land.

119
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,564
You should be king of us all

120
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,866
and I should be your Hand.

121
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,202
We men of the North
are right good hands

122
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,104
at keeping people lawful.

123
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:25,839
I'd ask him for permission,

124
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:28,108
but he smells too bloody awful.

125
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:33,163
<i>I die! I die!</i>

126
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:36,449
And here I now must lie.

127
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:40,137
Oh, woe.
Oh, no.

128
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,126
Oh, I am about to go.

129
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,230
Will you stay on
as Joffrey's Hand?

130
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,265
The Iron Throne's what I demand.

131
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:53,266
- You cannot.
- I can.

132
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:54,267
- You will not.
- I will.

133
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,019
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

134
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:58,238
<i>- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?</i>

135
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:00,107
<i>- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?</i>

136
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,642
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

137
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,841
So move along, give me my chair

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,043
and there won't be
no more trouble.

139
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:26,166
But we had a deal
all done and dusted.

140
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:29,469
I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.

141
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,815
Save my father.

142
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,420
Truly you should.
Killing the man will do you no good.

143
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:47,704
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

144
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:50,323
<i>Show the people what
a good king should be.</i>

145
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,659
Good people, you may all relax.

146
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,878
My father's friend
shall be spared the...

147
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:00,383
<i>Father! No!</i>

148
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:03,170
Oh, Father.
Oh!

149
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,880
<i>Worry not!</i>

150
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,482
<i>All is well.</i>

151
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,484
I have here a decree

152
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:20,353
from my father Tywin Lannister,

153
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,555
the richest man you'll see.

154
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:25,192
He proclaims me
Hand of the King.

155
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:27,077
The position's mine for life.

156
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,562
And he's given me
permission to take

157
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,781
Sansa as my wife.

158
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,620
You'll learn that
what I lack in height,

159
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,955
I make up for in appetite.

160
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,424
<i>So let's forget
about your plight,</i>

161
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:43,627
and go rehearse
our wedding night.

162
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:55,855
It's a wart.
Two warts.

163
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,774
I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.

164
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:01,728
Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

165
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:05,098
Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.

166
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,434
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

167
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,203
I had two lines.

168
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,505
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

169
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:14,157
I rang very false?

170
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:17,160
What you need, love,
is for someone to ring you true.

171
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,631
You weren't complaining
about me last night.

172
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,710
<i>May I get you some wine,
Lady Crane?</i>

173
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:25,835
<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>

174
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,171
You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

175
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,839
Of course we're going
to be intimate.

176
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,509
It's only a matter of time.

177
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,230
To our children.

178
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,316
May they have your talent.

179
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,318
And your filthy mind.

180
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,443
A girl will poison the rum.

181
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,779
Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

182
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:59,869
If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

183
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,122
A girl is not ready.

184
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:07,093
She's a good actress.

185
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,512
So a man has heard.

186
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,465
Seems like a decent woman.

187
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,888
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

188
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:22,525
No.

189
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:27,847
Who wants her dead?

190
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,734
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

191
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,521
The younger actress.

192
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:38,958
She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

193
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:42,644
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

194
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,715
A girl has decided.

195
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:49,469
A servant does not
ask questions.

196
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,408
No! No! No!

197
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:26,800
It was you.

198
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,601
You made the white walkers.

199
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,820
We were at war.

200
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,323
<i>We were being slaughtered.</i>

201
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:35,859
<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>

202
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,678
We needed to defend ourselves.

203
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,280
From whom?

204
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,916
From you.

205
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,201
From men.

206
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,547
We speak in the presence
of the Drowned God.

207
00:17:57,632 --> 00:17:59,716
In his name we gather today

208
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:03,436
to choose a new king
as our leader.

209
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,388
Who makes a claim?

210
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,562
I am Yara Greyjoy,

211
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,064
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

212
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,400
King of the Iron Islands.

213
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,686
I claim the Salt Throne.

214
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,356
We've never had a queen.
Not once.

215
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,875
There are many things
we've never done.

216
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,711
We've never made our mark
upon the world.

217
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,248
The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

218
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:35,385
until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

219
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:37,136
<i>long enough
to become a nuisance.</i>

220
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:39,506
Then they swat us down.

221
00:18:39,591 --> 00:18:43,092
They conquer us, humiliate us,

222
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:45,645
<i>and go right back
to forgetting we exist.</i>

223
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,647
Aye!

224
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,066
- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

225
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:53,436
- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

226
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,688
When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that...

227
00:18:55,774 --> 00:18:57,490
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

228
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:00,159
Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

229
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,580
Not when Balon's
own male heir has returned.

230
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,642
I am Theon Greyjoy...

231
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:37,030
last living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

232
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,657
And she is your rightful ruler.

233
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:48,992
Aye!

234
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,710
Those of you that have
sailed under her,

235
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,712
and there are many of you here,

236
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:55,415
- <i>you know what she is.</i>
- Aye!

237
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,799
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

238
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,135
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

239
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,004
She is ironborn!

240
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,722
Aye!

241
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:05,391
We will find no better leader.

242
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,263
This is our queen.

243
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,472
<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

244
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:22,158
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

245
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:24,694
I claim the Salt Throne.

246
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,340
Niece.

247
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:39,927
Nephew.

248
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,596
Little Theon.

249
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:48,184
Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

250
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:51,688
<i>Captured a castle
you couldn't keep.</i>

251
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:54,807
Got yourself taken prisoner.

252
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:57,110
Even heard you have no cock.

253
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:03,366
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

254
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,234
When did you return, Uncle?

255
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,537
A few days ago.

256
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,022
I had some things
to take care of.

257
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,874
Long overdue.

258
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:14,744
I'm glad you're here.

259
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:20,500
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

260
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:23,419
To execute the man
who killed my father.

261
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:31,344
I did.

262
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:33,563
I killed him.

263
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,650
Threw him right over
a rope bridge

264
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:40,903
and watched him fall.

265
00:21:41,022 --> 00:21:42,689
<i>He was leading us nowhere</i>

266
00:21:42,774 --> 00:21:45,408
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

267
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,578
<i>No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.</i>

268
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:51,414
He led us into two wars
we couldn't win.

269
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:55,501
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

270
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,787
That would have been hard to do.

271
00:21:57,872 --> 00:21:59,872
You weren't here.

272
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,543
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

273
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:05,094
Gallivanting?

274
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:06,912
That the sort of thing
you start to say

275
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,432
once your dick gets chopped off?

276
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,385
<i>Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?</i>

277
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,555
You were gone.

278
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,140
Yara was here.

279
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,942
<i>Being ironborn.
Leading ironborn.</i>

280
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:22,945
<i>Getting ready to bring us
back to glory.</i>

281
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:24,530
<i>And how will she do that?</i>

282
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:28,985
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

283
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:35,408
Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

284
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,794
<i>because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.</i>

285
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,378
<i>I've been all over the world.</i>

286
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:42,799
I've seen more of it
than all of you combined.

287
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,835
And across the sea
there is a person

288
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,789
who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

289
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,475
Someone with a large army,

290
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:56,345
three large dragons,
and no husband.

291
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,681
<i>I'm going to build that fleet</i>

292
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,983
and I'm going to
gallivant right over

293
00:23:01,102 --> 00:23:03,236
and give it
to Daenerys Targaryen

294
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,738
along with my big cock.

295
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:07,824
You're going to seduce
the Dragon Queen?

296
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:11,160
I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

297
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,080
And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

298
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:17,533
I wasn't born to be king.

299
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:20,152
I paid the iron price

300
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:21,704
and here I stand.

301
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:27,260
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

302
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:31,297
Euron! Euron!
Euron! Euron!

303
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,549
Euron! Euron!

304
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:47,480
May Euron, your servant,
be born again

305
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:50,116
from the sea as you were.

306
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:53,286
<i>Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.</i>

307
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:55,288
<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

308
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:58,023
<i>Listen to the waves.
Listen to the god.</i>

309
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:01,244
<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

310
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:06,382
<i>we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

311
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,702
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

312
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:12,054
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

313
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:14,974
<i>Let his lungs
fill with seawater.</i>

314
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:23,933
<i>Let the fish eat
the scales off his eyes.</i>

315
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:26,602
<i>What is dead may never die,</i>

316
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:30,356
but rises again
harder and stronger.

317
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:39,675
What is dead may never die.

318
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:43,012
What is dead
may never die.

319
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:59,412
Where are my niece and nephew?

320
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,502
Let's go murder them.

321
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,774
<i>They stole our best ships.</i>

322
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:32,061
Won't be enough to save them.

323
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:36,015
Go back to your homes.

324
00:26:36,117 --> 00:26:38,484
Chop down every tree
you can find.

325
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:41,153
Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

326
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,322
I want every man bending planks.

327
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:46,909
I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

328
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:49,328
Build me a thousand ships

329
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:51,881
and I will give you this world.

330
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:13,819
I banished you twice.

331
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:18,074
You came back twice.

332
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:23,329
And you saved my life.

333
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:29,952
So I can't take you back

334
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:32,171
and I can't send you away.

335
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:36,956
You must send me away.

336
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,423
Is there a cure?

337
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:53,809
I don't know.

338
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:56,779
How long does it take?

339
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:59,398
I don't know that either.

340
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,964
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

341
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:05,444
I'll end things before that.

342
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,709
I'm sorry.

343
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:12,962
I'm so sorry.

344
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,280
Don't be.

345
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:17,833
All I've ever wanted
was to serve you.

346
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:23,589
Tyrion Lannister was right.

347
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,811
I love you.

348
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:35,434
I'll always love you.

349
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,024
Good-bye, khaleesi.

350
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:49,698
Do not walk away
from your queen,

351
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:51,867
Jorah the Andal.

352
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:56,288
You have not been dismissed.

353
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,009
You pledged yourself to me.

354
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:03,429
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

355
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:09,051
<i>Well, I command you
to find the cure</i>

356
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:11,687
<i>wherever it is in this world.</i>

357
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:16,775
I command you to heal yourself

358
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,728
<i>and then return to me.</i>

359
00:29:22,817 --> 00:29:25,568
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

360
00:29:25,653 --> 00:29:28,154
I need you by my side.

361
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:10,529
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

362
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:13,916
how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

363
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,584
None.

364
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:18,623
And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

365
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:21,290
Two, but that was
the day of the pact.

366
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,125
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

367
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,245
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

368
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:27,713
For now.

369
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,715
For now is the best we
get in our profession.

370
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,300
It's not enough.

371
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,219
Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

372
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,864
I'd say it's a good start.

373
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,473
It's not enough
for Meereen to have peace.

374
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:40,042
They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

375
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:42,928
The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

376
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,197
Resist the foreign invaders.

377
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,399
Our queen has
an even better story.

378
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:52,154
Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains and all that.

379
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,623
The people know
who brought them freedom.

380
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:57,209
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

381
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:59,328
Who brought about
an end to the violence?

382
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:02,047
We need someone
the people trust,

383
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:05,551
someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

384
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,787
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

385
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,140
Who said anything about "him"?

386
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,836
That's about the extent
of my Valyrian.

387
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:49,428
Thank you for travelling
all this way.

388
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:53,349
I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

389
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:01,106
The truth is we need your help.

390
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:04,310
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to...

391
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,676
You don't need to persuade me.

392
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:08,530
I came to help.

393
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:11,817
Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

394
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:15,788
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

395
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:17,873
Yes.

396
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,858
She has freed the slaves
from their chains

397
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,495
and crucified the Masters
for their sins.

398
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:25,364
She did indeed.

399
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:28,334
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

400
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,252
a gift from the Lord of Light.

401
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:33,255
But you heard all of this before,
haven't you?

402
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:35,724
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

403
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:41,397
<i>The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>

404
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:43,882
burning their sins
and flesh away.

405
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:48,687
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

406
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:51,774
The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

407
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:55,060
You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

408
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:57,946
And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

409
00:32:58,032 --> 00:32:59,731
to be worshipped and obeyed.

410
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:03,068
I'd settle for obeyed.

411
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,171
<i>I will summon
my most eloquent priests.</i>

412
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:08,874
They will spread the word.

413
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:12,577
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

414
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,765
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

415
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:18,350
That sounds most excellent.

416
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:21,420
A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

417
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:24,273
as the chosen one
by one of your priestesses.

418
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:27,226
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

419
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:30,479
He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

420
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:32,698
by the man standing beside me.

421
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,250
Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

422
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:39,538
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

423
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:42,741
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

424
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,944
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

425
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:49,581
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

426
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,834
You're always right.

427
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,553
Everything is the Lord's will.

428
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,307
Everything is the Lord's will.

429
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:01,176
But men and women make mistakes.

430
00:34:01,262 --> 00:34:03,228
Even honest servants
of the Lord.

431
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:07,266
And you,
an honest servant of the Lord,

432
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:09,852
why should I trust you
to know any more

433
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:11,857
than the priestess
who counseled Stannis?

434
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:14,907
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

435
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:17,743
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

436
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,837
Everyone is what they are

437
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:28,653
and where they are for a reason.

438
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:31,924
Terrible things
happen for a reason.

439
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:35,677
Take what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when you were a child.

440
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:39,131
<i>If not for your mutilation</i>

441
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:41,133
<i>at the hand of
a second-rate sorcerer,</i>

442
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:44,470
<i>you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen</i>

443
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:47,672
<i>bring his light into the world.</i>

444
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:51,009
Knowledge has made you powerful.

445
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:54,196
But there's still
so much you don't know.

446
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:59,318
<i>Do you remember
what you heard that night</i>

447
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:02,955
<i>when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?</i>

448
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:08,660
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

449
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:14,967
Should I tell you
what the voice said?

450
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:18,637
Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

451
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:30,432
We serve the same queen.

452
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:32,568
If you are her true friend,

453
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:35,320
you have nothing
to fear from me.

454
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:26,798
What?

455
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:12,554
He saw me, the Night King!

456
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:14,823
- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.

457
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:18,493
I don't know.
He was close, but...

458
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:19,579
He touched you.

459
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,949
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

460
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:26,435
But he can't get in.

461
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:30,088
He can now.
His mark is on you.

462
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:32,254
You must leave, all of you.

463
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,129
<i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>

464
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:40,015
Hodor.

465
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,084
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

466
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:45,087
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

467
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:48,240
For you to become me.

468
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:52,427
But am I ready?

469
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,446
No.

470
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:59,117
We can't defend the north
from the walkers

471
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,952
and the south from the Boltons.

472
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:02,987
If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

473
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,874
and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

474
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,763
<i>Aside from the Starks
and the Boltons,</i>

475
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:14,549
the most powerful
houses in the North

476
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:16,685
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

477
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:18,436
and the Manderlys.

478
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:21,223
The Umbers and the Karstarks

479
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,275
have already declared
for the Boltons,

480
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,993
so we're not doing
so well there.

481
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:27,729
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

482
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,065
But the Karstarks
declared for Ramsay

483
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,684
without knowing
they had another choice.

484
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:35,120
I beg your pardon, my lady,

485
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:38,356
but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

486
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,818
I don't think we can
count on them either.

487
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,846
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

488
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,331
Precious little, my lady.

489
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,550
<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>

490
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:52,370
More loyal,
more suspicious of outsiders.

491
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,038
They may well be loyal,

492
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:56,091
but how many rose up
against the Boltons

493
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:58,256
when they betrayed your family?

494
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:02,898
I may not know the North,
but I know men.

495
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:05,517
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

496
00:41:05,602 --> 00:41:08,520
and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

497
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,923
their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

498
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:15,360
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

499
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,412
they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

500
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,081
There are more than three
other houses in the North...

501
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,834
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

502
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,536
<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

503
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:28,239
Two dozen more.
Together they equal all the others.

504
00:41:28,342 --> 00:41:30,292
We can start small and build.

505
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:32,844
<i>The North remembers.</i>

506
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,412
<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>

507
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:36,414
People will still risk
everything for it,

508
00:41:36,516 --> 00:41:38,717
from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.

509
00:41:38,802 --> 00:41:41,019
I don't doubt it.

510
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,221
But Jon doesn't have
the Stark name.

511
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:45,390
No, but I do.

512
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:50,929
Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son

513
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,814
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

514
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,950
<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>

515
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:58,036
<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>

516
00:41:58,121 --> 00:41:59,654
I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

517
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,706
My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it

518
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,041
and retaken Riverrun.

519
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:05,210
How do you know that?

520
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,581
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

521
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:13,335
That's good.

522
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,453
The Blackfish is a legend.

523
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:17,956
His support would mean
a great deal.

524
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:21,059
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

525
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:23,504
almost starts to look
like a winning side.

526
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:27,849
I've sworn
to protect you, my lady.

527
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,734
You heard them.
We need more men

528
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,636
and my uncle has an army.

529
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,271
We can send
the Blackfish a raven.

530
00:42:33,357 --> 00:42:35,407
Can't risk Ramsay
intercepting it.

531
00:42:35,492 --> 00:42:37,158
It has to be you.

532
00:42:37,277 --> 00:42:39,558
Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you

533
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:42,013
and you'll know
how to talk to him.

534
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:45,200
What is it?

535
00:42:47,004 --> 00:42:49,054
I don't like leaving
you here alone.

536
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:50,438
With Jon?

537
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,324
Not him.
He seems trustworthy.

538
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:55,427
A bit brooding, perhaps.

539
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,595
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

540
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,182
The others, though.

541
00:43:03,353 --> 00:43:07,005
Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

542
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,707
with bloodmagic.

543
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,393
<i>And when Stannis paid for his crime,
where were they?</i>

544
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:15,697
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

545
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:18,233
And that wildling fellow
with the beard...

546
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,638
Jon isn't Tormund.
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman

547
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:24,689
or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.

548
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,243
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

549
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:34,649
Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

550
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:45,543
New dress?

551
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:48,379
I made it myself.
Do you like it?

552
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:52,484
Yeah, it's...
I like the wolf bit.

553
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:56,688
Good, because I made
this for you.

554
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,693
<i>I made it like the one
Father used to wear.</i>

555
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:04,696
As near as I can remember.

556
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,166
Thank you, Sansa.

557
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:09,918
You're welcome.

558
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,590
Don't knock it down
while I'm gone.

559
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:34,609
I'll do my best.

560
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:42,150
Good luck.

561
00:45:13,266 --> 00:45:15,817
Should we close the gate,
Lord Commander?

562
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:18,019
I'm not the Lord Comman...

563
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:26,744
Yeah, ahem,
close the bloody gate.

564
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:40,491
<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>

565
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:43,161
Well, maybe not home home,

566
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:45,463
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

567
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:46,965
Hodor.

568
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,100
Eat something that isn't moss.

569
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:53,638
I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

570
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:56,674
Boiled? Fried up
with some butter?

571
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:58,359
Hodor.

572
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:02,030
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

573
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,448
Hodor.

574
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:05,593
Get Bran and run!

575
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:19,857
Bran.
Bran, wake up.

576
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:22,977
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

577
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:24,612
Bran, wake up.

578
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,275
<i>- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
- Take it easy.</i>

579
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:38,493
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

580
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:42,947
Hodor.

581
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:44,999
Hodor. Hodor.

582
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:47,585
Help me!

583
00:48:07,023 --> 00:48:08,503
<i>Go!</i>

584
00:48:09,276 --> 00:48:10,775
Go!

585
00:48:57,991 --> 00:49:00,241
<i>Remember that
you are a Stark.</i>

586
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:02,710
Comport yourself
with dignity at the Vale

587
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:05,196
<i>and try to stay out of fights.</i>

588
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:07,665
Yes, Father.

589
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:12,220
But if you have to fight, win.

590
00:49:13,973 --> 00:49:17,759
Bran!
Bran, wake up!

591
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:31,155
Bran! Bran!
Bran, wake up.

592
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,025
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

593
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,189
You have to wake up.

594
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,501
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

595
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:45,236
<i>Bran, we need Hodor.</i>

596
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:47,738
<i>Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

597
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:52,093
Hodor. Hodor.

598
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,586
Bran, we're all going to die!

599
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:04,305
<i>Bran, wake up!</i>

600
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:07,892
<i>We're all going to die!
Bran! Bran!</i>

601
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:09,811
Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.

602
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:11,479
Hodor. Hodor.

603
00:50:11,564 --> 00:50:13,815
Warg into Hodor now!

604
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,983
<i>Bran, wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

605
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:19,203
<i>We need Hodor.
Warg into Hodor now! Now!</i>

606
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:21,322
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

607
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:24,542
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

608
00:50:24,627 --> 00:50:26,444
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

609
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:28,629
Hodor.
Hodor.

610
00:51:03,366 --> 00:51:06,417
- Summer!
<i>- Go.</i>

611
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,085
Go!

612
00:51:45,308 --> 00:51:47,348
<i>The time has come.</i>

613
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:52,213
Leave me.

614
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:20,074
- What are you doing?
- Go!

615
00:53:09,242 --> 00:53:11,275
Hodor, hurry!

616
00:53:11,377 --> 00:53:12,377
Hodor!

617
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:33,014
Hold the door!

618
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:35,483
<i>Hold the door!</i>

619
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:40,821
<i>Hold the door!</i>

620
00:53:43,076 --> 00:53:45,493
<i>Hold the door!</i>

<i>- Hold the door!
- Wylis!</i>

623
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,846
What's the matter?

624
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:08,683
- <i>Hold the door!</i>
- Come on, son.

625
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:10,434
Hold the door!

626
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:20,111
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

627
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:23,564
Hold the door!
Hold the door!

628
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,650
Hold the door!

00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:27,652
<i>Hold the door!</i>

00:54:55,515 --> 00:54:57,898
