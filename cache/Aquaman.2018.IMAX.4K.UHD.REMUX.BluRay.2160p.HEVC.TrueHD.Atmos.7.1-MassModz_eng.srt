1
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,451
Jules Verne once wrote,

2
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,997
"Put two ships in the open sea

3
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:13,583
without wind or tide,
they will come together.”

4
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:40,276
That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other.

5
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,907
We are something else.
Try Arthur Treacher...

6
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,291
It's okay.

7
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,637
Easy. You weren't breathing.

8
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,361
They were
from different worlds.

9
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:29,325
But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.

10
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:13,619
Uh...

11
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,789
I was gonna make you some eggs.

12
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,584
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

13
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,339
It's okay.

14
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,091
I made tea.

15
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:33,431
Goon, try it.

16
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,765
It'll make you better.

17
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,830
So, uh, who are you?

18
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,544
Atlanna.

19
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,173
Queen of Atlantis.

20
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:09,842
Wow.

21
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,681
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

22
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,173
She had fled
an arranged marriage.

23
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,133
Left her whole world behind.

24
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:55,554
But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something unexpected.

25
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,311
And my father
found the love of his life.

26
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,692
Category 4 Hurricane Arthur

27
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:11,320
is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.

28
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,614
How about Arthur?

29
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,825
After the hurricane?

30
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,954
After a legend. He's a king, isn't he?

31
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,457
He's more than that.

32
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:26,335
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

33
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,755
He could unite our worlds one day.

34
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:41,767
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

35
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:47,106
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

36
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,777
It made him so powerful
that the ocean itself became jealous

37
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:55,573
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

38
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:58,576
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

39
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:03,122
But, legend has it
that one day a new king will come

40
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,583
who will use the power of the trident

41
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,544
to put Atlantis back together again.

42
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:16,552
Take him!

43
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:36,447
Queen Atlanna,

44
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:41,285
by the authority of King Orvax,
you are ordered to return to Atlantis.

45
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,745
Atlanna!

46
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,833
But Atlantis' memory is long...

47
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:52,379
And its king refused to let her go.

48
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,061
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

49
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,313
- My weapon!
- Here!

50
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,884
Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,

51
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,137
and I was a product of a love
that never should've been.

52
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,098
You don't have to do this, Atlanna.
Please.

53
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,601
No. They will always find me.

54
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,895
Next time, they'll send an army.

55
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:56,527
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

56
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,532
Save you.

57
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:08,038
Where I come from...

58
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,584
The sea carries our tears away.

59
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,255
Not here.

60
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:19,258
Here you feel them.

61
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,520
I will return to you. When it's safe.

62
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,397
One day.

63
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:36,442
Right here, at sunrise.

64
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:40,821
We'll be together again.

65
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:45,242
You stay strong, my little prince.

66
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:47,745
I'll always be with you.

67
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,339
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

68
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:29,078
All life came from the sea,
so if we want to understand ourselves,

69
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,954
we must journey to where we began.

70
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:35,918
Now, today, we have better maps of Mars
than we do of our own sea floor.

71
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,045
Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.

72
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,089
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

73
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:42,591
Stop that. Come on.

74
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,843
Come along.

75
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,180
Bye, fishy. Bye.

76
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:51,683
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

77
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,603
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

78
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,689
Arthur is talking to the fish.

79
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:58,816
Such a freak, Arthur.

80
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:02,111
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

81
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,071
Stop it! Don't!

82
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,447
Let me go!

83
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:04,066
Who are you?

84
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,901
Come on, let's go. Move it.

85
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,986
Come on. Hurry up.

86
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:18,914
Sir, we've secured the captain.

87
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,249
Distress signal's disabled.

88
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,501
We're running dark again.

89
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,461
But they heard it. You can count on it.

90
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:28,757
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

91
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,677
And you don't tell me how to pirate.

92
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,231
Where's the rest of the crew?

93
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,275
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

94
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,402
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

95
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,070
Our reputation precedes us.

96
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,613
Your reputation.

97
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,031
This is your win.,

98
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,288
Here.

99
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,749
Can't take that piece of junk.

100
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,543
It's the love of your life.

101
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,338
I never told you the story behind it.

102
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:10,632
This was your grandfather's.

103
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:15,721
He was one of the Navy's first frogmen
during World War II.

104
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:20,017
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

105
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:24,354
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

106
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:28,692
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

107
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,902
And this knife.

108
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:34,197
He gave it to me when I was your age.

109
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,827
And now it's yours, son.

110
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,524
Did we just hit something?

111
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,779
No. Something hit us.

112
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:15,683
Sir, there's something out there.

113
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:16,823
Another submarine?

114
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,700
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

115
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,458
That's not a man.

116
00:15:12,462 --> 00:15:15,924
Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway.

117
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,489
Permission to come aboard?

118
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,248
Aquaman!

119
00:17:39,985 --> 00:17:42,779
I've waited
a long time for this.

120
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,086
Am I supposed to know who you are?

121
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,339
I scavenge the high seas.

122
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,758
You're the Aquaman.

123
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,802
We were bound to meet at some point.

124
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,266
Let's not make it a habit.

125
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,018
Up.

126
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:08,365
Ow.

127
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,171
Dad!

128
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,966
Dad? Ow.

129
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,553
That's your kid?

130
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,018
Shame on you.

131
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,855
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

132
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:41,940
Get yourselves out of it.

133
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:43,024
Bastard!

134
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,785
Dad!

135
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,253
Dad!

136
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:07,298
Wait!

137
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,134
Help me! He's trapped!

138
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,969
You can't leave him like this!

139
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:13,972
Please!

140
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:18,393
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

141
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,366
Get outta here! I got this!

142
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,593
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

143
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:38,913
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

144
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,461
- Now, go!
- No!

145
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:46,296
- Go!
- Shut up!

146
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:52,093
No!

147
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:53,678
No!

148
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,239
Damn you!

149
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:14,699
Go.

150
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,724
I always know where to find you.

151
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:36,948
Old habits.

152
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,585
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

153
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:54,924
You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?

154
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,861
How is it that I can breathe underwater,

155
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,848
but you can still drink me
under the table?

156
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:05,184
That's my superpower.

157
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:06,436
A Russian submarine

158
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,396
hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.

159
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:11,190
The same pirates who are suspected

160
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:13,996
in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified

161
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:16,613
prototype stealth submarine.

162
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,949
And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports

163
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:23,703
that the met a human dubbed
by social media as "The Aquaman”

164
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,371
was responsible for this daring rescue.

165
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:27,624
That's not me.

166
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:31,461
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?

167
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,339
What Vulko trained you to do.

168
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:38,092
I knew you couldn't
stand on the sidelines forever.

169
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,511
Your mother
always knew you were special.

170
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:41,638
Don't even start.

171
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:45,058
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

172
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:46,392
Just stop.

173
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:53,232
Whatever Atlantis' problems are,
you're bigger than them.

174
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,109
Atlantis murdered my mother.

175
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:56,903
You don't know that for sure.

176
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,029
Yes, I do.

177
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,241
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

178
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,494
And you know it.

179
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,085
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

180
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,093
Hey, buddy.

181
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,888
You that fish boy from the TV?

182
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:26,349
Oh, great.

183
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,608
It's "fish man." What do you want?

184
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:37,944
I'll tell you what I want.

185
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,366
Could we get a picture with you?

186
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,410
You're like our local hero, man.

187
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:49,872
It would mean a lot. Just a quick...

188
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:55,670
Whatever.

189
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,630
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

190
00:24:57,755 --> 00:24:59,795
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

191
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,801
There we go. Everybody smile.

192
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,274
He understands the significance
of this meeting.

193
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,401
He'll hear you out.

194
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:22,090
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

195
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:25,718
You picked a meeting place
too close to the surface for my liking.

196
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,562
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

197
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,015
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

198
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,018
our ancestors gathered here.

199
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,105
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

200
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:40,858
Xebel, as always, by his side.

201
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:42,944
Brine. Fishermen.

202
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,987
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

203
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:47,365
The Lost Nation had not yet vanished.

204
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,827
Together, they were the greatest empire
the world had ever seen.

205
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:55,957
But now, I sit on Atlan's throne,
shackled by archaic laws and politics.

206
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,917
While the threat above us
grows undeniably--

207
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,169
Violence has always plagued the surface.

208
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,547
They will destroy themselves.

209
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:05,091
Not before destroying us first.

210
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:07,844
We have been hiding long enough.

211
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,014
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

212
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,559
We honor you, King Nereus,

213
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,438
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

214
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,566
to join King Orm's alliance.

215
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:23,609
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

216
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:25,570
By law,
you need four of the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:26,779
to ascend and attack.

218
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:29,657
The Lost Nation and the Deserters
have long perished.

219
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,534
The Trench are nothing but animals.

220
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:34,495
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

221
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:39,458
Without me and my army to convince them,
your plans are stillborn.

222
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:41,919
But I know what you really want.

223
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:44,505
Once you've obtained
the pledge of the four kingdoms,

224
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,215
you will be ordained

225
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:48,718
Ocean Master.

226
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:51,554
That is merely a title.

227
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,182
I'm no fool, King Orm.

228
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:55,766
As Ocean Master, you'll be commander

229
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:58,144
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

230
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,396
I am the natural choice to lead it.

231
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:03,733
Are you?

232
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:07,403
What about the rumors
that there's another?

233
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,281
An Atlantean, living among the surface.

234
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,783
One of royal blood.

235
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:17,371
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

236
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:19,540
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

237
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:22,668
My mother's bastard
has never even been to Atlantis.

238
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:24,003
His loyalty is to the surface.

239
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:37,099
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

240
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,288
Your king is injured!

241
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,933
I'm not trying to start a war.

242
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:03,227
The war has already begun.

243
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,023
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

244
00:30:11,694 --> 00:30:12,862
- I'm good.
- Stop.

245
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,780
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

246
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:16,625
Let's go home
and work on your tā moko. Huh?

247
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,558
If your grand pops was still alive,

248
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,619
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

249
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,249
Yes, he would,
but there is plenty of time for that.

250
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,960
We gotta get you to bed.

251
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,505
Got it?

252
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,511
I've been looking for you.

253
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,931
Oh, no, no, no...

254
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,725
I need you to come with me to Atlantis.

255
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,518
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

256
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:46,122
that I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

257
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:48,564
Except nicer, because you're a lady.

258
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,566
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

259
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,735
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

260
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,341
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

261
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:59,158
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

262
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,035
Billions will die.

263
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,453
Your people and mine.

264
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:05,081
We must stop him.

265
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,754
And how do you propose we do that?

266
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:15,091
You are
the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.

267
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,301
The throne is yours by birthright.

268
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:22,473
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

269
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:26,143
is for you
to take your rightful place as king.

270
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:31,882
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

271
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,277
I'm the bastard son of the queen
your people executed.

272
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:38,364
Trust me. I am no king.

273
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:39,490
I agree.

274
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,951
That's awesome. Cool.

275
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,662
But, Vulko seems to
believe in you for some reason,

276
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:45,955
and that's why I'm here.

277
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,791
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

278
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,419
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

279
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:52,545
It's not a myth.

280
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,214
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

281
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:58,342
You can then claim your birthright
and dethrone Orm.

282
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,262
My birthright? It died with my mother.

283
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,682
But I promise you this. If Orm attacks,

284
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,768
I will treat him exactly the same way
your people treated her.

285
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:10,479
With no mercy.

286
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:12,666
That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose.

287
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,836
One of your kind intervened.

288
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:18,464
He is not one of us.

289
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:21,217
He killed my father.

290
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,512
Our transaction has ended.

291
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:31,644
Keep the money. I want Aquaman.

292
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,841
Dad!

293
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,180
Dad!

294
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,751
Dad!

295
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:24,506
Pops!

296
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,176
Pops!

297
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,598
Come on, Pops.

298
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,143
Come on! He's not breathing.

299
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,394
Move! Let me help.

300
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,278
Come on, Pops.

301
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:58,957
Come on.

302
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:15,182
I don't even know your name.

303
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,394
It's Princess Y'Mera Xebella Challa.

304
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,397
You may call me Mera.

305
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:24,775
Thank you, Mera.

306
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,297
Dear God.

307
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,717
This was Orm's doing.

308
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,345
The worst is yet to come.

309
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,980
There's a flash flood warning here

310
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,733
that was just extended
for a couple hours.

311
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:08,402
Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.

312
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:12,239
We are seeing warships
and trash washed up by massive waves.

313
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:15,409
These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste

314
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,036
and garbage are taking place
all over the world.

315
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:21,165
Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land.

316
00:37:21,248 --> 00:37:22,308
Many are asking the question,

317
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:24,918
"Was this a natural disaster
or something else?”

318
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:26,879
No. This was no natural disaster.

319
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,298
They threw out our garbage
and our warships.

320
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,800
This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.

321
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:34,928
There you go again
with your insane Atlantean theory.

322
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,805
You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.

323
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:37,890
Open your eyes.

324
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:39,808
We already have
an Atlantean living among us,

325
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,351
and his name is Aquaman.

326
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,068
What is it?

327
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:54,072
This is the exact spot that
Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.

328
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,535
You have to forget
all the teaching of the surface world

329
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,915
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

330
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:04,958
But I already know how to swim.

331
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,127
Not even close.

332
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:12,216
Just so we're clear,

333
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,551
I'll help you stop this war.

334
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:16,845
But then, I'm done.

335
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,598
Maybe that's for the best.

336
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:42,246
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

337
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,747
It is who we are.

338
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:45,916
Wait, you can talk underwater?

339
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:49,044
I can talk underwater, too!

340
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,879
This is awesome!

341
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:54,424
Oh, we can do more than just talk.

342
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:05,978
Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.

343
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:10,691
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,

344
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:13,277
and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.

345
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:38,468
This is awesome!

346
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:09,708
So, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

347
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:14,421
Soon, my young prince.

348
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:18,550
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

349
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:30,729
I hid my ship in here.

350
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,294
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

351
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:36,502
Well, to get where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

352
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,612
Your fish ship
has been marinating in chum butter.

353
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,457
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

354
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:42,157
That'd be an improvement.

355
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:49,623
Yup. Okay.

356
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,811
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

357
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:55,063
The Gateway Bridge is a remnant
of the Old World.

358
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:57,068
It's also the only way in or out
of the Capital.

359
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,584
Why can't they just go over the walls?

360
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,318
Security is impenetrable.

361
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:02,046
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

362
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,739
they'd never get past the hydro-cannons.

363
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:07,784
People try to sneak in all the time.

364
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:10,704
Yeah, right.

365
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:32,059
What is this?

366
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:33,894
Customs and border control.

367
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,564
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

368
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:46,406
Welcome home.

369
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,415
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

370
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:40,377
The Highborns
never venture to the sea floor.

371
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:41,628
We're here.

372
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,242
What is this?

373
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,078
We use this air pocket
as an extra layer of precaution.

374
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:17,455
Only the Highborns can breathe water
as well as air.

375
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,207
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

376
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,043
They get kind of messy.

377
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,840
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

378
00:44:26,923 --> 00:44:29,718
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

379
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:36,141
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

380
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:38,351
I can't believe Orm attacked.

381
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,477
It wasn't an attack.

382
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,938
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

383
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:45,233
What he did to your surface warships
was merely a warning.

384
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:46,401
What provoked it?

385
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:50,488
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

386
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:52,991
By the surface? I don't think so.

387
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:54,868
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

388
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,536
I was there.

389
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,580
A surface warship fired at us.

390
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:01,499
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

391
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:06,338
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

392
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:10,592
If we're going to prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

393
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,678
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

394
00:45:14,095 --> 00:45:15,430
You don't understand.

395
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:18,600
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

396
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,728
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

397
00:45:22,354 --> 00:45:24,773
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

398
00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:26,209
Okay? I don't even know where to begin.

399
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,860
By winning
the hearts and minds of the people

400
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:33,406
by proving to them that you're worthy,
and retrieving this.

401
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:39,371
Hmm.

402
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:41,790
I already got one of those.

403
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,293
Not like this one, you don't.

404
00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:47,379
This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.

405
00:45:48,004 --> 00:45:49,130
Oh, I know the story.

406
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:51,967
It's more than a story. It's real.

407
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:56,638
It was forged by
the greatest weapon masters in history.

408
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:01,434
Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,

409
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:04,396
the first ruler of Atlantis.

410
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:09,734
Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.

411
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:12,195
So what happened to it?

412
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:16,116
To know that is to go back to the time
before the Great Fall,

413
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,828
when King Atlan ruled over all that was,

414
00:46:21,037 --> 00:46:23,498
when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.

415
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:31,381
It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.

416
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:35,051
We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy

417
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:38,555
at a time when the rest of the world
still thought the earth was flat.

418
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:44,269
But we became too ambitious,

419
00:46:44,394 --> 00:46:46,521
too hungry for power.

420
00:47:03,496 --> 00:47:06,624
The ocean swallowed us,
and Atlantis sank.

421
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:11,129
But the very power
that collapsed our civilization

422
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:13,840
also paved the way to our future.

423
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:17,510
It gave us the ability
lo breathe underwater.

424
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:20,472
And so, we evolved.

425
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:24,726
Others regressed, became savage.

426
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:31,024
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

427
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,570
Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.

428
00:47:36,112 --> 00:47:39,991
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

429
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:44,120
It's an ancient recording
dating back to the First Dynasty.

430
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:48,083
I believe it contains
Atlan's final message to his people

431
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:50,752
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

432
00:47:51,044 --> 00:47:52,462
So, what does it say?

433
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:55,423
We don't know. The technology's too old.

434
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:58,593
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

435
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,805
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

436
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:05,725
The clue to Atlan's final resting place
is inside of this.

437
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:26,079
Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry.

438
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:27,247
No!

439
00:48:29,124 --> 00:48:30,792
You mustn't be seen here!

440
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,971
I don't suppose
you want to talk about this, do you?

441
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:35,148
Neither do I.

442
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:19,817
In the name of His Highness, King Orm,
I place you under arrest.

443
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,090
Welcome to Atlantis...

444
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:44,342
Brother.

445
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,349
I can't believe you're finally here.

446
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:55,645
I've heard so many stories about you.

447
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:04,696
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

448
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,615
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

449
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,995
Ashamed of the fact that I have
a half-breed brother

450
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,831
whose heart
I wanted to run my trident through.

451
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,044
But now that you're finally here
before me, I must admit...

452
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:29,429
I am conflicted.

453
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,475
You want conflict, why don't you take
these chains off, little brother?

454
00:51:34,642 --> 00:51:36,311
And we'll see who gets run through.

455
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:42,650
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

456
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:47,488
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

457
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:48,948
To kill me?

458
00:51:49,198 --> 00:51:51,743
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

459
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:52,994
I see.

460
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:55,747
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

461
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:58,416
that the surface continues to commit?

462
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:04,255
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

463
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:06,674
and poisoned our children.

464
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:11,304
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

465
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:17,101
And you've come all this way
to take sides against your own people?

466
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:19,205
There are no sides in a war like this.

467
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:22,124
You have clearly chosen a side
and come here to challenge the throne.

468
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:23,941
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

469
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,946
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

470
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:32,325
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

471
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:35,787
Well then,
perhaps that's how we'll proceed.

472
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:37,538
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

473
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:38,623
Don't you see?

474
00:52:38,748 --> 00:52:41,000
If I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna

475
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,628
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

476
00:52:43,753 --> 00:52:48,716
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

477
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:52,178
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

478
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,138
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

479
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,101
Your Highness, he doesn't know our ways.

480
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,228
Then he's about to get an education.

481
00:53:01,896 --> 00:53:03,690
Are you officially challenging me?

482
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:05,650
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win--

483
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:07,568
If you win,

484
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:11,155
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

485
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,491
But if I win...

486
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,411
You're over.

487
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,371
Let's do it.

488
00:53:18,538 --> 00:53:19,872
So be it.

489
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:23,501
Challenge has been made, and I accept.

490
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:25,420
Prepare him for the Ring of Fire.

491
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:29,215
Wait. The ring of what?

492
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:51,320
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

493
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:53,948
It seems to me
like I just solved all of our problems.

494
00:53:54,073 --> 00:53:56,367
I beat him in a battle, war's over,
I get to go home.

495
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,619
You're a formidable fighter on land,

496
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:00,955
but here
you're out of your element, literally.

497
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:03,791
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

498
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,335
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

499
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,505
You taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.

500
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,674
Let's see if you remember anything.

501
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:16,929
So, what's with the big fork?

502
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,515
It's a trident. Now, defend yourself.

503
00:54:53,216 --> 00:54:54,342
What the hell is this?

504
00:54:54,509 --> 00:54:56,969
I'll teach you this move
when you've mastered the trident.

505
00:55:07,188 --> 00:55:08,314
It's not fair.

506
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,858
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

507
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:14,737
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

508
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:17,156
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

509
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:19,886
Why has she never come to see me, huh?

510
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:21,953
I told you, when you're ready--

511
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:26,123
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

512
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:28,960
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

513
00:55:29,043 --> 00:55:30,336
When am I gonna be good enough?

514
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:36,509
Does she not love me?

515
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:39,595
Your mother loved you
more than anything in the world.

516
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:44,267
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

517
00:55:44,392 --> 00:55:47,478
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

518
00:55:47,603 --> 00:55:49,313
so she had to marry him...

519
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,899
And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

520
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,111
When Orvax
eventually found out about you,

521
00:55:55,236 --> 00:55:57,822
he became overwhelmed with jealousy

522
00:55:57,947 --> 00:56:02,285
and sacrificed her
to the creatures of the Trench.

523
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:07,456
Are you saying they executed her?

524
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,084
Because she had me?

525
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,142
I remember...

526
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,102
Everything.

527
00:56:31,439 --> 00:56:33,566
I have something for you.

528
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:36,444
It belonged to my mother.

529
00:56:37,987 --> 00:56:39,405
Tell me...

530
00:56:41,324 --> 00:56:44,452
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

531
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:50,416
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

532
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:53,878
I truly do. I don't want war--

533
00:56:54,003 --> 00:56:55,129
Don't patronize me!

534
00:56:55,254 --> 00:56:56,547
I know you.

535
00:56:56,672 --> 00:56:58,592
What you're doing
flies in the face of everything

536
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:00,402
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

537
00:57:00,426 --> 00:57:01,427
If she were here--

538
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:05,640
But she's not here, is she?

539
00:57:05,765 --> 00:57:08,142
What my mother taught us was treason.

540
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:11,145
Don't follow in her wake.

541
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:14,224
All right! So, this is
the big, old ring of fire, huh?

542
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:17,693
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

543
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:22,782
Vulko.

544
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:26,661
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

545
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:39,548
Let's go, Lady Mera.

546
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:49,809
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

547
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:54,689
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

548
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:58,776
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

549
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:03,364
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

550
00:58:03,698 --> 00:58:06,575
Atlantis has been lying in wait...

551
00:58:07,493 --> 00:58:09,120
And now, the beast has awakened.

552
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:21,048
There was a time when
I wanted to meet you more than anything.

553
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:23,634
Get to know my little brother.

554
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:28,931
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

555
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,395
If only I had known
what a dick you would turn out to be.

556
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:40,359
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

557
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:43,738
And I've hated you for it ever since.

558
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:49,076
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

559
00:58:49,952 --> 00:58:52,997
I'm going to give you one chance.

560
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,374
Go home.

561
00:58:56,292 --> 00:58:58,919
Do not ever come back to Atlantis.

562
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:03,007
You are not going to win this.

563
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:07,386
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

564
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,806
And I am bringing
the wrath of the seven seas with me.

565
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:14,185
You know I can't let that happen.

566
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,979
I know.

567
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:21,400
What the hell is that?

568
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:24,904
The Ring of Fire.

569
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,081
Yeah!

570
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,668
Yeah!

571
00:59:46,592 --> 00:59:47,843
Shit.

572
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,097
People of Atlantis, hear me!

573
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:55,601
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

574
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,564
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

575
01:00:00,815 --> 01:00:05,152
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

576
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:15,955
Traitor!

577
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:17,957
Traitor!

578
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:25,589
You'll never be king!

579
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:41,915
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

580
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,566
would bow before the king of Atlantis.

581
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:47,570
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

582
01:00:47,695 --> 01:00:49,238
Beg them for mercy?

583
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:51,699
I detest the surface as much as you do.

584
01:00:51,824 --> 01:00:54,743
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

585
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:02,084
But you wouldn't be that gullible,
would you?

586
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,714
You want this war too, don't you?

587
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:09,568
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

588
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:12,011
If this is how it must be done,
then so be it.

589
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:20,311
You have our mother's trident.

590
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:23,564
Powerful, but flawed like her.

591
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,900
I wield my father's.

592
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:29,028
And it has never known defeat!

593
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:19,995
I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.

594
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:30,756
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

595
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:31,460
I am the one true king!

596
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,047
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

597
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:29,184
Mera!

598
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,189
Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?

599
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:37,359
The plan was to recover Atlan's trident,
then challenge Orm.

600
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:38,878
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

601
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:39,903
Shit happens.

602
01:05:45,617 --> 01:05:47,411
Heads up! We got a bogey on our six!

603
01:05:47,536 --> 01:05:49,746
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

604
01:05:49,872 --> 01:05:51,957
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

605
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:02,295
Whoa, whoa, wait, you said
we couldn't go over these walls.

606
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,047
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

607
01:07:04,071 --> 01:07:05,155
I did, now shut up!

608
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:11,578
Oh, shit!

609
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:36,228
Shit!

610
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,063
Shit.

611
01:07:38,939 --> 01:07:41,692
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

612
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:44,653
Oh!

613
01:07:51,952 --> 01:07:53,203
Here, hold this.

614
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:56,373
What are you doing?

615
01:07:56,498 --> 01:07:58,542
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

616
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,169
Never mind. Come here, get in. Come on.

617
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,340
Great. So we're getting eaten.

618
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:28,655
How are you even doing this, anyway?

619
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,532
I don't know.

620
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,535
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

621
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,622
Right. Because you're both big,
dumb animals.

622
01:08:36,747 --> 01:08:38,787
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- leaved yours first!

623
01:08:43,545 --> 01:08:45,339
She said, "Coast is clear."

624
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:47,466
So, where to now?

625
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:52,346
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

626
01:08:53,472 --> 01:08:54,931
All right.

627
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,165
I don't usually take charters,

628
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:22,212
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

629
01:09:22,751 --> 01:09:23,835
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

630
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:27,214
Oh, man.

631
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:29,466
Are you okay?

632
01:09:29,758 --> 01:09:31,760
I've never been so high up before.

633
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,430
Or so far from home.

634
01:09:36,682 --> 01:09:38,266
But at least you have a home.

635
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:40,310
Not anymore.

636
01:09:40,936 --> 01:09:42,145
I can never go back.

637
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:45,273
I betrayed everything
when I saved you from the coliseum.

638
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:52,572
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

639
01:09:52,739 --> 01:09:55,701
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

640
01:09:55,951 --> 01:09:57,661
But forgiving, it is not.

641
01:09:57,828 --> 01:09:58,870
Yeah, but you're royalty.

642
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,122
So was your mother.

643
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:04,167
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

644
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,837
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

645
01:10:11,383 --> 01:10:13,009
Look on the bright side,

646
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,738
now you don't have to marry some
tool bag that you're not in love with.

647
01:10:15,762 --> 01:10:18,098
My obligation isn't to love.

648
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,851
It is to my family and my nation,

649
01:10:21,476 --> 01:10:23,311
and I've turned my back on both.

650
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:28,692
Sometimes, you have to do what's right,

651
01:10:29,651 --> 01:10:32,320
even if your heart aches against it.

652
01:10:48,336 --> 01:10:49,963
Your Highness.

653
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:55,719
The tracker places Princess Mera here,
in the Deserter Kingdom.

654
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,804
You said she was dead.

655
01:10:58,555 --> 01:10:59,890
Apparently not.

656
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:03,119
Then your brother
still lives as well?

657
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:04,186
Not for long.

658
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:06,688
Captain Murk,
assemble a strike force immediately.

659
01:11:06,813 --> 01:11:11,109
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

660
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,319
She betrayed the throne.

661
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:13,820
She is a daughter of Xebel.

662
01:11:14,946 --> 01:11:17,824
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

663
01:11:17,908 --> 01:11:19,075
Your Highness,

664
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:22,704
we are now entering
the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.

665
01:11:22,871 --> 01:11:26,875
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

666
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,877
should be our immediate concern.

667
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:36,676
My vizier is correct. As usual.

668
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:44,392
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

669
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:08,875
We're here!

670
01:12:10,377 --> 01:12:11,628
Hey!

671
01:12:11,711 --> 01:12:13,255
Is there anything nearby?

672
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,140
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

673
01:12:15,507 --> 01:12:17,175
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

674
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:20,387
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

675
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:25,809
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

676
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:28,270
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

677
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,328
Shit!

678
01:12:58,008 --> 01:12:59,593
Oh, you're crazier than I thought!

679
01:12:59,759 --> 01:13:00,802
A-ha!

680
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,513
This way.

681
01:13:25,118 --> 01:13:28,330
You were defeated the last time
because your surface weapons failed you.

682
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:30,457
Ours will not.

683
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,253
It's prototype armor

684
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:37,672
for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.

685
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:41,259
Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.

686
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:44,471
You will lead my finest commandos
as your personal army

687
01:13:44,596 --> 01:13:47,182
to hunt down the half-breed abomination.

688
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:51,561
I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world.

689
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:54,898
Kill him and the woman he's with,
and you will be rewarded.

690
01:13:55,023 --> 01:13:57,150
Killing him is my reward.

691
01:14:00,987 --> 01:14:02,948
The crown jewel.
Still experimental.

692
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:07,494
Converts water
into beams of energized plasma.

693
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:21,359
Hmm.

694
01:15:21,443 --> 01:15:23,403
I think I'm gonna need a bigger helmet.

695
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:26,448
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here

696
01:15:26,573 --> 01:15:28,616
when this region
was still an inland sea.

697
01:15:28,742 --> 01:15:31,411
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

698
01:15:31,578 --> 01:15:33,121
Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.

699
01:15:33,246 --> 01:15:34,289
We're getting close now.

700
01:15:34,414 --> 01:15:36,750
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

701
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,310
Close to getting punched in the face!

702
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,813
Look, Fight Club, I know you're new
to how things work up here.

703
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:42,839
Why don't you look around? We are lost.

704
01:15:42,964 --> 01:15:44,567
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

705
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:46,593
Nada. This place is a wasteland.

706
01:15:47,427 --> 01:15:49,679
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

707
01:15:49,804 --> 01:15:51,347
This isn't my home!

708
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:53,367
It's not like the whole surface
looks like this!

709
01:15:53,391 --> 01:15:54,601
Oh, no, of course not.

710
01:15:54,726 --> 01:15:58,480
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

711
01:15:58,605 --> 01:16:00,356
and whole mountains made out of trash.

712
01:16:00,482 --> 01:16:01,751
And, oh, you've got great factories

713
01:16:01,775 --> 01:16:03,895
that do nothing
but belch out filth and melt ice caps.

714
01:16:03,985 --> 01:16:05,945
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

715
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:07,131
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

716
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:08,799
but we've got
some good things too, all right?

717
01:16:08,823 --> 01:16:11,743
We got green forests and big mountains
and beautiful lakes.

718
01:16:11,993 --> 01:16:14,079
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

719
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:15,914
Are you trying to provoke me?

720
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:18,184
I'm just saying you cannot judge a place
before you've even seen it.

721
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:20,752
You've judged Atlantis on far less.

722
01:16:24,506 --> 01:16:27,967
No. Would you
just stop it with that? No.

723
01:16:28,176 --> 01:16:31,554
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you
to jump out of an airplane

724
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,839
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

725
01:16:37,018 --> 01:16:39,312
If you're the next true king,
we're doomed.

726
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:08,883
That was awesome.

727
01:17:14,347 --> 01:17:16,891
Oh. Look what I found.

728
01:17:18,143 --> 01:17:19,144
What you found?

729
01:17:19,269 --> 01:17:20,270
Yeah.

730
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,407
Check this place out.

731
01:17:33,158 --> 01:17:34,534
This is badass!

732
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:37,996
This is the Hall of Armory.

733
01:17:38,997 --> 01:17:41,916
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

734
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,545
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

735
01:17:51,843 --> 01:17:53,136
Vulko was right.

736
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:57,098
It's real.

737
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,553
Huh.

738
01:18:36,221 --> 01:18:37,555
Nothing.

739
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:39,511
Of course it's not working.

740
01:18:39,557 --> 01:18:42,644
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

741
01:18:44,896 --> 01:18:46,272
Man!

742
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:49,734
"Since before the Sahara was a desert."

743
01:18:49,901 --> 01:18:51,694
Thank you
for repeating what I just said.

744
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,696
It's completely dried out.

745
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:57,301
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

746
01:18:57,325 --> 01:18:59,077
when you're not thinking at all.

747
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,367
All right, now hold still.

748
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:02,622
Hey. What are you doing?

749
01:19:02,747 --> 01:19:05,667
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

750
01:19:06,668 --> 01:19:08,211
Now, hold still.

751
01:19:14,384 --> 01:19:15,426
Hmm.

752
01:19:44,414 --> 01:19:45,581
Show-off.

753
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,959
I could have just peed on it.

754
01:19:58,511 --> 01:19:59,721
King Atlan.

755
01:20:01,973 --> 01:20:06,853
In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis.

756
01:20:07,145 --> 01:20:10,898
In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction.

757
01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:13,234
But in the hands of the true heir,

758
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:16,321
it would unite all our kingdoms
above and below.

759
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:22,285
If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.

760
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:25,496
Journey beyond the edge of the world
to the Hidden Sea.

761
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,666
Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.

762
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:34,589
Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see.

763
01:20:42,889 --> 01:20:44,015
Hmm.

764
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,065
We can't let Orm find this.

765
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:55,735
Hey! Wait!

766
01:20:56,944 --> 01:20:57,945
What?

767
01:20:58,613 --> 01:21:00,239
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

768
01:21:00,365 --> 01:21:02,241
I memorized it. Didn't you?

769
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:05,453
Oh, yeah. Totally.

770
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:08,289
What'd he just say?

771
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,335
"Something something trident."

772
01:21:26,933 --> 01:21:29,644
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

773
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:37,610
It's our next stop.

774
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:14,582
I'm starting to think you
actually like these surface-dwellers.

775
01:23:14,707 --> 01:23:17,126
It would be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before.

776
01:23:19,545 --> 01:23:21,881
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

777
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:44,445
Well, apparently, it's just right up
on the hill. A big old castle.

778
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:48,241
And I just learned something
very interesting.

779
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:49,534
Pinocchio.

780
01:23:50,284 --> 01:23:53,045
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

781
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:57,291
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

782
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:58,543
Oh!

783
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,378
I got it from the movie.

784
01:24:06,092 --> 01:24:09,220
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

785
01:24:09,303 --> 01:24:11,514
beyond that ancient notion

786
01:24:11,597 --> 01:24:13,766
that war with the surface is inevitable.

787
01:24:13,891 --> 01:24:16,811
It is the position of the Fishermen

788
01:24:16,936 --> 01:24:19,897
that when the time comes
to make ourselves known to the landsmen,

789
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:23,609
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

790
01:24:25,236 --> 01:24:27,697
I admire your lofty aspirations,
King Ricou.

791
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:36,497
But I suspect they are but clouds of ink
hiding the heart of a coward.

792
01:24:36,622 --> 01:24:38,249
How dare you!

793
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,837
Please. I implore you.

794
01:24:43,504 --> 01:24:47,133
You're a kingdom of bloated philosophers
and flaccid poets

795
01:24:47,258 --> 01:24:50,469
whose waters have grown stagnant,
and it sickens me.

796
01:24:59,186 --> 01:25:00,479
My King!

797
01:25:00,813 --> 01:25:04,275
The king is dead! Long live his heir.

798
01:25:06,193 --> 01:25:07,236
Princess.

799
01:25:08,487 --> 01:25:11,449
Prepare your armies, Your Highness.

800
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:15,411
We move against the Brine Kingdom
at once.

801
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:25,004
What did the recording
say, again?

802
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:28,174
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea.

803
01:25:28,299 --> 01:25:30,301
Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

804
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:34,305
Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

805
01:25:36,432 --> 01:25:39,143
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

806
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:42,271
Hmm.

807
01:25:44,315 --> 01:25:45,733
Oh, man.

808
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,443
What?

809
01:25:47,652 --> 01:25:49,695
Wow.
That's awesome.

810
01:25:49,862 --> 01:25:51,072
Let me see.

811
01:25:52,531 --> 01:25:54,659
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

812
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,077
Here, let me see.

813
01:25:56,202 --> 01:25:57,662
What was the last line?

814
01:25:57,787 --> 01:26:01,248
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

815
01:26:01,415 --> 01:26:03,084
"Only in the hands of the true..."

816
01:26:04,669 --> 01:26:06,212
Marcus Agrippa.

817
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:08,597
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

818
01:26:10,633 --> 01:26:12,009
Neither was Scipio.

819
01:26:13,386 --> 01:26:14,679
How do you know all this stuff?

820
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:17,181
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

821
01:26:17,348 --> 01:26:22,812
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

822
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:25,272
First king of Rome.

823
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:30,569
"Only in the hands of the true king
can he truly see."

824
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,665
There it is. That's our heading.

825
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,500
What? Let me see.

826
01:26:46,794 --> 01:26:47,878
We did it!

827
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,213
Oh!

828
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:52,925
That's not bad for an imbecile, huh?

829
01:26:55,261 --> 01:26:56,554
Not bad at all.

830
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:11,652
Mera.

831
01:27:13,946 --> 01:27:19,618
"Loathsomeness waits
and dreams in the deep,

832
01:27:19,744 --> 01:27:24,582
and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

833
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,503
Get back!

834
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,260
Arthur!

835
01:27:39,138 --> 01:27:40,389
I order you to stand down!

836
01:27:40,514 --> 01:27:43,017
Princess Mera, you've been charged
with high treason.

837
01:28:03,412 --> 01:28:04,705
Who the hell are you?

838
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,832
Maybe this will jog your memory.

839
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:56,257
You're the guy from the sub.

840
01:28:57,132 --> 01:28:58,259
That's right.

841
01:28:59,885 --> 01:29:02,179
But now I have Atlantean steel.

842
01:29:07,977 --> 01:29:10,688
Call me "Black Manta."

843
01:29:26,036 --> 01:29:28,038
You thought you could walk away?

844
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:35,928
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

845
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:57,651
You can't run.

846
01:29:58,652 --> 01:30:00,863
You owe me blood!

847
01:30:00,988 --> 01:30:02,197
How'd you find me?

848
01:30:02,323 --> 01:30:06,660
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

849
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:24,571
No!

850
01:31:59,064 --> 01:32:00,065
Come on.

851
01:32:04,653 --> 01:32:06,572
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

852
01:32:12,036 --> 01:32:15,789
I'll show you
the same mercy you showed my father.

853
01:32:15,914 --> 01:32:18,500
And gut you like the fish you are!

854
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:15,159
Arthur!

855
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:21,123
Mera, they're tracking you.

856
01:34:21,498 --> 01:34:22,499
What?

857
01:34:22,666 --> 01:34:24,334
They're tracking you.

858
01:34:35,345 --> 01:34:38,307
Arthur, stay with me.

859
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:41,977
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

860
01:35:30,901 --> 01:35:31,944
Um...

861
01:35:33,654 --> 01:35:35,280
Did you steal a boat?

862
01:35:35,447 --> 01:35:38,450
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

863
01:35:38,617 --> 01:35:41,328
No, those belong to people.

864
01:35:41,578 --> 01:35:42,871
Huh.

865
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:47,042
Those were Orm's elite commandos.

866
01:35:47,209 --> 01:35:49,461
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

867
01:35:50,337 --> 01:35:51,922
I've never seen him before.

868
01:35:52,547 --> 01:35:54,174
Yeah, I have.

869
01:35:54,383 --> 01:35:56,760
He and his father were pirates.

870
01:35:58,345 --> 01:36:00,472
And he blames me for his father's death.

871
01:36:01,056 --> 01:36:05,269
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

872
01:36:06,311 --> 01:36:07,980
That's not how it feels.

873
01:36:10,274 --> 01:36:12,943
It was up to me, and I let him die.

874
01:36:14,236 --> 01:36:15,904
I could've saved him, but I didn't.

875
01:36:17,364 --> 01:36:20,909
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

876
01:36:21,076 --> 01:36:22,452
And that would have been my fault.

877
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:26,456
Well, he's behind us now.

878
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,252
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

879
01:36:32,254 --> 01:36:35,173
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

880
01:36:37,217 --> 01:36:39,261
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

881
01:36:40,053 --> 01:36:41,179
Yes.

882
01:36:41,346 --> 01:36:43,515
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

883
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,559
It's become a place of death.

884
01:36:45,851 --> 01:36:47,853
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

885
01:36:52,024 --> 01:36:53,400
We should turn back.

886
01:36:54,568 --> 01:36:57,046
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

887
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:58,071
Turn back?

888
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:01,783
Look, I learned from a young age
not to show weakness.

889
01:37:02,868 --> 01:37:06,079
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

890
01:37:06,163 --> 01:37:08,123
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

891
01:37:09,166 --> 01:37:12,627
But I've done nothing
but get my ass kicked this whole trip.

892
01:37:13,503 --> 01:37:16,381
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

893
01:37:16,548 --> 01:37:19,134
I do not work or play well with others.

894
01:37:20,469 --> 01:37:23,597
And I can't let you die trying
to turn me into something that I'm not.

895
01:37:25,098 --> 01:37:28,518
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

896
01:37:29,728 --> 01:37:32,731
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

897
01:37:32,898 --> 01:37:35,317
You are the bridge between land and sea.

898
01:37:36,568 --> 01:37:38,070
I can see that now.

899
01:37:39,363 --> 01:37:40,739
The only question is...

900
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:44,618
Can you?

901
01:38:00,217 --> 01:38:03,720
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

902
01:38:04,763 --> 01:38:06,098
Vulko.

903
01:38:07,057 --> 01:38:08,600
My trusted vizier

904
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:12,479
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

905
01:38:14,815 --> 01:38:17,484
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

906
01:38:17,651 --> 01:38:20,737
I have already given it, My King.

907
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:23,990
But I will stand by your decision,
as always.

908
01:38:24,783 --> 01:38:26,201
My decision.

909
01:38:28,412 --> 01:38:29,663
To protect it.

910
01:38:32,165 --> 01:38:33,375
While you betray it.

911
01:38:34,835 --> 01:38:38,296
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

912
01:38:38,505 --> 01:38:43,051
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

913
01:38:43,885 --> 01:38:48,932
That you have spent years training him
to take the throne from me.

914
01:38:51,935 --> 01:38:53,520
Do not deny it.

915
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:57,858
I do not.

916
01:38:58,358 --> 01:38:59,693
Why?

917
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:03,280
I am the pure blood.

918
01:39:04,156 --> 01:39:06,491
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

919
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:10,495
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

920
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:11,580
I do serve it.

921
01:39:11,746 --> 01:39:14,291
Arthur may only be half-Atlantean,

922
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:18,336
but he's already twice the king
you'll ever be.

923
01:39:24,718 --> 01:39:26,052
Take him.

924
01:39:27,554 --> 01:39:29,264
But make sure he has a view.

925
01:41:10,657 --> 01:41:12,117
What the hell are these things?

926
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,994
The Trench! We're here!

927
01:41:16,663 --> 01:41:18,543
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

928
01:41:28,925 --> 01:41:29,968
They're from the depths.

929
01:41:30,093 --> 01:41:31,595
They're scared of the light. Here!

930
01:41:44,024 --> 01:41:45,275
Come on!

931
01:41:50,155 --> 01:41:51,364
You ready to jump?

932
01:43:00,475 --> 01:43:02,018
Over there!

933
01:43:36,803 --> 01:43:38,138
That thing will tear us apart.

934
01:43:38,805 --> 01:43:40,348
We don't have a choice!

935
01:44:00,493 --> 01:44:02,120
Arthur!

936
01:44:05,457 --> 01:44:06,458
Mera!

937
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:38,823
Mera!

938
01:44:39,991 --> 01:44:40,992
Mera!

939
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:03,807
Mera!

940
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,811
Mera!

941
01:45:52,105 --> 01:45:53,314
Arthur.

942
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:55,441
Mom?

943
01:46:34,147 --> 01:46:38,610
King Orvax sacrificed me
to the Trench, but I survived.

944
01:46:38,776 --> 01:46:41,988
I fought my way through as you did,
and I ended up here.

945
01:46:42,155 --> 01:46:43,781
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

946
01:46:43,948 --> 01:46:45,116
Yes.

947
01:46:45,283 --> 01:46:46,659
Come. Sit here.

948
01:46:51,789 --> 01:46:54,125
You must forgive me.

949
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:56,252
Forgive me for everything.

950
01:46:57,086 --> 01:46:59,088
This happened because you had me.

951
01:46:59,714 --> 01:47:04,093
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

952
01:47:04,552 --> 01:47:07,180
I made a choice. I had to leave...

953
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:11,309
To save you, to save your father.

954
01:47:13,811 --> 01:47:16,272
Tell me. Tell me about him.

955
01:47:16,814 --> 01:47:18,066
Is he...

956
01:47:22,028 --> 01:47:24,364
He still walks to the end of that dock.

957
01:47:26,157 --> 01:47:27,200
Every morning.

958
01:47:30,244 --> 01:47:31,579
Every day.

959
01:47:34,958 --> 01:47:36,334
Waiting for you.

960
01:47:44,092 --> 01:47:45,510
Why didn't you ever come back?

961
01:47:51,432 --> 01:47:54,477
Because the portal that brought you here
won't let us return.

962
01:47:55,478 --> 01:47:58,439
The trident is the only way back.

963
01:47:59,023 --> 01:48:02,819
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

964
01:48:05,321 --> 01:48:07,615
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

965
01:48:07,782 --> 01:48:10,702
It lies beyond the waterfall.

966
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:17,125
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

967
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:18,501
No.

968
01:48:18,668 --> 01:48:20,294
It's too powerful.

969
01:48:20,712 --> 01:48:23,047
I've tried many times over the years.

970
01:48:24,507 --> 01:48:27,760
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

971
01:48:30,888 --> 01:48:32,432
You're afraid.

972
01:48:35,143 --> 01:48:36,227
Yes.

973
01:48:37,854 --> 01:48:38,980
Good.

974
01:48:40,648 --> 01:48:41,899
You're ready.

975
01:48:43,484 --> 01:48:45,069
Atlantis has always had a king.

976
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:48,573
Now, it needs something more.

977
01:48:49,282 --> 01:48:51,200
But what could be greater than a king?

978
01:48:51,826 --> 01:48:52,910
A hero.

979
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:57,123
A king fights only for his nation.

980
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:01,169
You fight for everyone.

981
01:50:29,841 --> 01:50:34,220
You do not belong here.

982
01:50:35,805 --> 01:50:42,103
I have guarded the trident
against false kings since the beginning.

983
01:50:42,270 --> 01:50:44,564
And for a thousand years

984
01:50:44,772 --> 01:50:50,278
I have seen the greatest champions
try and fail.

985
01:50:50,528 --> 01:50:56,784
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

986
01:50:57,201 --> 01:51:04,041
You dare come here
with your tainted mongrel blood

987
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:07,587
to claim Atlantis' greatest treasure?

988
01:51:10,047 --> 01:51:11,090
So be it...

989
01:51:12,592 --> 01:51:14,302
Half-breed.

990
01:51:33,905 --> 01:51:37,074
You thought yourself worthy?

991
01:51:37,158 --> 01:51:40,244
You thought yourself a king?

992
01:51:40,328 --> 01:51:44,207
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

993
01:51:44,582 --> 01:51:45,708
Stop!

994
01:51:53,424 --> 01:51:56,677
You're right. I am a half-breed mongrel.

995
01:51:58,262 --> 01:52:00,681
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

996
01:52:00,932 --> 01:52:02,225
I know I'm not.

997
01:52:02,808 --> 01:52:06,729
You understand me?

998
01:52:06,896 --> 01:52:08,314
I do.

999
01:52:08,856 --> 01:52:15,363
No mortal has conversed with me
since King Atlan.

1000
01:52:16,489 --> 01:52:19,742
Who are you?

1001
01:52:20,493 --> 01:52:21,827
I'm nobody.

1002
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:26,916
I came because I had no choice.

1003
01:52:28,751 --> 01:52:33,005
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

1004
01:52:35,383 --> 01:52:39,053
I came
because the trident is their only hope.

1005
01:52:39,512 --> 01:52:41,514
And if that's not good enough...

1006
01:52:44,058 --> 01:52:45,518
Then screw you.

1007
01:52:47,687 --> 01:52:54,485
No man has ever freed the trident
from Atlan's grip.

1008
01:52:55,528 --> 01:52:58,447
Should he deem you unworthy...

1009
01:52:58,781 --> 01:53:03,911
Well, I haven't feasted in eons,

1010
01:53:03,995 --> 01:53:06,998
and I am famished.

1011
01:54:37,088 --> 01:54:40,049
The one true king.

1012
01:54:52,728 --> 01:54:55,981
Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,

1013
01:54:56,148 --> 01:55:00,152
but a swift assault aimed directly
at their leadership will turn the tide.

1014
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:01,862
Defeat the Brine King,

1015
01:55:02,071 --> 01:55:05,699
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

1016
01:55:07,785 --> 01:55:09,537
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1017
01:55:11,372 --> 01:55:12,873
Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!

1018
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:17,503
Rise, Atlantis!

1019
01:55:35,312 --> 01:55:38,732
Death to the Atlantean hagfish!

1020
01:55:44,113 --> 01:55:46,323
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1021
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:50,661
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

1022
01:56:57,186 --> 01:56:59,939
No! We need him!

1023
01:57:02,191 --> 01:57:03,526
Join me or die.

1024
01:57:03,776 --> 01:57:07,154
You expect me
to address you as Your Highness?

1025
01:57:07,404 --> 01:57:08,697
Not Your Highness.

1026
01:57:10,699 --> 01:57:12,159
Call me...

1027
01:57:13,035 --> 01:57:14,620
Ocean Master.

1028
01:57:14,912 --> 01:57:18,624
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1029
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:21,961
But you will never have my allegiance!

1030
01:57:22,253 --> 01:57:23,337
So be it!

1031
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:56,579
What the...

1032
01:58:31,947 --> 01:58:33,616
The king has risen.

1033
01:58:41,373 --> 01:58:43,334
Attack!

1034
02:00:42,494 --> 02:00:45,014
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1035
02:00:45,122 --> 02:00:48,292
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

1036
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:51,211
And what if I can't?

1037
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:53,547
Last time, he was in his element.

1038
02:00:54,465 --> 02:00:57,468
This time, make him fight in yours.

1039
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:25,662
Um...

1040
02:01:26,789 --> 02:01:29,625
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

1041
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:33,420
Yeah, good plan. Don't get killed.

1042
02:02:06,578 --> 02:02:08,539
The Trench! He commands the Trench!

1043
02:02:08,622 --> 02:02:09,998
Impossible!

1044
02:02:27,057 --> 02:02:28,392
Stand down! Let her pass.

1045
02:02:28,725 --> 02:02:31,687
Please, Father, he has the trident.

1046
02:02:31,979 --> 02:02:34,147
I know you think this war is necessary,

1047
02:02:34,439 --> 02:02:36,733
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

1048
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,420
And if you turn your back on that now,

1049
02:02:38,485 --> 02:02:40,779
then the Atlantis you're fighting for
is already dead.

1050
02:02:41,113 --> 02:02:42,114
It's true!

1051
02:02:42,197 --> 02:02:43,877
The half-breed wields
King Atlan's trident.

1052
02:02:43,949 --> 02:02:45,033
He commands the seal

1053
02:02:47,327 --> 02:02:49,204
Then that half-breed is your king.

1054
02:04:06,615 --> 02:04:08,825
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!

1055
02:04:08,992 --> 02:04:10,619
We can't! Look.

1056
02:04:10,869 --> 02:04:12,412
The people must bear witness.

1057
02:04:18,835 --> 02:04:20,921
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

1058
02:04:22,047 --> 02:04:23,465
A half-breed bastard.

1059
02:04:26,218 --> 02:04:29,388
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

1060
02:04:32,265 --> 02:04:33,475
Well, then by bloodshed...

1061
02:04:35,769 --> 02:04:37,562
Do the gods make known their will.

1062
02:05:07,342 --> 02:05:09,469
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1063
02:06:45,232 --> 02:06:46,274
Finish it.

1064
02:06:46,483 --> 02:06:47,651
Yield the throne.

1065
02:06:47,943 --> 02:06:49,653
Mercy is not our way.

1066
02:06:51,404 --> 02:06:53,323
Maybe you haven't noticed, brother...

1067
02:06:58,912 --> 02:07:00,413
But I'm not one of you.

1068
02:07:00,747 --> 02:07:01,790
Do it!

1069
02:07:04,334 --> 02:07:05,919
- Kill me!
- No!

1070
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,507
That is enough killing.

1071
02:07:18,098 --> 02:07:19,307
Mother?

1072
02:07:19,975 --> 02:07:21,560
Oh, my son.

1073
02:07:30,735 --> 02:07:32,279
It's a long story.

1074
02:07:32,904 --> 02:07:34,322
I'll tell ya later.

1075
02:07:35,282 --> 02:07:36,616
Come on!

1076
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:46,042
I don't understand. We thought--

1077
02:07:46,251 --> 02:07:47,252
I know.

1078
02:07:47,961 --> 02:07:49,713
Arthur saved me.

1079
02:07:53,592 --> 02:07:55,677
- You're with him?
- I am.

1080
02:07:58,388 --> 02:08:02,684
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1081
02:08:03,518 --> 02:08:05,562
But you have been misguided.

1082
02:08:07,272 --> 02:08:10,984
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1083
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:12,485
He was wrong.

1084
02:08:12,944 --> 02:08:15,614
The land and the sea

1085
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:18,408
are one.

1086
02:08:38,386 --> 02:08:39,554
My queen.

1087
02:08:42,682 --> 02:08:43,892
Vulko.

1088
02:08:46,269 --> 02:08:47,479
Take him.

1089
02:08:48,271 --> 02:08:50,440
But make sure he has a view.

1090
02:08:57,447 --> 02:08:58,448
When you're ready,

1091
02:09:00,951 --> 02:09:02,202
let's talk.

1092
02:09:17,259 --> 02:09:21,012
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1093
02:09:21,179 --> 02:09:23,181
but let it end in joy.

1094
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:28,186
I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.

1095
02:09:28,561 --> 02:09:30,272
Hail to the king!

1096
02:09:30,438 --> 02:09:32,983
- Hail to the king!
- Haiti to the king!

1097
02:09:41,533 --> 02:09:43,702
So, what do I do now?

1098
02:09:44,452 --> 02:09:45,954
Be their king.

1099
02:09:47,205 --> 02:09:48,373
Ooh.

1100
02:09:48,665 --> 02:09:50,792
This is gonna be fun.

1101
02:10:42,802 --> 02:10:45,388
You came back. You're back.

1102
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,807
Yes. Yes.

1103
02:10:53,897 --> 02:10:56,524
My father
was a lighthouse keeper.

1104
02:10:57,525 --> 02:10:59,361
My mother was a queen.

1105
02:11:01,237 --> 02:11:02,697
They were never meant to meet...

1106
02:11:06,326 --> 02:11:08,578
But their love saved the world.

1107
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:12,749
They made me what I am.

1108
02:11:13,583 --> 02:11:16,961
A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.

1109
02:11:18,922 --> 02:11:20,715
I am the protector of the deep.

1110
02:11:22,467 --> 02:11:23,551
I am...

1111
02:11:25,387 --> 02:11:27,097
Aquaman.

1112
02:14:36,286 --> 02:14:37,287
Hey!

1113
02:14:41,541 --> 02:14:42,792
I spent 15 years

1114
02:14:43,084 --> 02:14:45,503
at the United States Institute
of Marine Science...

1115
02:14:45,670 --> 02:14:48,715
- Weren't you fired?
- ...Studying oceanic phenomenon,

1116
02:14:48,881 --> 02:14:51,175
and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.

1117
02:14:51,342 --> 02:14:54,637
Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor.

1118
02:14:54,804 --> 02:14:56,306
We have satellite imagery

1119
02:14:56,472 --> 02:14:59,100
of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface--

1120
02:14:59,267 --> 02:15:00,987
- Dr. Shin!
- Will you please let me finish?

1121
02:15:01,019 --> 02:15:02,770
Here we go again. Atlantean?

1122
02:15:03,313 --> 02:15:05,815
Yes. The government
does not want us to know

1123
02:15:06,024 --> 02:15:07,459
about the threat
that exists right here...

1124
02:15:07,483 --> 02:15:09,277
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1125
02:15:22,206 --> 02:15:23,833
This is Atlantean technology, isn't it?

1126
02:15:24,125 --> 02:15:25,877
Can you tell me how you got this?

1127
02:15:26,044 --> 02:15:28,755
Sure. But first,

1128
02:15:29,505 --> 02:15:32,216
you gotta tell me how to find him.

1129
02:23:12,134 --> 02:23:13,135
English - SDH
