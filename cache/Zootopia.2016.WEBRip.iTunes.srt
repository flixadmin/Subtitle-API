1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,566
Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,568
Thousands of years ago,

3
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,988
these were the forces
that ruled our world.

4
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,074
A world where prey
were scared of predators.

5
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:19,413
And predators had an uncontrollable,
biological urge...

6
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,748
to maim, and maul, and...

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,712
Blood! Blood! Blood!

8
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,929
And death.

9
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,980
Back then, the world was divided in two.

10
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,148
Vicious predator...

11
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,734
or meek prey.

12
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,199
But over time, we evolved.

13
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,994
And moved beyond our primitive,
savage ways.

14
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

15
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:08,086
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

16
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,213
Yeah.

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,716
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.

18
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,303
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

19
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,642
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

20
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,186
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,064
I'm gonna be an actuary!

22
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,485
And I can make the world a better place.

23
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,237
I am going to be...

24
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,074
a police officer!

25
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:43,914
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

26
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,750
It may seem impossible
to small minds...

27
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,586
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

28
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,589
But, just 211 miles away...

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,343
stands the great city of Zootopia!

30
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,847
Where our ancestors
first joined together in peace...

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:06,353
and declared that
anyone can be anything!

32
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,190
Thank you and good night!

33
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,528
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

34
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,571
Nope.

35
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,365
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

36
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,784
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

37
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,787
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

38
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,290
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

39
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,833
I like trying actually.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,459
What you father means, hon...

41
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,128
is it's gonna be difficult,

42
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,589
impossible even,
for you to become a police officer.

43
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,300
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
Bunnies don't do that.

44
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,509
-Never.
-Never.

45
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,512
Then, I guess I'll have to be
the first one.

46
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:45,309
Because I am gonna make the world
a better place.

47
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,354
Or, heck, you know, you want to talk
about making the world a better place...

48
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,273
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,400
Yes! Your dad, me...

50
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,654
your 275 brothers and sisters.
We're changing the world!

51
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,697
One carrot at a time.

52
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,617
Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

53
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,911
Just putting the seeds in the ground.

54
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,663
At one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

55
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,498
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.

56
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,543
Yeah. Just as long as you don't
believe in them too much.

57
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,379
Where'd the heck she go?

58
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,216
Give me your tickets right now...

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,010
or I'm gonna kick
your meek little sheep butt.

60
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,803
Cut it out, Gideon!

61
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,389
What are you gonna do? Cry?

62
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,307
Hey!

63
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,518
You heard her. Cut it out.

64
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,561
Nice costume, loser.

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,688
What crazy world are you living in

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,107
where you think a bunny
could be a cop?

67
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,443
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

68
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,528
Come and get them.

69
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
But watch out, because I'm a fox,

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,907
and like you said
in your dumb little stage play...

71
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,409
us predators used to eat prey.

72
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,870
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah."

73
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,164
I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

74
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,874
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

75
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,876
You don't scare me, Gideon.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,005
-You scared now?
-Look at her nose twitch!

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,006
She is scared!

78
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,967
Cry little baby bunny.

79
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:00,884
Cry, cry...

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,682
You don't know when to quit, do you?

81
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,649
I want you to remember this moment...

82
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,570
the next time you think you will ever
be anything more than just a stupid...

83
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,655
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

84
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,870
That looks bad.

85
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,538
Are you okay, Judy?

86
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,832
Yeah. I'm okay.

87
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,709
Here you go.

88
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,627
Wow! You got our tickets!

89
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,171
You're awesome, Judy!

90
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,716
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

91
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,926
Well, he was right about one thing.

92
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,682
I don't know when to quit.

93
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,310
Listen up, cadets.

94
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,438
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems
within its city limits.

95
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,480
15 YEARS LATER

96
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,773
Tundratown...

97
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,108
Sahara Square...

98
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,985
Rainforest District, to name a few.

99
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,446
You're gonna have to
master all of them

100
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,907
before you hit the streets,
or guess what?

101
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,950
You'll be dead!

102
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,037
Scorching sandstorm!

103
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,790
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,793
1,000-foot fall!

105
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,671
You're dead, Carrot Face!

106
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,632
Frigid ice wall!

107
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,135
You're dead, Farm Girl!

108
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,804
Enormous criminal.

109
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,225
You're dead.
Dead, dead, dead!

110
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,568
Filthy toilet! You're dead, Fluff Butt.

111
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,404
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!

112
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,739
There's never been a bunny cop.

113
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,823
-Never.
-Never.

114
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,701
Just a stupid,
carrot-farming dumb bunny.

115
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,773
As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...

116
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,193
that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative
has produced...

117
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,029
its first police academy graduate.

118
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:31,577
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...

119
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,662
Judy Hopps.

120
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,247
Oh, gosh.

121
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,376
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.

122
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,044
-Oh, yes. Right!
-Thank you.

123
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,504
Yay, Judy!

124
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,422
Judy...

125
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,634
it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...

126
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,888
to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One.

127
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,222
City Center.

128
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,893
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

129
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,730
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

130
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,524
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

131
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,734
Bellwether, make room, will you?
Come on.

132
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,737
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

133
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,572
-Officer Hopps, right here!
-Look this way please!

134
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,865
Hold still. Smile!

135
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,911
We're real proud of you, Judy.

136
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,621
Yeah. Scared, too.

137
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,040
Really, it's kind of
a proud-scared combo.

138
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,752
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

139
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,753
Guys...

140
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,005
I've been working for this my whole life.

141
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,509
We know. And we're just
a little excited for you, but terrified.

142
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,386
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

143
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,014
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

144
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,515
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

145
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,725
-Wolves?
-Weasels.

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,893
You play cribbage with a weasel.

147
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,186
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,438
You know what, pretty much all
predators. And Zootopia's full of them.

149
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,315
Oh, Stu.

150
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,983
And foxes are the worst.

151
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,238
Actually, your father does have
a point there. It's in their biology.

152
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,697
Remember what happened
with Gideon Grey?

153
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,366
When I was nine.

154
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,536
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

155
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,621
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

156
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,374
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

157
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,626
we made you a little care package
to take with you.

158
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,878
-And I put some snacks in there.
-This is fox deterrent.

159
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,088
Yeah, that's safe, to have that.

160
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,631
This is fox repellent.

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,799
The deterrent and the repellent,
that's all she needs.

162
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,884
-Check this out!
-For goodness sake.

163
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,845
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.

164
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,138
Come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

165
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,100
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

166
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,893
Terrific! Everyone wins!

167
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,604
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

168
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,276
Okay, gotta go! Bye!

169
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,152
Bye, Judy!

170
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,286
I love you guys.

171
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,288
Love you, too.

172
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,040
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

173
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, Stu, pull it together.

174
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,627
Bye, everybody!

175
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,962
-Bye-bye, Judy!
-Bye, Judy!

176
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,672
I love you!

177
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,133
Bye! Bye!

178
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,220
Goodbye!

179
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,420
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

180
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,216
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

181
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,551
I keep falling down

182
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,887
I keep on hitting the ground

183
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,639
But I always get up now

184
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,724
To see what's next

185
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,895
Birds don't just fly

186
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,191
They fall down and get up

187
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:57,115
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

188
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,245
I won't give up
No I won't give in

189
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,415
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

190
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,543
No I won't leave

191
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:14,049
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

192
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,886
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

193
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,638
Till I reach the end

194
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,099
Then I'll start again

195
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,645
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

196
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,440
I want to try even though I could fail

197
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,779
Try everything

198
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,158
Try everything

199
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,788
Try everything

200
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:55,591
I'll keep making those new mistakes

201
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,473
And I'll keep on making them every day

202
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,478
Those new mistakes

203
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,411
Try everything

204
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,373
Try everything

205
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,461
Try everything

206
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,636
Try everything

207
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.

208
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,684
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

209
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,687
Luxury apartments with charm.

210
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,399
Complimentary delousing
once a month. Don't lose your key.

211
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,901
Thank you.

212
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,195
Hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor.

213
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,321
Yeah? Well, we're loud.

214
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,657
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

215
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:05,827
Greasy walls.

216
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,287
Hey, shut up!

217
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,372
Rickety bed.

218
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,623
-You shut up!
-You shut up!

219
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,707
Will you shut up?

220
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,334
Crazy neighbors.

221
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,544
I said, "Shut up!"

222
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,045
I love it!

223
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,380
Shut your mouth, shut up.

224
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,566
Come on!

225
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,568
He bared his teeth first!

226
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,071
Excuse me.

227
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,739
Down here.

228
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,199
Hi.

229
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,243
O-M-Goodness!

230
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,413
They really did hire a bunny! What!

231
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,416
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be!

232
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,838
You probably didn't know, but a bunny
can call another bunny "cute"...

233
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,590
but when other animals do it...

234
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,757
it's a little...

235
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,429
I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

236
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:09,766
the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby,
donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

237
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,521
No, it's okay. Oh, you've actually got...
There's a...

238
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,939
In your neck. The fold.

239
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,858
Where? Oh!

240
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,861
There you went, you little dickens!

241
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,989
I should get to roll call,
which way do I...?

242
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,699
Bullpen's over there to the left.

243
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,451
Great. Thank you.

244
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,662
That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

245
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,052
Hey, Officer Hopps.

246
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,054
You ready to make the world
a better place?

247
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,268
Atten-hut!

248
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,359
All right! Everybody sit.

249
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,820
I've got three items on the docket.

250
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,659
First... we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

251
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,327
Francine...

252
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,412
Happy birthday.

253
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,834
Number two.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,837
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

255
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,963
but I'm not going to....

256
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,923
because I don't care.

257
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,887
Finally, we have
14 missing mammal cases.

258
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,891
All predators, from a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

259
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,145
And City Hall
is right up my tail to find them.

260
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,524
This is priority number one.

261
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,859
Assignments.

262
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,360
Officers Grizzoli...

263
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,570
Fangmeyer, Delgato.

264
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:47,823
Your teams take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

265
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,118
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

266
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,787
Your teams take Sahara Square.

267
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,039
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

268
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,125
Tundratown.

269
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,044
And finally, our first bunny...

270
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,797
Officer Hopps.

271
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,632
Parking Duty.

272
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,384
Dismissed.

273
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,219
Parking duty?

274
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,597
Chief!

275
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,639
Chief Bogo?

276
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,644
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

277
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,313
-So?
-So, I can handle one.

278
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,066
You probably forgot, but I was
top of my class at the Academy.

279
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,652
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

280
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,821
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

281
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,824
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day
should be easy.

282
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,748
100 tickets.
I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

283
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

284
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,251
Before noon.

285
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,143
Boom!

286
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,062
200 tickets before noon!

287
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,402
201.

288
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,781
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

289
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,602
Where'd he go?

290
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:40,162
I don't know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours...

291
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,708
but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.

292
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,502
I'm not looking
for any trouble either, sir.

293
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,671
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

294
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,340
for my little boy.

295
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,138
You want the red or the blue, pal?

296
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,853
I'm such a...

297
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,896
Come on, kid. Back up.

298
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,398
Listen, buddy. What? There aren't any
fox ice cream joints...

299
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,650
in your part of town?

300
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,901
No, no. There are.

301
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,863
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

302
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,991
he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.

303
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,077
Is that adorable?

304
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,790
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams? Right?

305
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,793
You probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says...

306
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,129
"We reserve the right
to refuse service...

307
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,507
"...to anyone."
So, beat it.

308
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,676
You're holding up the line.

309
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,514
Hello? Excuse me.

310
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,600
You're gonna have to wait your turn
like everyone else, meter maid.

311
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,602
Actually, I'm an officer.

312
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,312
Just had a quick question.

313
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,858
Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucus...

314
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:51,900
with their cookies and cream?

315
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,362
What are you talking about?

316
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:59,032
I don't want to cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream...

317
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,743
with an ungloved trunk
is a Class 3 health code violation.

318
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,497
Which is kind of a big deal.

319
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,583
Of course,
I could let you off with a warning...

320
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,378
if you were to glove those trunks and,
I don't know...

321
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,882
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

322
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,008
What was it?

323
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,260
A Jumbo Pop.
Please.

324
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,803
A Jumbo Pop.

325
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,223
$15.

326
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,351
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

327
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,771
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

328
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,735
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached
to my neck. That's the truth.

329
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,697
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

330
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,991
Please don't be mad at me.

331
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,868
Thanks anyway.

332
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,417
Keep the change.

333
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,544
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

334
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,464
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?

335
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,091
Oh, no, My treat.
It just...

336
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,885
You know, it burns me up
to see folks

337
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,221
with such backward attitudes
toward foxes.

338
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,182
I just wanna say
you're a great dad and just a...

339
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,268
a real articulate fella.

340
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,981
Well, that is high praise. It's rare that
I find someone so non-patronizing.

341
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:13,899
Officer...

342
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,192
Hopps. Mister...

343
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,694
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

344
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,238
And you, little guy...

345
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,658
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up? You be an elephant.

346
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,035
Because this is Zootopia.

347
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,496
Anyone can be anything.

348
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,123
Boy, I tell him that all the time.

349
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,293
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.

350
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,421
Look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

351
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,966
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

352
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,510
Toot-toot!

353
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:42,636
Bye, now.

354
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:43,637
Goodbye!

355
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,072
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

356
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,330
Popsicles!

357
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,831
Get your popsicles!

358
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:18,982
Lumber delivery.

359
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,150
What's with the color?

360
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,360
The color?

361
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,278
That's red wood.

362
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,282
39, 40. There you go.

363
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,826
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

364
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,996
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

365
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,876
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off.

366
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,003
Ciao.

367
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,593
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

368
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,011
You liar!

369
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,721
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

370
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,890
And I'm not the liar. He is.

371
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:56,520
Hey!

372
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:59,565
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

373
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,024
Really? For what?

374
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,610
Gee, I don't know.
How about selling food without a permit.

375
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,863
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines.

376
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,072
False advertising.

377
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,158
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

378
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,578
And I didn't falsely advertise anything.
Take care.

379
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,913
You told that mouse
the popsicle sticks were redwood!

380
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,541
That's right. "Red wood."
With a space in the middle.

381
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,042
Wood that is red.

382
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:23,547
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

383
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,465
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

384
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,050
My bad. I just naturally assumed

385
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,428
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

386
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,345
No!

387
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,890
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County,
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

388
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:36,560
Okay. Tell me
if this story sounds familiar.

389
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,188
Naive little hick with good grades
and big ideas...

390
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,940
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

391
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:45,110
where predators and prey
live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya."

392
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,321
Only to find, whoopsie...

393
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,616
we don't all get along. And that
dream of becoming a big city cop?

394
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,244
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

395
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,538
no one cares about her or her dreams.

396
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,749
And soon enough, those dreams die

397
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,584
and our bunny sinks into emotional
and literal squalor...

398
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,252
living in a box under a bridge...

399
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,755
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

400
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,466
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy little tail
between her legs...

401
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,550
to become...

402
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,260
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

403
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,305
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

404
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,521
Be careful, now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

405
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,816
Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

406
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,985
Especially not some jerk...

407
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:31,657
who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a popsicle hustler.

408
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:35,327
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

409
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,287
thinking they can be
anything they want.

410
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,830
Well, you can't.

411
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,250
You can only be what you are.

412
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,585
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

413
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,587
I'm not a dumb bunny.

414
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,049
Right. And that's not wet cement.

415
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:51,969
You'll never be a real cop.

416
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,388
You're a cute meter maid, though.

417
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,890
Maybe a supervisor one day.

418
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,976
Hang in there.

419
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,041
You can't do nothing right, babe

420
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,169
I'm a loser

421
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,405
Oh, hey, it's my parents.

422
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,032
Oh, there she is!

423
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:55,991
Hi, sweetheart!

424
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:58,911
Hey there, Jude the dude.
How was your first day on the force?

425
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,079
-It was real great.
-Yeah?

426
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,456
Everything you ever hoped?

427
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,916
Absolutely.

428
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:08,545
And more. Everyone's so nice and...

429
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,088
-I feel like I'm making a difference.
-Wait a second.

430
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,507
Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.

431
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,217
Oh, my sweet heaven!

432
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:15,385
Judy, are you a meter maid?

433
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,971
This? No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing.

434
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,431
It's the safest job on the force!

435
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:22,226
She's not a real cop.
Our prayers have been answered!

436
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,561
-Glorious day!
-Meter maid! Meter maid!

437
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,397
-Meter maid! Meter maid!
-Dad. Dad. Dad!

438
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,274
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

439
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,567
That's right, you get some rest.

440
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,069
Those meters
aren't gonna maid themselves.

441
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,570
Bye-bye.

442
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,906
Buh-bye.

443
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,120
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

444
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,416
Leave the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?

445
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,751
She feels like a failure!

446
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,461
-Oh, shut up!
-You shut up!

447
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,880
-You shut up!
-You shut up!

448
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,799
Tomorrow's another day.

449
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,260
Yeah, but it might be worse!

450
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,639
I was 30 seconds over!

451
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,268
You're a real hero, lady!

452
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,105
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.

453
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,442
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.

454
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:17,781
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

455
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,576
Hey, hey! You, bunny!

456
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:24,621
Sir. If you have a grievance, you may
contest your citation in traffic court.

457
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,623
What are you talking about?
My shop!

458
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,709
It was just robbed! Look!

459
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,210
He's getting away!

460
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,795
Are you a cop or not?

461
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,756
Yes! Don't worry, sir!
I've got this!

462
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,096
Stop! Stop, in the name of the law!

463
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,099
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

464
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:52,608
Coming through!

465
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,484
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.

466
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,777
I got dibs!

467
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,362
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

468
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,756
You!

469
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:16,673
Freeze!

470
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,092
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

471
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,386
Stop!

472
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,207
Sorry. Coming through.

473
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,626
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

474
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,507
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

475
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,568
Hey, stop right there!

476
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,027
Have a donut, copper!

477
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:24,241
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard print jeggings?

478
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,832
I love your hair.

479
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,417
Thank you.

480
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,253
Come to papa.

481
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,967
You're gonna have to be patient and
wait in line just like everyone else...

482
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,178
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

483
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,978
I popped the weasel!

484
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,897
Hopps!

485
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,442
Abandoning your post.

486
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,068
Inciting a scurry.

487
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,112
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

488
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,114
But, to be fair...

489
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:07,910
you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

490
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,246
Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

491
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:14,124
Those are a crocus varietal
called midnicampum holicithias.

492
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,542
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

493
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,253
I grew up in a family where
plant husbandry was kind of a thing.

494
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,922
Shut your tiny mouth now!

495
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,591
Sir, I got the bad guy.

496
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:23,800
That's my job.

497
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,095
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!

498
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,015
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.

499
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,099
Not now.

500
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,476
Okay, I just didn't know
if you'd want to take it this time.

501
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,644
She seems really upset.

502
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,229
-Not now!
-Sir...

503
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:39,191
I don't want to be a meter maid,
I want to be a real cop.

504
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:44,154
Do you think the mayor asked me what
I wanted when he assigned you to me?

505
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,489
But, sir, if...

506
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:48,367
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song...

507
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,954
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

508
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,873
So, let it go.

509
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:59,002
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time.

510
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,170
I'm sorry, sir.

511
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,506
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

512
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,383
I gotta go sit down.

513
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,886
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

514
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:11,849
My husband has been missing for
10 days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

515
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,058
Yes, I know.

516
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,269
He's a florist.

517
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,689
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.

518
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,817
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.

519
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:26,029
Please. There's got to be someone
to find my Emmitt.

520
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:26,989
Mrs. Otterton...

521
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,073
I will find him.

522
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,326
Thank you.

523
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,538
Bless you. Bless you, little bunny.

524
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:38,250
Take this.

525
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,794
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

526
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,880
to me and my babies, please.

527
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,382
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

528
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,217
Of course. Thank you both so much.

529
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:48,677
One second.

530
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,889
You're fired.

531
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,223
What? Why?

532
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,725
Insubordination!

533
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,560
Now. I'm going to open this door...

534
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,563
and you're going to tell that otter
you're a former meter maid...

535
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,857
with delusions of grandeur...

536
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,734
who will not be taking the case!

537
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,737
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

538
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:08,363
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

539
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,783
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

540
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,661
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

541
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,746
No, let's not tell
the Mayor just yet.

542
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:18,749
And I've sent it and it is done,
so I did do that.

543
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,417
Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.

544
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:23,212
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

545
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,671
Like glue.

546
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,256
Good one.

547
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,383
Just call me
if you ever need anything, okay?

548
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,302
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

549
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:31,887
All right, bye-bye.

550
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:34,097
Thank you, ma'am.

551
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,271
I will give you 48 hours.

552
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,523
Yes!

553
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:43,941
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.

554
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:44,733
Okay.

555
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,112
But, you strike out, you resign.

556
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:54,451
Okay.

557
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:55,494
Deal!

558
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:59,456
Splendid. Clawhauser will
give you the complete case file.

559
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:00,791
Here you go.

560
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,417
One missing otter.

561
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,003
That's it?

562
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,340
Yikes! That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen.

563
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,759
Leads, none. Witnesses, none.

564
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:13,971
And you're not in the computer system
yet, so resources, none!

565
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:18,308
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one!

566
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:21,770
Okay. Last known sighting.

567
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,150
Can I just borrow...
Thank you.

568
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,364
Popsicle?

569
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,032
The murder weapon.

570
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,701
Get your popsicle.

571
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:39,538
Yeah. Because that...
What does that mean?

572
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:40,621
It means...

573
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,958
I have a lead.

574
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,009
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

575
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,178
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

576
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,347
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

577
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,349
and I'm here to ask you some questions
about a case.

578
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,977
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

579
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,854
It wasn't me.

580
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,401
Hey, Carrots, you're going to
wake the baby. I gotta get to work.

581
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,736
This is important, sir.

582
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:14,031
I think your $10 worth of popsicles
can wait.

583
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,409
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff!

584
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,746
365 days a year, since I was 12.

585
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,497
And time is money. Hop along.

586
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,583
Please, just look at the picture.

587
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,336
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle,
right? Do you know him?

588
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:28,212
I know everybody.

589
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:30,923
And I also know that, somewhere...

590
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,216
there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal,

591
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,010
so why don't you get back to your box?

592
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,887
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

593
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,265
Did you just boot my stroller?

594
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,267
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

595
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:45,062
For what? Hurting your feelings?

596
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,396
Felony Tax Evasion.

597
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:52,402
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12.

598
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:57,199
That's two decades, so times 20,
which is $1,460,000, I think.

599
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,911
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

600
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,829
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

601
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:05,707
you reported, let me see here... zero!

602
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:10,128
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

603
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,755
Five years jail time.

604
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:14,132
Well, it's my word against yours.

605
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,969
200 bucks a day, Fluff!

606
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,805
365 days a year, since I was 12.

607
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,849
Actually, it's your word against yours.

608
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:25,394
And if you want this pen, you're going to
help me find this poor, missing otter...

609
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,398
or the only place you'll be selling
popsicles is the prison cafeteria.

610
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,276
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

611
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,611
She hustled you.

612
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,368
She hustled you good!

613
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,621
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

614
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:46,957
Have fun...

615
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,166
working with the fuzz!

616
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,837
Start talking.

617
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,799
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

618
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:56,967
Great. Let's go.

619
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,345
It's not exactly a place for...

620
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,638
a cute little bunny.

621
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,765
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

622
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:06,143
Okay. You're the boss.

623
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,205
Hi.

624
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,331
Hello?

625
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,667
Hello?

626
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,753
Hello? Hello?

627
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,382
Hello. My name is...

628
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,677
You know, I'm going to hit
the pause button right there...

629
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,096
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

630
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,140
No.

631
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,559
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

632
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

633
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:54,233
who may have frequented
this establishment.

634
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,489
Yeah, old Emmitt.

635
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,034
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

636
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,371
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

637
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,206
I'd be happy to take you back.

638
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,249
Thank you so much.

639
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,751
I'd appreciate that more than
you can imagine, it would be such...

640
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:13,961
You are naked!

641
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,214
For sure, we're a naturalist club.

642
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:20,634
Yeah. In Zootopia,
anyone can be anything.

643
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,678
These guys, they be naked.

644
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,806
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

645
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:34,398
Oh, boy.

646
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,400
Does this make you uncomfortable?

647
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,987
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

648
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,114
Yes, there is.

649
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,283
Boy, that's the spirit.

650
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,579
Yeah, some mammals say
the naturalist life is weird...

651
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,831
but you know what I say is weird?

652
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,833
Clothes on animals!

653
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,252
Here we go.

654
00:38:55,419 --> 00:39:00,090
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

655
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,425
Hey, Nangi.

656
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:04,803
These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

657
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,762
Who?

658
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:09,266
Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like...

659
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:10,767
6 years?

660
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,519
I have no memory of this beaver.

661
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,438
He's an otter, actually.

662
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:16,315
He was here
a couple Wednesdays ago, remember?

663
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,232
No.

664
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:21,153
Yeah, he was wearing
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

665
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:26,617
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

666
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,660
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

667
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:29,578
No.

668
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,498
And we both walked him out,
and he got into this big old white car

669
00:39:33,582 --> 00:39:34,958
with a silver trim.

670
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,920
Needed a tune-up.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.

671
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,963
-Remember that, Nangi?
-No.

672
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:44,885
You didn't happen to catch
the license plate number, did you?

673
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,971
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

674
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:49,890
T-H-D...

675
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,934
-0-3.
-0-3. Wow.

676
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,477
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.

677
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,813
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

678
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,026
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

679
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:04,363
Well, I had a ball.

680
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,989
You are welcome for the clue...

681
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,033
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate,

682
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,036
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

683
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,997
The plate. I can't run a plate.

684
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,457
I'm not in the system yet.

685
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,709
Give me the pen, please.

686
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,336
What was it you said?

687
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,505
"Any moron can run a plate"?

688
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:26,426
Gosh. If only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

689
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,847
Rabbit, I did what you asked!
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

690
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:34,226
Not forever. Well, I only have
36 hours left to solve this case.

691
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,812
So can you run the plate or not?

692
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,607
Actually, I just remembered...

693
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,067
I have a pal at the DMV.

694
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,862
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

695
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,697
If you need something done, he's on it.

696
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,366
I hope so. We are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.

697
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,329
Wait. They're all sloths?

698
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,193
You said this was going to be quick!

699
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,487
Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast?

700
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,073
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

701
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:33,076
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

702
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,205
Nice to...

703
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,207
see you...

704
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,751
too.

705
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,212
Hey, Flash,
I'd love you to meet my friend.

706
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,297
Darling, I've forgotten your name.

707
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,592
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

708
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,093
I am...

709
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:51,595
doing...

710
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,597
just...

711
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:54,932
Fine?

712
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:57,267
...as well as...

713
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:58,644
I can...

714
00:41:59,144 --> 00:41:59,978
be.

715
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,396
-What...
-Hang in there.

716
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:02,606
...can I...

717
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,900
-do...
-I was hoping you could run a...

718
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:06,068
...for you...

719
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,277
Well, I was hoping you could...

720
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:08,487
...today?

721
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,617
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

722
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,494
We are in a really big hurry.

723
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:18,413
Sure.

724
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,915
What's the...

725
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,251
-plate...
-2-9-T...

726
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,544
...number?

727
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,421
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

728
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:36,640
Two...

729
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:39,935
nine...

730
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,437
T-H-D-0-3.

731
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,481
...T...

732
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,775
H-D-0-3.

733
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,485
...H...

734
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,654
D-0-3.

735
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:54,825
...D...

736
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,451
0-3.

737
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:58,662
...0...

738
00:42:58,829 --> 00:42:59,913
3.

739
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,333
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

740
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,501
No!

741
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,961
Sure.

742
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,507
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

743
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:12,926
I don't...

744
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,303
know.

745
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,512
What...

746
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:16,680
do...

747
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:18,515
you call...

748
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,601
-a...
-Three-humped camel.

749
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,186
...three-humped...

750
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,187
camel?

751
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,355
Pregnant.

752
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,289
Yes, very funny, very funny.

753
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,707
Can we please just focus on the...

754
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,334
-Hey...
-Wait, wait, wait!

755
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:46,710
...Priscilla!

756
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,045
Oh, no!

757
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,547
Yes...

758
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,382
Flash?

759
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:53,217
What...

760
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,218
do...

761
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,053
-No!
-...you call a...

762
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,639
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!"
Okay, great, we got it.

763
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,266
...three... humped...

764
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,364
-Here...
-Yeah. Hurry.

765
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,574
-...you...
-Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

766
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,659
...go.

767
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,203
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

768
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,540
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

769
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,458
Way to hustle, bud.
I love you. I owe you.

770
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,418
Hurry! We gotta beat
the rush hour, and...

771
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,879
It's night?

772
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,340
Closed. Great.

773
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:37,427
And I will bet you
you don't have a warrant to get in.

774
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,471
Darn it. It's a bummer.

775
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:41,557
You wasted the day on purpose.

776
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:43,433
Madam, I have a fake badge.

777
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,936
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

778
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:51,275
It's not a pretend investigation. Look,
see? See him? This otter is missing.

779
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,111
Then they should've gotten
a real cop to find him.

780
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,487
What is your problem?

781
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,573
Does seeing me fail
somehow make you feel better

782
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,449
about your own sad, miserable life?

783
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,660
It does. 100%.

784
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:05,080
Now, since you're sans warrant...

785
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:08,083
I guess we're... done?

786
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:12,796
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

787
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:14,798
Hey!

788
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,220
First off, you throw like a bunny.

789
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,891
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.

790
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:26,852
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

791
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:30,230
The thing is, you don't need a warrant
if you have probable cause...

792
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:34,318
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

793
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:37,029
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

794
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,867
2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This is it!

795
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,002
Polar bear fur.

796
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:56,590
-Oh, my God!
-What?

797
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,510
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

798
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:01,720
But on CD.

799
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:03,263
Who still uses CDs?

800
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:13,607
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

801
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:17,569
Those are claw marks.

802
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,947
You ever seen anything like this?

803
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,156
No.

804
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,075
Wait, look.

805
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,454
This is him, Emmitt Otterton.

806
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,998
He was definitely here.

807
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,334
What do you think happened?

808
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:36,255
Now, wait a minute.

809
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:40,968
Polar bear fur,
Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

810
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,886
I know whose car this is. We got to go.

811
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:43,887
Why? Whose car is it?

812
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,974
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big.

813
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,601
And he does not like me.
So we gotta go!

814
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,562
I'm not leaving.
This is a crime scene.

815
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,064
It's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here...

816
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,566
so we're leaving right now.

817
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:58,193
Raymond!

818
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,404
And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

819
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:05,659
And, speaking of "no see,"
how about you forget you saw me?

820
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:06,869
For old times' sake?

821
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,078
That's a no.

822
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,303
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

823
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,098
I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

824
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:32,144
that was made from the fur
of a skunk...

825
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,313
...'s butt.

826
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,608
Sweet cheese and crackers.

827
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:53,749
Is that Mr. Big?

828
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:54,958
No.

829
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,293
What about him?

830
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,628
-Is that him?
-No!

831
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:01,673
That's got to be him.

832
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,383
Stop talking, stop talking,
stop talking!

833
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,770
Mr. Big, sir. This is a simple...

834
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,523
Yeah.

835
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,735
This is a simple misunderstanding.

836
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:26,657
You come here, unannounced, on the
day my daughter is to be married.

837
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,825
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

838
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,788
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

839
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:35,457
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

840
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,585
I trusted you, Nicky.

841
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,629
I welcomed you into my home.

842
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:43,048
We broke bread together.

843
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,676
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

844
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,970
And how did you repay my generosity?

845
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:52,099
With a rug made from the butt
of a skunk.

846
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,059
A skunk-butt rug.

847
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:55,769
You disrespected me.

848
00:48:55,936 --> 00:49:00,691
You disrespected my Gram-mama,
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

849
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:05,946
I told you never to show your face
here again but here you are...

850
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,032
snooping around with this...

851
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,492
What are you? A performer?

852
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:11,827
What's with the costume?

853
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:12,786
Sir. I am a...

854
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,454
Mime! She is a mime.

855
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:17,791
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.

856
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,209
No, I am a cop.

857
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,003
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

858
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,714
And my evidence puts him in your car.

859
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,424
So intimidate me all you want.

860
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:30,345
I'm going to find out what you did
to that otter if it's the last thing I do.

861
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,267
Then I have only one request.

862
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,854
Say hello to Gram-mama.
Ice 'em.

863
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,940
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

864
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,358
And you never will.

865
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:44,943
Please! No, no, no!

866
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,696
If you're mad at me about the rug,
I've got more rugs!

867
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,867
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

868
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,578
What did we say?

869
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,830
No icing anyone at my wedding!

870
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,458
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

871
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,542
Ice 'em.

872
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:01,585
No, no no!

873
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:02,711
Wait. Please!

874
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:06,256
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

875
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,674
From that giant donut.

876
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:08,842
This bunny?

877
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,677
Yeah! Hi!

878
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:13,263
Hi. I love your dress.

879
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:14,973
Thank you.

880
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:16,475
Put 'em down.

881
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:21,688
You've done me a great service.

882
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:24,024
I will help you find the otter.

883
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:29,112
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

884
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:58,809
Otterton is my florist.

885
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,728
He's like a part of the family.

886
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:04,857
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

887
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,943
That's why I sent that car
to pick him up.

888
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,404
But he never arrived.

889
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:12,322
Because he was attacked.

890
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,992
No. He attacked.

891
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:16,577
Otterton?

892
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,872
Otterton. He went crazy.

893
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:24,001
Ripped up the car,
scared my driver half to death...

894
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,670
and disappeared into the night.

895
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:29,965
But he's a sweet little otter.

896
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:35,345
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down...

897
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,723
we are still animals.

898
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,895
You want to find Otterton,
talk to the driver of that car.

899
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,646
His name is Manchas...

900
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,357
lives in the Rainforest District.

901
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:50,027
Only he can tell you more.

902
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:55,490
Mr. Manchas?

903
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,701
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

904
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,913
We just wanna know
what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

905
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:06,835
You...

906
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,212
should be asking...

907
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,173
what happened to me.

908
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:15,302
A teensy otter did that?

909
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,762
What happened?

910
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,764
He was an animal.

911
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:21,099
Down...

912
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,727
on all fours.

913
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,190
He was a savage!

914
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:40,118
There was no warning.

915
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:42,538
He just kept yelling
about the Night Howlers.

916
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:46,250
Over and over. The Night Howlers.

917
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:49,795
So you know about
the Night Howlers, too?

918
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,380
Good. Good, good.

919
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:56,134
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here to talk about.

920
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,678
-Right?
-Yup.

921
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,556
So, you just open the door...

922
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,307
and tell us what you know...

923
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,601
and we will tell you
what we know. Okay?

924
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,272
Okay.

925
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:11,275
Clever fox.

926
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,114
Mr. Manchas?

927
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,286
Buddy?

928
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:23,579
Are you...

929
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:24,580
okay?

930
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:29,126
Run. Run!

931
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:35,215
What is wrong with him?

932
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,717
I don't know!

933
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,639
Jump!

934
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,310
Come on!

935
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:52,399
Head down!

936
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:55,861
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

937
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:59,323
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest
singer of our lifetime, angel with horns?

938
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,576
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

939
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:05,954
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.

940
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:11,043
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

941
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,879
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

942
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:15,506
Clawhauser!

943
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:19,551
Listen to me, we have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

944
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:20,636
Vine and Tuh-junja!

945
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:21,970
It's "Tuh-hunga!"

946
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:24,139
Okay, we're sending backup! Hopps?

947
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:26,058
Hopps!

948
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,519
There!

949
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,145
Head for the sky trams!

950
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:41,114
Get in! Carrots.

951
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,241
Carrots!

952
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,242
Go!

953
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,495
No, no, no!

954
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:47,913
Buddy.

955
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,873
One predator to another...

956
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,004
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

957
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:57,840
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space!

958
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,515
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

959
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,643
-I'm gonna let go!
-No, you, what?

960
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:11,728
One, two...

961
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,238
Carrots. You saved my life.

962
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:24,616
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

963
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,760
Well, this should be good.

964
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:46,889
I thought this was
just a missing mammal case...

965
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,557
but it's way bigger.

966
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,851
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

967
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:55,063
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

968
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:00,110
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't "go savage."

969
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:03,280
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

970
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,202
What? He was right here.

971
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:09,828
The "savage" jaguar?

972
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:12,915
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

973
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:18,462
Or, maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.

974
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,463
Let's go!

975
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,631
Wait, sir.

976
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,716
I'm not the only one who saw him.

977
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,051
Nick!

978
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,678
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

979
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,555
He was a key witness, and I...

980
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,891
Two days to find the otter...

981
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:33,310
or you quit.

982
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,187
That was the deal.

983
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,855
Badge.

984
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,112
-But, sir, we...
-Badge!

985
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:51,078
No.

986
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:53,622
What did you say, fox?

987
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:57,292
Sorry. What I said was, "no."

988
00:56:57,334 --> 00:57:00,170
She will not be giving you that badge.

989
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:04,049
Look, you give her a clown vest
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

990
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:07,094
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

991
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,054
Yeah.

992
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,681
No wonder she needed to get help
from a fox.

993
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:13,016
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

994
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:14,518
Here's the thing, Chief.

995
00:57:14,643 --> 00:57:16,103
You gave her the 48 hours...

996
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,188
so, technically, we still have...

997
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,482
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

998
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:22,985
and that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

999
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:27,489
So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

1000
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:28,991
Good day.

1001
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,290
Officer Hopps.

1002
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,397
Thank you.

1003
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:03,901
Never let them see that they get to you.

1004
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,403
So...

1005
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,989
things do get to you?

1006
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,575
No, I mean, not anymore...

1007
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:15,746
but I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

1008
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:16,872
Har-har.

1009
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,999
No, it's true.

1010
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,252
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

1011
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:27,424
and all I wanted to do
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

1012
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:30,302
So, my mom scraped together
enough money

1013
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:32,763
to buy me a brand-new uniform...

1014
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,474
because, by God, I was gonna fit in.

1015
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:39,019
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop.

1016
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,020
The only fox.

1017
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:41,021
Okay, Nick.

1018
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,773
I was gonna be part of a pack.

1019
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,399
Ready for initiation?

1020
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:46,360
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

1021
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,195
I was so proud.

1022
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:51,949
Okay.

1023
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,535
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

1024
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,121
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

1025
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:01,208
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

1026
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,212
Even though you're a fox?

1027
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:06,630
What?

1028
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:11,468
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

1029
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,804
No, please! Tell me!
What did I do wrong?

1030
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:15,556
What did I do?

1031
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,977
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle...

1032
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,063
you're even dumber than you look!

1033
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,192
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1034
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,377
I learned two things that day.

1035
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:46,837
One...

1036
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:51,091
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

1037
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:54,344
And two?

1038
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:59,474
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy...

1039
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:02,644
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

1040
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,356
Nick, you are so much more than that.

1041
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,154
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

1042
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,989
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

1043
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:15,866
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

1044
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:19,161
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

1045
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,622
The Jam Cams.

1046
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,458
-Seriously. It's okay.
-No, no, no.

1047
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,794
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

1048
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,671
All over the canopy!

1049
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:31,048
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

1050
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:32,424
The traffic cams would have caught it!

1051
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:33,425
Bingo!

1052
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,427
Pretty sneaky, slick!

1053
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,931
However, if you didn't have access
to the system before...

1054
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:42,726
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

1055
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:44,061
No.

1056
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:47,397
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

1057
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:50,817
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

1058
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,194
Sir...

1059
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,737
I'm so sorry. Sir!

1060
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:56,907
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

1061
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:59,952
Please. And clear my afternoon.
I'm going out.

1062
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,538
No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting
with Herds and Grazing.

1063
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,081
Sir, if I could just...

1064
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,751
Oh, mutton chops.

1065
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,963
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

1066
01:01:11,129 --> 01:01:12,339
We need your help.

1067
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,551
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

1068
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:26,228
So fluffy!

1069
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:27,145
Hey!

1070
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,772
Sheep never let me get this close.

1071
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:30,315
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

1072
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:31,483
It's like cotton candy.

1073
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,609
Stop it!

1074
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:33,861
Where to?

1075
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,322
Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.

1076
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,366
There! Traffic cams for the whole city.

1077
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:41,743
This is so exciting, actually!

1078
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,537
I never get to do
anything this important.

1079
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:46,081
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

1080
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,625
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

1081
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,253
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

1082
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,796
But he did give me that nice mug.

1083
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,383
Feels good to be appreciated.

1084
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,843
Smell-wether!

1085
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,721
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1086
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:02,764
I called him Lion-fart once.

1087
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,350
He did not care for that. Let me tell you,
it was not a good day for me.

1088
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:06,268
Yes, sir?

1089
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,061
I thought you were going to
cancel my afternoon!

1090
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:10,105
Oh, dear. I better go.

1091
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,859
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...

1092
01:02:14,026 --> 01:02:15,944
While we're young, Smell-wether!

1093
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,073
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

1094
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,159
Shush. Okay, traffic cams.

1095
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,412
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

1096
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,794
Who are these guys?

1097
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,840
Timberwolves.
Look at these dumb-dumbs.

1098
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,056
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

1099
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:45,516
And there it is.

1100
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:48,477
What is it with wolves and the howling?
It's like...

1101
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,437
Howlers. Night Howlers.

1102
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:52,773
That's what Manchas was afraid of!
Wolves!

1103
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,400
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...

1104
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,277
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

1105
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:59,988
All we gotta do
is find out where they went.

1106
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:08,413
Wait, where did they go?

1107
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,792
If I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal...

1108
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:12,918
which I never have...

1109
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,878
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1110
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:16,839
Which would put them out...

1111
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:19,049
right there.

1112
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:22,761
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

1113
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:27,057
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

1114
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:28,475
How dare you.

1115
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,435
Acacia Alley?

1116
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:31,937
Ficus Underpass.

1117
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,355
South Canyon.

1118
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:34,314
They're heading out of town.

1119
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:36,692
Where does that road go?

1120
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,446
Gary, quit it!

1121
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:23,488
You're gonna start a howl.

1122
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:24,656
I didn't start it!

1123
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:33,582
Come on.

1124
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,009
You are a clever bunny.

1125
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:02,986
It looks like this was a hospital.

1126
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,918
You know, after you.
You're the cop.

1127
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,554
Okay, all clear.

1128
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,894
All this equipment is brand new.

1129
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:38,605
Carrots.

1130
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:42,317
Claw marks.

1131
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,862
Yeah, huge claw marks.
What kind of...

1132
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,383
Mr. Manchas.

1133
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:17,728
It's him.

1134
01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:19,897
We found our otter.

1135
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,648
Mr. Otterton.

1136
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:25,194
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

1137
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,154
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1138
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:29,698
Or not.

1139
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:32,117
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

1140
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:34,578
11, 12, 13, 14...

1141
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:37,831
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

1142
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:40,792
Chief Bogo
handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1143
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:41,919
They're all here.

1144
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:45,756
All the missing mammals are right here.

1145
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,889
Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor!

1146
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:54,890
I want answers.

1147
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,350
Mayor Lionheart, please.

1148
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,352
We're doing everything we can.

1149
01:06:58,435 --> 01:06:59,394
Really?

1150
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:01,355
Because I got a dozen and a half
animals here

1151
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:03,190
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

1152
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:04,900
and you can't tell me why.

1153
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:07,653
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything."

1154
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,029
Sir...

1155
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:10,906
it may be time
to consider their biology.

1156
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:12,950
What? What do you mean "biology?"

1157
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,953
The only animals going savage
are predators.

1158
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:18,747
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

1159
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,750
Great idea. Tell the public.

1160
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:24,878
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor...

1161
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,713
who is a lion?

1162
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:27,965
I'll be ruined!

1163
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,341
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1164
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:31,635
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1165
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:35,055
And we are going to keep it that way.

1166
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:36,682
No, no, no!

1167
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:38,141
Someone's here.

1168
01:07:38,308 --> 01:07:39,726
Sir, you need to go, now!

1169
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,562
Security! Sweep the area!

1170
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,488
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

1171
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,949
That's it. I'm dead, you're dead.
Everybody's dead!

1172
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,158
Can you swim?

1173
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:58,161
What? Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

1174
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,019
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1175
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:24,438
We gotta tell Bogo!

1176
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:30,027
Wow! You are one hot dancer,
Chief Bogo.

1177
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,363
-Chief Bogo!
-Not now!

1178
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,448
Wait, is that Gazelle?

1179
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:36,366
No.

1180
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:39,368
I'm Gazelle,
and you are one hot dancer.

1181
01:08:39,493 --> 01:08:41,205
You have the app too?

1182
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:43,749
Chief!

1183
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,585
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

1184
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:50,339
Yes of course! About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called.

1185
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,548
She found all of them.

1186
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,384
Wow! I'm impressed.

1187
01:08:57,554 --> 01:09:00,224
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything...

1188
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:03,060
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!

1189
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:05,270
You were just trying to protect your job.

1190
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:08,273
No. Listen, we still don't know
why this is happening.

1191
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,734
It could destroy Zootopia.

1192
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:11,984
You have the right to remain silent.

1193
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:14,613
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1194
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:21,370
Ladies and gentlemammals.

1195
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,331
14 mammals went missing...

1196
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:28,167
and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...

1197
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:29,627
who will speak to you in a moment.

1198
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,087
But first, let me remind you...

1199
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:32,256
I'm so nervous.

1200
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,216
Okay. Press Conference 101.

1201
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:36,926
You wanna look smart? Answer
their question with your own question...

1202
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:40,138
and then answer
that question. Like this.

1203
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:43,642
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps,
what can you tell us about the case?"

1204
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:45,394
"Well, was this a tough case?

1205
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,688
"Yes. Yes, it was."
You see?

1206
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:49,523
You should be there with me.

1207
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:51,149
We did this together.

1208
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:54,361
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

1209
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:59,074
Funny you should say that,
because I've been thinking...

1210
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:03,787
It would be nice to have a partner.

1211
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:12,087
Here. In case
you need something to write with.

1212
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,842
At twenty-two hundred hours,
we found all these missing animals...

1213
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:19,595
Officer Hopps, it's time.

1214
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:23,432
They appear to be in good health,
physically, if not emotionally.

1215
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:28,520
So now, I'll turn things over
to the officer who cracked the case.

1216
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,355
Officer Judy Hopps.

1217
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:33,984
-Officer Hopps!
-Officer Hopps!

1218
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:35,027
Over here!

1219
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:36,028
Yes?

1220
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:37,988
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1221
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:42,659
Well, the animals in question...

1222
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,789
Are they all different species?

1223
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,958
Yes. Yes, they are.

1224
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:53,462
Okay, so what is the connection?

1225
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:57,299
All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

1226
01:10:57,382 --> 01:11:00,511
So, predators
are the only ones going savage?

1227
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:03,347
That is accurate. Yes.

1228
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,848
Why is this happening?

1229
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,099
We still don't know.

1230
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:12,689
It may have something
to do with biology.

1231
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:14,191
What do you mean by that?

1232
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,527
A biological component.

1233
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,821
You know, something in their DNA.

1234
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,491
In their DNA?
Can you elaborate on that, please?

1235
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:26,870
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1236
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:33,335
predators survived through
their aggressive...

1237
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,087
hunting instincts.

1238
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:36,213
For whatever reason...

1239
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:40,551
they seem to be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways.

1240
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:41,468
Of course they did.

1241
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,805
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1242
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:47,015
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1243
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:50,477
It is possible.
So we must be vigilant.

1244
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:53,897
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1245
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,524
Will more mammals go savage?

1246
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:56,775
What is being done to protect us?

1247
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,319
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1248
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:02,656
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.

1249
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,032
No more questions.

1250
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:07,619
Was I okay?

1251
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:10,080
You did fine.

1252
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:11,874
That went so fast.

1253
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:14,501
I didn't get a chance to mention you,
or say anything about how we...

1254
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:17,171
I think you said plenty.

1255
01:12:17,254 --> 01:12:18,964
What do you mean?

1256
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:21,466
"Clearly there's
a biological component?"

1257
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:26,471
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1258
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:28,265
Are you serious?

1259
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,934
I just stated
the facts of the case.

1260
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:33,604
I mean it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1261
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,606
Right. But a fox could?

1262
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:38,108
Nick, stop it.
You're not like them.

1263
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,027
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1264
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:42,863
You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.

1265
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,489
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1266
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:48,660
The kind that makes you think
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1267
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:52,664
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we met.

1268
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,959
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1269
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,963
Do you think I might go nuts?

1270
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:02,299
Do you think I might go savage?

1271
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,551
Do you think I might try to...

1272
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:05,719
eat you?

1273
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:10,891
I knew it.

1274
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:15,479
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me.

1275
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:19,399
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1276
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,324
No. Nick. Nick!

1277
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,493
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

1278
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,328
No, he's my friend.

1279
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,288
We can't even trust our own friends?

1280
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:35,332
That is not what I said! Please!

1281
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:36,166
Are we safe?

1282
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,252
Have any foxes gone savage?

1283
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:40,838
More bad news in this city
gripped by fear.

1284
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:44,091
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling...

1285
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,260
by a savage polar bear.

1286
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,762
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...

1287
01:13:48,846 --> 01:13:52,349
after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence

1288
01:13:52,391 --> 01:13:55,060
to traditionally predatory animals.

1289
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:58,939
Meanwhile, a peace rally
organized by pop star Gazelle...

1290
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,524
was marred by protest.

1291
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,067
Go back to the forest, predator!

1292
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:04,194
I'm from the savanna!

1293
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:06,154
Zootopia is a unique place.

1294
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:09,783
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...

1295
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,327
where we celebrate our differences.

1296
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:13,912
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1297
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,542
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1298
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,919
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1299
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:28,385
We don't know why these attacks
keep happening...

1300
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:33,390
but it is irresponsible
to label all predators as savages.

1301
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,899
That's not my Emmitt.

1302
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,820
We cannot let fear divide us.

1303
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:51,533
Please give me back
the Zootopia I love.

1304
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,079
Come on, Hopps.

1305
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:57,623
The new mayor wants to see us.

1306
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,083
The mayor? Why?

1307
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,212
It would seem you've arrived.

1308
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:08,091
Clawhauser?

1309
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:09,801
What are you doing?

1310
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,472
They thought it would be better...

1311
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:18,393
if a predator such as myself
wasn't the first face that you see...

1312
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,729
when you walk into the ZPD.

1313
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:22,147
What?

1314
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,651
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1315
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:28,278
It's by the boiler.

1316
01:15:30,405 --> 01:15:31,907
Hopps!

1317
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,290
I don't understand.

1318
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:43,460
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

1319
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:46,129
and right now they're just really scared.

1320
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:49,800
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.

1321
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:56,306
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want
you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1322
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:06,483
I'm not a hero.

1323
01:16:07,234 --> 01:16:10,696
I came here
to make the world a better place...

1324
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,406
but I think I broke it.

1325
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:16,743
Don't give yourself
so much credit, Hopps.

1326
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,330
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1327
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:23,000
Like you.

1328
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:29,548
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

1329
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:33,010
is supposed to serve and protect.

1330
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,470
Help the city.

1331
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:38,098
Not tear it apart.

1332
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,062
I don't deserve this badge.

1333
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:45,022
Hopps...

1334
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:48,358
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.

1335
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,069
It's what you wanted
since you were a kid.

1336
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,905
You can't quit.

1337
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,073
Thank you for the opportunity.

1338
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:16,011
A dozen carrots.

1339
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:17,304
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.

1340
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:18,472
Come on.

1341
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:27,147
Hey, there, Jude.
Jude the dude.

1342
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:30,067
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1343
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,235
I'm fine.

1344
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,862
You are not fine.
Your ears are droopy.

1345
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:37,533
Why did I think I could
make a difference?

1346
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,284
Because you're a trier,
that's why.

1347
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:41,078
You've always been a trier.

1348
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:42,704
Oh, I tried.

1349
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:46,667
And it made life so much
worse for so many innocent predators.

1350
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,044
Not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil.

1351
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,462
Right on time.

1352
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,300
Is that Gideon Grey?

1353
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,469
Yep. It sure is.
We work with him now.

1354
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:58,679
He's our partner.

1355
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,848
And we would never have considered it
had you not opened our minds.

1356
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:02,015
That's right.

1357
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,726
Gid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1358
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:11,859
That's really cool, you guys.

1359
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,694
Gideon Grey.

1360
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:15,279
I'll be darned.

1361
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:19,908
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1362
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:21,910
I had a lot of self-doubt,

1363
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:25,581
and it manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression.

1364
01:18:25,747 --> 01:18:27,875
I was a major jerk.

1365
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:32,462
I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1366
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:36,216
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

1367
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:41,054
Hey, kids, don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias.

1368
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,849
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

1369
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,643
My family always
just called them Night Howlers.

1370
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:49,605
What did you say?

1371
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,481
Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1372
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,275
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

1373
01:18:53,442 --> 01:18:55,027
but I don't like the little ones
going near 'em...

1374
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:56,570
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1375
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,614
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids

1376
01:18:58,655 --> 01:18:59,907
and went completely nuts.

1377
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:02,367
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1378
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,870
A bunny can go savage.

1379
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:08,332
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1380
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:12,544
Sure it did! There's a sizable divot
in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1381
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:16,048
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

1382
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:19,259
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

1383
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:21,428
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1384
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:23,096
Keys!

1385
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:24,473
Keys, keys, keys!
Hurry! Come on!

1386
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,184
Thank you! I love you! Bye!

1387
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:33,774
You catch any of that, Bon?

1388
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:34,983
Not one bit.

1389
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,820
That makes me feel a little bit better.
I thought she was talking in tongues.

1390
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,965
Who is it?

1391
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,132
I need to find Nick.

1392
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:00,717
Please.

1393
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:02,970
Nick?

1394
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,055
Nick!

1395
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:09,393
Oh, Nick.

1396
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,311
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

1397
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,188
They're toxic flowers.

1398
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:15,399
I think someone
is targeting predators on purpose

1399
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,985
and making them go savage!

1400
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,653
Wow.

1401
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:22,781
Isn't that interesting?

1402
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:29,162
Wait! I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.

1403
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,083
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

1404
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:37,754
And irresponsible and small-minded.

1405
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:41,758
But predators shouldn't have
to suffer for my mistakes.

1406
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,678
I have to fix this.

1407
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,514
But I can't do it without you.

1408
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,561
And after we're done...

1409
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:54,438
you can hate me.

1410
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,107
And that'll be fine.

1411
01:20:57,274 --> 01:21:00,569
Because I was a horrible friend...

1412
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:02,112
and I hurt you.

1413
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:08,785
and you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

1414
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:12,915
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1415
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:20,506
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1416
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:25,469
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1417
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:28,555
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

1418
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:29,723
in 48 hours.

1419
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:35,145
All right. Get in here.

1420
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:41,068
Okay. You bunnies are so emotional.

1421
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,654
There we go. Deep breath.

1422
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:47,491
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?

1423
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:50,494
You are standing on my tail, though.
Off, off, off.

1424
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:51,411
I'm sorry.

1425
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,002
I thought you guys only grew carrots.

1426
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:00,879
What's the plan?

1427
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:02,756
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1428
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:04,132
Okay. How?

1429
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:05,634
Know this guy?

1430
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,262
I told you. I know everybody.

1431
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:12,724
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

1432
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:13,934
All your favorite movies!

1433
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:16,228
I got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1434
01:22:17,688 --> 01:22:20,732
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

1435
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:24,695
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

1436
01:22:24,903 --> 01:22:25,904
What's it to you, Wilde?

1437
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:27,406
Shouldn't you be melting down
a popsicle or something?

1438
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:29,867
Hey, if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.

1439
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:33,287
We both know those weren't
moldy onions I caught you stealing.

1440
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:35,706
What were you gonna do
with those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

1441
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:37,791
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

1442
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,793
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1443
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,087
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1444
01:22:43,672 --> 01:22:44,673
Ice him.

1445
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:50,429
You dirty rat! Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1446
01:22:50,596 --> 01:22:53,599
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

1447
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:55,893
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1448
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:59,229
Ice this weasel.

1449
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:01,523
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

1450
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,233
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

1451
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:05,194
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

1452
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,153
Money.

1453
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:08,238
And to whom did you sell them?

1454
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:11,408
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.

1455
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:14,578
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1456
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:17,080
He's unfriendly.

1457
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:28,509
Come on.

1458
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,273
The weasel wasn't lying.

1459
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,443
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1460
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:31,280
You got Doug here.

1461
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:34,157
What's the mark?

1462
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:38,495
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1463
01:24:38,662 --> 01:24:40,330
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.

1464
01:24:40,497 --> 01:24:41,582
I can hit him.

1465
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,170
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through
the open window of a moving car.

1466
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:01,810
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1467
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:04,354
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.

1468
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:08,525
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1469
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:11,528
Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now.

1470
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:12,779
Out.

1471
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:14,156
Where are you going?
Get back here!

1472
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:16,450
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1473
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:18,076
What are you looking at? Hey!

1474
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:20,787
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

1475
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:22,831
Carrots!

1476
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:25,292
It better have the extra foam this time.

1477
01:25:28,462 --> 01:25:29,463
Hey, open up!

1478
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:32,049
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

1479
01:25:32,216 --> 01:25:33,800
We need to get this evidence
to the ZPD!

1480
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,969
Great! Here it is. Got it!

1481
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,055
-No. All of it!
-Wait, what?

1482
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,561
Great, you're a conductor now?

1483
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:47,314
It would take a miracle
to get this rust-bucket going.

1484
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:51,235
Well. Hallelujah.

1485
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,238
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

1486
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:55,405
It just got worse!

1487
01:25:57,282 --> 01:25:58,408
Mission accomplished.

1488
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:00,911
Would it be premature
for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1489
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:03,580
All right. One toot-toot.

1490
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,502
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

1491
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:21,932
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

1492
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:25,060
Maybe that's just hail.

1493
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:26,728
Come here!

1494
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:30,816
Back off!

1495
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,780
Incoming!

1496
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:39,992
Carrots!

1497
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:41,618
Don't stop! Keep going!

1498
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:43,120
No, no! Please stop!

1499
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:44,955
Do not stop this car!

1500
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,770
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

1501
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:10,272
There's another train coming!

1502
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:11,899
Trust me. Speed up!

1503
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:17,946
Stop the train!

1504
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:19,907
Hey!

1505
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:21,867
Need some help?

1506
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:26,872
Oh, no, no, no! Too fast!

1507
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:28,832
Hold on!

1508
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:41,929
I think this is our stop!

1509
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:53,482
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1510
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,618
Everything is gone.

1511
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:07,037
We've lost it all.

1512
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,205
Yeah...

1513
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,706
except for this.

1514
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:13,043
Nick! Yes!

1515
01:28:13,085 --> 01:28:15,295
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1516
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,215
Cut through
the Natural History Museum!

1517
01:28:29,893 --> 01:28:30,853
There it is!

1518
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:32,521
Judy!

1519
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,231
Judy!

1520
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,233
Mayor Bellwether!

1521
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,484
We found out what's happening.

1522
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:39,486
Someone's darting predators
with a serum.

1523
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:41,572
That's what's making them go savage.

1524
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:44,575
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

1525
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,410
Thank you, ma'am.

1526
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:52,374
How did you know where to find us?

1527
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:54,376
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1528
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:59,548
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1529
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:05,095
Run.

1530
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:07,681
Get them.

1531
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:14,354
Carrots!

1532
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,442
I got you! Come here, come here.

1533
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:22,779
Okay, now just relax.

1534
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:25,115
Blueberry?

1535
01:29:25,282 --> 01:29:26,366
Pass.

1536
01:29:28,118 --> 01:29:30,120
Come on out, Judy.

1537
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,580
Take the case.

1538
01:29:31,788 --> 01:29:32,956
Get it to Bogo.

1539
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:34,750
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

1540
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:36,293
I can't walk.

1541
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:37,461
We'll think of something.

1542
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:39,963
We're on the same team, Judy.

1543
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:44,009
Underestimated, underappreciated.

1544
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:46,303
Aren't you sick of it?

1545
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:52,935
Predators.
They may be strong and loud...

1546
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,688
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1547
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:01,318
Think of it.

1548
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:03,487
90% of the population...

1549
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:05,906
united against a common enemy.

1550
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,492
We'll be unstoppable.

1551
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:15,999
Over there!

1552
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,921
Help!

1553
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:35,435
Well, you should have just stayed
on the carrot farm, huh?

1554
01:30:35,602 --> 01:30:38,146
It really is too bad. I did like you.

1555
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:40,858
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1556
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:43,861
No, of course not.

1557
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,028
He is.

1558
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:48,323
No! Nick!

1559
01:30:49,074 --> 01:30:53,453
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the Natural History Museum.

1560
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,706
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

1561
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:58,208
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

1562
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,461
But he can't help it, can he?

1563
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:06,133
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1564
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:19,897
Gosh. Think of the headline!

1565
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:24,234
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."

1566
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:29,072
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1567
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:30,741
Yeah, pretty much.

1568
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:31,950
It won't work!

1569
01:31:32,117 --> 01:31:34,703
Fear always works.

1570
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:37,915
And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1571
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,169
Oh, Nick.

1572
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:43,879
No.

1573
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:47,758
Bye-bye, bunny.

1574
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:58,602
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

1575
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:00,020
All right, you're milking it.

1576
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:01,438
Besides, I think we got it.

1577
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:03,857
We got it up there, thank you,
Yakety-yak!

1578
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:05,817
You laid it all out beautifully.

1579
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:06,777
What?

1580
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:08,111
Are you looking for the serum?

1581
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:09,905
Well, it's right here.

1582
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:11,073
What you've got in the weapon there?

1583
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,326
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

1584
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,870
They are delicious.
You should try some.

1585
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:20,582
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you, too.

1586
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,960
It's my word against yours.

1587
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:25,295
Actually...

1588
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:29,132
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia
to keep it that way.

1589
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:31,051
...it's your word against yours.

1590
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:34,304
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

1591
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,648
Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...

1592
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:46,567
guilty of masterminding
the savage attacks

1593
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:48,777
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1594
01:32:48,944 --> 01:32:52,489
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot...

1595
01:32:52,656 --> 01:32:54,992
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.

1596
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,619
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1597
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:59,037
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1598
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:03,000
It was a classic "doing the wrong thing
for the right reason" kind of a deal.

1599
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:06,128
In related news, doctors say
the Night Howler antidote

1600
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:07,337
is proving effective...

1601
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:10,340
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1602
01:33:13,343 --> 01:33:14,428
Emmitt.

1603
01:33:16,346 --> 01:33:17,347
Emmitt.

1604
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:21,894
Thank you.

1605
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:26,690
When I was a kid...

1606
01:33:26,857 --> 01:33:30,485
...I thought Zootopia
was this perfect place.

1607
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:35,032
Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.

1608
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:39,328
Turns out, real life's a little bit
more complicated...

1609
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:42,164
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1610
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:43,999
Real life is messy.

1611
01:33:45,876 --> 01:33:49,421
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.

1612
01:33:49,546 --> 01:33:54,051
Which means, hey, glass half-full,
we all have a lot in common.

1613
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:57,054
And the more we try
to understand one another...

1614
01:33:57,221 --> 01:34:00,098
the more exceptional
each of us will be.

1615
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:03,018
But we have to try.

1616
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:06,813
So, no matter what type of animal
you are...

1617
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:08,398
from the biggest elephant...

1618
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:12,069
to our first fox...

1619
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:17,366
I implore you... try.

1620
01:34:17,491 --> 01:34:20,911
Try to make the world a better place.

1621
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:23,580
Look inside yourself...

1622
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:25,415
and recognize that change...

1623
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,210
starts with you.

1624
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:31,129
It starts with me.

1625
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:35,425
It starts with all of us.

1626
01:34:43,517 --> 01:34:46,520
All right, enough! Shut it!

1627
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:50,691
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

1628
01:34:50,816 --> 01:34:51,984
including our first fox.

1629
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:54,111
Who cares?

1630
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:56,780
You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1631
01:34:56,947 --> 01:34:58,073
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1632
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:00,075
Assignments.

1633
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:02,786
Officers Grizzoli,
Fangmeyer, Delgato...

1634
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:04,955
Tundratown SWAT.

1635
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,124
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

1636
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:09,293
undercover.

1637
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,795
Hopps, Wilde.

1638
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,422
Parking duty.

1639
01:35:13,547 --> 01:35:15,257
Dismissed.

1640
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:17,301
Just kidding!

1641
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:20,470
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1642
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,973
Find him, shut him down.

1643
01:35:23,056 --> 01:35:26,977
So, are all rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1644
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:30,355
Oops. Sorry.

1645
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:33,192
Sly bunny.

1646
01:35:33,358 --> 01:35:34,651
Dumb fox.

1647
01:35:34,818 --> 01:35:36,862
You know you love me.

1648
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:38,655
Do I know that?

1649
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:40,699
Yes. Yes, I do.

1650
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:59,343
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.

1651
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,012
Flash?

1652
01:36:02,179 --> 01:36:04,181
Flash? Hundred yard dash?

1653
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,145
Nick.

1654
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:13,774
Good evening, Zootopia!

1655
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:17,194
Come on, everybody,
put your paws up!

1656
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:21,406
I messed up tonight
I lost another fight

1657
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:25,035
Lost to myself
But I'll just start again

1658
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:27,329
I keep falling down

1659
01:36:27,538 --> 01:36:29,665
I keep on hitting the ground

1660
01:36:29,873 --> 01:36:33,001
But I always get up now
To see what's next

1661
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:37,631
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1662
01:36:37,798 --> 01:36:41,802
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1663
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:46,223
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1664
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:50,727
I want to try even though I could fail

1665
01:36:50,894 --> 01:36:54,231
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1666
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:58,610
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1667
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:02,739
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1668
01:37:02,906 --> 01:37:06,577
I want to try even though I could fail

1669
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:12,416
Try everything

1670
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:16,753
Try everything

1671
01:37:19,298 --> 01:37:20,799
Try everything

1672
01:37:25,137 --> 01:37:26,889
Put your paws in the air. Come on!

1673
01:37:32,895 --> 01:37:36,315
Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love

1674
01:37:36,481 --> 01:37:40,485
Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath

1675
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:44,656
Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast

1676
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:49,119
Sometimes we come last
But we did our best

1677
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:52,706
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1678
01:37:52,956 --> 01:37:56,627
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again

1679
01:37:56,793 --> 01:38:00,797
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1680
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:02,549
I want to try

1681
01:38:02,799 --> 01:38:04,510
Even though I could fail

1682
01:38:05,928 --> 01:38:08,180
I won't give up
No, I won't give in

1683
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:13,310
Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again

1684
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:17,689
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything

1685
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:22,486
I want to try even though I could fail

1686
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:30,494
I'll keep making those new mistakes

1687
01:38:31,828 --> 01:38:39,169
And I'll keep on making them every day

1688
01:38:39,378 --> 01:38:43,882
Those new mistakes

1689
01:38:46,593 --> 01:38:48,303
Try everything

1690
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:52,474
Try everything

1691
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:56,520
Try everything

1692
01:39:04,945 --> 01:39:06,864
Come on!

1693
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:10,993
Shake your tails with me. Come on!

1694
01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:13,453
Yeah!

1695
01:39:17,416 --> 01:39:24,256
I'll keep on making those new mistakes

1696
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:32,472
I'll keep on making them every day

1697
01:39:33,682 --> 01:39:37,436
Those new mistakes

1698
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:42,232
Try everything

1699
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:46,320
Try everything

1700
01:39:48,989 --> 01:39:50,449
Try everything

1701
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:58,248
Try everything
