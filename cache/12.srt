1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in my power

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
to change the future,
and I'm the only one

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
fast enough to keep her alive.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,536
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,546 --> 00:00:00,537
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:02,271
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:02,272
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:04,907
When I threw the Philosopher's
Stone into the Speed Force,

30
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:04,908
&nbsp

31
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:06,575
I accidentally ran into the future.

32
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:06,576
&nbsp

33
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:08,210
I saw Savitar murder you.

34
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,211
&nbsp

35
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,812
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
- I'm not.

36
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:09,813
&nbsp

37
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:11,347
If you guys got something going on,

38
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:11,348
&nbsp

39
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:12,771
I hope you know you can talk to me.

40
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:12,772
&nbsp

41
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,250
Every night when I go to bed,

42
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,251
&nbsp

43
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,034
I'm afraid that I'm
gonna wake up and be her.

44
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:16,035
&nbsp

45
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,720
I didn't ask for these powers,

46
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:17,721
&nbsp

47
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,122
just like you didn't ask
to be used by Savitar.

48
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:20,123
&nbsp

49
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,427
So you're telling me that
every time I'm blacking out...

50
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:22,428
&nbsp

51
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:23,626
You've become Alchemy.

52
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:23,627
&nbsp

53
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,194
Alchemy can restore the powers

54
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:25,195
&nbsp

55
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:26,829
that people had in Flashpoint.

56
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:26,830
&nbsp

57
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,397
What Alchemy did was not your fault.

58
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:28,398
&nbsp

59
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm saying that at this
point in his training,

60
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:30,801
&nbsp

61
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,301
- you're faster than Barry!
- What?

62
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:32,302
&nbsp

63
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,383
It's crazy how fast I've
gotten in such a short time.

64
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:34,384
&nbsp

65
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:36,167
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

66
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:36,168
&nbsp

67
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,107
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar.

68
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:38,108
&nbsp

69
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,340
You are.

70
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,077
&nbsp

71
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:45,470
- So this is it, huh?
- Yeah.

72
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,471
&nbsp

73
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,673
This is the starting line to our race.

74
00:00:47,683 --> 00:00:47,674
&nbsp

75
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,641
Cisco set up sensors
all along the course,

76
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:49,642
&nbsp

77
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:52,123
and he'll be tracking your speed
all the way to the finish line

78
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:52,124
&nbsp

79
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,187
on the other side of town.

80
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:53,188
&nbsp

81
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:54,546
No, I meant this is it...

82
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:54,547
&nbsp

83
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:57,749
the day the greatest upset in
speedster history goes down.

84
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:57,750
&nbsp

85
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,853
Wally, man, this isn't
about winning or losing.

86
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:00,854
&nbsp

87
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,020
Okay?

88
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,021
&nbsp

89
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,422
This is about training

90
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:03,423
&nbsp

91
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,258
so you can get faster and
beat Savitar and save Iris.

92
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:06,259
&nbsp

93
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,360
- Yeah, which I'm gonna do.
- Okay.

94
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,361
&nbsp

95
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,062
But first I'm gonna
make you eat my dust.

96
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:10,063
&nbsp

97
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,363
I'm sorry.

98
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:11,364
&nbsp

99
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,232
Okay, you know there
is a reason they call me

100
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:13,233
&nbsp

101
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:15,734
the fastest man alive.

102
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:15,735
&nbsp

103
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:17,169
Cisco, you good?

104
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:17,170
&nbsp

105
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,670
Ladies and gentlemen,

106
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:18,671
&nbsp

107
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,040
the Central City Speedster
500 is about to begin.

108
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,041
&nbsp

109
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,943
But first, I've got five-to-one odds

110
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:24,944
&nbsp

111
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,945
Barry takes down Wally.

112
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:26,946
&nbsp

113
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,413
- Any takers?
- Yep.

114
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:28,414
&nbsp

115
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:30,949
Game of speculation?
Are we... we're betting?

116
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:30,950
&nbsp

117
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,184
Yeah, no, I'm in.

118
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:32,185
&nbsp

119
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:34,019
On my Earth, financial
wagering was banned

120
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:34,020
&nbsp

121
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,055
after an unfortunate incident
with Vice President Al Capone.

122
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:37,056
&nbsp

123
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,057
Well, lucky for you, you live here now.

124
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:39,058
&nbsp

125
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:41,460
- Yes.
- Put me down for 20 for Barry.

126
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:41,461
&nbsp

127
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,695
- Joe, got to be in it... come on.
- No, not me.

128
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:43,696
&nbsp

129
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,864
That's a Sophie's Choice
I'm not gonna make.

130
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:45,865
&nbsp

131
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,132
$80 on Barry.

132
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:47,133
&nbsp

133
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:48,667
Mama needs a new confocal microscope.

134
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:48,668
&nbsp

135
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,636
All right, H.R., you put
your life in my hands,

136
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:50,637
&nbsp

137
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,304
so I know for a fact
you like high stakes.

138
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:52,305
&nbsp

139
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,972
How much you in for?

140
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:53,973
&nbsp

141
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,409
Wallace's recent speed tests
ensure that he is a lock.

142
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:57,410
&nbsp

143
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,673
Put me down for an Abe Lincoln.

144
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:58,674
&nbsp

145
00:01:58,684 --> 00:01:59,978
- Hm?
- Uh, 100.

146
00:01:59,988 --> 00:01:59,979
&nbsp

147
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,020
Whatever 100 is on this
Earth, put me down for that.

148
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,021
&nbsp

149
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:03,764
- Guys, we're ready.
- All right, all right.

150
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:03,765
&nbsp

151
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:06,285
All bets are in, and may the
odds be ever in your favor.

152
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:06,286
&nbsp

153
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,587
Gentlemen, start your engines.

154
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:08,588
&nbsp

155
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,889
- Ready?
- Get set.

156
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:10,890
&nbsp

157
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,890
Go.

158
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:22,268
&nbsp

159
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:23,869
At the first marker, 1/3 of the way in,

160
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:23,870
&nbsp

161
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,637
Flash is in the lead...
or is that Kid Flash?

162
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:25,638
&nbsp

163
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,539
Kid Flash! Come on, little Joseph, go.

164
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:27,540
&nbsp

165
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,274
Come on, mama needs a new pair of shoes.

166
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:29,275
&nbsp

167
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,176
Come on, Wallace, down the lane!

168
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:31,177
&nbsp

169
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:32,644
I think he's done this before.

170
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,615
&nbsp

171
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,016
Ooh, second marker. Wally's in the lead.

172
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:38,017
&nbsp

173
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,584
Yeah, Wallace! That's my boy!

174
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:39,585
&nbsp

175
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,328
- You mean that's my boy.
- That's your boy.

176
00:02:41,338 --> 00:02:41,329
&nbsp

177
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,220
I want to double down.

178
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,221
&nbsp

179
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:43,821
I want to double down on that right now.

180
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:43,845
&nbsp

181
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:44,957
Oh, H.R., big spender.

182
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:44,958
&nbsp

183
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,391
- You serious?
- Serious?

184
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:46,392
&nbsp

185
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,260
Serious as a heart attack, Rich.

186
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,261
&nbsp

187
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,462
Guys, they're neck and neck.

188
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:50,463
&nbsp

189
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:51,863
And almost at the finish line.

190
00:02:51,873 --> 00:03:08,280
&nbsp

191
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,615
- Oh!
- Oh, yes!

192
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:10,616
&nbsp

193
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,985
- Pay up.
- Hmm?

194
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:12,986
&nbsp

195
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:14,319
Now?

196
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:14,320
&nbsp

197
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,722
Do you guys take IOUs?

198
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:16,723
&nbsp

199
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,190
Come on, man, that didn't count.

200
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,191
&nbsp

201
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,391
You know I can't phase yet.

202
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:19,392
&nbsp

203
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:21,727
Man, you just saw me do it, right?

204
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:21,728
&nbsp

205
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,062
And you have to be ready
to face any obstacle

206
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:24,063
&nbsp

207
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,364
that's put in your path.

208
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:25,365
&nbsp

209
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,932
Yeah, well, don't worry, Barry.

210
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:26,933
&nbsp

211
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm gonna get faster.

212
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:28,401
&nbsp

213
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:30,024
Pretty soon I'm gonna
be faster than you.

214
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:30,025
&nbsp

215
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:31,236
Oh, yeah?

216
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:31,237
&nbsp

217
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:33,604
Well, until then, what's my name?

218
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,657
&nbsp

219
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,320
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

220
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,749
&nbsp

221
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,218
Joe, hey, this one, is, uh...

222
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:46,219
&nbsp

223
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,353
Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.

224
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:48,354
&nbsp

225
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:50,422
- That's the body?
- Yeah, why?

226
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:50,423
&nbsp

227
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,491
Because he died less
than eight hours ago.

228
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:52,492
&nbsp

229
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:54,593
Eight hours?

230
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:54,594
&nbsp

231
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,894
He was a chef here...

232
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:55,895
&nbsp

233
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,518
Stuart Holzman... and
the owner confirmed

234
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:57,519
&nbsp

235
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,297
- that he was working last night.
- Huh.

236
00:03:59,307 --> 00:03:59,298
&nbsp

237
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,833
That's a lot of damage
in a short amount of time.

238
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:01,834
&nbsp

239
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:03,235
We thinking he's a meta?

240
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:03,236
&nbsp

241
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:05,103
Possibly, although certain chemicals

242
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:05,104
&nbsp

243
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,938
can cause a similar reaction.

244
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:06,939
&nbsp

245
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,974
Yeah, any acid with a pH below two.

246
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:08,975
&nbsp

247
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,409
Precisely.

248
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:10,410
&nbsp

249
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,193
We could be looking for
an aggressive variant

250
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:12,194
&nbsp

251
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,346
of a necrotized fasciitis.

252
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:14,347
&nbsp

253
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,081
A flesh-eating disease.

254
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:16,082
&nbsp

255
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:17,249
In a restaurant?

256
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,250
&nbsp

257
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,984
I'm never eating out again.

258
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:18,985
&nbsp

259
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,319
Okay, so an autopsy
might help us hone in

260
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:21,320
&nbsp

261
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,554
on what really did this.

262
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:22,555
&nbsp

263
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:23,655
Yes, I agree.

264
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:23,656
&nbsp

265
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,524
Unfortunately, County denied my request

266
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:25,525
&nbsp

267
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:27,426
for a 3D image medical scanner,

268
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:27,427
&nbsp

269
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,130
which would make short
work of the process.

270
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,131
&nbsp

271
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,163
Okay, well, we have
one at S.T.A.R. Labs.

272
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:31,164
&nbsp

273
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:33,031
Allen, this is an active investigation.

274
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,032
&nbsp

275
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,967
There is protocol to follow...

276
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:35,968
&nbsp

277
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,169
surely?

278
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:37,170
&nbsp

279
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,837
Not if we're gonna figure this out.

280
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:38,838
&nbsp

281
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:41,706
Okay, I'll bag the body
myself and meet you there.

282
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:41,707
&nbsp

283
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,140
Great.

284
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,045
&nbsp

285
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:50,214
Iris, hey.

286
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,450
&nbsp

287
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,051
You okay?

288
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:53,052
&nbsp

289
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:54,386
Yeah, I'm just, uh,

290
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:54,387
&nbsp

291
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:56,388
running up against a deadline, so...

292
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:56,389
&nbsp

293
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,457
Since I have you both, I wanted to ask,

294
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:58,458
&nbsp

295
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:01,193
um, Cecile's daughter, Joanie,

296
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:01,194
&nbsp

297
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,527
is in town, and I was thinking

298
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:02,528
&nbsp

299
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,296
that maybe we could all get together.

300
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:04,297
&nbsp

301
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,931
If you don't think it's too soon.

302
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:05,932
&nbsp

303
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,366
I mean, I haven't exactly been
dating Cecile for that long.

304
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:08,367
&nbsp

305
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,935
It's not too early, Joe.

306
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:09,936
&nbsp

307
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,103
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

308
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:11,104
&nbsp

309
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,671
And Jitters... is that cool?

310
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:12,672
&nbsp

311
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:13,872
Or is that too casual?

312
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:13,873
&nbsp

313
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,698
Dad, don't worry, okay?

314
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:15,699
&nbsp

315
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,067
It's great. Joanie's gonna love you.

316
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:18,068
&nbsp

317
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,469
I love my kids.

318
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:19,470
&nbsp

319
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,733
I'm gonna set it up. Thank you.

320
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:20,734
&nbsp

321
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:21,671
All right.

322
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:21,672
&nbsp

323
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:23,506
It's nice to see him so happy.

324
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:23,507
&nbsp

325
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,107
Yeah, it is.

326
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:25,108
&nbsp

327
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,642
You okay?

328
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:26,643
&nbsp

329
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:29,712
Hey, I need to show you
something at S.T.A.R. Labs.

330
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:29,713
&nbsp

331
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,413
Okay.

332
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:32,882
&nbsp

333
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,917
Look.

334
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:34,918
&nbsp

335
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:37,021
That's the name of the
restaurant where we just were.

336
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,022
&nbsp

337
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,621
- Yeah.
- I spoke to the owner,

338
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:38,622
&nbsp

339
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,983
and he said he doesn't think
that the restaurant can survive

340
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:40,984
&nbsp

341
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:42,818
an attack like this...
that they'd most likely

342
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:42,819
&nbsp

343
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,461
have to reopen under a new name.

344
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:45,462
&nbsp

345
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:46,996
It's all coming true, Barry.

346
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:46,997
&nbsp

347
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,197
No.

348
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:48,198
&nbsp

349
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,665
I thought things were changing.

350
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:49,666
&nbsp

351
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:52,068
Things are changing, okay? They are.

352
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:52,069
&nbsp

353
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,504
I was supposed to stop Plunder, right?

354
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:54,505
&nbsp

355
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,105
And instead Wally did.

356
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:56,106
&nbsp

357
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:57,773
And we're gonna...

358
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:57,774
&nbsp

359
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,775
Stop Savitar too. I'm making sure of it.

360
00:05:59,785 --> 00:05:59,776
&nbsp

361
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,444
What if we can't stop all of this?

362
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:03,913
&nbsp

363
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,015
I'm scared, Barry.

364
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:06,016
&nbsp

365
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:08,351
Okay, uh...

366
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,720
&nbsp

367
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,421
Maybe we should tell Joe.

368
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:12,422
&nbsp

369
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,190
No, no.

370
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,191
&nbsp

371
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,126
No, we agreed that we wouldn't.

372
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:17,127
&nbsp

373
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,561
Besides, you saw him earlier.

374
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:18,562
&nbsp

375
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:21,097
He's... he's planning
for a future with Cecile.

376
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:21,098
&nbsp

377
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,431
If we tell him about Savitar,

378
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:22,432
&nbsp

379
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:23,733
it's all he's gonna think about.

380
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:23,734
&nbsp

381
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:25,167
I-I can't do that to him.

382
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:25,168
&nbsp

383
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,469
- I won't.
- Okay.

384
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:26,470
&nbsp

385
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,070
Whatever you want.

386
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,071
&nbsp

387
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,572
Now listen to me.

388
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:29,573
&nbsp

389
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,608
I promise you I'm doing
everything in my power

390
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:32,609
&nbsp

391
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:35,077
to make sure that that
future never happens.

392
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:35,078
&nbsp

393
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,544
Okay.

394
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:38,414
&nbsp

395
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:41,817
You think this is what it's
like to be a character on "CSI"?

396
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:41,818
&nbsp

397
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,953
What do they hope to gain
from that examination?

398
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:43,954
&nbsp

399
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,988
They're trying to find
the exact cause of death.

400
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:45,989
&nbsp

401
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,423
Once we know that,
we'll have a better idea

402
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:47,424
&nbsp

403
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,691
of what we're dealing with.

404
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:48,692
&nbsp

405
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,426
But until then, we need to train.

406
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:50,427
&nbsp

407
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:52,128
I'm gonna teach you everything I know,

408
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:52,129
&nbsp

409
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,496
starting with phasing.

410
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:53,497
&nbsp

411
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,398
- Yes! Finally.
- You know what we should do?

412
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:55,399
&nbsp

413
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,782
We should concoct some simulations

414
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:56,783
&nbsp

415
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,401
to help Wallace learn this new skill.

416
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:58,402
&nbsp

417
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,535
What do you say, Francisco?

418
00:06:59,545 --> 00:06:59,536
&nbsp

419
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:00,770
I got one word for you:

420
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:00,771
&nbsp

421
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,071
quebracho.

422
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:02,072
&nbsp

423
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,205
Let's go.

424
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:03,206
&nbsp

425
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,141
Quebracho!

426
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,142
&nbsp

427
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,542
What's his name?

428
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:06,543
&nbsp

429
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,344
Doesn't really matter much now, does it?

430
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:08,345
&nbsp

431
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:09,858
Of course, we should
call him by his name.

432
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:09,859
&nbsp

433
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,259
After everything he's been through,

434
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:11,260
&nbsp

435
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,483
he deserves that much respect.

436
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:12,484
&nbsp

437
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:13,749
He is a corpse,

438
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:13,750
&nbsp

439
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,085
thus impervious to such bedside manners.

440
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:16,086
&nbsp

441
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,927
Well, thank goodness,
'cause I'd hate to have

442
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:17,928
&nbsp

443
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,262
to subject him to yours.

444
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:19,263
&nbsp

445
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,591
Victim is male, between 30 and 40,

446
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:21,592
&nbsp

447
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,492
with a highly necrotized epidermis.

448
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:23,493
&nbsp

449
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:25,094
We plan to do a full-body scan

450
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:25,095
&nbsp

451
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,862
and a chest wall retraction.

452
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:26,863
&nbsp

453
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,331
Julian, look.

454
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:34,471
&nbsp

455
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,039
The decay continues even
after the tissue's dead.

456
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:37,040
&nbsp

457
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,908
This is... this is not a bacteria.

458
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:38,909
&nbsp

459
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,509
Or any other disease
known to medical science.

460
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,747
&nbsp

461
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,782
That was one crazy set, man.

462
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:46,783
&nbsp

463
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:49,819
I'm telling you, Rob, you
keep wailing on that saxophone,

464
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:49,820
&nbsp

465
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,555
you're gonna running up to
Lee Jay Thompson in no time.

466
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:52,556
&nbsp

467
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,791
All right, have a good
one. Catch you laters.

468
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,527
&nbsp

469
00:07:57,537 --> 00:08:00,229
All right.

470
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:08,838
&nbsp

471
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:11,540
Whoo!

472
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,541
&nbsp

473
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,509
- Do I know you?
- Unlikely.

474
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:13,510
&nbsp

475
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,444
But I know you, Julio Mendez.

476
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:15,445
&nbsp

477
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,346
Man, that was some set.

478
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:17,347
&nbsp

479
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,648
Your cover of "Dock of the Bay"

480
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:18,649
&nbsp

481
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,316
took me to a different time and place.

482
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:20,317
&nbsp

483
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,685
Well, I'm glad you dug the set, man.

484
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:22,686
&nbsp

485
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,053
Hey, before you go, uh,

486
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,054
&nbsp

487
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,688
I'd just really like to shake your hand.

488
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:25,689
&nbsp

489
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,923
Yeah, anything for a fan.

490
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:32,528
&nbsp

491
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:35,831
What'd you do to me?

492
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:35,832
&nbsp

493
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:38,401
What you deserve for all
the pain you caused me.

494
00:08:38,411 --> 00:09:01,612
&nbsp

495
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:02,701
Oh!

496
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:02,702
&nbsp

497
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,469
Oh, no!

498
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:04,470
&nbsp

499
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,470
Ouch!

500
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,471
&nbsp

501
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,964
That hurt like a...

502
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:07,965
&nbsp

503
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,733
Like you ran into a giant wooden wall?

504
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:09,734
&nbsp

505
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:11,067
'Cause you did.

506
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:11,068
&nbsp

507
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:12,936
And it's not just any big wooden wall.

508
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:12,937
&nbsp

509
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,172
That's double-reinforced quebracho.

510
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:15,173
&nbsp

511
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:17,516
That's like the strongest stuff
on the planet, right there.

512
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:17,517
&nbsp

513
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,075
Well, fantastic choice, Cisco.

514
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:19,076
&nbsp

515
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,444
Well, it shouldn't matter if
it's wood or steel or stone.

516
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:21,445
&nbsp

517
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,868
If you're moving fast enough,
you can phase through anything.

518
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:23,869
&nbsp

519
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,651
Even molten lava... you know, if
you ever ended up in a volcano.

520
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:27,652
&nbsp

521
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,886
You know, I... I still don't get it.

522
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:29,887
&nbsp

523
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,288
- How do you do this?
- All right.

524
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:31,289
&nbsp

525
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:33,857
Here. Watch.

526
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:33,858
&nbsp

527
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,426
When you vibrate at the
natural frequency of air,

528
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:36,427
&nbsp

529
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:40,463
your body, your cells,
will be in an excited state

530
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:40,464
&nbsp

531
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:43,233
that'll allow you...

532
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:43,234
&nbsp

533
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,668
to phase.

534
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:44,669
&nbsp

535
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,412
Yeah, it's not... it's
not really helping.

536
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:46,413
&nbsp

537
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:47,504
What exactly do I do?

538
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:47,505
&nbsp

539
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:48,972
Connect with your body, right?

540
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:48,973
&nbsp

541
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,141
Connect with the air.
Be pure electricity.

542
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:51,142
&nbsp

543
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:53,276
You have to feel everything
that's around you.

544
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:53,277
&nbsp

545
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:54,945
All right?

546
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:54,946
&nbsp

547
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:56,780
So go fast and feel things.

548
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,781
&nbsp

549
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,082
Yeah, no worries.

550
00:09:59,092 --> 00:09:59,083
&nbsp

551
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:01,284
You can do this, Wallace.

552
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:01,285
&nbsp

553
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:02,719
Okay.

554
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:02,720
&nbsp

555
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,221
All right, all right.

556
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:04,222
&nbsp

557
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,356
You can do this.

558
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:06,357
&nbsp

559
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,024
Oh!

560
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:08,025
&nbsp

561
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,960
All right, again.

562
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:09,961
&nbsp

563
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,495
- Yeah?
- You got this.

564
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,332
&nbsp

565
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,066
- This isn't working.
- It's not working.

566
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:16,067
&nbsp

567
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,708
You've been training him. What's worked?

568
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:17,709
&nbsp

569
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,172
You know what works with that guy?

570
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:19,173
&nbsp

571
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,671
Vocal encouragement.
You got this, Wallace!

572
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:21,672
&nbsp

573
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,135
I don't know why you even ask him.

574
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:23,136
&nbsp

575
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,281
What did Wells do with me?

576
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:24,282
&nbsp

577
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:27,143
His plan was, uh, more
methodically constructed

578
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:27,144
&nbsp

579
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:29,045
than John Doe's in "Seven."

580
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:29,046
&nbsp

581
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,348
And he had a bit more
time to work it out

582
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:31,349
&nbsp

583
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,850
by, give or take, 15 years.

584
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:33,851
&nbsp

585
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:37,187
Well, we don't have 15 years.

586
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:37,188
&nbsp

587
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:38,555
I have a crime scene. I got to go.

588
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:38,556
&nbsp

589
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:39,889
I'll be back.

590
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:39,890
&nbsp

591
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,558
Just make sure he keeps practicing.

592
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:41,559
&nbsp

593
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,392
Go, Wallace!

594
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,997
&nbsp

595
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:49,833
Body was found by that bicyclist.

596
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:49,834
&nbsp

597
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:51,868
Same M.O. as the first one.

598
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:51,869
&nbsp

599
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,604
This victim was
performing here last night.

600
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:54,605
&nbsp

601
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:56,606
He's a lounge singer named Julio Mendez.

602
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:56,607
&nbsp

603
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:57,974
Julio Mendez?

604
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:57,975
&nbsp

605
00:10:57,985 --> 00:10:59,342
Has anybody seen Detective West?

606
00:10:59,352 --> 00:10:59,343
&nbsp

607
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:01,544
In Flashpoint, he was Captain Mendez.

608
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:01,545
&nbsp

609
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:04,281
Sorry. In Flashpoint, this...
this alternate universe

610
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:04,282
&nbsp

611
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,284
that you lived in,
he worked at the CCPD?

612
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:07,285
&nbsp

613
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:09,286
Yeah.

614
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:09,287
&nbsp

615
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:12,289
Wait a second, the other...
the other Vic, Stuart Holzman...

616
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:12,290
&nbsp

617
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,357
do we have a photo of him?

618
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:14,358
&nbsp

619
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,625
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

620
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:15,626
&nbsp

621
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:19,095
Yeah, hold on. That's him.

622
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:19,096
&nbsp

623
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:20,363
What is it?

624
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:20,364
&nbsp

625
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:22,299
He was a cop there, too.

626
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:22,300
&nbsp

627
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,302
So this is the second
dead cop from Flashpoint?

628
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:25,303
&nbsp

629
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,569
Yeah.

630
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:26,570
&nbsp

631
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,171
We got to figure out who this guy is.

632
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:28,172
&nbsp

633
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,606
Well, if we hurry,
there's still a chance

634
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:29,607
&nbsp

635
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,041
we can get some of the attacker's

636
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:31,042
&nbsp

637
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:33,009
residual DNA before this
corpse disintegrates,

638
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:33,010
&nbsp

639
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,511
but we've got to move quick.

640
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:34,512
&nbsp

641
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:36,813
Barry, you can help with that.

642
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:36,814
&nbsp

643
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,247
All right, come on.

644
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:41,318
&nbsp

645
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,552
Did anybody see me?

646
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:42,553
&nbsp

647
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:43,953
Damn, I barely saw you.

648
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:43,954
&nbsp

649
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,355
Look, we got to get going.

650
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:45,356
&nbsp

651
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,690
Hey, Joe, hold on.

652
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:46,691
&nbsp

653
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,325
Um, look, I-I know how excited you are

654
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:48,326
&nbsp

655
00:11:48,336 --> 00:11:50,393
for this coffee thing
with Joanie and Cecile,

656
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:50,394
&nbsp

657
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:51,895
but I think we should hold off.

658
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:51,896
&nbsp

659
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,519
I don't think it's a
good idea right now.

660
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:53,520
&nbsp

661
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,899
Bar, these two attacks
don't establish a pattern.

662
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:55,900
&nbsp

663
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,767
- Well...
- And besides, I'm a cop.

664
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:57,768
&nbsp

665
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,270
If I canceled my plans
every time I was in danger,

666
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,271
&nbsp

667
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,371
I'd never leave the house.

668
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:01,372
&nbsp

669
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:02,605
I-I hear you.

670
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:02,606
&nbsp

671
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:03,606
I would just feel a lot better

672
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:03,607
&nbsp

673
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,888
knowing you were someplace safe.

674
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:04,889
&nbsp

675
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,472
Name a place safer than a coffee shop

676
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:06,473
&nbsp

677
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:09,145
with my two speedster sons.

678
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:09,146
&nbsp

679
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:11,648
Meeting Joanie is important to Cecile,

680
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:11,649
&nbsp

681
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,783
therefore it's important to me.

682
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:13,784
&nbsp

683
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:16,586
Some things are worth taking risks for.

684
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:16,587
&nbsp

685
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:19,855
All right. Let's get out of here.

686
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,291
&nbsp

687
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:22,292
Anything?

688
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:22,293
&nbsp

689
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,326
Aside from this body

690
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:23,327
&nbsp

691
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:24,590
disintegrating before our eyes?

692
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,591
&nbsp

693
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,296
Nothing unusual.

694
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:26,297
&nbsp

695
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:29,132
There must be a heightened
point of necrosis somewhere.

696
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:29,133
&nbsp

697
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:32,035
Look!

698
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:32,036
&nbsp

699
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,804
We have less than 50 minutes
before this corpse disintegrates

700
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:34,805
&nbsp

701
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:36,172
into ash like the last one.

702
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:36,173
&nbsp

703
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:39,041
- We need to find it now.
- I'm aware.

704
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,478
&nbsp

705
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:43,880
This might be a faster
process if I did it alone.

706
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:43,881
&nbsp

707
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,716
You know, I've done
autopsies before, Julian.

708
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:46,717
&nbsp

709
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,284
I'm sure you have.

710
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:48,285
&nbsp

711
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:49,853
This might just be a quicker process

712
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:49,854
&nbsp

713
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:52,622
if I did it alone.

714
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:52,623
&nbsp

715
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,623
What are you doing?

716
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:53,624
&nbsp

717
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:54,657
The gradation is darker

718
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:54,658
&nbsp

719
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:55,658
on the palm of his hand

720
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:55,659
&nbsp

721
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,595
from the point of contact.

722
00:12:58,605 --> 00:12:58,596
&nbsp

723
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,964
I see, I see.

724
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:00,965
&nbsp

725
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,066
You know, I used to think
Barry was overreacting

726
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:03,067
&nbsp

727
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,970
when he complained about
sharing a lab with you.

728
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:04,971
&nbsp

729
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,170
But now I understand his frustration.

730
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,171
&nbsp

731
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,173
Believe me, no one is
more frustrated than I.

732
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:10,174
&nbsp

733
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,609
You do realize that it's
possible not to be a jerk

734
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:12,610
&nbsp

735
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,010
all the time, right?

736
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,011
&nbsp

737
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:15,645
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

738
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:21,819
&nbsp

739
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,119
Two strains of DNA.

740
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:23,120
&nbsp

741
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,021
One of them must be from our killer.

742
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:25,022
&nbsp

743
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:30,160
But, you know, there's
something else here.

744
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,161
&nbsp

745
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:33,830
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

746
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:33,831
&nbsp

747
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,698
I have...

748
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:35,699
&nbsp

749
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,967
in all the meta husks
created by Alchemy.

750
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,304
&nbsp

751
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:44,541
Which means the meta that
killed our two innocent people...

752
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:44,542
&nbsp

753
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,676
was created by me.

754
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:50,147
&nbsp

755
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:53,149
- French roast for Cecile.
- Thank you.

756
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,150
&nbsp

757
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,120
Non-dairy green tea latte for Joanie.

758
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,121
&nbsp

759
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,988
You not much of a
coffee drinker, Joanie?

760
00:13:58,998 --> 00:13:58,989
&nbsp

761
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,590
Well, I used to be, but then I learned

762
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:00,591
&nbsp

763
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:01,991
hot roasted coffee beans contain

764
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:01,992
&nbsp

765
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,194
cancer-causing levels of acrylamide.

766
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:04,195
&nbsp

767
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:05,727
Well, damn.

768
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:08,798
&nbsp

769
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:12,635
Uh, Joanie, Cecile
says you're at Coast U?

770
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:12,636
&nbsp

771
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:14,671
- What are you studying?
- I'm undecided.

772
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:14,672
&nbsp

773
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:16,506
Are you leaning towards anything?

774
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:16,507
&nbsp

775
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:18,508
Not really.

776
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:18,509
&nbsp

777
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,211
Uh, Coast U's pretty far, right?

778
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:21,212
&nbsp

779
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,512
Do you ever miss Central City?

780
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:22,513
&nbsp

781
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:24,147
Actually, I like it better there.

782
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:24,148
&nbsp

783
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,349
Well, there is one thing
I miss about Central City.

784
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:26,350
&nbsp

785
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,750
What's that?

786
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,751
&nbsp

787
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,419
You're gonna regret that you asked.

788
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:29,420
&nbsp

789
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,788
Kid Flash.

790
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:31,789
&nbsp

791
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,289
She's a little... little obsessed.

792
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:33,290
&nbsp

793
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,459
Kid Flash is the one thing
you miss about Central City?

794
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:36,460
&nbsp

795
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,760
Whoa, Barry, slow down.

796
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:37,761
&nbsp

797
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:39,462
You don't have to be
so skeptical about it.

798
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:39,463
&nbsp

799
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:40,930
Kid Flash is cool.

800
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:40,931
&nbsp

801
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:43,266
What do you like best
about him, specifically?

802
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:43,267
&nbsp

803
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,467
Well, he's fearless.

804
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:44,468
&nbsp

805
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:46,269
- And he's brave.
- Yeah.

806
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:46,270
&nbsp

807
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,405
He's a hero, and he's probably
pretty cute under that mask.

808
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:49,406
&nbsp

809
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,741
Yeah, I think so, too.

810
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:51,742
&nbsp

811
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:53,676
Come on, Joanie, honey, Kid Flash?

812
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:53,677
&nbsp

813
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,545
He's a showboat...
he's snapping selfies,

814
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:55,546
&nbsp

815
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,928
he's leaving graffiti
bolts on buildings.

816
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:57,929
&nbsp

817
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,520
- Okay, that's his signature move.
- That's kind of his signature.

818
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,521
&nbsp

819
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,917
Yeah, well, from what I hear,

820
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:00,918
&nbsp

821
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,901
The Flash is the one who's
actually saving people.

822
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:02,902
&nbsp

823
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,285
Sounds like Cecile's Team Flash.

824
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:04,286
&nbsp

825
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,889
Uh, Joanie,

826
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:05,890
&nbsp

827
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,724
my dad would never brag about this,

828
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:07,725
&nbsp

829
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,093
but he knows Kid Flash.

830
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:10,094
&nbsp

831
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:11,928
You do?

832
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:11,929
&nbsp

833
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,329
Is my mom right?

834
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:13,330
&nbsp

835
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,531
Who's the real hero...

836
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:14,532
&nbsp

837
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,733
Flash or Kid Flash?

838
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:16,734
&nbsp

839
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:20,103
Mmm... they both are.

840
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:20,104
&nbsp

841
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:23,373
Uh, they both do great
things for Central City.

842
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:23,374
&nbsp

843
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:25,008
Okay, but if you had to choose?

844
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:25,009
&nbsp

845
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,709
I-I don't...

846
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:26,710
&nbsp

847
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,912
I don't think I could choose.

848
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:28,913
&nbsp

849
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,447
Yeah, but if you, like, had to.

850
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:31,448
&nbsp

851
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,717
Um, would you go get me
some cream, Wally, please?

852
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:34,718
&nbsp

853
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:37,854
Yes.

854
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:37,855
&nbsp

855
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:40,189
Ah, this is work. I'll
be right back, sorry.

856
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:40,190
&nbsp

857
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,816
- Hey, what's up?
- Barry, we got some DNA

858
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:42,817
&nbsp

859
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:43,756
off Mendez's corpse.

860
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:43,757
&nbsp

861
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,699
We were about to match
it with CCPD records.

862
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:45,700
&nbsp

863
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,325
The meta's name is Clive Yorkin.

864
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:47,326
&nbsp

865
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:49,094
We're sending you his info now.

866
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:52,190
&nbsp

867
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,691
Detective Joe West!

868
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:59,497
&nbsp

869
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:00,964
Long time, no see.

870
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:09,482
&nbsp

871
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:10,983
Do I know you?

872
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:10,984
&nbsp

873
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,451
You don't remember me?

874
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:12,452
&nbsp

875
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:15,988
You and your cronies had a
very fun time ruining my life.

876
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:15,989
&nbsp

877
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,190
Not gonna let you do
that this time around.

878
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,191
&nbsp

879
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,859
I think you have the wrong guy.

880
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:19,860
&nbsp

881
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,227
No, no.

882
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:21,228
&nbsp

883
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,028
You're the Joe West I remember.

884
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:23,029
&nbsp

885
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,797
Look a lot more full
of life now, though.

886
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:24,798
&nbsp

887
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,633
But don't worry...

888
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:27,634
&nbsp

889
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:28,968
I can change that.

890
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,504
&nbsp

891
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,938
- Everybody get back.
- Joanie, go.

892
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:32,939
&nbsp

893
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,341
Everybody get out of
here. Everybody go! Go!

894
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:35,342
&nbsp

895
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:38,744
Yes, everybody run.

896
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:38,745
&nbsp

897
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,946
I only want him.

898
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:40,947
&nbsp

899
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,115
You can't hide up there, Detective.

900
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:43,116
&nbsp

901
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,818
No one can hide from me anymore.

902
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:45,819
&nbsp

903
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,988
- Joe...
- One more step, and I'll shoot.

904
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:48,989
&nbsp

905
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,190
Didn't work then.

906
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,191
&nbsp

907
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,324
Won't work now, either.

908
00:16:53,334 --> 00:17:01,434
&nbsp

909
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:02,935
Told ya.

910
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:02,936
&nbsp

911
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:05,604
Stop!

912
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:05,605
&nbsp

913
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:06,939
Ah, ah, ah.

914
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,940
&nbsp

915
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,909
Can't touch me, speedster.

916
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:26,325
&nbsp

917
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,661
I knew it. Kid Flash is the hero.

918
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:28,662
&nbsp

919
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,997
Well, thank God for Kid Flash, huh?

920
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:31,998
&nbsp

921
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,732
He's gone.

922
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:37,436
&nbsp

923
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,405
This guy's got the touch of death.

924
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:39,406
&nbsp

925
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,507
Yeah, he does, and it's not just people.

926
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:41,508
&nbsp

927
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,676
Anything he touched turned to ash.

928
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:43,677
&nbsp

929
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,946
Joe, I... I really think
you should just stay here

930
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:46,947
&nbsp

931
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,414
until we find Yorkin.

932
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:48,415
&nbsp

933
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,983
No, I'm gonna go check
on Cecile and Joanie.

934
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:50,984
&nbsp

935
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:52,451
They were pretty shook up.

936
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:52,452
&nbsp

937
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:53,853
Dad, are you crazy?

938
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:53,854
&nbsp

939
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,222
This guy wants to kill you.

940
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:56,223
&nbsp

941
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,057
If it wasn't for Wally
and Barry, he could've.

942
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:58,058
&nbsp

943
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,758
He could've killed any one of us.

944
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:01,461
&nbsp

945
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:05,229
Come on, we have been through
much worse metas than Yorkin.

946
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,900
&nbsp

947
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,568
What?

948
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:10,937
&nbsp

949
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,938
Iris, I'm fine. We're all fine.

950
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:12,939
&nbsp

951
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:15,674
We're not losing anybody today.

952
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:15,675
&nbsp

953
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,643
Maybe not today, but soon.

954
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:17,644
&nbsp

955
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,612
Soon?

956
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:19,613
&nbsp

957
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:21,347
W-what are you saying?

958
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:21,348
&nbsp

959
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,548
Iris...

960
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:22,549
&nbsp

961
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,149
Wally, he needs to know.

962
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:24,150
&nbsp

963
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,718
Needs to know what?

964
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,855
&nbsp

965
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:31,824
When Barry threw the Philosopher's Stone

966
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:31,825
&nbsp

967
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,859
into the Speed Force,

968
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:33,860
&nbsp

969
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,896
there was an explosion,

970
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:36,897
&nbsp

971
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:41,000
and he was propelled to the future.

972
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,001
&nbsp

973
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,735
The future?

974
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:42,736
&nbsp

975
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,004
It was a few months from now.

976
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:45,005
&nbsp

977
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:47,606
What he saw was himself

978
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:47,607
&nbsp

979
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:50,876
standing before Savitar...

980
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:50,877
&nbsp

981
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:54,079
and me.

982
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:54,080
&nbsp

983
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,515
Right before Savitar killed me.

984
00:18:56,525 --> 00:19:07,126
&nbsp

985
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:10,696
So you're saying that in a few months...

986
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:10,697
&nbsp

987
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,097
you die?

988
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,000
&nbsp

989
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,583
Unless we can change the future, Dad.

990
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:15,584
&nbsp

991
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:17,102
Which we're gonna do, Joe, okay?

992
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:17,103
&nbsp

993
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,138
I'm not... we're not
gonna let this happen.

994
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:19,139
&nbsp

995
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,873
How long have you known about this?

996
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,877
&nbsp

997
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:24,910
How long?

998
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:24,911
&nbsp

999
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,112
A couple weeks now, Joe.

1000
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:27,113
&nbsp

1001
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,547
And you're just telling me now?

1002
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:28,548
&nbsp

1003
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:29,982
That's my daughter!

1004
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:29,983
&nbsp

1005
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:31,606
Dad, I didn't want them to say anything

1006
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:31,607
&nbsp

1007
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,052
because I knew how you would react.

1008
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:33,053
&nbsp

1009
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:36,822
This is not something you
keep from your father, Iris!

1010
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:36,823
&nbsp

1011
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,190
You should've known that.

1012
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,191
&nbsp

1013
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,125
- And you should've too.
- I know, Joe.

1014
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:40,126
&nbsp

1015
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:42,327
Look, I can understand why
they didn't want to tell me

1016
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:42,328
&nbsp

1017
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:44,191
because they didn't grow
up under the same roof

1018
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:44,192
&nbsp

1019
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:45,698
that you did.

1020
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:45,699
&nbsp

1021
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:49,535
They don't know... they don't
know what my baby girl means to me,

1022
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:49,536
&nbsp

1023
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,003
Barry, but you do.

1024
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:51,004
&nbsp

1025
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:53,939
I know.

1026
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:53,940
&nbsp

1027
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,408
Joe...

1028
00:19:56,418 --> 00:20:00,547
&nbsp

1029
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:02,848
I'll talk to him.

1030
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:02,849
&nbsp

1031
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,483
I'm... I'm gonna go to CCPD,

1032
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:04,484
&nbsp

1033
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,585
see if I can find anything
that might lead us to Yorkin.

1034
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:16,795
&nbsp

1035
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:18,797
Well, that went swimmingly.

1036
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:18,798
&nbsp

1037
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,966
Joe's right. We should've
told him before now.

1038
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:20,967
&nbsp

1039
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:24,636
What you should have told him
is that I'm the one responsible,

1040
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:24,637
&nbsp

1041
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,740
that the meta trying to kill
him is one that I created.

1042
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,741
&nbsp

1043
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,175
Julian, you can't change
what happened to you.

1044
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:30,176
&nbsp

1045
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:31,477
It's not your fault.

1046
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:31,478
&nbsp

1047
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,645
You keep saying that,
but it is my fault.

1048
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:33,646
&nbsp

1049
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,081
People are responsible
for their own actions.

1050
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:36,082
&nbsp

1051
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,183
To say otherwise is just...

1052
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:38,184
&nbsp

1053
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,551
it's just a way to make
yourself feel better.

1054
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,255
&nbsp

1055
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,591
Is that what you think I'm doing?

1056
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:45,592
&nbsp

1057
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:48,794
Making excuses for things
I've done in the past?

1058
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:50,363
&nbsp

1059
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,631
You know, I'm really starting to regret

1060
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:52,632
&nbsp

1061
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,600
bringing you in here.

1062
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:16,855
&nbsp

1063
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:18,657
Come on, Dad.

1064
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:18,658
&nbsp

1065
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,026
Ah, hey, Dad, it's me...

1066
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:21,027
&nbsp

1067
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:22,828
calling, again.

1068
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:22,829
&nbsp

1069
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,430
Look, I know you're upset,

1070
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:24,431
&nbsp

1071
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,633
but, um, give me a call back, okay?

1072
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:27,634
&nbsp

1073
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:29,068
I love you.

1074
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:40,280
&nbsp

1075
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,114
Honey?

1076
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:47,053
&nbsp

1077
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:49,588
Good evening, Iris West.

1078
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:49,589
&nbsp

1079
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,457
It's Iris's panic alarm.

1080
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:51,458
&nbsp

1081
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:53,681
She's at the apartment. I'll call Barry.

1082
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:53,682
&nbsp

1083
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:54,940
No, no, no. I-I got this.

1084
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,941
&nbsp

1085
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:56,662
Uh, he's at CCPD, and I'm closer.

1086
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:56,782
&nbsp

1087
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,530
Okay, go!

1088
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:58,531
&nbsp

1089
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,467
You know, initially,
I wanted your dad dead.

1090
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:01,468
&nbsp

1091
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:05,003
But then I thought, "If I
really want to make him suffer,

1092
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:05,004
&nbsp

1093
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:06,805
I should kill his daughter instead."

1094
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:06,806
&nbsp

1095
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:08,740
This is not how I'm supposed to die.

1096
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,677
&nbsp

1097
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,111
Oh, I'm pretty sure it is.

1098
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:15,415
&nbsp

1099
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:17,516
No, stop!

1100
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:22,155
&nbsp

1101
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,223
Too late, Kid Flash.

1102
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,692
&nbsp

1103
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,726
Me or her?

1104
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:35,277
&nbsp

1105
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,545
I got you, baby girl.

1106
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:36,546
&nbsp

1107
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:37,946
I'm not going anywhere.

1108
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:37,947
&nbsp

1109
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,570
Elevated heart rate. Temperature's 104.

1110
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:39,571
&nbsp

1111
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:42,184
The decay is reaching
her subcutaneous tissue.

1112
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:42,185
&nbsp

1113
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm here, all right? What happened?

1114
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:44,821
&nbsp

1115
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,854
Yorkin went after her.

1116
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:45,855
&nbsp

1117
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,522
Why didn't you call me?

1118
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:47,523
&nbsp

1119
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,857
Because I was here.

1120
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:48,858
&nbsp

1121
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,925
You call me! All right?

1122
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:49,926
&nbsp

1123
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,259
We have to give her something.

1124
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:51,260
&nbsp

1125
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,901
There has to be
something we can give her.

1126
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:52,925
&nbsp

1127
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:54,629
It's not bacteria.
Antibiotics won't work.

1128
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:54,630
&nbsp

1129
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,730
We have to do something.

1130
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:55,731
&nbsp

1131
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,731
Nothing's not an option.

1132
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:56,732
&nbsp

1133
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,033
Okay, what do you do

1134
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:58,034
&nbsp

1135
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,634
when a banana ripens too quickly?

1136
00:22:59,644 --> 00:22:59,635
&nbsp

1137
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,493
- Put it in the freezer.
- That's brilliant.

1138
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:01,494
&nbsp

1139
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:02,774
Caitlin, you can freeze her arm.

1140
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:02,775
&nbsp

1141
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:03,976
It'll stop the spread of decay

1142
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:04,000
&nbsp

1143
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,740
and give us some time to find a cure.

1144
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,741
&nbsp

1145
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,942
I trust you.

1146
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:06,943
&nbsp

1147
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,343
I can't, even if I wanted to.

1148
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:08,344
&nbsp

1149
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,112
We're not talking about a cold blast.

1150
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:10,113
&nbsp

1151
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,080
This is a specific and
continuous cold stream.

1152
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,081
&nbsp

1153
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,944
Too high a temperature
and the decay spreads,

1154
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:13,945
&nbsp

1155
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:16,451
too low and the frostbite will
destroy your nerve endings.

1156
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:16,452
&nbsp

1157
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,153
And that long using my powers,

1158
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:18,154
&nbsp

1159
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,621
I could lose control.

1160
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:19,622
&nbsp

1161
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,845
Caitlin, you are strong,
okay? Stronger than you know.

1162
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:21,846
&nbsp

1163
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,825
You are not going to lose control.

1164
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:23,826
&nbsp

1165
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:28,196
Caitlin, try, please.

1166
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:53,989
&nbsp

1167
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,091
It worked.

1168
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,092
&nbsp

1169
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,325
Oh, thank God.

1170
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:57,326
&nbsp

1171
00:23:57,336 --> 00:24:01,196
- You okay?
- So far, so good.

1172
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:01,197
&nbsp

1173
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,331
Wally, where are you going?

1174
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:03,332
&nbsp

1175
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,634
Out of the way where
I can't screw up again.

1176
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:14,544
&nbsp

1177
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,478
You okay?

1178
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:16,479
&nbsp

1179
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,479
Yeah.

1180
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:17,480
&nbsp

1181
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,814
Hey, look, what I said back there...

1182
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:19,815
&nbsp

1183
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,016
No, you were right.

1184
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:21,017
&nbsp

1185
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,217
We should've called you.

1186
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:22,218
&nbsp

1187
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:23,881
I just thought... I
thought I could do it.

1188
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:23,882
&nbsp

1189
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:25,921
I thought I was ready.
Obviously, I'm not.

1190
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:25,922
&nbsp

1191
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:27,389
It's not on you.

1192
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:27,390
&nbsp

1193
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,890
I wasn't fast enough, Barry.

1194
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:28,891
&nbsp

1195
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,625
That... that is totally on me.

1196
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:30,626
&nbsp

1197
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,494
No, not really.

1198
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:32,495
&nbsp

1199
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,095
It's not, all right?

1200
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:34,096
&nbsp

1201
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:38,900
Look, when I got these powers, I-I...

1202
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:38,901
&nbsp

1203
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,802
I was really lucky, in a weird way.

1204
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:40,803
&nbsp

1205
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,505
You know, I had a lot of people
helping me through all of this.

1206
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:43,506
&nbsp

1207
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,474
I had Wells... both of 'em...

1208
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:46,475
&nbsp

1209
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,376
and Jay and Zolomon.

1210
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:48,377
&nbsp

1211
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,478
I mean, two of them
turned out to be bad guys,

1212
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:50,479
&nbsp

1213
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,614
but even they were good teachers

1214
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:52,615
&nbsp

1215
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,850
who really taught me
how to use my powers.

1216
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:55,851
&nbsp

1217
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,420
I just don't think that
I've been that for you yet.

1218
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,421
&nbsp

1219
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,423
You're telling me everything
that I need to learn.

1220
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:01,424
&nbsp

1221
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,225
I'm just not getting it. I...

1222
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:03,226
&nbsp

1223
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:04,593
No, that's not it.

1224
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:04,594
&nbsp

1225
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,094
It's... I've been...

1226
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:06,095
&nbsp

1227
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,463
I've been letting you
coast by on your raw talent,

1228
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:08,464
&nbsp

1229
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,687
which you have a lot of, but
teaching... it's a lot more

1230
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:10,688
&nbsp

1231
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,201
than just doing something
and expecting you to follow.

1232
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:13,202
&nbsp

1233
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,036
It's about inspiring

1234
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:15,037
&nbsp

1235
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,939
and empowering you to use your gifts

1236
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:17,940
&nbsp

1237
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,675
to succeed on your own.

1238
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:20,676
&nbsp

1239
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,143
That's what I need to do.

1240
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:22,144
&nbsp

1241
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:24,279
That's what I'm gonna do from now on.

1242
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:24,280
&nbsp

1243
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,082
So the next time you're
out there and you're alone,

1244
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:27,083
&nbsp

1245
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,584
you will win.

1246
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:29,585
&nbsp

1247
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,487
Deal?

1248
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:32,488
&nbsp

1249
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,421
Deal.

1250
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,025
&nbsp

1251
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,759
H.R. and I just came up with a way

1252
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:37,760
&nbsp

1253
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,995
to track down Yorkin, and it's...

1254
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:39,996
&nbsp

1255
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,496
crazy.

1256
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:41,497
&nbsp

1257
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:45,367
Like, defies time and space crazy.

1258
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,538
&nbsp

1259
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,606
Okay, here's what we know.

1260
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:51,607
&nbsp

1261
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,442
We know Yorkin's going after
cops in Flashpoint, right?

1262
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:54,443
&nbsp

1263
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,145
What we don't know is
who he's going after.

1264
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:57,146
&nbsp

1265
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,614
But if we find out who they are,

1266
00:25:59,624 --> 00:25:59,615
&nbsp

1267
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,815
then we can be ready for him.

1268
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:00,816
&nbsp

1269
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,684
Right, so how do we do that?

1270
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:02,685
&nbsp

1271
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,686
We vibe Flashpoint.

1272
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:04,687
&nbsp

1273
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,254
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore.

1274
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:06,255
&nbsp

1275
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,789
Stop you right there, BA.

1276
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:07,790
&nbsp

1277
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,592
Flashpoint doesn't exist
anymore in this universe.

1278
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:10,593
&nbsp

1279
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,227
But in quantum mechanics,

1280
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:12,228
&nbsp

1281
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,895
the daughter universe theory tell us...

1282
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:13,896
&nbsp

1283
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,277
- Universe theory.
- For every decision you make,

1284
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:15,278
&nbsp

1285
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:16,598
a universe exists where you don't.

1286
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:16,599
&nbsp

1287
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,040
Yeah, I actually went to that class.

1288
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,041
&nbsp

1289
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,704
You better be going to all your classes.

1290
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:19,705
&nbsp

1291
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:23,571
So if there is a universe
where you stay in Flashpoint,

1292
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:23,572
&nbsp

1293
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,106
Francisco here could vibe it.

1294
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:25,107
&nbsp

1295
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,875
And you're sure you can do that?

1296
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:26,876
&nbsp

1297
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,510
No, no. Not at all.

1298
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,511
&nbsp

1299
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,912
But Gypsy did say I could do
some pretty incredible things

1300
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:30,913
&nbsp

1301
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,314
- with my powers...
- Yeah, she did.

1302
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:32,315
&nbsp

1303
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,349
Things I'm not even aware of yet, so...

1304
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:34,350
&nbsp

1305
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,750
things I haven't even imagined.

1306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:35,751
&nbsp

1307
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,185
- Well, let's get to imagining.
- All right.

1308
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:37,186
&nbsp

1309
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,586
- What do you need me to do?
- Oh!

1310
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:38,587
&nbsp

1311
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,221
All I need you to do is to stand there,

1312
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:40,222
&nbsp

1313
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,856
focus on Flashpoint, okay?

1314
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:41,857
&nbsp

1315
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:45,327
Focus on CCPD, Joe,
Mendez, that part of it,

1316
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:45,328
&nbsp

1317
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,562
and I'll take care of the rest.

1318
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:53,336
&nbsp

1319
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,703
It worked!

1320
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:54,704
&nbsp

1321
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,771
I'm here.

1322
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:56,772
&nbsp

1323
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,940
Huh, for some reason
I thought Flashpoint

1324
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,941
&nbsp

1325
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,275
would look a lot different.

1326
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:00,276
&nbsp

1327
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,911
Okay, all right, if I were Joe West,

1328
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:02,912
&nbsp

1329
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,112
where would I be?

1330
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:04,113
&nbsp

1331
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,114
He was at the same desk.

1332
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,115
&nbsp

1333
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,215
Got ya.

1334
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:07,216
&nbsp

1335
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,017
If it wasn't for this takedown,

1336
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:09,018
&nbsp

1337
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,201
we'd be having a different
conversation right now, Joe.

1338
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:11,202
&nbsp

1339
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,253
Understood, Captain.

1340
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:12,254
&nbsp

1341
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:14,189
Ooh, Joe's in trouble.

1342
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:14,190
&nbsp

1343
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,991
Ladies and gentlemen,
for today's perp walk,

1344
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:16,992
&nbsp

1345
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,462
we have a literal degenerate:

1346
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:20,463
&nbsp

1347
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:25,700
the one and only Clive Yorkin.

1348
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:25,701
&nbsp

1349
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,335
Here we go.

1350
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,139
&nbsp

1351
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,540
Captain Mendez, Detective West,

1352
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:32,541
&nbsp

1353
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,942
thanks for the assist.

1354
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:33,943
&nbsp

1355
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,844
Couldn't have bagged
this goon without you.

1356
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:35,845
&nbsp

1357
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,779
Get him to Iron Heights.

1358
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,684
&nbsp

1359
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:42,884
Stone...

1360
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,820
&nbsp

1361
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,188
- Who's Stone?
- Stone... that was the other cop.

1362
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:47,189
&nbsp

1363
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,591
And let me tell you,
she loves her perp walks.

1364
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:49,592
&nbsp

1365
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,426
Laura Stone. She's a PI.

1366
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:51,427
&nbsp

1367
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,594
Yeah, that's her.

1368
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:52,595
&nbsp

1369
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,229
It was you, Mendez, Holzman, and her.

1370
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,230
&nbsp

1371
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,164
You guys took down Yorkin in Flashpoint.

1372
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:56,165
&nbsp

1373
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,846
Well, then, that means
she's the only one

1374
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:57,847
&nbsp

1375
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,214
that Yorkin hasn't gone after yet.

1376
00:27:59,224 --> 00:27:59,215
&nbsp

1377
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,369
Classic example of
saving the best for last.

1378
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:01,370
&nbsp

1379
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,837
I'm on it. You guys stay here

1380
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:02,838
&nbsp

1381
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,541
and try to figure out
how to catch somebody

1382
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:04,542
&nbsp

1383
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,273
we can't touch.

1384
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:21,823
&nbsp

1385
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,526
Joe West. Long time, no see.

1386
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:24,527
&nbsp

1387
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,760
Hey.

1388
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:25,761
&nbsp

1389
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,729
I wish it were under
better circumstances.

1390
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:27,730
&nbsp

1391
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,799
Listen, you're being targeted by a meta.

1392
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:30,800
&nbsp

1393
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,701
Sweetheart, take a look over there.

1394
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:33,702
&nbsp

1395
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,570
I'm the only one doing
the targeting here.

1396
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:35,571
&nbsp

1397
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,105
That chick's husband is paying me

1398
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:37,106
&nbsp

1399
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,574
twice my going rate, so scram.

1400
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:39,575
&nbsp

1401
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,709
Look at this.

1402
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:41,710
&nbsp

1403
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,411
The guy that's coming after you

1404
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:43,412
&nbsp

1405
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,146
can do that with one touch.

1406
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:45,147
&nbsp

1407
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:47,449
Attention, all passengers.
The S.T.A.R. City Express

1408
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:47,450
&nbsp

1409
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,751
- is now boarding all platforms.
- How about we multitask?

1410
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:49,752
&nbsp

1411
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,752
All aboard, please.

1412
00:28:50,762 --> 00:29:03,364
&nbsp

1413
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,632
Hey, Julian.

1414
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:04,633
&nbsp

1415
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,401
You have anything?

1416
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:06,402
&nbsp

1417
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,938
Look, it's early days, but...

1418
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:09,939
&nbsp

1419
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,739
first tests show that her blood

1420
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:11,740
&nbsp

1421
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,042
is attacking the cells in her body.

1422
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,043
&nbsp

1423
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,211
Wait, that's the
opposite of how my blood

1424
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:16,212
&nbsp

1425
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,545
causes cells to regenerate.

1426
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:17,546
&nbsp

1427
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:18,746
Precisely.

1428
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:18,747
&nbsp

1429
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,282
Can we use my blood to save her?

1430
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:21,283
&nbsp

1431
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,485
Listen, I don't think that your blood

1432
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:23,486
&nbsp

1433
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,886
is the key to saving Iris.

1434
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:24,887
&nbsp

1435
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,855
But I do think it might
be exactly what we need

1436
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:26,856
&nbsp

1437
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,790
to take down Yorkin.

1438
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:28,791
&nbsp

1439
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,758
All is not lost, mate.

1440
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:41,704
&nbsp

1441
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:43,438
- The decay is spreading.
- Why?

1442
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:43,439
&nbsp

1443
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,672
I don't know.

1444
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,961
&nbsp

1445
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:48,595
Caitlin?

1446
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:57,298
&nbsp

1447
00:29:57,308 --> 00:29:59,533
- Caitlin?
- I'm losing control.

1448
00:29:59,543 --> 00:29:59,534
&nbsp

1449
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:00,917
Okay, all right, it's spreading.

1450
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:00,918
&nbsp

1451
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:02,469
We need you.

1452
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:02,470
&nbsp

1453
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,104
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

1454
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:04,105
&nbsp

1455
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:06,106
Just a little bit
longer, and she's dead.

1456
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:06,107
&nbsp

1457
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:08,508
How's that for changing the future?

1458
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:08,509
&nbsp

1459
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,844
I know who you are, Caitlin.
You do not want to do this.

1460
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:10,845
&nbsp

1461
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:12,446
This is who I am. You said it.

1462
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:12,447
&nbsp

1463
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,215
It's time for me to take
responsibility for my actions.

1464
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:15,216
&nbsp

1465
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:17,784
Time for me to own who I really am.

1466
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:17,785
&nbsp

1467
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:19,419
Who you are is Caitlin Snow.

1468
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:19,420
&nbsp

1469
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,889
I know firsthand the battle
going on inside of you.

1470
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:21,890
&nbsp

1471
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,724
I know what it feels like.

1472
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:23,725
&nbsp

1473
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:26,260
When it happened to me, I lost.

1474
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:26,261
&nbsp

1475
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,495
All right? I was weak, and I let it win.

1476
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:28,496
&nbsp

1477
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:30,797
And I did... I did horrible things

1478
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:30,798
&nbsp

1479
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:31,999
to a lot of good people.

1480
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:32,000
&nbsp

1481
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,034
And you don't have to do that.

1482
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:34,035
&nbsp

1483
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,303
You're not gonna do that.

1484
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:36,304
&nbsp

1485
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:38,005
You're stronger than I am, Caitlin.

1486
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:38,006
&nbsp

1487
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:39,706
You're far stronger than I am.

1488
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:39,707
&nbsp

1489
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:43,377
You're one of the strongest
people I've ever known.

1490
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:43,378
&nbsp

1491
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:44,745
You can win this fight.

1492
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:51,686
&nbsp

1493
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,287
Iris needs your help now.

1494
00:30:53,297 --> 00:30:57,558
&nbsp

1495
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:58,592
It's all right.

1496
00:30:58,602 --> 00:30:58,593
&nbsp

1497
00:30:58,603 --> 00:30:59,660
It's gonna be all right.

1498
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:14,609
&nbsp

1499
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,044
And how do you know this
guy's coming after me, Joe?

1500
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:17,045
&nbsp

1501
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:19,513
We have pretty reliable Intel.

1502
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:19,514
&nbsp

1503
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,916
Look, Laura, this is not
someone you should be ignoring.

1504
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:22,917
&nbsp

1505
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,217
He's dangerous.

1506
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:24,218
&nbsp

1507
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,986
He's already killed two cops.

1508
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:25,987
&nbsp

1509
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:27,754
He tried to kill me and my daughter.

1510
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:54,515
&nbsp

1511
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:57,050
Well, I've certainly pissed
off a lot of people in my day.

1512
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,051
&nbsp

1513
00:31:57,061 --> 00:32:00,754
But the only thing I fear now is
forgetting to clear my browser.

1514
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:00,755
&nbsp

1515
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:04,391
Consider me warned.

1516
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:13,468
&nbsp

1517
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:14,968
Oh, my God.

1518
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:20,908
&nbsp

1519
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,009
What is that?

1520
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:22,010
&nbsp

1521
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,044
It's Joe's panic alarm.

1522
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:24,045
&nbsp

1523
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,345
He must be on that train.

1524
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:25,346
&nbsp

1525
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:27,247
There's no way that train can stop...

1526
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:33,521
&nbsp

1527
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:34,722
It's not gonna stop in time.

1528
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:34,723
&nbsp

1529
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,226
We have to get everyone out of there.

1530
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:36,227
&nbsp

1531
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,557
We don't have enough time.

1532
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:37,558
&nbsp

1533
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:39,126
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

1534
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:39,127
&nbsp

1535
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,495
- Everybody brace yourselves!
- What's happening?

1536
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:41,496
&nbsp

1537
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:42,657
We're gonna move the train.

1538
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:42,658
&nbsp

1539
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:43,761
How are we gonna do that?

1540
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:43,762
&nbsp

1541
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,332
I'll vibrate it.

1542
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:45,333
&nbsp

1543
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:47,253
I'll vibrate it fast enough
that it can phase through this.

1544
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:47,254
&nbsp

1545
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,574
- You can do that?
- I don't know.

1546
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:48,598
&nbsp

1547
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:49,669
I've never tried before.

1548
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,840
&nbsp

1549
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,808
Everybody hold on!

1550
00:32:54,818 --> 00:32:54,809
&nbsp

1551
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,109
Is that even possible?

1552
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:56,110
&nbsp

1553
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,611
We're about to find out.

1554
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:07,889
&nbsp

1555
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:09,956
Holy Kardashians.

1556
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:42,924
&nbsp

1557
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,491
- Yeah!
- All right!

1558
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:44,492
&nbsp

1559
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,626
Barry. Barry!

1560
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:46,627
&nbsp

1561
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:47,994
We're good, man.

1562
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:47,995
&nbsp

1563
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,963
Took a lot out of me, but it worked.

1564
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:49,964
&nbsp

1565
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:52,599
Yeah, maybe, but we got another problem.

1566
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:52,600
&nbsp

1567
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,501
Yorkin's back.

1568
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:56,104
&nbsp

1569
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:59,072
You know what they say, Kid Flash.

1570
00:33:59,082 --> 00:33:59,073
&nbsp

1571
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:02,776
If at first you don't
succeed, try, try again.

1572
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:02,777
&nbsp

1573
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,244
You have to stop him.

1574
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:04,245
&nbsp

1575
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,813
I don't have it in me right now.

1576
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:06,814
&nbsp

1577
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,415
I need you to get your blood into him.

1578
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:08,416
&nbsp

1579
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:10,484
It'll counteract his cells
and negate his powers.

1580
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:10,485
&nbsp

1581
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,828
How am I supposed to do that
when I can't even touch him?

1582
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:12,829
&nbsp

1583
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,154
You're gonna phase it into him.

1584
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:14,155
&nbsp

1585
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,022
You know I've never done that before.

1586
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:16,023
&nbsp

1587
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,144
And you just watched me do
something I'd never done,

1588
00:34:18,154 --> 00:34:18,145
&nbsp

1589
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,713
but I did it because I had to.

1590
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:19,714
&nbsp

1591
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,760
All right?

1592
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:29,903
&nbsp

1593
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:31,505
I know you can do it, okay?

1594
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:31,506
&nbsp

1595
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:32,839
I need you to believe it, too.

1596
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:36,110
&nbsp

1597
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,444
Now run, Wally.

1598
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:37,445
&nbsp

1599
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:39,212
Run.

1600
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:51,091
&nbsp

1601
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:52,159
It worked!

1602
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:52,160
&nbsp

1603
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,395
- I did it!
- You sure did.

1604
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:55,396
&nbsp

1605
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:56,696
Good-bye, Kid Flash.

1606
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:59,734
&nbsp

1607
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:03,370
Oh, wha... look at that.

1608
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,371
&nbsp

1609
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,372
Your powers are neutralized, Yorkin.

1610
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:05,373
&nbsp

1611
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,040
What did you do?

1612
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:07,041
&nbsp

1613
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:08,073
I won.

1614
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:23,591
&nbsp

1615
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,325
Dad?

1616
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:25,326
&nbsp

1617
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:27,794
The last time I was this
happy looking in your eyes,

1618
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:27,795
&nbsp

1619
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:29,129
you'd just been born.

1620
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:30,998
&nbsp

1621
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,432
Hey.

1622
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:32,433
&nbsp

1623
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,501
It's okay. You're okay.

1624
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:34,502
&nbsp

1625
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:36,937
Yorkin's done.

1626
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:36,938
&nbsp

1627
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,038
What happened?

1628
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:38,039
&nbsp

1629
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:39,606
I'll tell you what happened.

1630
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:39,607
&nbsp

1631
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,842
Wallace was a total badass.
That's what happened.

1632
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:41,843
&nbsp

1633
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,043
Translate.

1634
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:43,044
&nbsp

1635
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:44,547
Yeah, he phased his speedster blood

1636
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:44,548
&nbsp

1637
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:46,880
into Yorkin and neutralized his powers.

1638
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:46,881
&nbsp

1639
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:49,082
That's the science behind it.

1640
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:49,083
&nbsp

1641
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:51,685
I had a great teacher.

1642
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:51,686
&nbsp

1643
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,753
And me?

1644
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:53,754
&nbsp

1645
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:55,288
Once Yorkin's blood was stabilized,

1646
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:55,289
&nbsp

1647
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:57,657
we actually managed to get
an antidote that cured you.

1648
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:57,658
&nbsp

1649
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:59,601
You'll have to wear the
bandage for a few days,

1650
00:35:59,611 --> 00:35:59,602
&nbsp

1651
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:02,529
but other than that,
you're absolutely recovered.

1652
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:02,530
&nbsp

1653
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,864
Thank you.

1654
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:03,865
&nbsp

1655
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,532
I know what you risked for me.

1656
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:05,533
&nbsp

1657
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:07,133
I had some help.

1658
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:07,134
&nbsp

1659
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:08,902
Couldn't have done it alone.

1660
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:08,903
&nbsp

1661
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,338
It was all of us working together.

1662
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:11,339
&nbsp

1663
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,874
Yup, really proud of everybody.

1664
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:13,875
&nbsp

1665
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,809
Great job. Big ideas today.

1666
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:15,810
&nbsp

1667
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,280
My point is, if we're gonna
save Iris from Savitar,

1668
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:20,281
&nbsp

1669
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,681
we're gonna have to up our game.

1670
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:21,682
&nbsp

1671
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:22,983
No more lies...

1672
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:22,984
&nbsp

1673
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,517
even well-intentioned ones.

1674
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:24,518
&nbsp

1675
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:27,854
We have to be completely
real with each other.

1676
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:27,855
&nbsp

1677
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:30,257
- I agree.
- I agree with Joe, too.

1678
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:30,258
&nbsp

1679
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,926
From here on out, complete honesty.

1680
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:34,595
&nbsp

1681
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:36,196
Honesty.

1682
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:36,197
&nbsp

1683
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,231
All right. Get some rest, all right?

1684
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:38,232
&nbsp

1685
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,833
I'll check on you in a bit.

1686
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:42,103
&nbsp

1687
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,838
- Bar?
- Yeah?

1688
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:44,839
&nbsp

1689
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:47,941
Savitar's prophecy of someone dying...

1690
00:36:47,951 --> 00:36:47,942
&nbsp

1691
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,810
was it Iris?

1692
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:50,811
&nbsp

1693
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:51,912
Yeah.

1694
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:51,913
&nbsp

1695
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,447
But it's not gonna happen.

1696
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:54,448
&nbsp

1697
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:58,318
Look, I'm glad she comes
first in your life now.

1698
00:36:58,328 --> 00:36:58,319
&nbsp

1699
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,662
If you're gonna date my daughter,

1700
00:36:59,672 --> 00:36:59,663
&nbsp

1701
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:01,288
that's the way it should be.

1702
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:01,289
&nbsp

1703
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,923
You're still a close second.

1704
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:05,092
&nbsp

1705
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:06,192
It's just heartwarming.

1706
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:06,193
&nbsp

1707
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,627
It's just truly heartwarming.

1708
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:07,628
&nbsp

1709
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:09,331
You're already crafting
a version of this

1710
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:09,332
&nbsp

1711
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:10,530
for your book, aren't you?

1712
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:10,531
&nbsp

1713
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,799
"Peace finally descends
upon the family West."

1714
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:12,800
&nbsp

1715
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,467
The West family, or family West?

1716
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:14,468
&nbsp

1717
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:15,969
Right, it's time I get to work.

1718
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:15,970
&nbsp

1719
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,404
At this hour?

1720
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:17,405
&nbsp

1721
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,188
Yes, there's still one
husk meta out there,

1722
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:19,189
&nbsp

1723
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,573
and I intend to find him.

1724
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:20,574
&nbsp

1725
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:23,042
Good night.

1726
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:29,849
&nbsp

1727
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:32,018
- Hey, Julian?
- Hi.

1728
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:35,022
&nbsp

1729
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,489
I don't think you're weak

1730
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:36,490
&nbsp

1731
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,992
because of what happened
to you with Savitar.

1732
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:38,993
&nbsp

1733
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:41,962
The strength that I found
to stay in control...

1734
00:37:41,972 --> 00:37:41,963
&nbsp

1735
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,030
that came from you.

1736
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,031
&nbsp

1737
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,365
So thank you.

1738
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,835
&nbsp

1739
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,202
Well, I wasn't gonna let Iris

1740
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:49,203
&nbsp

1741
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:51,338
die at the hands of Killer Frost, was I?

1742
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:51,339
&nbsp

1743
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:53,907
I knew there was a good guy
inside of you somewhere...

1744
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:53,908
&nbsp

1745
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:58,345
one that the rest of us would
like to see a little more often.

1746
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:00,147
&nbsp

1747
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,881
Good night.

1748
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:05,286
&nbsp

1749
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:06,987
Do you want to get a drink?

1750
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:06,988
&nbsp

1751
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:09,589
Uh... what? As in now?

1752
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:09,590
&nbsp

1753
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,857
Yeah.

1754
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:10,858
&nbsp

1755
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,792
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd love that.

1756
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:21,001
&nbsp

1757
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:22,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

1758
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:22,603
&nbsp

1759
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:24,337
What brings you to my
neck of the bullpen?

1760
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:24,338
&nbsp

1761
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:27,707
Oh, Joanie's headed back for midterms.

1762
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:27,708
&nbsp

1763
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,709
We just thought we'd
come and say good-bye.

1764
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:29,710
&nbsp

1765
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,711
Aw.

1766
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:31,712
&nbsp

1767
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:34,214
I was hoping a redo on the coffee,

1768
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:34,215
&nbsp

1769
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,383
seeing as how the last
one went off the rails.

1770
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:36,384
&nbsp

1771
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,084
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

1772
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:38,085
&nbsp

1773
00:38:38,095 --> 00:38:40,353
I got to see Kid Flash
in action, right up close.

1774
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:40,354
&nbsp

1775
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:42,889
Well, we got a lot of
stories about Kid Flash

1776
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:42,890
&nbsp

1777
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,313
I can guarantee you've never heard.

1778
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:44,314
&nbsp

1779
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,026
Maybe we can tell you them over dinner

1780
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:46,027
&nbsp

1781
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,327
next time you come to town.

1782
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:47,328
&nbsp

1783
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:50,530
I have a long weekend next month.

1784
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:50,531
&nbsp

1785
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,565
You sure you're ready
to commit to something

1786
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:52,566
&nbsp

1787
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:54,100
that far in the future?

1788
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,101
&nbsp

1789
00:38:54,111 --> 00:38:57,270
I am absolutely sure.

1790
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,271
&nbsp

1791
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,839
Hmm?

1792
00:38:59,849 --> 00:38:59,840
&nbsp

1793
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,341
Good.

1794
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:01,342
&nbsp

1795
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:02,575
We should go.

1796
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:02,576
&nbsp

1797
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,844
- Good luck at school.
- Thank you. See ya.

1798
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:04,845
&nbsp

1799
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:06,780
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

1800
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,918
&nbsp

1801
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,454
Okay, good as new.

1802
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:14,455
&nbsp

1803
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,718
Actually, it's better than
new with the three extra locks

1804
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:16,719
&nbsp

1805
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,024
that I added.

1806
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:18,025
&nbsp

1807
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,893
Which you didn't have to do.

1808
00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:19,894
&nbsp

1809
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,761
Well, Cisco did offer to build us

1810
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:21,762
&nbsp

1811
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:23,029
a custom security door,

1812
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,030
&nbsp

1813
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,564
but we've both seen how well

1814
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:24,565
&nbsp

1815
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:26,366
those things keep people
out of S.T.A.R. Labs.

1816
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:26,367
&nbsp

1817
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:28,234
- So...
- I like deadbolts.

1818
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:28,235
&nbsp

1819
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:30,770
- Deadbolts work.
- Yeah.

1820
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:30,771
&nbsp

1821
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:33,306
It's just with... what happened here,

1822
00:39:33,316 --> 00:39:33,307
&nbsp

1823
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,875
I want to make sure you feel safe.

1824
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:35,876
&nbsp

1825
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,644
I do.

1826
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:37,645
&nbsp

1827
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:40,547
About everything?

1828
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:40,548
&nbsp

1829
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:42,148
You know, you've been saying for weeks

1830
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:42,149
&nbsp

1831
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,017
that you were gonna
save me from Savitar.

1832
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:44,018
&nbsp

1833
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,652
- Mm-hmm.
- And while I trust you

1834
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:45,653
&nbsp

1835
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:50,523
with my life, it was
hard not to feel scared.

1836
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,793
&nbsp

1837
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:56,529
You know, sometimes it feels
like The Flash is this guy

1838
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:56,530
&nbsp

1839
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,799
my boyfriend becomes when he
runs off to save other people.

1840
00:39:59,809 --> 00:39:59,800
&nbsp

1841
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,269
Like I'm the only one
who doesn't get The Flash.

1842
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:03,270
&nbsp

1843
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,073
He felt separate from you.

1844
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:07,074
&nbsp

1845
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:08,475
But yesterday when you saved me,

1846
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:08,476
&nbsp

1847
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:11,945
I remembered that I have
no reason to be scared.

1848
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:11,946
&nbsp

1849
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,279
Mm-mm.

1850
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:13,280
&nbsp

1851
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,048
The man I love is a superhero.

1852
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:17,418
&nbsp

1853
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,587
I love and trust you, Barry Allen...

1854
00:40:20,597 --> 00:40:20,588
&nbsp

1855
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:21,788
The Flash.

1856
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:24,125
&nbsp

1857
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:27,026
I love all of you, and I always will.

1858
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:29,763
&nbsp

1859
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:32,065
I love you.

1860
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:32,066
&nbsp

1861
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,067
That was so nice.

1862
00:40:34,077 --> 00:41:03,302
&nbsp

1863
00:41:03,312 --> 00:41:04,302
Jesse!

1864
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:04,303
&nbsp

1865
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:05,403
No, no, no, no.

1866
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:05,404
&nbsp

1867
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:06,404
What's wrong?

1868
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:06,405
&nbsp

1869
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:07,505
Grodd.

1870
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:07,506
&nbsp

1871
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:09,640
He's got my dad.

1872
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:09,641
&nbsp

1873
00:41:09,651 --> 00:41:12,616
And he has him in Gorilla City.

1874
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:14,495
