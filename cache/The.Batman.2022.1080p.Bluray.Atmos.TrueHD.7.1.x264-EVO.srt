00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:30,019
Hey!

3
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,715
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:06,722
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

5
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:08,349
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

6
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,768
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

7
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,688
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

8
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,273
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

9
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,819
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

10
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:23,948
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

11
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,783
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

12
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,619
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

13
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,162
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

14
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:34,417
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,294
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

16
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:38,754
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

17
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,755
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

18
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,091
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

19
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:43,217
<i>Under my administration,</i>

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,096
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

21
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:50,683
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

22
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,060
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

23
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,103
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

24
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,479
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

25
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:56,522
<i>But listen...</i>

26
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,023
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

27
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,567
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

28
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:05,072
Hey.

29
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,243
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

30
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,125
Why is she still tied?

31
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:23,716
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

32
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:33,225
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

33
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:35,186
Just call me in the morning, okay?

34
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,816
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

35
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,444
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

36
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:46,197
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

37
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,987
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

38
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,586
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

39
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,424
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

40
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:35,389
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

41
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:38,392
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

42
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,395
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

43
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:44,148
<i>Watching.</i>

44
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:50,154
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

45
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:58,329
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

46
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,803
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

47
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,597
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

48
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,182
<i>It's a big city.</i>

49
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,522
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

50
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:37,034
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

51
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,958
Look at this guy, man.

52
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:50,131
Boom!

53
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:51,465
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,054
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

55
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,556
Yo, let's see your hits.

56
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,766
That's you.

57
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:25,166
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

58
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:29,128
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

59
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,006
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

60
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,134
<i>It's a warning.</i>

61
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:37,928
<i>To them.</i>

62
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:48,856
<i>Fear...</i>

63
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:53,986
<i>is a tool.</i>

64
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:08,250
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

65
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,640
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

66
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:26,602
Come on!

67
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:36,946
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,299
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

69
00:08:58,676 --> 00:08:59,760
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

70
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:01,303
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

71
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:03,514
Help!

72
00:09:03,597 --> 00:09:04,807
Somebody help me!

73
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,601
Help, help!

74
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,693
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:21,449
Come on.

76
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,200
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,787
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:28,873
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:30,666
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,293
Come on, man.

81
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:33,627
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:10,581
You see this guy?

83
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,423
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,733
I'm vengeance.

85
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:40,778
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,596
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,723
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,138
Police action.

90
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,391
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:37,228
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,897
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:43,359
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,749
Goddamn freak.

95
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,725
What do we know?

96
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:27,945
Detective?

97
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,655
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:35,036
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

99
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,956
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

100
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,753
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,212
No.

102
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,760
Excuse me.

103
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,930
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,437
Thumb was severed.

105
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:05,274
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,568
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,279
Ecchymosis...

108
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,074
around the wound.

109
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,007
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:32,301
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

111
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:36,013
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:41,143
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

113
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,318
You said there was a card.

114
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:50,986
Yeah.

115
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:04,166
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,169
Haven't a clue?

117
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,630
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:13,217
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:16,637
There's a cipher too.

120
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:25,271
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:29,024
What's going on here?

122
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,529
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,281
This is a crime scene.

124
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:37,700
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,785
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,621
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

127
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,540
But this is way over the line.

128
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,295
Wait.

129
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:51,088
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

130
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,298
How do you know?

131
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:55,384
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

132
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:57,219
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

133
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,929
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

134
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,556
He lies still.

135
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:03,059
Excuse me?

136
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,686
The riddle.

137
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,690
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

138
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,326
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,374
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

140
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,210
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,629
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,382
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,137
I want him outta here.

144
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:41,847
Now!

145
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,647
Come on.

146
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:03,661
Yeah.

147
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,330
The kid found him.

148
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:14,338
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

149
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:32,940
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,241
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,535
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,288
And I lost a friend.

153
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,916
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

154
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,086
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

155
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,714
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:00,885
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

157
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:05,056
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

158
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:06,390
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:09,310
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

160
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:10,978
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,779
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,947
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,033
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,787
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:31,749
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,128
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:38,172
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,762
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:29,640
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,439
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,401
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:44,363
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,504
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

174
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:04,467
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

175
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,386
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

176
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,221
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,973
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,558
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:15,519
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

180
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,856
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

181
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,775
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,402
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

183
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:27,740
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

184
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,575
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

185
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:31,619
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:34,538
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

187
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:38,459
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

188
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:40,336
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,089
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

190
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:46,425
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

191
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:50,471
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

192
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:54,725
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

193
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,227
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,355
Yeah.

195
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:07,696
Oh, I see.

196
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,449
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,201
Dear God.

198
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,003
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,305
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,269
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:41,355
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,440
Apparently.

203
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:44,608
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:47,987
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,488
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:50,614
I don't know yet.

207
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,241
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:55,536
Have a shower.

209
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:58,664
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

210
00:21:58,748 --> 00:21:59,665
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,751
Here? Why?

212
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,918
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:04,086
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,838
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:09,008
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

216
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,676
I don't care about that.

217
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:12,470
Any of that.

218
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:14,055
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

219
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:19,560
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,812
If I can't change things here,

221
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:24,273
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:26,984
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,194
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:29,904
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,740
You're not my father.

226
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,952
I'm well aware.

227
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:13,531
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,766
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,066
What are you doing?

230
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:53,112
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

231
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:57,408
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,079
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,417
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,919
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:13,049
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

236
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:14,508
see where it leads.

237
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:17,428
That's interesting.

238
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:19,805
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:21,182
Yes, Dory?

240
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:22,975
The accountants are here.

241
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,894
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,024
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:31,692
What do you mean?

244
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,611
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,073
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

246
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:39,200
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

247
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:40,451
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,661
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

249
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:44,580
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:48,125
Oh.

251
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,599
Damn.

252
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:06,018
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,313
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:11,065
Where to even start?

255
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,984
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

256
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,069
You don't trust me?

257
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,696
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,658
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

259
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,786
There.

260
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,185
What are we looking for?

261
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:50,354
A USB port.

262
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:51,564
USB?

263
00:25:58,654 --> 00:25:59,822
What?

264
00:26:05,202 --> 00:26:07,455
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:09,874
Jesus.

266
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,004
It's encrypted.

267
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:19,717
Try this.

268
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:29,101
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,571
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:43,240
So much for family values.

271
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:44,575
Who is she?

272
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:46,243
No idea.

273
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:49,997
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

274
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:51,832
I know who he is.

275
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,292
What was that?

276
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,880
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:26:58,631 --> 00:27:00,966
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,594
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:05,763
Jesus.

280
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:08,224
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

281
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,767
"He lies still."

282
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,018
About her?

283
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,854
Maybe.

284
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:15,898
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:19,402
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

286
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:21,612
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:25,032
Yeah.

288
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:39,338
Know who I am?

289
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:42,925
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:44,802
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,763
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

292
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:54,145
What's the problem?

293
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:55,646
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,898
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,608
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,986
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,946
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

298
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:06,407
Mine or yours?

299
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:15,708
Get him!

300
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:16,959
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:18,252
He's over there!

302
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:19,670
What is your problem?

303
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:04,507
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

304
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,771
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,648
You looking for me?

307
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,275
I see you met the twins.

308
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:27,530
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

309
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:29,907
I guess we both are.

310
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,369
How you doing?

311
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,413
I'm Oz.

312
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,211
Who is she?

313
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:47,174
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:50,094
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

315
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:51,554
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:05,985
It's okay, baby.

317
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:10,322
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

318
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:37,266
Thank you, honey.

319
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,608
Here you go, champ.

320
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:49,236
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

321
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,113
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

322
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:52,990
Is that the mayor?

323
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:54,867
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:57,370
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:01,624
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

326
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:04,668
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,922
Look...

328
00:31:09,173 --> 00:31:11,967
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:17,098
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

330
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,024
Tell you one thing.

331
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:32,780
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,783
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

333
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:40,871
What? Too soon?

334
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:53,092
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

335
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:03,394
Taxi!

336
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:06,897
Taxi!

337
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,959
Hey, it's me.

338
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:29,587
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

340
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:36,135
On the news?

341
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:40,097
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

342
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,891
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:46,687
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

344
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:50,024
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

345
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:52,109
Uh...

346
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,654
God damn it.

347
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,635
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

348
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:19,595
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:22,515
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

350
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:58,884
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:14,729
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,471
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,643
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,230
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:01,067
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

356
00:37:39,146 --> 00:37:41,774
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

357
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:44,318
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

358
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:45,778
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

359
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:47,613
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

360
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:49,073
What does she know?

361
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,283
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

362
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:52,952
She did seem upset.

363
00:37:54,745 --> 00:37:56,247
Back at your place.

364
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,792
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:27,069
Anni!

366
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:29,447
Baby!

367
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:32,116
Anni!

368
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,413
Anni!

369
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:41,250
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,544
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:45,504
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:50,968
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

373
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,345
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

374
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:56,265
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

375
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,894
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:01,353
<i>His victim, longtime head

00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:08,360
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

380
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:11,781
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

381
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:14,742
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

382
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,541
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,585
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,713
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:32,593
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

386
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:34,720
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,059
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,358
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:52,905
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:54,824
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:59,912

392
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,707
<i>be unmasked.</i>

393
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,043
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:11,924
<i>Commissioner Savage

<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,429
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:18,806
At the club.

398
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:21,892
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,103
44 Below.

400
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,022
What is that?

401
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:31,819
The club within the club.

402
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:34,822
The real club.

403
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:38,868
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:40,745
Is that where you work?

405
00:40:42,663 --> 00:40:43,497
Selina?

406
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,255
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:40:54,717 --> 00:40:56,260
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:57,553
Who?

409
00:40:58,137 --> 00:41:00,556
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

410
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:04,810
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,606
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:10,733
For your friend.

413
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:22,661
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:26,082
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:31,545
You're not safe here.

416
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:33,839
I can take care of myself.

417
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:36,717
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

418
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:38,344
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:41,680
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

420
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,600
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

421
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:05,788
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:08,958
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

423
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,168
when no one else was around.

424
00:42:12,294 --> 00:42:13,713
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:15,756
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:19,093
Rat poison.

427
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:21,470
Yeah.

428
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:24,098
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,016
Look at this thing.

430
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,901
It's a maze.

431
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:41,782
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

432
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:45,619
More symbols.

433
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:49,707
It's another cipher.

434
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,543
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

435
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,796
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,008
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

437
00:43:00,593 --> 00:43:01,927
I don't get it.

438
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:04,388
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

439
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:07,308
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,434
You kidding me?

441
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:11,228
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

442
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:14,565
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

443
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:16,859
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:43:18,402 --> 00:43:20,446
You make it sound like he had it coming.

445
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:24,158
He was a cop.

446
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:26,786
Crossed a line.

447
00:43:58,025 --> 00:43:59,693
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:03,447
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

449
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:13,666
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,420
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

451
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,213
The hell is that?

452
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:23,134
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

453
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,761
I don't know.

454
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:27,805
Lieutenant.

455
00:44:27,888 --> 00:44:29,306
They're coming back.

456
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,641
We got to get out of here.

457
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:35,938
Come on.

458
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:42,069
Ow!

459
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:44,864
I don't know about these things.

460
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:48,409
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

461
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:54,999
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

462
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:58,335
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:04,258
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:08,012
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

465
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:18,773
Look at me.

466
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,576
Looks good. Here.

467
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:15,746
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:17,707
Yeah.

469
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:27,383
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:29,135
Hospitality.

471
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:32,722
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

472
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,016
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,775
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:46,318
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:49,864
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

476
00:46:50,197 --> 00:46:52,241
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,927
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

478
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:13,137
Great.

479
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:22,688
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

480
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:24,356
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,650
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:47:32,698 --> 00:47:34,325
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:35,451
Really?

484
00:47:35,534 --> 00:47:36,494
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:47:36,577 --> 00:47:37,787
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

486
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,122
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

487
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:42,500
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:45,961
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:47,213
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:48,381
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,257
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

492
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:51,675
I need to see his face.

493
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:54,804
Jesus.

494
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:03,979
That's the DA.

495
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:05,106
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:06,857
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,150
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:48:11,278 --> 00:48:12,363
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:48:12,446 --> 00:48:13,531
Hi.

500
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:14,448
I'm Gil.

501
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:17,284
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:18,327
Yeah.

503
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:20,705
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:48:20,788 --> 00:48:22,164
Is that right?

505
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:24,792
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:48:25,793 --> 00:48:27,837
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

507
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,464
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:32,049
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:33,134
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:34,635
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,053
Do you want to come over?

512
00:48:36,137 --> 00:48:37,263
Sure.

513
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,600
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

514
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:43,102
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:45,271
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

516
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:48,232
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:49,483
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:50,526
Hi.

519
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:52,653
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

520
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:54,613
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:56,240
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:58,367
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

523
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:01,996
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,123
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

525
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:05,541
He's wasted.

526
00:49:05,624 --> 00:49:06,667
No shit.

527
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:09,336
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:11,380
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:18,262
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

530
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:19,430
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:20,806
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,142
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

533
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:24,143
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,145
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

535
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:28,189
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

536
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:32,026
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,579
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:48,000
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

539
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:51,003
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

540
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,797
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

541
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,465
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:57,843
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

543
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:00,721
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

544
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:02,723
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:50:02,807 --> 00:50:05,434
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

546
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:06,769
What do you know about that?

547
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:09,563
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:10,606
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,024
Keep him talking.

550
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:16,195
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:50:16,278 --> 00:50:17,321
She knows Annika.

552
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:18,823
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:20,825
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,079
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

555
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:26,205
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:28,833
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

557
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,167
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:32,712
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,715
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

560
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:37,299
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

561
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:38,467
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:44,265
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:45,933
Hey.

564
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:50,271
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

565
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:52,773
How you been?

566
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:56,819
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:50:58,154 --> 00:50:59,530
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:03,409
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,161
Well...

570
00:51:06,245 --> 00:51:07,913
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:24,388
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

572
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:26,057
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

573
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,933
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

574
00:51:28,017 --> 00:51:29,852
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

575
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:31,020
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:33,522
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

577
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,111
Taxi!

578
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:44,075
Hey!

579
00:51:45,785 --> 00:51:46,869
I lost you in there.

580
00:51:46,952 --> 00:51:48,037
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:50,331
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,333
That's me right there.

583
00:51:58,422 --> 00:51:59,507
Taxi!

584
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,716
I'm good.

585
00:52:02,426 --> 00:52:03,844
I hope, uh...

586
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:09,850
I'll see you around.

587
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,316
Just hold still.

588
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:39,583
What do you know about

589
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,961
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

590
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:46,757
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:49,301
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:52,096
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,683
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

594
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:57,226
Where are you getting this?

595
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:00,187
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

596
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,440
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:05,943
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

598
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,903
I worked that case.

599
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:09,947
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,948
How do you know?

601
00:55:11,323 --> 00:55:12,742
You're not corrupt.

602
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:15,327
Colson's dirty?

603
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,710
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:26,714
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

605
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:30,092
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

606
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:32,636
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,931
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:38,934
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:41,395
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,774
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:55:45,649 --> 00:55:46,817
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:48,194
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:49,695
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

614
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,280
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:55:52,323 --> 00:55:53,908
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

616
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:55,659
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

617
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,245
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,372
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:01,082
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

620
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:03,000
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

621
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:04,335
Pretty.

622
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:07,713
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:13,511
I'm not so sure.

624
00:56:14,345 --> 00:56:15,846
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:19,141
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:20,226
What?

627
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:21,227
Your attire.

628
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,437
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

629
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:25,523
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

630
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:28,275
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

631
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:30,903
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:32,446
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:37,576
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

634
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,620
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:56:40,037 --> 00:56:43,124
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:45,334
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

637
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:48,671
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:56:49,296 --> 00:56:50,715
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:52,007
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:54,593
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

641
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:55,928
Yeah.

642
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:58,514
A stool pigeon.

643
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:00,391
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:57:00,474 --> 00:57:01,434
I couldn't find them.

645
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:04,854
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:06,731
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:13,696
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

648
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,616
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

649
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:20,411
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:29,295
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,441
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

652
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:04,747
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,458
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

654
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,551
Hold it.

655
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:20,137
You good, fellas?

656
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:21,722
Good.

657
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:24,934
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:58:42,743 --> 00:58:43,744
Sir?

659
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:04,390
Hey!

660
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:06,475
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

661
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:09,270
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:59:09,729 --> 00:59:12,022
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,694
Some event, huh?

664
00:59:16,777 --> 00:59:19,739
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

665
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,283
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:23,993
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

667
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:26,078
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,372
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,458
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,585
His father saved my life.

671
00:59:33,544 --> 00:59:36,756
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:41,469
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

673
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:44,972
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
00:59:45,056 --> 00:59:50,311
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

675
00:59:51,729 --> 00:59:53,731
I remember your face.

676
00:59:55,733 --> 00:59:57,693
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

677
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:00,196
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,115
"Hippocratic oath."

679
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:06,869
That's good.

680
01:00:07,411 --> 01:00:08,579
Excuse me.

681
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes.

682
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:28,265
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:29,934
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

684
01:00:30,017 --> 01:00:32,395
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:34,271
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
01:00:34,355 --> 01:00:35,773
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
01:00:35,856 --> 01:00:37,274
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

688
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:38,776
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:40,903
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
01:00:40,986 --> 01:00:43,239
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:44,532
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,451
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

693
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:52,289
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

694
01:00:52,373 --> 01:00:55,584
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

695
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:58,462
He got what he deserved.

696
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:01,382
Know what I mean?

697
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:04,802
Hey, don't I know you?

698
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:05,970
Bruce Wayne.

699
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:08,848
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:09,932
I'm sorry?

701
01:01:10,224 --> 01:01:12,560
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

702
01:01:12,643 --> 01:01:13,853
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,605
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

704
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:18,023
Will you walk with me?

705
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:24,530
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:25,823
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:29,618
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

708
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:32,038
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

709
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,540
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

710
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:37,084
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

711
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:38,961
Thank you.

712
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:40,838
My God.

713
01:01:42,673 --> 01:01:45,176
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

714
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:46,886
I want to continue this.

715
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:51,974
Excuse me.

716
01:01:54,018 --> 01:01:55,895
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:01:58,105 --> 01:01:59,023
Thank you.

718
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:00,858
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

719
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:04,070
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,446
What?

721
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:07,823
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

722
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:08,949
Christ, not again.

723
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:11,118
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:15,456
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:02:16,123 --> 01:02:18,417
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

726
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,418
What'd his wife say?

727
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,711
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:16,392
Get out of the car!

729
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,353
Get out of the car and show your hands!

730
01:03:20,771 --> 01:03:21,981
Get out!

731
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:33,784
Get 'em up!

732
01:03:33,868 --> 01:03:35,619
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,667
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,461
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:03:58,517 --> 01:04:00,061
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:01,771
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:38,766
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:43,187
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:47,650
What's he looking at?

740
01:05:06,419 --> 01:05:07,753
Holy shit.

741
01:05:08,796 --> 01:05:10,464
Are you kidding me?

742
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:13,300
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:05:14,135 --> 01:05:16,595
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

744
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,571
Please.

745
01:05:33,738 --> 01:05:36,490
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

746
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:39,118
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

747
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,202
I'm so sorry.

748
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,371
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:43,914
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:05:44,665 --> 01:05:46,333
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:06:23,037 --> 01:06:24,288
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:06:26,123 --> 01:06:27,208
Who are you?

753
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,751
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,755
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:06:34,215 --> 01:06:36,634
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:06:36,717 --> 01:06:41,013
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

757
01:06:41,555 --> 01:06:42,640
"Unmask"?

758
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:43,891
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:47,561
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,064
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:06:50,731 --> 01:06:53,067
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,944
How am I a part of this?

763
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:56,946
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:58,781
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

765
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:00,950
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:07:01,033 --> 01:07:02,284
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:05,371
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,748
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:11,210
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,336
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,422
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

772
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:15,464
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:18,676
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

774
01:07:18,759 --> 01:07:21,762
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:22,847
Okay.

776
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,691
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:07:35,443 --> 01:07:37,611
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,698
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:44,493
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:07:44,577 --> 01:07:48,164
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:51,167
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,587
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:59,884
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

784
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:02,219
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:08:02,303 --> 01:08:05,056
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:09,226
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

787
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,645
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

788
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:13,898
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:15,066
You want me to...

790
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,526
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:21,238
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:25,993
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

793
01:08:26,077 --> 01:08:28,496
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

794
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:29,663
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:08:29,747 --> 01:08:31,165
- "Justice."
- Huh?

796
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:32,291
The answer's "justice."

797
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,584
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

798
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:35,252
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

799
01:08:35,336 --> 01:08:39,673
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

800
01:08:39,757 --> 01:08:42,134
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

801
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,595
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:08:44,678 --> 01:08:45,888
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:48,349
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:52,561
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:08:52,645 --> 01:08:56,816
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,692
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

807
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:00,027
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:02,279
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

809
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:04,824
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,158
- How much?
- Nothing!

811
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,452
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

812
01:09:08,536 --> 01:09:10,830
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

813
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:11,747
What cases?

814
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:12,957
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,041
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,461
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

817
01:09:17,545 --> 01:09:20,172
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:24,093
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

819
01:09:24,176 --> 01:09:26,595
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:31,016
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,396
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

822
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:37,565
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

823
01:09:37,648 --> 01:09:40,192
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

824
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,069
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

825
01:09:42,153 --> 01:09:43,362
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,114
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

827
01:09:45,197 --> 01:09:47,158
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

828
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:48,784
If I go out this way, it's just me.

829
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:51,996
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

830
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:53,539
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

831
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,957
- People are watching.
- What people?

832
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,168
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

833
01:09:57,251 --> 01:09:59,420
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

834
01:09:59,503 --> 01:10:00,379
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:01,839
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

836
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,799
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,373
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:36,290
Take it easy.

839
01:10:36,374 --> 01:10:37,375
I want to see.

840
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:39,919
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,132
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:46,675
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

843
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:47,968
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

844
01:10:48,052 --> 01:10:49,220
Hey!

845
01:10:49,804 --> 01:10:52,932
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,683
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,268
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,231
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

849
01:11:00,314 --> 01:11:02,733
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:04,235
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:06,737
What'd you say?

852
01:11:06,821 --> 01:11:08,406
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:10,491
What was he afraid of?

854
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:12,326
You?

855
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:20,876
You son of a bitch.

856
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,463
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

857
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:26,257
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,341
Why are we playing games...

859
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:30,344
Get him! Come on!

860
01:11:30,428 --> 01:11:32,430
Back off! Back off!

861
01:11:32,513 --> 01:11:34,807
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

862
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,976
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

863
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:39,854
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

864
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:44,066
You too now?

865
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:46,694
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

866
01:11:46,777 --> 01:11:49,363
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

867
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:51,699
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

868
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:55,995
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:12:11,635 --> 01:12:12,928
Two minutes.

870
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:26,275
You listen to me.

871
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,862
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,491
That would put a lot of heat on you.

873
01:12:33,574 --> 01:12:35,242
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:12:37,495 --> 01:12:38,788
Take this key.

875
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:43,459
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

876
01:12:44,502 --> 01:12:46,212
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

877
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:49,507
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:55,262
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:01,394
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,397
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

881
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:07,942
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

882
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:12,613
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:18,703
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

884
01:13:18,786 --> 01:13:20,287
Somebody stop him!

885
01:13:58,492 --> 01:14:00,036
- There he is!
- Freeze!

886
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,334
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

887
01:14:48,876 --> 01:14:50,086
I did.

888
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:53,547
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

889
01:14:53,631 --> 01:14:55,674
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:56,884
I only trust you.

891
01:14:56,967 --> 01:14:59,303
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

892
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:02,765
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

893
01:15:03,516 --> 01:15:04,642
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:15:04,725 --> 01:15:07,770
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

895
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:09,814
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

896
01:15:09,897 --> 01:15:11,232
DA was a regular too.

897
01:15:11,315 --> 01:15:14,819
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

898
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:17,113
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:15:17,196 --> 01:15:18,155
The what?

900
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,698
Riddler's latest.

901
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:21,492
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:15:21,575 --> 01:15:24,078
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

903
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:27,289
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,252
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

905
01:15:31,335 --> 01:15:33,003
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

906
01:15:33,087 --> 01:15:36,298
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

907
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:39,552
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

908
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:44,014
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:15:45,182 --> 01:15:46,267
There's Penguin.

910
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:48,227
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:15:49,854 --> 01:15:51,105
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,442
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,505
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

914
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,882
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,968
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

916
01:16:21,052 --> 01:16:23,554
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

917
01:16:42,782 --> 01:16:45,326
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:46,619
This is a buy.

919
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,872
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

920
01:16:49,955 --> 01:16:51,123
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:52,083
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:55,294
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

923
01:17:19,652 --> 01:17:21,070
This just got complicated.

924
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:22,988
What do you mean?

925
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,371
Hey! What happened?

926
01:17:30,454 --> 01:17:31,789
You all right?

927
01:17:42,508 --> 01:17:44,301
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,053
Jesus.

929
01:17:46,804 --> 01:17:48,639
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,474
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:17:50,558 --> 01:17:52,268
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:17:53,018 --> 01:17:54,061
It was all just a score?

933
01:17:54,145 --> 01:17:57,940
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

934
01:17:59,316 --> 01:18:01,235
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:18:12,538 --> 01:18:13,497
Jesus!

936
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:43,235
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:48,115
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

938
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:30,616
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,289
Hey! What the...

940
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,258
Whoa!

941
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,055
Come on! Come on!

942
01:20:37,224 --> 01:20:38,559
This guy's crazy!

943
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:42,021
Come on! Hey!

944
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,488
Move!

945
01:22:37,303 --> 01:22:39,180
Get out of the way!

946
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:51,400
Come on!

947
01:23:00,117 --> 01:23:01,243
Get out of the way!

948
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:40,533
I got you!

949
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:43,119
I got you!

950
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:45,538
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:47,081
I got you!

952
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:06,369
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

953
01:25:06,452 --> 01:25:09,080
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

954
01:25:09,163 --> 01:25:10,456
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:11,957
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,667
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

957
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:15,628
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

958
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:17,838
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:25:17,922 --> 01:25:19,131
His drops operation.

960
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,675
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

961
01:25:21,759 --> 01:25:25,388
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

962
01:25:25,471 --> 01:25:27,223
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

963
01:25:27,306 --> 01:25:29,642
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

964
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:32,937
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

965
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,188
What are you, crazy?

966
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:35,356
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:36,399
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:38,275
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

969
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:39,652
But she got too close, right?

970
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:41,946
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

971
01:25:42,029 --> 01:25:43,989
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:45,991
He knows so much about you.

973
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:48,119
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

974
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:50,913
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

975
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,498
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:55,501
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

977
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,919
I ain't no rat!

978
01:25:57,002 --> 01:25:58,838
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

979
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:00,005
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:26:00,089 --> 01:26:02,258
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

981
01:26:02,341 --> 01:26:04,885
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

982
01:26:04,969 --> 01:26:06,512
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:08,222
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

984
01:26:08,305 --> 01:26:10,224
Open your eyes!

985
01:26:14,145 --> 01:26:15,730
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:26:15,813 --> 01:26:17,314
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:26:17,398 --> 01:26:19,233
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

988
01:26:19,316 --> 01:26:21,652
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

989
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:24,321
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:25,781
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:26:25,865 --> 01:26:27,074
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:26:27,158 --> 01:26:28,034
Yeah!

993
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:29,744
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

994
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:30,661
What?

995
01:26:31,078 --> 01:26:32,413
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:26:32,496 --> 01:26:33,789
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,292
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

998
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:38,252
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:26:38,669 --> 01:26:40,921
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:43,632
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1001
01:26:43,716 --> 01:26:44,800
Jesus!

1002
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:46,385
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

1003
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:48,471
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:26:49,889 --> 01:26:50,973
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:26:51,057 --> 01:26:52,266
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:26:52,349 --> 01:26:53,392
A rat with wings?

1007
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:55,061
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:26:55,144 --> 01:26:58,314
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1009
01:26:58,397 --> 01:27:00,399
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:09,909
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:27:18,584 --> 01:27:20,086
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:27:20,503 --> 01:27:21,337
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,254
Wait.

1014
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:27,009
Is that him?

1015
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:29,720
Holy shit.

1016
01:27:49,615 --> 01:27:51,200
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1017
01:28:20,604 --> 01:28:24,233
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:28:24,316 --> 01:28:27,153
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:28:27,236 --> 01:28:29,155
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:31,365
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,450
Any idea?

1022
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:33,993
Yeah.

1023
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:36,662
It's an orphan.

1024
01:28:45,546 --> 01:28:47,298
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:28:48,841 --> 01:28:51,427
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1026
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:53,220
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:28:53,846 --> 01:28:55,431
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1028
01:28:55,514 --> 01:28:56,348
Let's go.

1029
01:28:59,602 --> 01:29:02,063
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:04,482
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:29:04,565 --> 01:29:06,025
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1032
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:10,946
Hey!

1033
01:29:12,406 --> 01:29:14,825
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:29:28,923 --> 01:29:31,092
No guns.

1035
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:34,595
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,909
What's that?

1037
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,338
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:30:15,803 --> 01:30:17,012
Dropheads.

1039
01:30:24,437 --> 01:30:26,063
What the hell is that?

1040
01:30:37,825 --> 01:30:40,202
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:30:40,286 --> 01:30:41,579
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:30:44,331 --> 01:30:46,375
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,377
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:51,714
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:30:53,007 --> 01:30:54,800
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,472
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1047
01:31:00,014 --> 01:31:01,807
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:04,727
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1049
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:08,147
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1050
01:31:08,689 --> 01:31:10,566
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:31:10,649 --> 01:31:13,444
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1052
01:31:13,903 --> 01:31:16,739
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1053
01:31:17,323 --> 01:31:21,369
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1054
01:31:21,452 --> 01:31:23,371
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:31:23,454 --> 01:31:24,914
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:31:24,997 --> 01:31:26,415
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:31:26,499 --> 01:31:28,959
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1058
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,506
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:31:37,385 --> 01:31:39,595
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:31:41,597 --> 01:31:44,725
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:31:49,313 --> 01:31:50,731
Hey!

1062
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,960
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1063
01:32:53,044 --> 01:32:54,879
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1064
01:32:54,962 --> 01:32:56,589
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:32:57,256 --> 01:32:59,341
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:33:11,145 --> 01:33:12,897
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:33:14,065 --> 01:33:15,733
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:33:17,193 --> 01:33:18,944
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:23,365
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:27,661
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1071
01:33:50,393 --> 01:33:52,019
We've sedated him.

1072
01:33:52,103 --> 01:33:53,729
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:33:54,605 --> 01:33:57,316
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1074
01:33:57,858 --> 01:33:59,610
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:34:00,945 --> 01:34:02,363
Next of kin?

1076
01:34:07,493 --> 01:34:08,577
No.

1077
01:34:09,704 --> 01:34:11,330
It's just me.

1078
01:35:54,433 --> 01:35:55,684
Selina?

1079
01:36:02,316 --> 01:36:03,317
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:36:06,445 --> 01:36:08,864
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1081
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,825
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:31,429
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:36:32,513 --> 01:36:34,974
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1084
01:36:35,057 --> 01:36:37,518
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1085
01:36:38,185 --> 01:36:39,937
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:41,981
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:36:42,064 --> 01:36:43,983
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:36:44,066 --> 01:36:46,944
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1089
01:36:47,027 --> 01:36:50,030
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1090
01:36:50,114 --> 01:36:51,657
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1091
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:53,367
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:54,785
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1093
01:36:54,869 --> 01:36:56,412
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:36:56,495 --> 01:36:57,997
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,458
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:03,252
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1097
01:37:03,335 --> 01:37:05,171
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1098
01:37:05,504 --> 01:37:07,673
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,302
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1100
01:37:12,928 --> 01:37:16,599
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1101
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:18,017
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1102
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,435
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:37:19,518 --> 01:37:21,270
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1104
01:37:21,353 --> 01:37:22,188
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:37:22,271 --> 01:37:23,189
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:37:23,272 --> 01:37:25,024
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1107
01:37:25,107 --> 01:37:26,108
would owe you anything.

1108
01:37:26,192 --> 01:37:28,527
Because he's my father!

1109
01:37:37,661 --> 01:37:40,456
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:37:41,957 --> 01:37:43,250
Just like Anni.

1111
01:37:45,419 --> 01:37:47,963
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1112
01:37:50,049 --> 01:37:51,384
To the club?

1113
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:53,302
Yeah.

1114
01:37:56,013 --> 01:37:58,891
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1115
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,102
Used to see him there.

1116
01:38:01,852 --> 01:38:03,854
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:38:05,815 --> 01:38:09,276
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1118
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:13,656
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1119
01:38:17,034 --> 01:38:19,370
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1120
01:38:20,037 --> 01:38:21,539
Strangled.

1121
01:38:21,956 --> 01:38:25,418
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1122
01:38:27,294 --> 01:38:29,380
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1123
01:38:29,463 --> 01:38:31,632
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:38:33,467 --> 01:38:35,261
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:38:39,014 --> 01:38:40,766
He owes me that money.

1126
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,978
I'm sorry.

1127
01:38:45,104 --> 01:38:46,272
For what I said.

1128
01:38:47,648 --> 01:38:49,066
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:38:52,611 --> 01:38:54,697
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:38:55,614 --> 01:38:56,991
Which, well...

1131
01:38:59,285 --> 01:39:01,203
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:39:06,667 --> 01:39:08,419
Who are you under there?

1133
01:39:14,508 --> 01:39:16,385
What are you hiding?

1134
01:39:18,763 --> 01:39:20,598
Are you just...

1135
01:39:22,183 --> 01:39:23,893
hideously scarred?

1136
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,021
Yeah.

1137
01:39:34,278 --> 01:39:35,696
Listen to me.

1138
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:40,117
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1139
01:39:41,285 --> 01:39:45,956
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1140
01:39:46,582 --> 01:39:49,668
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:39:49,752 --> 01:39:51,003
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:52,338
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:39:52,421 --> 01:39:54,465
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1144
01:39:54,548 --> 01:39:55,800
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:39:55,883 --> 01:39:57,510
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1146
01:39:57,593 --> 01:39:59,553
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:39:59,637 --> 01:40:01,722
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1148
01:40:02,807 --> 01:40:06,685
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1149
01:40:06,769 --> 01:40:07,978
will you help me?

1150
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,523
Please.

1151
01:40:13,317 --> 01:40:15,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:40:17,696 --> 01:40:19,949
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1153
01:40:20,032 --> 01:40:21,659
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1154
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:32,753
I told you, baby.

1155
01:40:34,672 --> 01:40:37,258
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,355
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1157
01:40:59,196 --> 01:41:02,783
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1158
01:41:02,908 --> 01:41:04,744
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:41:04,952 --> 01:41:07,371
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1160
01:41:07,538 --> 01:41:08,998
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:41:09,707 --> 01:41:12,043
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:41:13,252 --> 01:41:15,588
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:18,132
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:41:18,215 --> 01:41:21,385
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:27,391
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1166
01:41:27,475 --> 01:41:31,145
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:41:31,854 --> 01:41:33,397
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:41:33,481 --> 01:41:35,983
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:41:36,067 --> 01:41:37,693
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:41:37,777 --> 01:41:43,365
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1171
01:41:43,449 --> 01:41:48,120
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1172
01:41:48,204 --> 01:41:50,581
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:41:51,415 --> 01:41:53,918
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1174
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:57,922
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1175
01:41:58,047 --> 01:42:00,091
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:42:00,591 --> 01:42:04,887
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1177
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:07,556
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:10,726
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:42:11,310 --> 01:42:16,565
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:42:17,066 --> 01:42:19,443
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:42:19,527 --> 01:42:21,904
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:42:21,987 --> 01:42:25,449
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:42:25,533 --> 01:42:28,327
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,706
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:42:37,461 --> 01:42:38,546
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:42:40,172 --> 01:42:41,298
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:42:41,382 --> 01:42:43,259
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:42:54,019 --> 01:42:55,020
See?

1189
01:43:06,323 --> 01:43:08,951
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1190
01:43:09,702 --> 01:43:11,829
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:43:12,288 --> 01:43:14,040
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1192
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:18,002
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1193
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:19,086
No, boss.

1194
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,505
$1,183.

1195
01:43:22,089 --> 01:43:24,050
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:43:24,133 --> 01:43:25,134
No, boss.

1197
01:43:27,053 --> 01:43:28,304
Austerity.

1198
01:43:30,556 --> 01:43:32,183
All right. All right.

1199
01:43:32,475 --> 01:43:34,852
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:43:34,935 --> 01:43:36,687
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:43:38,898 --> 01:43:41,400
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:43:41,484 --> 01:43:42,651
What are you doing here?

1203
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:46,405
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:43:47,323 --> 01:43:48,365
Come on.

1205
01:43:50,284 --> 01:43:51,494
See ya, champ.

1206
01:43:52,495 --> 01:43:53,746
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:43:55,706 --> 01:43:56,707
Have a seat.

1208
01:43:58,751 --> 01:44:00,544
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:44:01,712 --> 01:44:04,840
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1210
01:44:06,384 --> 01:44:08,177
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,970
- Is it true?
- What?

1212
01:44:11,263 --> 01:44:12,890
That reporter business?

1213
01:44:14,225 --> 01:44:15,434
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:44:15,518 --> 01:44:18,312
Did you kill him? For my father?

1215
01:44:18,396 --> 01:44:21,148
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:44:22,024 --> 01:44:23,818
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:25,528
Some very...

1218
01:44:26,695 --> 01:44:30,449
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1219
01:44:30,533 --> 01:44:33,244
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1220
01:44:33,327 --> 01:44:34,787
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1221
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:36,789
not right before the election.

1222
01:44:37,248 --> 01:44:39,542
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1223
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:41,252
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:44:41,335 --> 01:44:44,505
So, he came to me.

1225
01:44:44,588 --> 01:44:46,966
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,635
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:44:50,428 --> 01:44:55,141
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1228
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,479
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:45:01,147 --> 01:45:02,982
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:45:04,316 --> 01:45:07,653
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1231
01:45:08,654 --> 01:45:10,489
I handled it.

1232
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:13,617
I know.

1233
01:45:13,701 --> 01:45:15,953
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:45:17,204 --> 01:45:19,040
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:45:19,123 --> 01:45:21,500
what even a good man like him

1236
01:45:21,584 --> 01:45:24,170
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:45:26,422 --> 01:45:27,882
Do me a favor.

1238
01:45:28,215 --> 01:45:30,259
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:32,553
This reporter

1240
01:45:33,387 --> 01:45:34,972
was a lowlife.

1241
01:45:35,056 --> 01:45:36,515
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:45:38,142 --> 01:45:39,769
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1243
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:43,773
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1244
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:48,694
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1245
01:45:48,778 --> 01:45:51,113
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:45:51,864 --> 01:45:52,865
forever.

1247
01:45:53,532 --> 01:45:55,576
He would have done anything

1248
01:45:55,659 --> 01:45:57,828
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:45:57,912 --> 01:45:59,246
You understand?

1250
01:46:00,456 --> 01:46:05,002
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1251
01:46:05,086 --> 01:46:07,129
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:11,634
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1253
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:15,304
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:46:15,388 --> 01:46:17,807
This little conversation here?

1255
01:46:20,226 --> 01:46:22,395
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:46:25,022 --> 01:46:27,149
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:47:36,552 --> 01:47:37,845
You lied to me...

1258
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:42,308
my whole life.

1259
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,523
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:55,905
He told me what he did for my father.

1261
01:47:59,909 --> 01:48:01,410
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:48:03,412 --> 01:48:06,123
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:48:06,207 --> 01:48:07,958
Had my father killed.

1264
01:48:10,419 --> 01:48:12,630
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:48:15,383 --> 01:48:19,929
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1266
01:48:20,012 --> 01:48:22,348
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:48:22,431 --> 01:48:24,016
He was a good man.

1268
01:48:25,184 --> 01:48:26,894
You listen to me.

1269
01:48:26,977 --> 01:48:30,398
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:48:34,026 --> 01:48:35,945
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1271
01:48:36,028 --> 01:48:37,947
He had a man killed.

1272
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:39,115
Why?

1273
01:48:40,282 --> 01:48:43,536
To protect his family image?

1274
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,871
His political aspirations?

1275
01:48:45,955 --> 01:48:49,500
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1276
01:48:52,086 --> 01:48:53,629
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:48:54,588 --> 01:48:58,134
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1278
01:48:58,217 --> 01:49:00,344
He cared about her,

1279
01:49:00,428 --> 01:49:01,721
and you,

1280
01:49:01,804 --> 01:49:04,724
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1281
01:49:04,807 --> 01:49:08,269
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1282
01:49:09,145 --> 01:49:12,481
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1283
01:49:12,565 --> 01:49:15,693
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1284
01:49:15,776 --> 01:49:17,611
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:49:19,864 --> 01:49:22,074
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:24,201
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1287
01:49:24,285 --> 01:49:27,038
your father was distraught.

1288
01:49:27,913 --> 01:49:31,125
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1289
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:33,377
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:49:34,879 --> 01:49:36,881
And that night,

1291
01:49:36,964 --> 01:49:40,885
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:48,142
It was Falcone?

1293
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:56,317
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:04,575
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1295
01:50:04,658 --> 01:50:07,411
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1296
01:50:07,495 --> 01:50:12,708
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1297
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:18,339
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1298
01:50:19,006 --> 01:50:20,800
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:50:20,883 --> 01:50:23,427
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:50:25,596 --> 01:50:27,890
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:50:29,308 --> 01:50:31,685
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:50:31,769 --> 01:50:34,271
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:50:35,648 --> 01:50:38,317
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1304
01:50:38,401 --> 01:50:40,236
You needed a father.

1305
01:50:42,196 --> 01:50:44,615
And all you had was me.

1306
01:50:46,992 --> 01:50:48,202
I'm sorry.

1307
01:50:49,954 --> 01:50:51,872
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:50:58,671 --> 01:50:59,755
God.

1309
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:07,221
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1310
01:51:09,932 --> 01:51:12,059
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:51:18,482 --> 01:51:19,734
I mean,

1312
01:51:20,943 --> 01:51:23,070
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:51:24,822 --> 01:51:27,199
I realize now there's something

1314
01:51:28,325 --> 01:51:30,202
I haven't got past.

1315
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,872
This fear...

1316
01:51:35,332 --> 01:51:38,294
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:51:42,548 --> 01:51:44,759
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:36,310
Hey.

1319
01:52:36,394 --> 01:52:39,146
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1320
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:41,148
I thought it was you.

1321
01:52:54,078 --> 01:52:55,621
- I found him!
- I see that.

1322
01:52:55,705 --> 01:52:57,206
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:52:57,289 --> 01:52:58,499
She left a message
the night they took her.

1324
01:52:58,582 --> 01:52:59,500
She called me...

1325
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:01,293
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:53:01,377 --> 01:53:02,670
She got my gun!

1327
01:53:04,004 --> 01:53:05,715
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1328
01:53:07,258 --> 01:53:09,802
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1329
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:16,475
Here. Listen.

1330
01:53:18,436 --> 01:53:20,104
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:53:20,229 --> 01:53:22,398
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1332
01:53:22,481 --> 01:53:24,567
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1333
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,985
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:53:26,068 --> 01:53:27,778
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:53:27,862 --> 01:53:28,904
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:53:28,988 --> 01:53:30,281
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:53:30,364 --> 01:53:33,034
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1338
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:36,954
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:53:37,663 --> 01:53:40,207
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1340
01:53:40,291 --> 01:53:43,210
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1341
01:53:43,294 --> 01:53:46,005
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:53:46,547 --> 01:53:48,549
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1343
01:53:49,258 --> 01:53:52,136
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1344
01:53:52,219 --> 01:53:54,930
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1345
01:53:55,014 --> 01:53:57,141
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1346
01:53:57,224 --> 01:54:00,352
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1347
01:54:01,187 --> 01:54:03,731
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:54:04,815 --> 01:54:06,150
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:54:06,942 --> 01:54:10,488
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1350
01:54:10,988 --> 01:54:12,198
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:54:12,281 --> 01:54:14,241
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:54:14,325 --> 01:54:15,618
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:54:15,701 --> 01:54:20,623
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1354
01:54:20,706 --> 01:54:23,417
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:54:23,501 --> 01:54:25,878
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:54:25,961 --> 01:54:27,088
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:54:27,838 --> 01:54:29,215
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:54:30,174 --> 01:54:32,343
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:54:40,017 --> 01:54:41,352
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:54:41,435 --> 01:54:42,978
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:54:43,062 --> 01:54:46,107
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:54:55,324 --> 01:54:56,617
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:55:01,372 --> 01:55:03,165
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:55:03,499 --> 01:55:05,334
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:55:16,303 --> 01:55:19,473
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:55:20,141 --> 01:55:22,685
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:55:25,688 --> 01:55:26,772
No.

1368
01:55:29,859 --> 01:55:31,152
We work for him.

1369
01:55:32,153 --> 01:55:33,404
Everybody does.

1370
01:55:33,487 --> 01:55:34,488
How?

1371
01:55:34,572 --> 01:55:36,157
Through Renewal.

1372
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:38,325
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:55:38,409 --> 01:55:39,744
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1374
01:55:40,327 --> 01:55:44,040
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1375
01:55:44,123 --> 01:55:47,710
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1376
01:55:47,793 --> 01:55:51,172
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1377
01:55:51,255 --> 01:55:53,340
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1378
01:55:53,424 --> 01:55:55,134
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:55:55,217 --> 01:55:57,053
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:55:58,846 --> 01:56:02,058
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1381
01:56:03,476 --> 01:56:05,811
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:56:06,187 --> 01:56:08,898
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1383
01:56:08,981 --> 01:56:11,442
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:56:11,525 --> 01:56:14,070
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:56:15,696 --> 01:56:17,615
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:56:18,574 --> 01:56:21,077
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1387
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,536
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:56:23,245 --> 01:56:25,081
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:27,416
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1390
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,334
No!

1391
01:56:29,794 --> 01:56:31,003
We'll get him.

1392
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:33,547
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1393
01:56:33,631 --> 01:56:34,757
He owns the city!

1394
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,092
Cross that line...

1395
01:56:36,884 --> 01:56:38,177
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:56:38,886 --> 01:56:40,429
Listen to me.

1397
01:56:40,513 --> 01:56:42,390
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:56:48,938 --> 01:56:50,314
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:56:53,401 --> 01:56:54,860
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:56:54,985 --> 01:56:56,946
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,532
Oh, God!

1402
01:57:08,833 --> 01:57:09,959
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:57:10,126 --> 01:57:12,712
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1404
01:57:12,795 --> 01:57:13,796
I have to stop her.

1405
01:57:13,963 --> 01:57:14,922
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:57:16,257 --> 01:57:17,800
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:57:18,134 --> 01:57:19,135
And then what?

1408
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:21,387
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:57:22,221 --> 01:57:23,848
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,844
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1411
01:58:01,927 --> 01:58:03,387
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:58:04,013 --> 01:58:05,347
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:58:08,601 --> 01:58:09,935
Hey!

1414
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:12,188
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:14,690
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1416
01:58:14,774 --> 01:58:16,776
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1417
01:58:16,942 --> 01:58:18,402
Absolutely.

1418
01:58:20,154 --> 01:58:21,155
Alone?

1419
01:58:37,713 --> 01:58:38,798
Hey!

1420
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:50,559
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:58:50,643 --> 01:58:52,269
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:58:54,021 --> 01:58:57,400
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1423
01:58:57,483 --> 01:59:00,903
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1424
01:59:02,405 --> 01:59:04,782
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1425
01:59:06,242 --> 01:59:07,368
I'm sorry.

1426
01:59:07,576 --> 01:59:08,661
It's okay.

1427
01:59:08,744 --> 01:59:10,871
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1428
01:59:11,038 --> 01:59:13,916
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1429
01:59:18,170 --> 01:59:19,088
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:59:19,171 --> 01:59:20,631
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:59:20,715 --> 01:59:23,634
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1432
01:59:26,011 --> 01:59:27,513
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
01:59:27,596 --> 01:59:29,014
I'll be right back.

1434
01:59:44,321 --> 01:59:45,406
Holy shit.

1435
01:59:45,489 --> 01:59:47,158
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

02:00:04,467 --> 02:00:09,263
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1444
02:00:09,346 --> 02:00:12,266
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1445
02:00:12,349 --> 02:00:14,894
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1446
02:00:14,977 --> 02:00:15,978
<i>Right.</i>

1447
02:00:16,854 --> 02:00:18,064
<i>Hmm.</i>

1448
02:00:18,147 --> 02:00:19,356
<i>Okay.</i>

1449
02:00:26,614 --> 02:00:28,991
<i>Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role</i>

1450
02:00:29,075 --> 02:00:30,326
<i>as a mafia informant...</i>

1451
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:32,161
Hey, Dad.

1452
02:00:33,204 --> 02:00:34,205
What?

1453
02:00:34,663 --> 02:00:36,707
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
02:00:38,334 --> 02:00:39,794
You remember her?

1455
02:00:41,837 --> 02:00:42,880
Yeah.

1456
02:00:47,176 --> 02:00:48,260
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
02:00:48,344 --> 02:00:49,428
This is for my mother.

1458
02:01:46,694 --> 02:01:47,862
I see him!

1459
02:02:31,906 --> 02:02:33,657
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:02:38,245 --> 02:02:40,539
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:02:56,931 --> 02:02:58,766
You made me do this.

1462
02:03:00,184 --> 02:03:01,977
Just like your mother.

1463
02:03:07,983 --> 02:03:09,318
He has to pay!

1464
02:03:13,239 --> 02:03:14,365
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:03:17,993 --> 02:03:19,495
You paid enough.

1466
02:03:54,071 --> 02:03:55,197
Jesus.

1467
02:03:55,281 --> 02:03:57,992
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1468
02:03:58,075 --> 02:04:01,162
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1469
02:04:01,245 --> 02:04:02,496
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:05,082
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1471
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:06,792
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:04:06,876 --> 02:04:08,586
Whatever I know,

1473
02:04:08,669 --> 02:04:10,546
whatever I've done,

1474
02:04:10,629 --> 02:04:14,967
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:04:25,519 --> 02:04:27,480
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:04:29,106 --> 02:04:31,400
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1477
02:04:39,325 --> 02:04:41,660
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:04:50,669 --> 02:04:52,213
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:04:53,047 --> 02:04:56,550
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1480
02:04:56,634 --> 02:04:57,968
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:04:58,052 --> 02:04:59,220
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:04:59,303 --> 02:05:01,097
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1483
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,890
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:05:04,392 --> 02:05:05,976
Do you understand?

1485
02:05:07,937 --> 02:05:09,021
Yeah.

1486
02:05:09,105 --> 02:05:11,190
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:05:11,273 --> 02:05:12,274
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:05:12,358 --> 02:05:13,651
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1489
02:05:13,734 --> 02:05:14,985
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:05:16,946 --> 02:05:18,280
What'd you say?

1491
02:05:18,364 --> 02:05:20,116
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:05:21,242 --> 02:05:22,493
Probably be your last.

1493
02:05:22,743 --> 02:05:25,788
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:05:25,871 --> 02:05:26,956
Maybe I am.

1495
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:28,249
Really, Oz?

1496
02:05:28,332 --> 02:05:33,045
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1497
02:05:33,129 --> 02:05:34,213
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:39,385
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:05:39,844 --> 02:05:41,846
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1500
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:44,640
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:06,203
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:11,751
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:06:11,834 --> 02:06:12,918
There!

1504
02:06:13,002 --> 02:06:14,837
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:06:16,422 --> 02:06:17,423
It's Riddler.

1506
02:06:19,508 --> 02:06:20,676
Gage, on me.

1507
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:23,471
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1508
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:38,879
He's gone.

1509
02:07:48,681 --> 02:07:50,641
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:07:50,725 --> 02:07:53,060
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1511
02:07:53,144 --> 02:07:54,270
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:07:54,353 --> 02:07:57,022
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1513
02:07:57,106 --> 02:07:59,567
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:02,570
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1515
02:08:18,085 --> 02:08:20,171
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:08:23,215 --> 02:08:26,719
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1517
02:08:45,863 --> 02:08:47,782
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:08:50,743 --> 02:08:52,036
Stay still!

1519
02:08:52,119 --> 02:08:53,120
Now!

1520
02:09:21,774 --> 02:09:23,567
Which one is you?

1521
02:09:23,651 --> 02:09:25,152
You tell me.

1522
02:09:25,986 --> 02:09:27,446
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:09:30,533 --> 02:09:32,284
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1524
02:09:46,799 --> 02:09:49,719
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1525
02:09:49,802 --> 02:09:52,388
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1526
02:09:52,471 --> 02:09:55,057
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Reál's headquarters right now...</i>

1527
02:09:55,141 --> 02:09:56,183
Hey.

1528
02:10:20,624 --> 02:10:22,334
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:10:22,418 --> 02:10:24,837
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1530
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:28,466
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1531
02:10:28,549 --> 02:10:30,092
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:10:30,176 --> 02:10:32,470
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:10:32,553 --> 02:10:34,388
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1534
02:10:34,472 --> 02:10:36,891
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1535
02:10:36,974 --> 02:10:38,726
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,770
You should see this.

1537
02:10:46,734 --> 02:10:48,235
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:10:49,695 --> 02:10:51,947
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:10:52,031 --> 02:10:55,743
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1540
02:10:56,077 --> 02:10:59,121
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:10:59,205 --> 02:11:00,623
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:11:00,706 --> 02:11:04,835
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1543
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:07,963
'Renewal.'

1544
02:11:08,047 --> 02:11:12,468
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1545
02:11:12,551 --> 02:11:15,679
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1546
02:11:15,763 --> 02:11:19,100
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1547
02:11:19,183 --> 02:11:21,644
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:11:21,727 --> 02:11:24,730
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1549
02:11:25,856 --> 02:11:27,691
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:11:27,775 --> 02:11:29,610
really understand,

1551
02:11:29,693 --> 02:11:31,987
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:11:32,071 --> 02:11:33,531
You have to confront them,

1553
02:11:33,614 --> 02:11:36,033
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1554
02:11:36,117 --> 02:11:38,285
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:11:38,369 --> 02:11:41,163
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:11:44,125 --> 02:11:45,459
Jesus.

1557
02:11:51,549 --> 02:11:53,509
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:11:54,051 --> 02:11:55,553
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:12:12,194 --> 02:12:13,320
What is that?

1560
02:12:44,935 --> 02:12:46,145
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:12:46,228 --> 02:12:47,605
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:12:47,688 --> 02:12:49,148
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:12:49,231 --> 02:12:50,608
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:12:51,275 --> 02:12:54,153
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1565
02:13:02,745 --> 02:13:04,747
"My confession"?

1566
02:13:04,830 --> 02:13:07,708
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1567
02:13:07,792 --> 02:13:09,168
This isn't over.

1568
02:13:09,251 --> 02:13:11,670
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1569
02:13:12,088 --> 02:13:14,298
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1570
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:24,600
His final post was last night.

1571
02:13:24,683 --> 02:13:27,895
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1572
02:13:27,978 --> 02:13:30,981
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1573
02:13:31,107 --> 02:13:34,527
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:13:45,871 --> 02:13:48,416
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1575
02:13:50,042 --> 02:13:51,752
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:13:52,586 --> 02:13:54,213
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:13:56,799 --> 02:13:57,883
You?

1578
02:13:58,259 --> 02:14:00,302
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:14:00,845 --> 02:14:02,221
What is?

1580
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:04,098
The Batman.

1581
02:14:09,478 --> 02:14:10,646
Yeah?

1582
02:14:21,949 --> 02:14:23,159
Right.

1583
02:14:26,037 --> 02:14:29,999
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:14:37,465 --> 02:14:38,966
You're a good cop.

1585
02:15:03,574 --> 02:15:05,951
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:15:06,702 --> 02:15:08,537
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:15:08,621 --> 02:15:10,164
"Want"?

1588
02:15:10,748 --> 02:15:14,377
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1589
02:15:15,586 --> 02:15:16,921
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:15:17,963 --> 02:15:20,966
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:24,678
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:15:26,222 --> 02:15:28,641
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:15:28,724 --> 02:15:30,559
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:15:40,945 --> 02:15:42,905
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:15:45,783 --> 02:15:47,618
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:15:49,995 --> 02:15:53,749
Bruce...

1597
02:15:55,167 --> 02:15:58,045
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:16:09,306 --> 02:16:11,726
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:16:14,311 --> 02:16:17,690
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1600
02:16:17,773 --> 02:16:20,151
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:16:22,611 --> 02:16:26,866
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1602
02:16:27,408 --> 02:16:30,953
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1603
02:16:31,037 --> 02:16:34,707
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:16:35,291 --> 02:16:36,834
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:16:42,506 --> 02:16:47,636
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1606
02:16:48,929 --> 02:16:53,559
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1607
02:16:54,226 --> 02:16:55,770
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:16:58,397 --> 02:17:01,067
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:17:01,442 --> 02:17:04,028
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:17:05,321 --> 02:17:09,367
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

1611
02:17:11,077 --> 02:17:15,748
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1612
02:17:16,916 --> 02:17:20,086
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:17:20,169 --> 02:17:22,463
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:17:23,756 --> 02:17:26,342
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:17:29,261 --> 02:17:32,431
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1616
02:17:32,515 --> 02:17:35,434
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1617
02:17:35,518 --> 02:17:36,519
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:17:37,978 --> 02:17:40,022
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:17:41,065 --> 02:17:42,983
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:17:46,654 --> 02:17:49,740
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:56,288
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:17:57,748 --> 02:18:01,627
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:18:04,797 --> 02:18:05,965
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:18:06,966 --> 02:18:08,259
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:18:09,927 --> 02:18:12,388
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:18:12,471 --> 02:18:15,391
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:18:15,474 --> 02:18:16,559
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:18:16,642 --> 02:18:21,063
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1629
02:18:22,523 --> 02:18:24,567
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:18:25,526 --> 02:18:28,028
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:18:28,112 --> 02:18:31,741
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1632
02:18:31,824 --> 02:18:33,367
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:18:34,285 --> 02:18:35,286
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:18:35,369 --> 02:18:37,038
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:18:37,913 --> 02:18:38,914
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:18:38,998 --> 02:18:40,708
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:18:40,791 --> 02:18:42,001
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:44,628
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1639
02:18:44,712 --> 02:18:46,922
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1640
02:18:47,006 --> 02:18:48,466
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:18:48,549 --> 02:18:50,551
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1642
02:18:50,634 --> 02:18:51,802
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:18:51,886 --> 02:18:52,887
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:18:52,970 --> 02:18:55,473
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1645
02:18:55,556 --> 02:18:57,975
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1646
02:18:58,059 --> 02:19:01,228
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1647
02:19:01,312 --> 02:19:02,938
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1648
02:19:03,022 --> 02:19:04,231
You gave me that.

1649
02:19:04,315 --> 02:19:05,441
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:19:05,524 --> 02:19:08,110
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:19:08,194 --> 02:19:13,074
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1652
02:19:13,157 --> 02:19:14,700
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:19:14,784 --> 02:19:16,285
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:19:17,411 --> 02:19:18,496
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:19:18,579 --> 02:19:20,748
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1656
02:19:20,831 --> 02:19:22,208
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:19:22,291 --> 02:19:23,793
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:19:23,876 --> 02:19:25,544
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:19:26,045 --> 02:19:27,797
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1660
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:29,548
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1661
02:19:29,632 --> 02:19:30,674
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:19:30,758 --> 02:19:31,675
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:19:33,469 --> 02:19:35,262
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:19:37,181 --> 02:19:39,558
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:19:39,809 --> 02:19:42,395
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:19:43,354 --> 02:19:46,982
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:19:47,066 --> 02:19:49,693
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:19:50,694 --> 02:19:52,696
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:19:53,072 --> 02:19:56,367
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:19:56,450 --> 02:19:57,451
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:19:57,535 --> 02:19:59,286
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:20:07,628 --> 02:20:09,296
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:20:11,465 --> 02:20:13,801
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:20:18,097 --> 02:20:22,017
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1675
02:20:24,061 --> 02:20:26,147
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:20:26,605 --> 02:20:27,857
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:20:28,566 --> 02:20:33,446
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:20:36,282 --> 02:20:38,117
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:20:39,785 --> 02:20:41,912
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1680
02:20:43,247 --> 02:20:44,790
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:20:46,333 --> 02:20:52,173
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:54,467
<i>What have you done?</i>

1683
02:20:56,927 --> 02:20:58,304
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1684
02:20:58,471 --> 02:20:59,889

02:21:07,438 --> 02:21:12,985
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:21:44,850 --> 02:21:46,227
Hey!

1688
02:21:47,228 --> 02:21:48,521
What are you doing in here?

1689
02:22:06,455 --> 02:22:09,041
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1690
02:22:15,631 --> 02:22:18,092
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1691
02:22:18,968 --> 02:22:21,721
Killing Mitchell

1692
02:22:26,392 --> 02:22:29,437
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1694
02:22:31,772 --> 02:22:34,024
It's a tucker.

1695
02:22:51,834 --> 02:22:52,835
Huh.

1696
02:23:08,017 --> 02:23:10,811
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1697
02:23:10,895 --> 02:23:12,396
What are you doing?

1698
02:23:42,927 --> 02:23:44,345
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1714

<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1715

<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1716

<i>But unmasking is not enough.</i>

<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

<i>And now it is time</i>

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1754
02:27:24,815 --> 02:27:26,776
You're gonna have to go inside

to get a handle here, sir.

1757
02:27:39,747 --> 02:27:41,582
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:27:41,665 --> 02:27:42,917
We got an active situation.

1759
02:27:43,042 --> 02:27:44,335
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1760
02:27:44,418 --> 02:27:45,628
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1761
02:27:45,711 --> 02:27:46,629
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1762
02:27:46,712 --> 02:27:47,546
Come!

1763
02:28:23,582 --> 02:28:25,000
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1764
02:28:25,084 --> 02:28:25,960
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:28:26,043 --> 02:28:27,420
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:28:27,503 --> 02:28:29,046
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1767
02:28:29,130 --> 02:28:31,340
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1768
02:28:31,424 --> 02:28:33,259
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1769
02:28:33,342 --> 02:28:35,678
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1770
02:28:35,761 --> 02:28:38,013
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1771
02:28:38,097 --> 02:28:40,349
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1772
02:28:40,433 --> 02:28:42,268
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1773
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:45,354
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1774
02:28:45,438 --> 02:28:46,939
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1775
02:28:52,111 --> 02:28:55,573
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1776
02:28:55,656 --> 02:28:57,950
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:29:13,841 --> 02:29:14,967
You're okay!

1778
02:30:45,891 --> 02:30:48,519
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:30:48,602 --> 02:30:49,812
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:32:59,817 --> 02:33:01,318
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:33:01,402 --> 02:33:02,445
It's okay.

1782
02:33:03,612 --> 02:33:04,655
It's okay.

1783
02:33:06,282 --> 02:33:08,409
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:12,455
It's over.

1785
02:34:08,302 --> 02:34:11,764
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:34:12,473 --> 02:34:14,809
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:34:43,379 --> 02:34:44,505
Jesus.

1788
02:34:54,348 --> 02:34:56,016
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:35:00,229 --> 02:35:01,230
Me?

1790
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,818
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:40,574
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:38:43,786 --> 02:38:45,663
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:38:47,998 --> 02:38:49,750
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:38:52,044 --> 02:38:54,046
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:38:54,964 --> 02:38:56,590
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:38:59,802 --> 02:39:03,514
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:39:03,597 --> 02:39:06,142
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1798
02:39:07,309 --> 02:39:11,021
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1799
02:39:13,983 --> 02:39:17,111
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1800
02:39:18,487 --> 02:39:19,864
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:39:20,489 --> 02:39:21,949
But not just our city.

1802
02:39:22,658 --> 02:39:26,871
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1803
02:39:26,954 --> 02:39:29,040
in our elected officials,

1804
02:39:29,123 --> 02:39:30,416
in each other.

1805
02:39:31,208 --> 02:39:34,545
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1806
02:39:38,883 --> 02:39:40,551
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:39:42,011 --> 02:39:44,180
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:39:46,265 --> 02:39:48,184
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:39:50,561 --> 02:39:53,606
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:57,318
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:39:59,737 --> 02:40:01,781
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:40:04,867 --> 02:40:06,494
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:40:07,703 --> 02:40:09,914
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:40:13,709 --> 02:40:15,378
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:40:16,295 --> 02:40:17,671
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:40:18,589 --> 02:40:19,840
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:40:21,967 --> 02:40:24,053
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:40:25,429 --> 02:40:28,140
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1819
02:40:29,767 --> 02:40:31,519
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:34,897
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:40:36,774 --> 02:40:38,692
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:40:39,652 --> 02:40:41,153
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:40:42,530 --> 02:40:44,657
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:40:47,576 --> 02:40:49,745
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1825
02:40:49,829 --> 02:40:52,623
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1826
02:40:52,707 --> 02:40:54,291
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:40:54,375 --> 02:40:56,001
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:40:56,085 --> 02:40:59,088
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1829
02:40:59,171 --> 02:41:01,716
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:41:01,799 --> 02:41:04,135
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1831
02:41:04,218 --> 02:41:06,679
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:41:08,055 --> 02:41:09,974
Him...

1833
02:41:10,057 --> 02:41:12,935
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:41:18,649 --> 02:41:20,651
What is it they say?

1835
02:41:21,819 --> 02:41:23,988
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:41:25,531 --> 02:41:27,199
the next...

1837
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:30,494
you're a clown."

1838
02:41:32,872 --> 02:41:34,040
Well,

1839
02:41:35,833 --> 02:41:38,669
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1840
02:41:40,963 --> 02:41:43,632
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:41:44,925 --> 02:41:46,761
You did so well.

1842
02:41:51,265 --> 02:41:52,266
And you know,

1843
02:41:53,934 --> 02:41:57,146
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:42:07,198 --> 02:42:08,574
Who are you?

1845
02:42:09,116 --> 02:42:11,535
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:42:12,787 --> 02:42:13,954
isn't it?

1847
02:42:16,874 --> 02:42:19,251
Riddle me this...

1848
02:42:21,712 --> 02:42:23,839
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:28,427
the more one is worth."

1850
02:42:33,849 --> 02:42:35,601
A friend.

1851
02:43:01,836 --> 02:43:02,837
You're leaving.

1852
02:43:03,754 --> 02:43:04,839
Jesus.

1853
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:08,175
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:43:13,264 --> 02:43:14,682
Where will you go?

1855
02:43:16,183 --> 02:43:18,602
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:43:19,019 --> 02:43:20,730
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:43:21,605 --> 02:43:22,606
Why?

1858
02:43:23,816 --> 02:43:25,025
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:43:32,074 --> 02:43:34,201
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1860
02:43:34,618 --> 02:43:36,954
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1861
02:43:37,038 --> 02:43:38,956
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:43:40,583 --> 02:43:41,709
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:43:42,334 --> 02:43:43,544
I know.

1864
02:43:45,087 --> 02:43:46,172
But the city can change.

1865
02:43:46,255 --> 02:43:47,506
It won't.

1866
02:43:48,632 --> 02:43:49,633
I have to try.

1867
02:43:49,717 --> 02:43:51,510
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1868
02:43:53,804 --> 02:43:54,930
Listen.

1869
02:43:57,349 --> 02:43:58,601
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:01,062
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:44:01,812 --> 02:44:05,316
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1872
02:44:05,983 --> 02:44:07,610
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:44:09,111 --> 02:44:10,780
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:44:24,126 --> 02:44:25,544
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:44:27,004 --> 02:44:29,131
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:44:41,018 --> 02:44:42,436
You should go.

1877
02:44:50,778 --> 02:44:51,779
Selina...

1878
02:44:55,866 --> 02:44:57,535
Take care of yourself.
