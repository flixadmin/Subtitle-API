1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:02,546
The Time Masters were an organization

2
00:00:02,571 --> 00:00:04,060
charged with protecting history

3
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:05,695
from rogue time travelers,

4
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,146
but they were destroyed.

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,567
Under the leadership of Rip Hunter

6
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,452
we have taken up their mantle.

7
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,372
Sara Lance, former member
of the League of Assassins,

8
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,958
Dr. Raymond Palmer... The Atom,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,243
The Arsonist... Mick Rory,

10
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,462
and Firestorm... The merged super form

11
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:26,132
of Jefferson Jackson
and myself, Martin Stein.

12
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:29,168
We are the only ones left
to protect history.

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,177
We are The Legends of Tomorrow.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,268
Oh!

15
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:51,774
Sorry! My bad!

16
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,751
What the hell is going on out here?

17
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:04,459
Sorry, sir, he broke through the
security cordon downstairs.

18
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,122
Only because they wouldn't let me up

19
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:09,959
without an appointment,
but how does a regular guy

20
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,961
get an appointment
with the Mayor anyway?

21
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:13,796
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.

22
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:19,301
I'm... here to talk
about Sara Lance, Ray Palmer,

23
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:22,354
and the rest of the Legends.

24
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,056
I think they're all in trouble.

25
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,112
Thank you for not
having me arrested back there.

26
00:01:30,114 --> 00:01:31,897
Those security guards
really overreacted.

27
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,449
You know, one of 'em tried to Mace me.

28
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,823
Dr. Heywood, I only
agreed to give you five minutes,

29
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,464
which was three minutes ago,

30
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,371
because Ray and Sara
are friends of mine,

31
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:42,958
but I don't know the
first thing about any Legends.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,461
Of course you do,
because you're the Green Arrow.

33
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:47,830
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

34
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,833
- We're done here.
- Look, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,835
I didn't mean to drop a
bomb on you like that,

36
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:56,338
it's just, I've
exhausted all my normal avenues,

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,176
and you're the only person left
who won't think I'm crazy.

38
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,727
Are you sure about that?

39
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,312
I'm a historian.

40
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,765
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

41
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:08,601
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective,

42
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:11,737
which I really don't have to be
to look at a calendar to see

43
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,523
one week after you came to this city,

44
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,026
Robin Hood showed up.

45
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,874
You said that Sara and Ray are...

46
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,967
Traveling throughout time
with the other Legends.

47
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,078
"Legends" is what they call themselves.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,130
Now, for the past six months,
I've been noticing

49
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:28,083
subtle changes to
history... Almost imperceptible.

50
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:29,707
Actually, if it wasn't
for a friend of mine

51
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:31,837
who's a quantum
physicist, I wouldn't have been able

52
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:33,338
to detect the subliminal alterations.

53
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,925
The point being, I think
your friends are responsible.

54
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:41,146
You're looking at me like
you want evidence.

55
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:43,432
Evidence, okay, an illuminated
manuscript

56
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,067
from 1216 depicting a knight...

57
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,935
Looks a lot like
your friend Dr. Palmer...

58
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:48,687
Same nose and and chin.

59
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,407
Erratic text describing a woman
in white with a bo staff.

60
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,609
Uh, hieroglyphic from Mesopotamia

61
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:56,161
depicting an albeit crude ship

62
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,030
that flies through the
air and disappears.

63
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:00,165
Let's skip to the part where
they're in trouble.

64
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,667
UFO sighting, New York City, 1942,

65
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,921
multiple witnesses report
a flying machine

66
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:08,090
diving into the Atlantic, which matches

67
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:09,791
not only the
Mesopotamian hieroglyphics but...

68
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,126
The part where they're in trouble!

69
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:12,427
Contemporaneous with the sighting

70
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:13,879
were multiple reports

71
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,465
of an underwater detonation
of an atomic bomb!

72
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,434
Now, the government has denied this.

73
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,137
You said 1942.

74
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,389
- That's three years before...
- Before the atomic bomb

75
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:26,742
was supposedly invented, yes.

76
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,728
I told you history was changing.

77
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,780
Dr. Heywood, if the Legends' ship

78
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:36,201
met an A-bomb,
they're not in trouble...

79
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,456
They're dead.

80
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:46,300

81
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,372
_

82
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:52,000
We're closing in on your
coordinates, Dr. Heywood.

83
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,886
Are you seeing the sonar
readings of the sea floor?

84
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:57,506
Either that's a really weird-looking
rock formation...

85
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,808
or the wreckage of a time ship.

86
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,853
If the Legends
went down with the ship...

87
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,022
Where are the bodies?

88
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,173
The ship's keeping him in stasis.

89
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,708
How do you know that?

90
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:37,796
Oh.

91
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,196
My name is Oliver Queen
and my preference is

92
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:57,315
to not break your arm,
so I want you to calm down

93
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:01,369
and tell us what happened to your team.

94
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:05,073
You wouldn't believe
me even if I told you.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,659
All I remember is being knocked out

96
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,245
by that skinny, little Englishman.

97
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,497
Very embarrassing.

98
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,349
I know that Sara told her father

99
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,885
she was leaving to protect history.

100
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,087
Why?

101
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,473
Why does history need protecting?

102
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,447
Because the idiots
who were protecting it...

103
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:26,595
The Time Masters, were blown up.

104
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:29,030
So you and the Legends took over?

105
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,882
Mm.

106
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:32,717
Chasing down time criminals

107
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,104
and fixing the parts of
history they screwed up.

108
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:38,823
Aberrations the captain called them.

109
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,576
We were chasing them
for about six months

110
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:43,361
without a problem.

111
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:47,232
Well, the occasional problem.

112
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,170
I knew we were all in trouble
when Rip made us put on blouses

113
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:55,123
just to save the King of France.

114
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,626
I look like an idiot.

115
00:05:57,628 --> 00:06:01,213
I rather like the style of les
Mousquetaires de la garde.

116
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,381
- You would.
- Can we concentrate, please?

117
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:05,634
King Louis XIII is scheduled
to meet an untimely end

118
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:07,135
at the hand of Cardinal Richelieu's men

119
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:09,471
at any moment.

120
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:12,190
Roger that. I have eyes on the King.

121
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:15,060
Whatever you do, do not let
him out of your sight.

122
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,479
But if today's when he's supposed to...

123
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,780
You know, with the queen, I...

124
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:20,232
Raymond, without that consummation

125
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,200
there will be no
Louis coutures, no Sun King,

126
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,069
and no golden age of France.

127
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,654
Which means by extension
no Madame Curie,

128
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:26,871
no Louis Pasteur.

129
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,123
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it,

130
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,958
history will be totally screwed,

131
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,077
but I don't have to
be there for the actual...

132
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,412
you know, consummation, do I?

133
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:43,088
It's beautiful, Your Grace.

134
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,175
As is yours. Who gave it to you?

135
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:48,710
My sister.

136
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:51,179
You speak of her as if she is gone.

137
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,319
I hate to see a lady
so beautiful so sad.

138
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:03,525
Your husband...

139
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,910
Enjoys the company of
his male courtiers.

140
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:10,615
Why should I be denied
similar... pleasures?

141
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,667
Sara...

142
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,087
I need to know that the Queen is secure.

143
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,207
Meantime, I believe
I've identified out assassins

144
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:22,294
and I'd wager those aren't
just swords on their hips.

145
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,878
Ah, yes, that would explain

146
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,347
the aberration.

147
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:32,988
My love, there is no need for you to...

148
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,389
knock.

149
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:38,109
Sorry to spoil the mood.

150
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,164
Where the hell's Sara?

151
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:05,920
Ha!

152
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,426
Everyone back to the ship!

153
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:16,264
That's easier said than done.

154
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,925
Grey, meet me on the north
side of the house!

155
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:47,295
It's actually a
chateau. What's your plan?

156
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,898
You'll see!

157
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,633
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

158
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,776
Oh, bloody hell.

159
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,400
That was the last assassin.

160
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:09,734
What did we say about using powers

161
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:11,569
and future tech, Dr. Palmer?

162
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:13,538
Well, yeah, but they started it.

163
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,206
Don't look at me.

164
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,542
I left my gun on the ship
like a good little Boy Scout.

165
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:19,144
What's going on?

166
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,414
Who are you people?

167
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,332
I believe the Queen is waiting for you

168
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,167
in her bedroom.

169
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,503
And I'll bet she's all
warmed up for you.

170
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:30,338
Shut your mouth, Jax, or
I'll cut your eyes out

171
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,473
and feed 'em to you.

172
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:33,425
I believe our work here is done.

173
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,687
Wait, how'd you go
from the court of Louis XIII

174
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,355
to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean?

175
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,491
You said you wanted to
hear the full story.

176
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,526
We do, just some of us have lives

177
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:52,994
that we'd like to get back to.

178
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:55,697
We got ourselves in trouble
by visiting a time

179
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,199
we were told not to.

180
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,668
- 1942?
- Mm.

181
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,254
Who told you not to go to 1942?

182
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:06,591
Some guy in a hood named...

183
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,793
Rex Tyler.

184
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:12,347
Said if we set foot in 1942
we'd be all screwed,

185
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,132
and then he just vanished.

186
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:17,886
Okay, if he told you not to go to 1942,

187
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,521
then why'd you go?

188
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,191
Put another successful mission
down in the books.

189
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:24,325
Where are we off to next?

190
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,694
Gideon and I have calculated
a 96% likelihood

191
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:29,314
of another aberration in Bhopal, 1912.

192
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,566
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

193
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,067
For real. We've been going non-stop

194
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,152
for the past six months.

195
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:35,904
Nobody wants to address the fact

196
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:38,456
that Cardinal Richelieu's men
were armed with laser guns?

197
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,793
Clearly provided to them by
a time pirate or some-such.

198
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,212
Ah, Grey's right. We need
to find out who so...

199
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,414
You can get another chance of
destroying the very history

200
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,399
that you're supposed to be protecting?

201
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,418
Ah, I knew I forgot something...

202
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,587
The part where Rip tells us
everything that we did wrong.

203
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,255
As in seducing the Queen of France

204
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:55,807
just before she's supposed to conceive

205
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,509
the country's
greatest hope for the future?

206
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,060
- She seduced me.
- All wrong,

207
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:00,562
as in violating our policy

208
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:03,264
of not using super powers
in front of people?

209
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,716
They had laser guns.

210
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:06,651
At least I didn't screw up this time.

211
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,488
Ahem.

212
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,973
Stealing's not screwing up.

213
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:18,413
Another successful mission, Captain?

214
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:19,614
Yes, well, it seems I don't share

215
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,191
our team's definition of success,

216
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:24,219
but let's see if our labors came
to a certain fruition, shall we?

217
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,454
Well, that was fun.

218
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,289
I'm in no mood for a lecture, Sara.

219
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,458
Too tired from dishing 'em out?

220
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,127
Replacing the Time Masters is
an enormous responsibility,

221
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,296
Sara, and one which I fear
our team is ill equipped...

222
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,633
Gideon, are we under attack?

223
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,468
Negative, that was a shock wave

224
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,136
generated rat by a time quake.

225
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:43,095
A what?

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,939
A disturbance in the temporal zone

227
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,641
caused by an unusually large aberration.

228
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,776
You never mentioned a time quake before.

229
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,945
I've never
experienced one before. Gideon?

230
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,230
The shock wave's point of origin

231
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:55,149
was New York City, 1942.

232
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,785
That's not... possible.

233
00:11:57,787 --> 00:12:01,956
Wait, what wasn't possible?

234
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,875
What?

235
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:06,794
You said you and the Legends
discovered an aberration

236
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,997
in 1942, what was it?

237
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,749
My guess is it involved Nazis.

238
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:14,302
You could say that.

239
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:17,956
The krauts nuked New York City in 1942.

240
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,367
Wow, someone just blew up New York.

241
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,785
During World War II.

242
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,321
Think we can all guess
who that someone is.

243
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:34,374
Nazis. I hate Nazis.

244
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,327
Aided by some sort of
time traveling ally, obviously.

245
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,096
Wait, does that mean the Allied
forces lost the war?

246
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,382
In which case, why aren't we
speaking German right now?

247
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:43,833
Because we're in the temporal zone.

248
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:45,184
And because it takes time
for the consequences

249
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,054
of an aberration... even one
as cataclysmic as this one,

250
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,339
to ripple throughout time.

251
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,141
So how much time do we have to stop it?

252
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,243
Isn't traveling to that particular time

253
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,012
precisely what Rex Tyler
told us not to do?

254
00:12:56,014 --> 00:13:00,383
Well, what's the alternative?
We let New York blow up?

255
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,268
It's not like there are
Time Masters left to stop it.

256
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,355
Miss Lance is right, we are history's
last line of defense.

257
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:06,606
I like the sound of that.

258
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,908
I'd rather die than speak German.

259
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:16,199
Best case scenario, let's assume
that Mr. Tyler is wrong

260
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,803
and we all end up not dying in 1942.

261
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:25,091
What if, in endeavoring to
save New York, we make things worse?

262
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:27,260
What could be worse
than a genocidal fascist

263
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,962
nuclear-armed super power?

264
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,331
Relax, Captain.

265
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,099
We got this.

266
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,937
Gideon, I need you to pull
up everything you can

267
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,689
on the target in 1942.

268
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,442
I assume that by
"target" you mean Damien Darhk.

269
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,560
You are finally getting the hang

270
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,729
of this whole revenge thing.

271
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,231
All right, so we know that
he was alive during 1942,

272
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,867
so we just need to know where he is.

273
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:55,238
According to a 1942 FBI file,
the target was spotted here.

274
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,709
Hope I'm not interrupting.

275
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:03,630
No, just reading up on 1942.

276
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:07,300
You've been spending a lot
of time down here lately, alone.

277
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,836
Am I not allowed in the library?

278
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:12,555
Ah, you just never
struck me as a book worm.

279
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,842
I'm just making sure that you're not

280
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,761
holding onto anything.

281
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,179
I-I know a thing or two about grief,

282
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:20,513
so if you ever want
to talk about Laurel...

283
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:24,484
Then I know where to
find you. Thank you.

284
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,273
Miss Lance. Any luck pinpointing

285
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:32,776
the epicenter of
the temporal aberration?

286
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:33,597
No.

287
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,895
Perhaps these news reports
will prove useful.

288
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,075
Oh, that's good news,

289
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,599
even though we get nuked,
we still win the war.

290
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:42,035
Look at the date, Dr. Palmer.

291
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:44,087
In this version of history
World War II lasts

292
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,205
two more years.

293
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:48,091
And claims 12 million more lives.

294
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:49,392
Including Albert Einstein.

295
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,877
Actually, Einstein went missing

296
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,379
just prior to the attack on New York.

297
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:56,683
Wait. W-wait.

298
00:14:56,685 --> 00:15:01,438
Perhaps these two events
aren't merely coincidental.

299
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,474
Think about it, a Nobel Prize
winning physicist goes missing.

300
00:15:04,476 --> 00:15:06,476
And miraculously,
the Germans get the bomb

301
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:07,410
three years ahead of us.

302
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:08,978
They must've kidnapped Einstein,

303
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,114
forced him to build them an A-bomb,

304
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:16,402
which means the only way
for us to fix the aberration...

305
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:17,787
Is for us to kidnap him first.

306
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,290
Yes! Ha!

307
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:23,209
Gideon, please chart a course
for New York City, 1942.

308
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:26,212
Oh, my God.

309
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:28,631
I can't believe I'm going to meet...

310
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,468
Albert Einstein.

311
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,419
I can't believe you're
making me stay on the ship.

312
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,628
Mm. I'm asking you to stay
on the ship, Mr. Jackson.

313
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,786
While the rest of you
get to have all the fun

314
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,800
battling Nazis.

315
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,074
You're the only one that I trust

316
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,264
to give the time drive
a long overdue tune up.

317
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:47,100
And build the time library
and modify the bridge

318
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:49,319
and half the other 100 things
you've been getting me to do.

319
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,070
All right, give me your tools then.

320
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:52,605
- What?
- Pack up your tools

321
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,774
- and give 'em to me.
- Why would I do that?

322
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:55,981
Well, I'm gonna give 'em to Mr. Rory

323
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,361
to see if he wants to
be the ship's mechanic.

324
00:15:58,363 --> 00:15:59,562
You see, that's not funny.

325
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,997
Quite right, because in the event

326
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,500
that we can't stop
this nuclear explosion,

327
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:07,453
a fully functioning time drive
is going to come in handy.

328
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:17,239
_

329
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,383
So how do we find Einstein in
a city of 7 million people?

330
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:22,051
Well, we just look for the physicist

331
00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,804
with the crazy white hair.
I mean the other one.

332
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,389
According to Gideon, there's
a cocktail party

333
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,440
at Columbia this evening.

334
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:28,441
Cocktail party?

335
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,226
Means booze. Where is it?

336
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:31,477
At Columbia, I just...

337
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,980
Why does no one ever listen to me?

338
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,817
Hey, where you going?

339
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:39,903
I have a grandfather that's in the FBI.

340
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,988
I figured I'd check in
in case we need backup.

341
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,041
Oh. Good plan.

342
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,994
Hey!

343
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,412
Where do you think you're going?

344
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:52,165
Follow Sara, in case she needs backup.

345
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,168
Oh, God.

346
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,341
Take me to Conway and 5th.

347
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,109
Oh, jeez.

348
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:24,163
Never been to a nerd party before.

349
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,165
You mean a physics symposium.

350
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,585
- Nerd party.
- Keep your eyes open.

351
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:30,703
We're sure to be in the
company of German spies.

352
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:39,012
Th-th-that's him.

353
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,630
Good evening, ladies.

354
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,383
The greatest mind
the world has ever known.

355
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,972
I am merely
demonstrating Newton's third law.

356
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:54,143
"For every action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction."

357
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:56,729
Ha ha! I like him.

358
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,281
He's a pig.

359
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:02,151
I just found our spies.

360
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:04,537
- Them?
- Notice their uniforms.

361
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,540
The stitching on the lapels,
it's exquisite.

362
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,826
- You mean to say fake.
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,833
Surprise. Surprise.

364
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:52,585
How long have you been following me?

365
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:54,420
How long have you been following Darhk?

366
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,842
Shut your mouth, Ray. We got company.

367
00:18:59,844 --> 00:19:02,512
Guten Abend, mein Herren.

368
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:04,630
- Are they speaking...
- German.

369
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:15,725
The extraction team is on the move.

370
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:18,611
Let me talk, I speak "physicist."

371
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,064
Oh, Herr Professor,
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

372
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,699
- Who are you?
- My colleague and I

373
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,734
were just having a rather
spirited debate

374
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,536
about your theory of relativity.

375
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:29,455
Perhaps you can help us settle it.

376
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,574
I was this close to getting them both

377
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,292
to come back to my room.

378
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:35,411
Well, what about your wife?

379
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:40,666
The one who died or the one
who divorced me 30 years ago?

380
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,252
Come on, it's time to go.

381
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,546
_

382
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,589
_

383
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:51,714
_

384
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:55,240
_

385
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,036
_

386
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,450
_

387
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,357
You don't have to speak
German to know what "uranium" means.

388
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:04,668
So what?

389
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,670
Even Einstein can't build
a bomb without fuel.

390
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,778
Darhk must be the one
supplying the Nazis.

391
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,914
Damien Darhk murdered my sister in 2016.

392
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,001
If I take him out here in 1942...

393
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,031
You save her.

394
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,955
I've been waiting six months
to get this son of a bitch.

395
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:20,590
You're gonna have to wait
a little while longer.

396
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:21,929
We gotta let him go.

397
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,127
Until we get our hands
on the uranium he's selling,

398
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,879
New York City's hanging in the balance.

399
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:29,932
I really hate you sometimes, Ray.

400
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,804
What do you two think you're doing?

401
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:35,833
We have to get you out of here,

402
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:36,905
your life is in danger.

403
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,526
This is why I never travel
without my security detail.

404
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,645
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

405
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,324
We might not look like it,
but we're the good guys.

406
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:58,211
Why should I believe that
you are really a physicist?

407
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:01,881
Because for every action...

408
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:04,133
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

409
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,353
So how'd it go with Einstein?

410
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:15,276
Depends on who you ask.

411
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:18,479
But apparently the professor
has one hell of a right hook.

412
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:20,782
Seriously? Grey punched him out?

413
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:22,867
Yeah, he's sleeping it off in the brig.

414
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,179
So can we get the hell out of 1942 now?

415
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:26,904
It looks like. Gideon?

416
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,157
I'm afraid not, Miss Lance.

417
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,826
But without Einstein's
help, the Nazis...

418
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,961
Still manage to destroy New York City

419
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:35,546
with an atomic blast.

420
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,632
The historical
aberration remains unchanged.

421
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:40,418
How is that possible?

422
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,836
The Nazis must've gotten the bomb

423
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:44,972
from someone other than Einstein.

424
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:54,265
Guten Morgen.

425
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:02,190
What is this? Some sort of prison?

426
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:04,108
What am I doing in here?

427
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,777
Good question.

428
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,278
I'm sorry, I never had the opportunity

429
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,248
to introduce myself.
I'm Professor Martin Stein,

430
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,785
just like "Einstein" minus the "Ein."

431
00:22:13,787 --> 00:22:16,621
There's just so much I'd
like to discuss with you,

432
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:19,791
such as your paper
on unified field theory.

433
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,492
I have not yet published

434
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:24,284
my paper on unified field theory!

435
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,631
Who are you? Why have you abducted me?

436
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:28,266
The guys at the party wanted you to make

437
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:30,518
an atomic bomb for "ze Fuhrer."

438
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,803
No.

439
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:34,689
Not even a man as mad as Adolph Hitler

440
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,808
would want to create
such a terrible weapon.

441
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,111
You yourself once said
that two things are infinite...

442
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:42,647
The universe and human stupidity.

443
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,399
And you are living proof of the latter.

444
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,118
He just called you stupid.

445
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,570
Now, open this door and let me out!

446
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:52,123
We will, soon. I promise.

447
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,709
We saved you from the Nazis.

448
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:57,662
The least you could do
is help us save New York.

449
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,547
From what?

450
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,884
From some theoretical attack?

451
00:23:02,886 --> 00:23:06,888
Some eventuality that not even
I could have predicted?

452
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,173
The only way you...

453
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,190
Mein Gott.

454
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,574
_

455
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,683
Yes, obviously you know.

456
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,985
I deduced it, Herr Doktor.

457
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:24,155
Perhaps you could
deduce how the Germans managed

458
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:26,574
- to create a nuclear bomb...
- Atomic.

459
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,226
When you are the only man on Earth

460
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,494
capable of performing such a feat.

461
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,950
Ja. That is correct.

462
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:38,870
I am the only man.

463
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:42,623
Wait a minute. You saying
there's some lady

464
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,542
out there that can make an atomic bomb?

465
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:47,712
Wunderbar. Why am I talking to him

466
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:50,431
when you are clearly
the brains of the operation?

467
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:54,302
You ex-wife is also a physicist.

468
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:57,555
Without Mileva's help,
I would still be working

469
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:00,942
as a patent clerk in Vienna.

470
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:03,728
So, while we were busy

471
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,563
safeguarding Professor Einstein...

472
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:07,648
The Nazis were busy kidnapping his ex.

473
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,150
Her name is Mileva Maric,

474
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,902
she's a fellow nuclear physicist.

475
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:13,070
Who, let me guess,
had no one guarding her.

476
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,907
Yes, Einstein's
collaborations with Ms. Maric

477
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,075
were a closely guarded secret
between the two of them.

478
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:20,077
A secret that the Germans
apparently knew,

479
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,497
so unless we can determine
where they're keeping her

480
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,049
while she manufactures their bomb...

481
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:26,355
If I had to guess,

482
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,002
I'd say she's with Damien
Darhk's uranium.

483
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,837
Damien Darhk? As in...

484
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,555
The man who murdered your sister.

485
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,557
How is Damien Darhk

486
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,643
even alive in 1942?

487
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:38,596
Thanks to the
Lazarus Pit, he hardly ages.

488
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,564
Sara's kind of an expert
on Damien Darhk.

489
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,850
- Drop it, Ray.
- I'm sorry,

490
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:44,318
but while you were all saving Einstein,

491
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,070
Sara was off on her own
secret side mission

492
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:47,521
to kill Laurel's killer in the past.

493
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:48,773
And I suppose you never thought

494
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,191
about saving your fiancée?

495
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:51,909
Yeah, of course I did,
but I never did it,

496
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:52,994
because it's against the rules.

497
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:54,217
What rules?

498
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,997
We're not Time Masters,
there are no rules.

499
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,198
Well, if there were, there'd
certainly be one

500
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,699
about lying to your team.

501
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:00,084
Listen to yourself.

502
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:01,969
Look, we get it, you're perfect.

503
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,338
Always the Boy Scout,
aren't you, Raymond?

504
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,623
Yeah, well, I could say the same thing

505
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,842
about you being an assassin.

506
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:09,844
Well, if we're being honest,

507
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,595
then let me get something
off of my chest.

508
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,047
Let's all just take a
deep breath, shall we?

509
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,050
You think that
you're such a big hero, Ray?

510
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,601
Without that fancy suit

511
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:20,805
you're nothing but a
self-righteous rich guy.

512
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:24,358
Maybe you're right...
but without my suit

513
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,310
there's no way of finding
Einstein's ex-wife,

514
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,862
or Damien Darhk for that matter.

515
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:29,730
Sorry, what are you saying?

516
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:32,650
That anyone who spends a lot
of time around uranium...

517
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:34,869
In this case Damien Darhk...
Picks up trace amounts

518
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:37,571
of radiation, which my suit can track.

519
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:43,327
And lead us straight to
the Nazis' nuclear bomb.

520
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:52,169
Beautiful work, Mileva.

521
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:55,089
Dr. Einstein should never
have let you get away.

522
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:58,342
I did what you want. Now let me go.

523
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:01,178
Actually, we still have need of you.

524
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,683
This thing didn't exactly
come with an owner's manual.

525
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:09,687
Get her and the bomb onboard.

526
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,117
We can't allow them
to get that bomb onboard.

527
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,086
- What about Mileva?
- Don't worry, Doctor,

528
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:26,420
we'll be sure to keep her safe,

529
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,205
but we must secure the nuclear bomb...

530
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:30,007
- Atomic.
- About to be placed

531
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:32,843
aboard a Nazis submarine.
This is no time for subtlety.

532
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,295
Agreed.

533
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:36,680
Let's make sure we all follow the plan.

534
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,299
Let's just get this done.

535
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,142
Step away from the lady and the bomb!

536
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:49,276
Final warning!

537
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,562
Schnell! Toten sie!

538
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:55,399
I love roasting Nazis!

539
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,484
Mein Gott!

540
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,420
We need to get Miss Maric to safety!

541
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:19,223
Sara!

542
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,145
Get down.

543
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:35,539
Interesting technique.
League of Assassins, am I right?

544
00:27:38,444 --> 00:27:40,945
I've been waiting a long time for this.

545
00:27:40,947 --> 00:27:42,496
Long time? For what?

546
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:46,050
- To kill you.
- Try to you mean.

547
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,509
Dr. Palmer, let's take precautions.

548
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,179
And disable the bomb? Already on it.

549
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:05,219
Uh, guys, a little problem here.

550
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,221
Suit's not as radiation-proof
as I thought.

551
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:09,890
Sara! Fall back!

552
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,822
Uh, guys, actually a big problem.

553
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,291
Haircut! Watch out!

554
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,232
Mick, look out!

555
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,007
Fall back!

556
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,676
Sara!

557
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:47,761
Mr. Rory's injured, Dr.
Palmer is incapacitated,

558
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:49,680
we need to fall back now!

559
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:55,252
Firestorm, cover Dr. Palmer and Sara.

560
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:18,377
Okay, Mick's on the mend
and Einstein and his ex

561
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:21,047
are safe and sound
with the security detail.

562
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:23,549
Thank you, Jax.

563
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,001
But the Nazis still have the nuke.

564
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:26,385
What are we doing leaving New York?

565
00:29:26,387 --> 00:29:27,837
Because the Nazis still have a nuke,

566
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,839
which we saw being loaded
onto a U-boat.

567
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:31,424
They're gonna hit
New York from underwater.

568
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,226
Yeah, I'm tracking the uranium signature

569
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:35,344
recorded by Dr. Palmer's
suit, but before we engage the Nazis

570
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,597
I need you to make these modifications.

571
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,182
Really? Is now the time
for me to be playing mechanic?

572
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,567
Look, I know that you consider

573
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:42,635
the chores that I've been assigning you

574
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,270
to be a waste of time,
Jefferson, but believe me,

575
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:45,855
they're more than just an exercise.

576
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,077
What's the subliminal variance
of the quantum manifold?

577
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,446
- Two microns.
- And if one wanted

578
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,665
to divert power from the axial array?

579
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:58,751
Can't be done, you'd have to go
through the clavian adjunct.

580
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,786
Mm-hmm.

581
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,090
All of the stuff
you've been having me do,

582
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:06,008
you've been teaching me
about the Waverider.

583
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,543
I'm a time traveler, Jefferson.

584
00:30:07,545 --> 00:30:09,045
I spend most of my time
thinking about the future,

585
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:13,182
specifically my own, and...

586
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:15,685
it occurs to me that
that future might not involve

587
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:18,054
me being aboard this ship,
and I need someone

588
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:19,772
to know its secrets in my absence.

589
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:23,225
Hmm, nice try, dude, but
you're not quitting on us.

590
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,812
What's a "Timescatter"?

591
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:30,983
Hmm? Uh, a last ditch option,

592
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:34,120
and one that I pray we
will never have to use.

593
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:55,808
Ah. We going swimming or something?

594
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,311
I'm tracking the Nazis U-boat.

595
00:30:58,313 --> 00:30:59,762
Where is it now?

596
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:03,065
It's close.

597
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:12,011
_

598
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,769
_

599
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:15,136
_

600
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:22,084
They've knocked out our
telemetry, Captain.

601
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:24,787
- What's going on?
- As you can see, the Waverider

602
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:27,340
is ill suited for underwater combat.

603
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:29,375
I'm trying to bypass the
tertiary subsystem array.

604
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:31,127
Make it fast, haircut.

605
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,723
Yes!

606
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,276
Is the weapon ready?

607
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:49,028
Yes, Herr Darhk.

608
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,479
Fire!

609
00:31:58,122 --> 00:31:59,238
What was that?

610
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,823
They're not firing on us.

611
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,076
It's the nuclear bomb.

612
00:32:04,078 --> 00:32:05,327
Atomic.

613
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,213
Whatever it is, we gotta stop it.

614
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:09,999
I fear that there is only
one way to do that.

615
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:16,238
Okay, I don't know what
you wanted me to do,

616
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,758
- but I did it.
- Excellent work, Jax.

617
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
- What's going on?
- I am piloting us

618
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,511
on a collision course with the torpedo,

619
00:32:22,513 --> 00:32:25,765
Now, with any luck it will
hit us before New York City.

620
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,103
How is that lucky?

621
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:33,022
Can the Waverider handle the blast?

622
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,575
Honestly, I have absolutely no idea.

623
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:41,697
Which is why... I'm doing this.

624
00:32:46,587 --> 00:32:48,003
Where is everybody?

625
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:49,872
The appropriate question is when.

626
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:52,591
Other the last few months
I've implemented a safeguard

627
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:55,094
in case of a catastrophe. A
high burst of temporal energy

628
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,813
has scattered our team
throughout history.

629
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,049
I knew you never liked me.

630
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm afraid, injured as you are,

631
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:03,469
you wouldn't survive
the rigors of time travel,

632
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:06,021
which is why... I'm doing this.

633
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,442
Gideon, how much time do we have?

634
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:10,860
30 seconds, Captain.

635
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:31,630
Gideon?

636
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,048
I'm here, Captain.

637
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:37,753
You always are.

638
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,785
Okay, there's just one question

639
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:56,836
that you haven't answered.

640
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:59,155
Where's Captain Hunter?

641
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:02,508
I don't know. Must
have time-scattered himself

642
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,794
like the rest of them.

643
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,897
Guess I gotta play hero and find them.

644
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:10,650
Do you even think this ship still flies?

645
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,937
I don't see why not. Fridge works.

646
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:15,355
I don't have time to time travel,

647
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:17,557
but if your team is stuck in history,

648
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,726
who better to help find
them than a historian?

649
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:24,030
This guy?

650
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:27,283
Without Dr. Heywood
you'd still be in stasis.

651
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:30,620
Ah. Good point.

652
00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:32,538
Library, this way.

653
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,291
Hey, wait. Time out.

654
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,577
This was supposed to
be a salvage mission.

655
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,329
Who are you kidding? You've been waiting

656
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,597
your whole life for a chance like this.

657
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:53,226
Well, I-I did some digging, but I think

658
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:54,727
I finally got a lead on Ray Palmer.

659
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,145
Uh-huh.

660
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,434
Are you, uh, sure you know
how to fly this thing?

661
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:03,152
Let's find out.

662
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:10,777
Maybe you should slow down?

663
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,862
Maybe you should shut up and strap in.

664
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,749
I can't believe this.

665
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:18,534
We're about to travel through time!

666
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:20,753
Did I tell you about the side effects?

667
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:23,289
What side effects?

668
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:55,138
Oh!

669
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,573
Mick! Buddy!

670
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,158
- How'd you find me?
- I didn't.

671
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,411
Pretty did.

672
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,495
Is he okay?

673
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:05,214
Side effects of time travel.

674
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:08,167
Speaking of, you're never gonna believe

675
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,620
where the rest of your team ended up.

676
00:36:16,177 --> 00:36:19,145
This festival is boring.

677
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:22,432
Bring me my wizards!

678
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,602
My liege, how may we entertain you?

679
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:30,189
Do you wish to gaze into my
magic mirror, Your Majesty?

680
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,743
I grow bored of your tricks.

681
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,611
Off with their heads.

682
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:37,413
- What?
- You little brat.

683
00:36:37,415 --> 00:36:42,368
This is incredible. An actual
medieval execution?

684
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,871
I never imagined I'd
see this with my own eyes.

685
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:45,872
Who... Who's that?

686
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:47,256
The new guy.

687
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:48,875
- New guy, duck!
- Hiyah!

688
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:53,379
I'm Dr. Heywood, I heard
so much about you.

689
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,547
Hey, how about we get to know each other

690
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,765
- back on the ship?
- Okay.

691
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,383
But first we have to find Sara.

692
00:36:58,436 --> 00:36:59,886
Vile witch!

693
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:02,054
You have corrupted
the women of our village!

694
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:05,525
In my defense, they were
happily corrupted.

695
00:37:06,778 --> 00:37:09,562
Hang the witch! Hang the witch!

696
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,315
Hang the witch! Hang the witch!

697
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,719
You must be Sara Lance.

698
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,623
Oh! whoa, whoa, it's okay. He's with us.

699
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:23,159
Hey.

700
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,745
Is she always this violent?

701
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:29,132
I'm sorry, but so far I haven't
been able to detect

702
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:32,251
any historical alteration
that would indicate

703
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:35,972
Mr. Hunter was stranded in a time.

704
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,424
Uh, why don't we ask Gideon where he is?

705
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,926
Who's Gideon?

706
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:41,511
Greetings, Dr. Heywood.

707
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:43,596
I am the ship's
artificial consciousness.

708
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:46,732
Gideon, we need you
to tell us where Rip is.

709
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,768
I'm afraid I have no idea,

710
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,771
but I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.

711
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,407
Final message?

712
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,409
Sorry for stranding
you all throughout history,

713
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:58,611
but it was the only way to save you.

714
00:37:59,697 --> 00:38:01,781
Well, you know what they say,

715
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:05,751
Captain must never abandon his ship.

716
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:07,570
Well, neither shall I abandon hope

717
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:11,624
of seeing you all again
someday, somewhere in time.

718
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:14,093
As flawed and unruly as
you are individually,

719
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,628
together you are the best crew,

720
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,632
the best team a captain
could ever hope for.

721
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,553
So...

722
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:25,938
stick together.

723
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,941
And remember,

724
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:32,612
history is yours now, my dear Legends.

725
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:39,886
Good luck.

726
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:49,183
So, what do we do now?

727
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,636
We drink.

728
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,520
It's not like we were
exactly Time Masters, even with Rip.

729
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:55,739
But I think he knew that one day

730
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:57,991
we might have to do this without him.

731
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,277
And we all heard his
message. He wanted us to keep going.

732
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:02,329
Weave to keep going.
There's a rogue time traveler

733
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:03,530
out there somewhere.

734
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:05,949
Yeah, a time nemesis whose idea of fun

735
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,834
is helping Damien Darhk and the Nazis

736
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:09,536
blow up New York City.

737
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,588
What's to stop them from
going back in time

738
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,457
and kidnapping Einstein
and his ex-wife again?

739
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:14,875
We can't be everywhere at once.

740
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:17,177
But you can safeguard the Einsteins.

741
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:20,130
Safeguard the Einsteins?

742
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:22,799
How?

743
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:26,687
By making one slight
alteration to history.

744
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:30,597
_

745
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:32,859
We'd like to talk to Mr. Einstein. CIA.

746
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:37,064
He means OSS. This is related
to the Manhattan Project.

747
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:38,665
You're headed to Columbia
University, right,

748
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,150
- for the symphony?
- Symposium.

749
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:41,702
- Same thing.
- Once you're there,

750
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,153
we're gonna need you
to publicly announce

751
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:45,155
that Miss Mileva Maric
has been your silent partner

752
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:46,467
for over 30 years.

753
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,458
You see, acknowledgment
of Mileva's contributions

754
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,743
is the only way to keep her safe.

755
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:51,912
Besides, it's the right thing to do.

756
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:53,914
Don't be a jerk.

757
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:58,802
Today I want to tell you about
a very special woman,

758
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:03,640
my longtime collaborator, Mileva Maric.

759
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,212
What does that mean?

760
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:10,764
Krauts won't be able to get to her?

761
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:12,933
Yes, and then people won't say,

762
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:15,102
"Hey, you're a regular Einstein."

763
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,522
They'll say, "You're
like one of the Einsteins."

764
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:20,407
That's so crazy.

765
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:23,327
I can't believe we just changed history.

766
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:28,165
No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.

767
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:35,455
You promised no trouble, Herr Darhk.

768
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:38,792
And you promised me competency.

769
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:41,428
Perhaps we'll have
better luck with the next bomb.

770
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,964
That's cute, but
there won't be a next bomb.

771
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:47,267
You see, my partner wants
to move on to other things.

772
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,987
But your partner isn't here, is he?

773
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,782
According to who?

774
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,237
Hello, Eobard.

775
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,989
Mr. Darhk.

776
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:13,794
Ah, how'd it go with Einstein?

777
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:16,163
Good, until someone
gives the Confederate Army

778
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:18,665
machine guns or breaks
Mozart's fingers, or...

779
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,884
One aberration at a time.

780
00:41:20,886 --> 00:41:23,420
Hey, remember that thing
that I said before

781
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:24,971
about you being a...

782
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:28,508
Billionaire Boy
Scout? You weren't all wrong.

783
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,012
Yeah, but... you're more than that.

784
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:34,147
Thanks.

785
00:41:34,149 --> 00:41:38,769
And we'll get justice
for Laurel, Sara, promise.

786
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:42,239
What do you guys say we get outta 1942?

787
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:45,359
Not until you answer a few questions.

788
00:41:46,563 --> 00:41:48,362
We're the Justice Society of America.

789
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,263
And you're coming with us.

790
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:05,041
