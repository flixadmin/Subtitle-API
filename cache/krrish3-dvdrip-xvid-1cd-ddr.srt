1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,167
This tale began with the birth
of a mentally challenged boy, Rohit.

2
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,438
As years went by, his physical
growth continued unhindered...

3
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,770
but his mental age
remained that of a child.

4
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,202
The way he spoke,
his habits, everything...

5
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,547
But he had to pay a
price for his innocence.

6
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,345
Everyone makes fun of me.

7
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,457
lf you don't help me, then who will?

8
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,417
You are so powerful.

9
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:48,590
Please God, please can you
give me a little bit of your power?

10
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,734
And, one night,
a space-ship landed in Kasauli.

11
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,705
Rohit found Jaadu...

12
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,504
and his life turned into bliss.

13
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,507
Jaadu blessed Rohit
with amazing powers...

14
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,478
...and that transformed
him completely.

15
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,350
Rohit's fame spread far and wide.

16
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,718
One day he received
a special invitation...

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,253
...to visit Singapore
for some research.

18
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,222
The invitatioh was sent
by the fannmous Dr. rSidddhant Arya.

19
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,658
Mr. Rohit Mehra,
l'm sorry to keep you waiting.

20
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,387
Unfortunately Sonia
Mehra lost both her...

21
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,262
son Rohit and daughter-in-law
Nisha forever...

22
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,532
and her grandson Krishna
became her reason to live.

23
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:30,239
But, she was so scared by
Krishna's baffling super powers that

24
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,369
she took him away to
a remote and unknown location.

25
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,340
But Destiny chose the path of love...

26
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,473
Krishna followed his love,
Priya, to Singapore...

27
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,412
where he learnt the
shocking truth that...

28
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,513
his father Dr. Rohit Mehra was alive.

29
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,360
And was being held captive by Dr.
Siddhant Arya since many years.

30
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,221
Tinnme saw Krishna
create a hew history.

31
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,997
With a broken piece of a mask...

32
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,962
...that he donned in
the midst of a circus fire.

33
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,702
And, this led to the birth of...

34
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,898
a protector, a friend, a superhero

35
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,632
Krrish!

36
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,028
Kaal's experiment is a success.

37
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,901
Now, this virus...

38
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,736
will mark the beginning...

39
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,032
of the end of humanity.

40
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,473
Thahk you, Jaadu.

41
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,418
l have now understood your secret
of harnessing the power of sunlight.

42
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,953
lf this experiment is successful...

43
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,055
it will usher in a new beginning...

44
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,721
for this world, for all mankind.

45
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,496
Just 10 more minutes.

46
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,502
Papa? What happened?

47
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,807
ls everything alright?

48
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,745
Of course.

49
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,611
l am also fine!

50
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,648
And everything is also fine!

51
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,716
ln fact, l am so excited that...

52
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,718
Papa?

53
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,514
Oh , sorry for waking you up.

54
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,682
But, it's just 9 minutes to sunrise.

55
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,089
Come on,
you have to come up to the lab.

56
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,025
Come on! - Yes, papa.

57
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,594
C'mon!

58
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,995
lt should all work today!

59
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,024
l have tweaked the
formation to perfection.

60
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,468
My calculations should
not go wrong today.

61
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,548
Wow, papa!

62
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,739
What's all this?

63
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,179
My years of hardwork...

64
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,981
and endeavour.

65
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,558
Because life originates in light.

66
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,619
Light gives life.

67
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,593
And, l think l have finally...

68
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,531
managed to create the
perfect combination...

69
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,666
to multiply the energy of light...

70
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,258
by using mirrors to reflect it.

71
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,201
This nnmag.ical connmbination
is nnaturahhy ppresent in natureu.

72
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,541
But, unfortunately we cannot see it.

73
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:34,536
Hence, l have invented this pen...

74
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,608
which is actually
an electronic device.

75
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,277
Whenever it's in the presence
of such a combination...

76
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,854
it gets activated
and starts beeping...

77
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,189
And then,
it consolidates and multiplies...

78
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,960
all the light beams and
concentrates it on a subject.

79
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,793
And, manifests the life
giving properties of light.

80
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,894
You mean, the rays of the sun will...

81
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,629
revive this dead plant?

82
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,300
What?

83
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,038
But that's impossible!

84
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,632
What do you mean?
Of course it's possible!

85
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,869
lt will, l am certain.

86
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,571
Fingers crossed, cross them!

87
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,550
Papa, the sun...

88
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,062
The ppeh has been activated.

89
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,040
This means... the placement
of all the mirrors is correct.

90
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,734
The formation is absoluteehy right.

91
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,769
The power of the
energy is far too much.

92
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,737
l have to think of something.

93
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,334
l must do something.

94
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,177
Perhaps, we need to build a filter...

95
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,805
that passes just the
right amount of radiance...

96
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,180
and absorbs the rest of the energy.

97
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,753
You mean...

98
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,151
a filter with a brain, papa?

99
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,918
Correct. A filter with a brain!

100
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:38,895
Easy, l will build it.

101
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,029
And then you'll see.

102
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,463
This experiment will
change face of solar energy.

103
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,101
What are you staring at?
Don't you have work today?

104
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,234
Come on, time to go to office!

105
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,444
A filter with a brain.

106
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,941
Easy, l'll do it.

107
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,242
Krishna!

108
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,753
Ready, papa.

109
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,357
Hmm... smart you're looking.

110
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,459
Thahk you.

111
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,931
Did you fix the tyre that
someone punctured yesterday?

112
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:19,864
Yeah, no...

113
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,132
the thing is...

114
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,104
Where the hell is Priya?

115
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,197
Priya!

116
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,767
l am coming!

117
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,346
Ready, papa.

118
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,811
Sure.

119
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,212
Get dressed, first.

120
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,375
l am ready.

121
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,780
Are you sure?

122
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,776
l was only touching up...

123
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,879
l will finish it up in the car.

124
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,522
Puncture!

125
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,496
Look.

126
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,938
Yeah.

127
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,774
Wow!

128
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,245
Now you look perfectly ready!

129
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,338
l am also ready.

130
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,286
Okay, since we are all ready,
let's go paint the town red.

131
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,018
Red?

132
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,420
Don't you have to go
work at the TV channel today?

133
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,490
l have to.

134
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,193
But, after a quick
visit to the parlour.

135
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:22,927
Alright Krishna.

136
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,093
Your office is here.

137
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,101
Oh, actually my new
office is a little ahead.

138
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,231
lf you take the next right...

139
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,330
...then again the right
after the first left...

140
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,433
you will reach the security agency,
that's my new office.

141
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,079
Even the Air lndia job?

142
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,841
Hurry up! l am getting late!

143
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,378
Don't change the topic.

144
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,577
What happened this time?

145
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,980
l know what happened.

146
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,054
What?

147
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,022
When the clients must be
coming to book their air tickets...

148
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,593
he must have been in the air!

149
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,987
Hence, the airline
authorities must have...

150
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,357
permanently grounded him.

151
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,589
And told him to take off for good.

152
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,457
Correct?

153
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,261
Right, papa.

154
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,334
That is exactly what happened.

155
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,901
Very good.

156
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,295
l'm proud of you.

157
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,830
That's it. Right there. Stop.

158
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,269
This is my neww officee.

159
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,933
You work at SlS?

160
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,877
Oh husband, come here.

161
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,543
Yes, wife?

162
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,482
l am going to leave
the studio at 4:30 pm.

163
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,319
You have to meet me at 5:00 pm sharp.

164
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,150
l hope you haven't forgotten.

165
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,050
Yes.

166
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,052
lf you are late again, Mr. Mehra...

167
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,993
maybe you'll get fired
from being a husband too...

168
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,364
l know. Bye.

169
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,990
Bye.

170
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,563
Alright, papa.

171
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,268
Where should l drop you off?

172
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,371
What do you mean?

173
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,268
l haven't been sacked, yet.

174
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,167
Drop me off at the lab as always.

175
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,147
We shall overcome...

176
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,245
We shall overcome...

177
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,649
Krishna...
Kripal... you both have been fired.

178
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,387
Here's your termination letter...

179
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,191
and here's yours.

180
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,635
What's wrong?

181
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,609
Shrunk from a football
to a tennis ball?

182
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,378
Yesterday, when those four robbers
broke into the jewellery store...

183
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,479
you disappeared!

184
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,078
Are you really surprised
they fired you?

185
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,013
But, you also?

186
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,591
Well, even l ran.

187
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,286
But l ran away, so l could come back.

188
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,621
What do you mean?

189
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,658
l mean...

190
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,332
what are you all staring at?

191
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,264
We have been sacked...

192
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,960
but you still have jobs to do.

193
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,504
Get going. - Okay.

194
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,072
You don't understand.

195
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,634
Yesterday, after l ran off.

196
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,002
l mean, left...

197
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,039
who entered the store?

198
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,472
Who?

199
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,641
Who entered?

200
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,383
Krrish!

201
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,247
Correct!

202
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,649
Understood the secret?

203
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,126
What's my full name?

204
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,497
Kripal Sharma.

205
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,363
Yes, take the Kri of Kripal.

206
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,128
Kri.

207
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,203
And the Sh of Sharma.

208
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:12,599
Sh.

209
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,070
Put them together, what do you get?

210
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,037
Krrish.

211
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:16,633
You?

212
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,441
Not so loud.

213
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,173
lf anyone hears, a crowd will gather.

214
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,249
People will ask for autographs,
you know what l mean...

215
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,044
You still think l am wrong.

216
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,086
Right?

217
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,354
Height!

218
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,182
Krrish is quite tall.

219
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,987
And you are...

220
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,685
One has to adjust things, my friend.

221
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,021
Tall, when a fight is on.

222
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,429
But l like to be small on duty.

223
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,658
Never mind, you won't get it.

224
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,467
That's the style of us supermen.

225
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,136
And, you are a mere common man.

226
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,230
Go ahead and find a job
that you might be good at.

227
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,171
Correct?

228
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,105
Breaking news from Mumbai.

229
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,177
The front landing
gear of flight AKA 101...

230
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,249
coming in from Delhi
to Mumbai is jammed.

231
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,376
All the attempts of the pilot
to extend it have been futile.

232
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:06,456
Failure to lock down the landing
gear can cause a crash landing.

233
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,651
This can prove fatal
to all the passengers...

234
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,059
...and the crew present
in the aircraft.

235
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,089
See? Duty calls. l must go.

236
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,099
'And, we'll keep updating you about
it, time to time.' - Where did he go?

237
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,272
Mumbai Control. AKA 101...

238
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,272
waiting for instructions.

239
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,240
AKA 101...

240
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:29,513
we have cleared runway
2-7 for emergency landing...

241
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,116
you are cleared to land.

242
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,115
Best of Luck.

243
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,686
Sir, landing without an
extended nose landing gear...

244
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,520
can cause the plane to skid...

245
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,714
it can even explode.

246
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,622
We don't have any other option.

247
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,058
We have run out of fuel.

248
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,396
We have to take this chance.

249
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,632
Pay Attention, please keep
your seat belts fastened...

250
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,668
and take brace position for landing.

251
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,066
What did he say?

252
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,199
What's happening?

253
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,330
Looks like something is really wrong.

254
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,596
What's going on?

255
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,846
Mom, we are going to be fine?

256
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,190
God, Please help us. Please...

257
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,666
Bravo, Krrish.

258
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,309
Super job, Krrish.

259
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,583
We have safely landed.

260
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,393
Krrish!

261
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,864
Look mum, Krrish! - What? Where?

262
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,435
An eppiddemic of ah unknowh
virus has brokeun out ih lNamibia.

263
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,637
Disturbing images of
the virus outbreak have...

264
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,408
...just come in from
the city of Gobabis.

265
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,370
Our correspondent is currently
at the local office...

266
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,031
...of the lnternational
Health Council...

267
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,876
waiting for a statement from Dr.
Varun Shetty...

268
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,377
...Regional Director of the WHO.

269
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,911
On my return from
Namibia this morning...

270
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,543
l have immediately briefed
senior members of the lHC...

271
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,883
about the current
state of this outbreak.

272
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,482
This virus needs to be
contained as soon as possible.

273
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,562
Otherwise the consequences would be,
would be catastrophic.

274
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,521
lnfected samples of blood have
been dispatched to distinguished...

275
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,566
...scientists and doctors
in all parts of the world.

276
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,835
We need,
we need all the help possible...

277
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,564
...in coming out with an antidote.

278
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,098
lt is now quite clear that
the Namibia crisis is escalating.

279
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,503
Our channel has set
up a toll free emergency...

280
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,739
...help line for any
virus related information.

281
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,043
Hello, Yes, Dr. Shetty?

282
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,482
Dr. Mehra, l am sure you must have...

283
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,554
...heard about the
life threatening virus...

284
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,522
that is creating panic in Namibia.

285
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,420
Yes, we just saw it on TV...

286
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,485
Dr. Shetty, how long does it take for
the symptoms of this virus to show?

287
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,564
What is the incubation period?

288
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,800
People start exhibiting
the symptoms within...

289
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,661
...5 seconds to 5 minutes of contact.

290
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,138
This virus is sppreadihg
rappiddly through air ahd wwater.

291
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,436
We have sent the
blood samples of the...

292
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,876
...infected people
to several labs worldwide.

293
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,173
You will receive it too.

294
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,742
And, l am really hopeful that...

295
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,947
you will be successful
in coming up with a solution.

296
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,949
That's why,
you are my last hope, Dr. Mehra.

297
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,418
Please, do something.

298
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,047
l will give it my all, Dr Shetty.
l'll try my best.

299
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:54,795
Hello.

300
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,558
Hello, Dr. Shetty?

301
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,859
Yes, who's this?

302
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,473
Hello sir, this is Alok Sen.
Dr. Alok Sen.

303
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,737
Sir, l have to meet you right now.

304
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,841
lt's very urgent sir. Please, sir.

305
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,878
Regarding what?

306
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,072
Sir...

307
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,911
l have some shocking
information about...

308
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,952
the virus outbreak in
Namibia and its antidote.

309
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,018

310
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,850

311

312
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,583
Okay... calm down, Dr. Sen.

313
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,523
l am heading to my office.
Why don't you come there?

314
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,563
The adddress is...

315
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,497
Yes, sir. l know where it is,
l'll be there soon.

316
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,901
Good evening, sir.

317
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,837
Good evening.

318
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:37,874
l am expecting someone.

319
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,102
Okay, sir. - Thanks.

320
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,015
Who are you?

321
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,145
Unique, Unusual, Unparalleled.

322
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,251
Because, l have no history...

323
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,222
no past.

324
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,825
Just the present.

325
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,256
Surprised?

326
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,861
Whoever you are, you have
clearly come to the wrong place.

327
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,163
The place is also right,
and so is the time.

328
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,800
The sameu cah't bee said

00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,812
At least get to know me first.

331
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,210
l am the answer
to all your questions.

332
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,886
- Look... - You look...

333
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,680
into my eyes...

334
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,589
to find yourself.

335
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,595
What the hell do
you think you are doing?

336
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,693
Sir, there is a Dr.
Sen here to see you...

337
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,697
Send him in.

338
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:11,734
Right, sir.

339
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,105
Dr. Shetty? l'm Dr. Sen.

340
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,568
Thank you for meeting me.

341
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,872
You said you wanted to tell
me something about the virus?

342
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,143
Yes, sir. Here...

343
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,880
This contains a sample of the virus,
and it's ahtiddote.

344
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,019
l work for Kaal Pharmaceuticals.

345
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,021
This company experiments
with the fusion of DNA...

346
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,897
of different species to
create antidotes for viruses.

347
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,693
But sir...

348
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,696
l recently discovered that...

349
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,037
before they can formulate
the antidote, they create the virus.

350
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,238
They have laboratories
all over the world.

351
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,714
Sir, l've collected
all evidence against them...

352
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,149
...and saved it in this pen drive.

353
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:09,783
You were assigned
charge of Lab no. 3.

354
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:16,864
Where you had to put together
the DNA of various species...

355
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,262
but instead you put
together these files?

356
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,334
How do you know?

357
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,005
l know!

358
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,286
You've made a grave
mistake by cheating him.

359
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,086
He can't stand traitors.

360
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,913
This is Kaya.

361
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,681
A miracle of science.

362
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,753
Created by the one,
who is creating...

363
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,760
his own, new and
extraordinary world on Earth.

364
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,402
This is Kaal.

365
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,874
He believes that he is the
master of his own life and destiny.

366
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,736
An enigma.

367
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,210
A scientific genius.

368
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:42,779
His research of many years
is now capable of changing the world.

369
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:52,256
But he began every experiment
with the aim of changing himself.

370
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,459
lt is rather ironic that...

371
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:04,164
a brain so sharp is housed in a body
that is paralyzed below the neck...

372
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,504
except for two of his fingers.

373
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,416
Unbelievable as it is,
but it is true...

374
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:18,950
that Kaal can conjure up the power
of his mind into these two fingers...

375
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,086
to lift things, make them fly, or
destroy them, through telekninesis.

376
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,425
Yet, he has been attempting
to obtain the bone marrow...

377
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,399
which would rejuvenate him.

378
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,935
But when Kaal,
with his unusual DNA...

379
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,373
could not find his
cure among humans...

380
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,972
he began experimenting on animals.

381
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,383
Fusing together his DNA and
blood with that of the animals'...

382
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,248
Kaal created creatures
as one creates test tube babies.

383
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,482
ln this process,
Kaal made such amazing creatures...

384
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,058
whose mind and soul were Kaal's.

385
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:59,823
human in appearance but
beastly in nature and strength.

386
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,289
Kaal has named them...

387
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,329
Manimals!

388
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:10,305
But despite all efforts Kaal
hasn't found the bone marrow yet.

389
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,844
His search still continues.

390
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,107
lnitiate!

391
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,904
Start Deliquidation!

392
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,122
Fusion is the future!

393
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,698
Begin the final test.

394
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,967
Kaal... - Let it learn
to survive in this environment...

395
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,137
and, continue your research.

396
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,375
l am sure you will
find that bone marrow.

397
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,573
And success will be yours soon.

398
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,446
l am successful even today.

399
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,518
You may have noticed the lethal
strike of my new manimal, Striker.

400
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,424
Success was Kaal's...

401
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,695
even when he made you.

402
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,361
Fusing my blood with
that of a chameleon's.

403
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,731
That's thee reasoh yoou
cah chahge your foorm ahd shape.

404
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,234
Wherever, whenever.

405
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,307
Let's find out how many lives
the virus has claimed in Namibia.

406
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,614
These reed doots indicateu
that moore thah...

407
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,053
40% of Namibia's population
has been infected by the virus.

408
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,489
This has thrown many genius
scientists off their keel.

409
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:54,289
Our scientists want to know
when we should send our antidote.

410
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,629
Let some more people die.

411
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,463
Let there be more fear.

412
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,666
lt's simple science, Kaya.

413
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:13,480
Our profit will rise
as people's hopes fall.

414
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,423
This virus is hot natural...

415
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,058
it was created.

416
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,555
But, sir...who would do such a thing?

417
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,099
A madman.

418
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,762
Dr. Mehra,
an antidote has been successfully...

419
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,165
...made for the virus
outbreak in Namibia.

420
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,438
This breakthrough was achievedd by a
connmppany called Kaal Pharmaceeuticals.

421
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,272
The antidote has reached Namibia
and the situation is under control.

422
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,183
Thahk Goddl

423
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,084
This antidoote has
pproveed yet agaih that...

424
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,388
there are more kind hearted
people than evil ones.

425
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,762
Krrish.

426
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,523
Krrish.

427
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,462
Al Sabah 13th floor, Millat Nagar.

428
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,171
Help! Help me!

429
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,532
Mummy!

430
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,106
Somebody, help!

431
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,370
Vicky!

432
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,842
Help! Help me!

433
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,775
Help me.

434
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,596
There's no need to be scared anymore,
you are safe now.

435
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,433
Okay?

436
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,338
ln fact, we're both safe.

437
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,138
But tell me something...

438
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,770
what were you doing up there?

439
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:55,513
l was doing my homework, when
l saw a pigeon stuck in the wires...

440
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,153
struggling to break free.

441
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,883
So l went up to the
roof to set it free.

442
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,456
Though l have small hands...

443
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:05,560
l managed to set the pigeon free.

444
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,528
But l got trapped.

445
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,657
Mother, help me. Mother.

446
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,894
But you saved me, Krrish.

447
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,499
Thahk you, hKrrish.

448
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,671
Thahk you...

449
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,498
Krrish.

450
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:20,869
Me?

451
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,476
You saved the pigeon's life.

452
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:28,352
Anyone who takes away tears
and spreads happiness is Krrish!

453
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,350
Wow, even l am Krrish!

454
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,850
Yes.

455
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,790
But, Krrish,
you have a mask, a suit...

456
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,559
and super powers.

457
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,354
What do l have?

458
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,458
You have an innocence which
has taught me a lesson today.

459
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,194
That, agee ddoesn't matter,
courag.ee does.

460
00:36:54,545 --> 00:37:00,711
Here's a small gift,
from Krrish, to little Krrish.

461
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,422
This is now the symbol of
your honesty and righteousness.

462
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,586
Welcome to the team.

463
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,760
Team? l am a part
of your team, Krrish?

464
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,427
Yes, but you must promise me that...

465
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,291
you won't try to imitate me by...

466
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,893
...climbing,
jumping and leaping off buildings.

467
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,806
Promise? - l promise, Krrish.

468
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,247
Gone.

469
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,255
Sir... yes, sir?

470
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,855
Welcome!

471
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,327
How nice of you to make it on time!

472
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,294
Might as well have
come after we closed.

473
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,631
By the way,
may l ask you what took you so long?

474
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,427
l had to go, sir.

475
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,262
You had to go?

476
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:53,826
Yes, sir.

477
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,599
lt was more important than your job?

478
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,536
No.

479
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,937
The gueests wereu waiting
for Chiheese foodd...

480
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,943
and they left with a mouthful
of lndian abuses. - Breaking news!

481
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:01,636
Do you get it?

482
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,408
Eternal savior,
Krrish, rescued another kid and...

483
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,779
safely reunited him with his family.

484
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,748
Proving yet again, where
there's crisis, there is Krrish.

485
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,457
On one hand there's Krrish.

486
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,059
He flies like the wind,
winning over hopeless situations.

487
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,795
Yes. - And,
on the other, there's you.

488
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,559
You run like the wind
from situations which need you.

489
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,996
You could learn
something from Krrish.

490
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,801
Perhaps,
if you'd been more like him...

491
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,802
l wouldn't have to sack you.

492

they start treating elders like kids.

l know it's Krishna's birthday today.

571
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,183
l've even got him a gift.

572
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:00,990
There's some other good news.

573
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,523
And Mr. Balgopal will
tell you what it is, himself.

574
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,325
Some other good news?

575
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,960
And, who is Mr. Balgopal?

576
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,863
l don't think l even
have any friends by this name.

577
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,908
Actually, l may just.

578
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,201
One can't even recall all
the names of his friends at this age.

579
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,812
Balgopal?

580
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,317
That's your hameu tooo!

581
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,327
You are going to be a grandpa.

582
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,900
Grandpa?

583
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,143
Really?

584
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,110
Yes, papa.

585
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,333
Every father wants
to see his kids grow up.

586
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,204
Wants to play with them,
fool around with them...

587
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,141
But that joy was taken away from me.

588
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,478
l could not see the number
of times you fell down...

589
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,386
the number of times you
got back up on your feet...

590
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,190
all the times you came
home covered in muck.

591
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,559
l still regret not being
able to witness all of that.

592
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,493
But, now, l have no regrets.

593
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,595
No complaints.

594
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,137
So what if l couldn't
be there as a father.

595
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,466
l will be there now, as a grandpa.

596
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,634
l will live up your childhood...

597
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,976
through your child.

598
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:11,411
Thahk you, Priya,
for coompheting our snnmahh family.

599
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,311
And yes.

600
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,626
Happy birthday, Krishna.

601
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,122
Here's a small gift for you...
for both of you.

602
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,494
Okay, papa.

603
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,133
And l will distribute these
sweets among my colleagues.

604
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,463
Everyone will be thrilled.

605
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,505
lt will be a fun day.

606
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,190
What are you doing, Kaal?

607
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,158
lf only l had the use
of all of my fingers...

608
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,661
my whole hand...

609
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,436
my entire body.

610
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:43,405
You have no idea what
l would be capable of.

611
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,309
l am still amazed...

612
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,541
how you manage to do, what you do.

613
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,583
How did you get these powers?

614
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:52,448
What is the secret behind it?

615
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,981
lnspite of being so powerful,
why is...

616
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,219
...your body still
wheelchair bound, Kaal?

617
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,532
Kaal, you are choking me.

618
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,262
lt hurts.

619
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,996
And it should.

620
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,301
Because, you have hurt me.

621
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,140
By asking me the question...

622
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,306
for which l don't have an answer.

623
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:23,015
And l am still searching for it.

624
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,619
What are you doing, son?

625
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,290
Don't misuse your powers.

626
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,792
Don't use your powers
for destruction.

627
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,536
How many times have l told you, Kaal?

628
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,730
And how many times
have l asked you, dad?

629
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,273
How did l get these powers?

630
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,769
Why am l like this?

631
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,503
l don't know that.

632
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,771
You have been lying all this while.

633
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,045
You are lying now too.

634
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,176
Trust me, l am telling you the truth.

635
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,649
Stop it, Kaal.

636
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,456
Kaal...

637
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,301
l didn't find an answer then.

638
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,841
Even after all this research,
all these experiments...

639
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,613
l still haven't found the answer.

640
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,176
But, l know science has the answer.

641
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,320
And, therein lies my cure.

642
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,286
My cure lies in that answer.

643
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,126
l have spent millions.

644
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,634
l will spend billions.

645
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:52,802
Doctors, how much have we earned
from the antidote sales in Namibia?

646
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,712
320 million dollars and counting.

647
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,840
A little fear and
320 million dollars.

648
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,517
And still counting!

649
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,349
The businneess of feuar...

650
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,556
is the best business.

651
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,519
But now millions are not enough,
we need to earn in billions.

652
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:17,496
lt is now time,
to plant the virus in a country...

653
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,262
that has a population of billions.

654
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,450
lndia? Or, China?

655
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,622
China's population surpasses
that of lndia, Kaal.

656
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,457
But a million Gods rule over lndia.

657
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,490
And people have
immense faith in them.

658
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,802
Let's find out if
any one of their Gods...

659
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:59,636
can save them from our virus.

660
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,761
Krishna, let's have ice cream?

661
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,502
lce cream?

662
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,630
But l heard, during pregnancy...

663
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,866
women like to have sour things.

664
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:39,834
But l am craving for sweet things.
- Really?

665
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,276
Because l want our baby
to turn out sweet, like you.

666
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:44,814
Okay.

667
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,811
Let's go and sit there.

668
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,510
Stop licking the ice cream like that!

669
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,288
You ate up my ice cream?

670
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,528
l thought you got it for me!

671
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,933
l couldn't eat my own!

672
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,060
How could l eat yours?

673
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,395
Let's get another one. - Let's go.

674
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,574
Kripal, what's up?

675
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:13,831
l am quite worked up.

676
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,535
l am trying to control my anger.

677
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,944
Because l was just accused
of being an ice cream thief.

678
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,546
We'd like to have same flavor again.
- Okay, sir.

679
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,985
So, what will you have?

680
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,095
So, you are handing
over empty cones to us!

681
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,023
Sir, l had filled it.

682
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,096
lf it was full, why is it empty now?

683
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,835
Sir, you can see while
l fill the scoop again.

684
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,335
Yes, do it in front of me.

685
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,771
Two choco blocks, please.

686
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,773
Sir, you saw it for yourself!
l had filled it!

687
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,346
Yeah, he filled
it and yet it's empty.

688
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,373
Mummy, my ice cream?

689
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,917
l just got you one.

690
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,884
Where's my ice cream gone?

691
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,420
Where is my ice cream?

692
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,989
Mummy, my ice cream?

693
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,059
Can you fill it once more please?
- Yes. sir.

694
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,374
What is it?

695
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,515
l'll be right back.

696
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:27,647
But...

697
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,954
Yes, Kaya.

698
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:52,897
Kaal, Mumbai's pulse
is about to change.

699
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,477
Nerve wracking reports coming
in from several parts of Mumbai.

700
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,572
This virus is sppreadihg
across Mumbbai cityy.

701
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,481
The wwhoohe oof Munnmbai has bbeeun eungulfedd
by a horrifying., unknownn disease.

702
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,053
First report came in
from 'CST Railway Station'

703
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,783
ln no time, a perilious
virus has taken over Mumbai.

704
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,122
On roads, offices and from
every where same reports are coming

705
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,128
Similar kind if reports
are started coming from..

706
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,822
..other parts of city as well.

707
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,026
As you can see...

708
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,798
fear and horror have
spread everywhere.

709
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,966
Every hospital is facing
a similar or worse situation.

710
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:37,706
Countless people are critical.

711
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,148
And, 117 people have lost their
lives to the rapidly spreading virus.

712
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,620
Someone call a crane
to move this truck.

713
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:46,982
Dad, get up!

714
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,819
Wake up, dad, please!

715
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,160
Krrish, please help.

716
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,892
My wife's in a bad condition.

717
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:31,865
Krrish... my dad...

718
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,902
Krrish, save my child

719
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,775
Krrish, my children...

720
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,977
Krrish, please save my wife...

721
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,016
Save my father.

722
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:04,959
Krrish, please help!
- Krrish, please help!

723
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,917
My fear has come true.

724
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,253
lt's the same virus that...

725
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,689
claimed thousands
of lives in Namibia.

726
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,191
Oh my God!

727
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,035
But there is an
antidote for this virus.

728
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,104
Contact Kaal
Pharmaceuticals immediately.

729
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,046
Kaal, after what
happened with Striker...

730
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,914
we should be wary of Krrish.

731
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,354
Our virus will test him too.

732
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:06,294
The lnddiah g.overnment has
wweakkeeneed due to this virus, hKaah.

733
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,092
They are contacting
our dealers repeatedly.

734
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,007
Kaal, the key component
of the antidote is ready.

735
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,942
We must start working on
the antidote as soon as possible.

736
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,014
How long will it take
for our scientists to make it?

737
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,681
10 days!

738
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,444
The cityy wwihl be dead in 10 days!

739
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,747
People are dying in front of me,
in my arms.

740
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,449
l can hear their screams...

741
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,752
and, l am helpless.

742
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,992
l am helpless, papa.

743
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,729
What is the point of me being Krrish?

744
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:49,064
There is a point.

745
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,765
There is.

746
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,210
lnspite of being around infected
people, you are not affected.

747
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:03,011
And neither is Priya,
as she is carrying your baby.

748
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:09,090
All my colleagues have
fallen prey to this virus.

749
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,251
All except me.

750
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,859
That means,
we are immune to this virus.

751
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,036
Perhaps, our blood
has something that is...

752
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:25,137
shiehding us, pprotecting us.

753
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,041
What are you doing?

754
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,442
lf l remain immune to this virus...

755
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,180
...even after it is
infused in my blood then...

756
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,940
my blood can be used to
make an antidote for this virus.

757
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,313
No, papa.

758
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,084
l won't let you do this.

759
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,354
Krishna, this is the only
way to find a cure for the virus.

760
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,152
Theh, ihjecct it in nnmy bblooodd.

761
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,788
No, that's too risky.

762
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:51,297
l could put you under risk...

763
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,500
but, not the people's hope.

764
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,464
Right now,
you are everyone's last hope, papa...

765
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,507
not me!

766
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,376
Test it on me.

767
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:06,772
But-

768
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:07,873
Please, papa.

769
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,384
Krishna.

770
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:51,351
Krishna!

771
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,076
l am okay.

772
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,908
l am okay.

773
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,420
This nnmeeahs, l cah makke
an antidote fronnm your bblooodd.

774
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,357
Now, we will be able to save people.

775
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:26,326
lt should take only a few hours...

776
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:28,862
But...

777
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,868
How can we provide the anitode
to so many in so little time?

778
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,470
How will we do that?

779
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,948
Kaal, there's a problem.

780
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,413
l don't know how...

781
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,545
but, the effect of our
virus is wearing off in Mumbai.

782
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,628
One of you has betrayed me.

783
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,389
You have cheated Kaal.

784
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:17,364
l warned you that the antidote should
not reach lndia until after 10 days.

785
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,104
How, then?

786
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,074
Who did it?

787
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,971
No one, Kaal.

788
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,982
We are still making our antidote!

789
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,980
Rumor has it, that a scientist from
a research institute in Mumbai...

790
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,022
has managed to create
the antidote to our virus.

791
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,418
What?

792
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,185
What nonsense?

793
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,626
How can a measly
scientist manage to...

794
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,990
find an antidote for Kaal's virus?

795
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:52,070
The antidoote cah
oohly bbe ppreepared froom...

796
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,740
my DNA...

797
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,511
my blood.

798
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,312
And how can anyone get it?
From where?

799
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,244
How?

800
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:16,059
How can my blood be coursing
through someone else's veins?

801
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,225
How?

802
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,696
Mumbai has once again proved...

803
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:55,568
to be unstoppable, unafraid, invincible
by vanquishing this virus.

804
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,433
l salute the courage of this city.

805
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,642
The spirit of its citizens...

806
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:06,174
and more importantly
the real hero of this victory.

807
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,448
A friend to the kids...

808
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,845
a hope for the grown-ups...

809
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,115
and, the support to the elders...

810
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,421
our very own, Krrish.

811
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,756
lf you are present here...

812
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,592
or wherever you are...

813
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,130
please know that words
aren't enough to thank you.

814
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,359
Yet, we have attempted in
our small way to felicitate you...

815
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,164
and, this shall be the
new identity of the city.

816
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,831
And, to present to you all,
this new identity...

817
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,702
l would like to call upon stage...

818
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,772
the man, without whom...

819
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,110
even Krrish's efforts
would have been futile...

820
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,847
Dr. Rohit Mehra.

821
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,678
Please come, sir.

822
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,479
Thahk you foor ahl your love.

823
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,312
Thahk you soo much.

824
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:16,582
But, l am sure if
you were in my place...

825
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,448
you would have done the same.

826
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:20,745
l was merely a medium.

827
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:22,818
Our effort has been successful...

828
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,757
...because of your
prayers and well wishes.

829
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,893
l would also like
to thank Krrish...

830
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,739
For making our nights safer and
gifting us a promise of a new day.

831
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,680
Sir, do you know Krrish?

832
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,955
l believe in Krrish.

833
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,655
l believe that...

834
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,621
we all have the essence
of Krrish in us.

835
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:05,494
Every person, who uses
their abilities to help others...

836
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:06,962
who extends a helping
hand selflessly...

837
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,759
who stands by those in need...

838
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,395
is, indeed Krrish.

839
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,468
We all have Krrish in us.

840
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:13,903
Even l am Krrish.

841
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,307
Krrish told me...

842
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,436
wwhen l saveed a pig.eon.

843
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,208
He also gave me this symbol.

844
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,272
Even l have one.

845
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,611
Me too.

846
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:26,752
l have one too!

847
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,831

873
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,480
Looks like Krishna's here.

874
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:56,888
l'll check, papa.

875
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,499
What's the matter, Priya?
Who is it?

876
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,063
No one, papa.

877
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,653
Priya!

878
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,584
Priya!

879
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,988
Priya.

880
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,112
What's her blood group?

881
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,318
O positive.

882
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,190
Any medical history, any allergies?

883
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:51,986
No.

884
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,858
But, Priya is pregnant.

885
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,909
Krishna, how is Priya?

886
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,874
l don't know anything yet, papa.

887
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,803
They have taken
her in for a check-up.

888
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,839
What's going on, papa?

889
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,440
Don't worry.

890
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,918
We'll soon find out.

891
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:21,421
Thahks to you oonee of the
attackers is in our ccustoddy.

892
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,019
l just hope... Mr. Mehra...

893
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,293
your wife is alright now.

894
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,830
But, l am sorry to say,
we couldn't save the baby.

895
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,170
Papa.

896
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,149
lt's going to be alright...

897
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,454
lt's going to be fine.

898
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,121
We don't need tears right now.

899
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,125
Because Priya needs you, Krishna.

900
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,293
You must make her smile again.

901
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:39,366
You must teach her
how to live again.

902
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:42,300
And, only you can do it.

903
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,166
Only you, Krishna.

904
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:50,001
Welcome, Mrs. Priya Mehra.

905
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:55,242
l hope you had a pleasant journey.

906
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,403
Who are you?

907
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:02,041
l know strange places
can be frightening.

908
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,250
You are in Kaal's world.

909
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,004
Here, l am trying to have
a conversation with you...

910
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,304
and you are trying
to run from me...

911
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,068
trying to attack me.

912
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:40,179
lt's not safe to be running
in your condition, for both of you.

913
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,026
So, please, sit down.

914
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,730
Sit!

915
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,080
Who is Krrish?

916
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,107
Who is he?

917
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,185
l... l don't know.

918
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:15,013
But you do know...

919
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,284
that the antidote for my virus...

920
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:20,089
was created by your father-in-law,
Rohit Mehra.

921
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:24,321
l'm sure you know how.

922
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,191
l don't know that.

923
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,736
But, l do know that...

924
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:34,132
only you have the answers
to all my questions.

925
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:37,337
Look, please...

926
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,003
my family...
my husband...

927
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,481
They must be searching for me...
And if they...

928
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,314
We search for things
that are missing.

929
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,745
But you are not missing, Priya.

930
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,547
You are here.

931
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,589
And there too!

932
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,329
Yes, two seats please.

933
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,668
Priya, all set!

934
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:11,338
First day, first show.

935
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,180
Shall we go?

936
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,456
Where are you lost?

937
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,662
l am right here.

938
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,459
ln front of you.

939
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,259
You are in front of me...

940
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,161
but not with me.

941
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,330
What?

942
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,807
lf you were really here...

943
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,135
you'd have sensed
that l have changed.

944
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:49,208
Yes, ma'am,
starting today, l'm all yours.

945
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,786
Just like your channel
entertains 24/7...

946
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,352
l am here at your service,
to entertain you.

947
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,651
48/14.

948
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:57,780
l have the list ready for each day.

949
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,121
From Sunday to Monday.

950
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,593
From shopping to cinema.

951
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,194
And, l won't ask for any leaves.

952
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,287
Nor any promotions.

953
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:04,490
l only want my salary.

954
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,363
Which would be...

955
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,397
A few thousand smiles.

956
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,828
A few million hugs.

957
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,869
A few billion kisses.

958
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:16,470
That's ahl l waht.

959
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,842
So, where do we start?

960
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,278
You've read my mind.

961
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,310
Where do we start?

962
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:32,785
We start by letting go of the past.

963
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,518
This is reeally strange.

964
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:03,588
His heart is beating
only once every two minutes.

965
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:07,226
This nnmeeahs, he is hibbernating.

966
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:11,191
ln this suspended state,
along with this heart rate...

967
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,857
he can stay alive
for as long as he wants.

968
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,437
But, human beings can't do that.

969
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,767
But some animals can.

970
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,908
They hibernate uhderground...

971
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,644
and resurface only when
the weather is favorable.

972
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,452
Perhaps,
he also has that very ability.

973
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:36,279
He is as much an animal,
as he is human.

974
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:41,418
l guess, he can be called a mutant.

975
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,695
Mutant?

976
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,693
Yes, Krishna.

977
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,335
Ancient mythology like Mahabharata
and Ramayana had such creatures.

978
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:50,562
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

979
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,442
- Hello!
- Priya, are you okay?

980
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:30,908
- Yes, why?
- l will be late in coming home.

981
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:35,481
Because one of the attackers
is coming back to consciousness.

982
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:48,462
Once he is awake perhaps
he can help us and we can help him.

983
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,889
And, he can tell
us who it is that is...

984
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:56,027
trying to attempt such a dangerous
subversion of laws of nature.

985
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,705
Priya!

986
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:03,942
Priya, why did you come here?

987
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:05,777
l was getting scared.

988
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,039
No need to be afraid.

989
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,387
Krishna, l am afraid.

990
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,013
He will kill me.
He will kill us.

991
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:17,552
Do something, Krishna.

992
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,887
Get a sedative, immediately.

993
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,052
Papa, you have to kill him.

994
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,489
No, no, you have to kill him,
Krishna. lt'll be fine, Priya.

995
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,326
Priya. - Kill him!

996
01:28:26,834 --> 01:28:28,426
Father.

997
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:29,697
Father.

998
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:53,921
That thing...

999
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,895
he tried to kill me.

1000
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,793
You saw it, didn't you?

1001
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,329
lf you weren't there to save me...

1002
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,428
What did l ever do to them?

1003
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,895
Who are these people?

1004
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,803
What do they want from me... us?

1005
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:08,974
Priya, l can imagine
you are disturbed.

1006
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,944
But, please, calm down.

1007
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,546
Perhaps we would
have got some answers...

1008
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,841
if he had been alive for longer.

1009
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:20,716
But, who are they?

1010
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,445
And, why are they attacking us?

1011
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:23,954
Attacking papa?

1012
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,722
You think it could be because...

1013
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,794
papa made an antidote
for the virus?

1014
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:31,762
Yes, l think so too.

1015
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:33,662
You are on the right track.

1016
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:36,736
We can't be sure...

1017
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:43,473
but, the attack seems to be linked
with the virus and the antidote.

1018
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,407
lt seems very probable.

1019
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,748
That means, they can come back.

1020
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,515
They cah spreeadd the virus again.

1021
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,012
We'd still be able to save people.

1022
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:55,986
But, how?

1023
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,684
They have burned the lab down.

1024
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,551
Yes.

1025
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,694
But we still have the antidote.

1026
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:06,163
And if needed,
we can make more of it.

1027
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,131
How?

1028
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,599
How... papa?

1029
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,039
Because, Priya, we have--

1030
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:21,445
Papa, l think,
her questions won't stop until...

1031
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,111
you make the antidote
in front of her eyes.

1032
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,682
Because, she isn't Priya.

1033
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:38,862
She is just a journalist right now.

1034
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,593
Yes.

1035
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:45,161
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1036
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,074
Because she hasn't
been to work for so long...

1037
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,476
the journalist in
her is trying to surface.

1038
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:54,148
That's why, you shouldd
reusunnme workk fronnm tomorroww, Priya.

1039
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,143
And right now,
you are going to bed.

1040
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,809
- But, papa...
- Let's go.

1041
01:30:57,885 --> 01:31:00,820
Krishna, let papa tell us.

1042
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:02,446
We should know this.

1043
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,924
There's no teulling
wwhen wwe might heeud it.

1044
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,551
Father.
Listen to me, Krishna.

1045
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:10,119
lf we come to know how
papa makes the antidote...

1046
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,960
we could help him.

1047
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,100
This is very important.

1048
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,595
Why don't you understand?

1049
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,845
l love you.

1050

This is from all of us.

1069
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:16,880
What's this?

1070
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,323
The symbbol of Korrish.

1071
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,221
Anyone who steps up to help another
person, is rewarded with this.

1072
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:24,126
Where can l meet Krrish?

1073
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,293
l do not know that.

1074
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:29,033
l just know that
he is always present...

1075
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,298
...at the right place,
at the right time.

1076
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:33,272
And, when he isn't...

1077
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:38,237
kind people like you,
take his place.

1078
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,144
But, what did l do?

1079
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:41,909
You did.

1080
01:33:41,983 --> 01:33:45,111
You have done what
any kind person would do.

1081
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,890
Your good human instincts
saved a child's life...

1082
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:55,160
...and her mother's as well.

1083
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,936
You don't understand, Krishna.

1084
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:16,779
l love you.

1085
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,712

1088
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,396
''Why, today, for the first time''

1089

01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,169
''Yes''

1096
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:14,030
''My heart''

01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:18,812

1108
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:47,928
''The world seems a better place''

1109
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,132
''This love is''

1110
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,497
''Like that gust of wind''

1111
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:59,003
''Like that tidal wave''

1112
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:07,284
''That sweeps away
everything in its path''

Kaal will obtain
it by his own means.

1139
01:39:52,753 --> 01:39:56,245
Doctor, are all

1140
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,557
Parameters are normal.

1141
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,727
The foetus is heualthy

1143
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,294
Get it out.

1144
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:08,631
Right away.

1145
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:11,136
But why, Kaal?

1146
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:18,737
l want to try injecting my DNA
in its DNA at this foetal stage...

1147
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,647
and see what generates.

1148
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:34,722
Because, we have not yet conducted any
experiments with human foetuses.

1149
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:36,560
That's right, Kaal.

1150
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,120
But, it's too early.

1151
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:41,495
Pulling the foetus
out right now is dangerous.

1152
01:40:41,602 --> 01:40:42,796
lt will die.

1153
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:45,602
Until the foetus
is three months old...

1154
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,103
we cannot take it out.

1155
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,601
Nor, can we conduct
any experiments.

1156
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:53,602
ln fact,
we cannot even do a DNA test.

1157
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:56,781
How much longer?

1158
01:40:56,817 --> 01:40:58,444
At least a week, Kaal.

1159
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,386
Only another seven days.

1160
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:08,494
And your nine month long
ordeal will come to an end.

1161
01:41:10,397 --> 01:41:15,266
And perhaps get answers
to all my questions.

1162
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:27,446
Krishna, where are you?

1163
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,285
Some startling facts
have been revealed, Krishna.

1164
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:34,584
At first, we discovered that...

1165
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,714
the DNA of the antidote supplied
by Kaal Pharmaceuticals...

1166
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:42,686
is a match to the DNA
of the mutant in our custody.

1167
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:50,433
Even more alarming
truth is the fact that...

1168
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:55,869
the DNA of the antidote
created by us...

1169
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:59,678
is also more or less the same.

1170
01:42:01,415 --> 01:42:03,542
l did several tests to confirm.

1171
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,879
Every single time,
l got the same result.

1172
01:42:07,554 --> 01:42:08,748
But, how is that possible?

1173
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,218
Because we made
that antidote from...

1174
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:19,891
- l guess Priya has woken up.
- Yes.

1175
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,601
- About the antidote...
- How is she?

1176
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,327
She is fine.

1177
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,201
- The antidote... - Listen...

1178
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,165
l am leaving for
Singapore tomorrow.

1179
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:30,369
Take care of yourself and Priya.

1180
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:31,569
You are going to Singapore?

1181
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:34,441
Why?

1182
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,576
Because...

1183
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:41,678
Singapore, Dr.
Arya, and his cruel intentions...

1184
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:45,350
are all an important
part of my past.

1185
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:51,790
And, the facts that have surfaced
have raised many questions.

1186
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:58,463
Perhaps, l can only find
the answers by revisiting my past.

1187
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,914
- There you are.
- What happened?

1188
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,387
Are you alright?

1189
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,218
Yes, why?

1190
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,283
l don't know.

1191
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,460
l felt like you were calling
out to me from a distance.

1192
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:26,895
l am right here with you.
Why would l call out to you?

1193
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:28,764
True.

1194
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,664
Papa had asked for some coffee.

1195
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,532
He is still working.

1196
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,499
But, it's quite late.

1197
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:38,844
Let me go check on him.

1198
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:40,209
No.

1199
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,477
He said he is working
on some important research.

1200
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:45,708
We shouldn't disturb
him until morning.

1201
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,851
Come with me.
Come on.

1202
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:49,479
Okay, let's go.

1203
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,717
What's the matter?

1204
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:23,754
No.

1205
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:26,482
Now, l cannot break
Krishna's trust.

1206
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,452
And...

1207
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,928
what about Kaal's trust?

1208
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:41,340
l will ask him to wait until
Rohit Mehra returns from Singapore.

1209
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:24,779
Hello.

1210
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:27,376
l have found all the answers
l was looking for, Krishna.

1211
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:30,421
Coming to Singapore
was a good move.

1212
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,315
Singapore?

1213
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:34,058
You're in Singapore?

1214
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:35,391
When did you leave?

1215
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,054
Why didn't you tell me?

1216
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:38,564
Of course, l did.

1217
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:40,390
l told you last night...

1218
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,899
when you came down to the lab.

1219
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:44,695
Last night?

1220
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:46,938
When?

1221
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:56,542
And l was going to
share some more details...

1222
01:45:56,616 --> 01:45:57,981
but, Priya woke up.

1223
01:45:58,352 --> 01:45:59,819
Remember?

1224
01:46:05,092 --> 01:46:06,081
There you are.

1225
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:07,684
What happened?

1226
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:09,823
You're here with me.

1227
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:11,124
But not really here.

1228
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,356
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

1229
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:18,402
lf we find out how papa
made the antidote for the virus.

1230
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:22,475
Krishna, you have to kill him.

1231
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:27,511
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1232
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:50,970
Krishna...

1233
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:53,430
Krishna...

1234
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:57,007
Who are you?

1235
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,669
Priya.

1236
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:02,504
l am Priya Mehra.

1237
01:47:02,883 --> 01:47:04,145
You are not Priya.

1238
01:47:04,618 --> 01:47:05,744
Yes, l am.

1239
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,878
l am Priya... Krishna!

1240
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,956
You aren't Priya.

1241
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,456
lf you were...

1242
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:21,463
you would know the truth
about Krishna and Krrish.

1243
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:26,204
Tell me who you are!

1244
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:32,873
Where's my Priya?

1245
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,672
Your Priya?

1246
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:36,181
Yes.

1247
01:47:41,588 --> 01:47:43,021
Krishna?

1248
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:45,222
Yes, Krishna.

1249
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:56,497
Your tears might influence Krishna.

1250
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:00,035
But, they won't fool Krrish.

1251
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:06,005
Where's my Priya?

1252
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:10,015
She is in a safe place.

1253
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:12,746
Priya and...

1254
01:48:14,187 --> 01:48:15,677
your child, too.

1255
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:35,734
Believe me,
l am telling the truth...

1256
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:37,276
to both Krishna and Krrish.

1257
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:43,716
Where is she?

1258
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:50,782
Welcome to the world of Kaal, Dr.
Rohit Mehra.

1259
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,718
And, l am sorry...

1260
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:56,556
l had to bring you
here without your consent.

1261
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:02,968
You went to Singapore
looking for some answers.

1262
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:08,072
Tell me, what did you find?

1263
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:15,311
That man should
never try to be God.

1264
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:22,779
Many years ago, Dr. Arya
had held me captive in Singapore.

1265
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:26,854
And during that period...

1266
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:30,160
he conducted a strange
experiment on me.

1267
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,332
Dr. Mathur...

1268
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:38,933
if this experiment is successful...

1269
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:43,605
l will have created
a new Rohit Mehra.

1270
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:47,209
From his own blood, his own DNA.

1271
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:55,317
With all of Rohit's mental
and physical powers...

1272
01:49:57,257 --> 01:50:03,253
but, controlled entirely by me.

1273
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:08,358
Dr. Arya did manage to
create a child using my DNA.

1274
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:12,932
But the child turned
out to be handicapped.

1275
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:17,699
Dr. Arya, instructed Dr.
Mathur to dispose of the baby.

1276
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:20,939
But Dr. Mathur couldn't do so.

1277
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:24,740
He left the baby
in an orphanage instead.

1278
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,882
- And... - And then...

1279
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:34,285
A rich man adopted
the handicapped child.

1280
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:38,292
And raised him as his own.

1281
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:43,158
That means, the one l
always regarded as my father...

1282
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:46,304
was not really my father.

1283
01:50:49,042 --> 01:50:54,275
Because, that handicapped
child is none other than me.

1284
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:59,116
And you... you are my father.

1285
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:08,421
l like it.

1286
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:12,764
Everything's going
to be alright now.

1287
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,894
l found you and with you...

1288
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:19,836
l found the answers
to all my questions.

1289
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,767
Now l'll find a cure
for my condition as well.

1290
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:31,210
l just need a little help from you.

1291
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:33,980
What help?

1292
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:39,255
l need your bone marrow.

1293
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:43,720
Bone marrow?

1294
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:49,735
You can have it.

1295
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,470
l will help you.

1296
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:58,110
You will have to put
an end to what you are doing.

1297
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:03,873
You must destroy this
little universe you've created.

1298
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:06,249
Dad...

1299
01:52:07,387 --> 01:52:09,048
can l call you dad?

1300
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:11,347
Of course l can...

1301
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:13,955
you are my dad indeed.

1302
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:16,759
Dad...

1303
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:19,065
no terms and conditions.

1304
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:21,924
Doing that will cause you...

1305
01:52:22,936 --> 01:52:24,767
a lot of grief.

1306
01:52:25,805 --> 01:52:27,067
Because then...

1307
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:29,466
l will be forced to take the DNA...

1308
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:32,842
from the bone marrow
of the baby that...

1309
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:35,144
Priya is carrying.

1310
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,944
Your grandchild.

1311
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,810
My grandchild?

1312
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:45,490
But l thought...

1313
01:52:46,826 --> 01:52:49,124
- even before she could give--
- No...

1314
01:52:49,863 --> 01:52:51,387
the baby is alive.

1315
01:52:52,132 --> 01:52:56,068
Because, Priya is in my custody.

1316
01:52:57,203 --> 01:52:58,932
Do you want to see her?

1317
01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:10,277
But...

1318
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:13,018
Priya is... there...

1319
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:17,313
That is hot Priya.

1320
01:53:18,324 --> 01:53:20,349
She is one of my mutants.

1321
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:22,961
Masquerading as Priya.

1322
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:25,964
The real Priya is
here and she's safe.

1323
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:28,129
Her baby is healthy.

1324
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:31,200
And so is baby's bone marrow.

1325
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:34,939
You may feel that we
are all alone right now.

1326
01:53:36,209 --> 01:53:39,303
And hence,
you may torture us all you want.

1327
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:47,010
But, you don't know the
power of a father's tears.

1328
01:53:49,189 --> 01:53:54,183
That is why you
cahnoot seee him connming.

1329
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,030
He is our strength.

1330
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:04,860
And he is the end of you.

1331
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:13,308
My real son...

1332
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:16,380
Krrish!

1333
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:41,149
Are you okay?

1334
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:42,592
Yes.

1335
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:50,562
Krishna...

1336
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:52,001
Kaal is not in this facility.

1337
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:32,071
Come in, dad.

1338
01:57:40,787 --> 01:57:43,381
Look, l have found my feet.

1339
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,425
- Whereas you...
- How do you feel, Kaal?

1340
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:55,192
l was talking to my dad.

1341
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:22,454
This is just the beg.inhing.

1342
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:27,497
A lot of blood is yet to be shed.

1343
01:58:31,604 --> 01:58:37,372
- Yes, Kaal?
- Kaya, thank you so much.

1344
01:58:39,846 --> 01:58:44,647
Because of you,
Rohit Mehra is with me.

1345
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:51,723
Come back here,
from wherever you are.

1346
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:55,151
Come to the facility
where l created you.

1347
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:45,173
Aren't you glad to
be back in your world?

1348
01:59:45,478 --> 01:59:46,809
Kaya?

1349
01:59:49,315 --> 01:59:50,509
Kaal?!

1350
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:56,453
Kaya, now you shall bear
witness to Kaal's powers.

1351
01:59:56,956 --> 01:59:58,787
l'm going to destroy humanity...

1352
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,486
and create a race
of powerful creatures.

1353
02:00:01,727 --> 02:00:03,820
This world belongs to me now.

1354
02:00:05,765 --> 02:00:07,460
lt could have been ours...

1355
02:00:08,834 --> 02:00:12,634
but, you chose a different path.

1356
02:00:14,574 --> 02:00:16,405
By betraying me.

1357
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:31,480
l knew you would bring Krrish here.

1358
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:37,394
And that is exactly
what l wanted you to do.

1359
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:20,462
Krrish!

1360
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:26,844
You are going to need your tears.

1361
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:30,674
Save them...

1362
02:01:32,885 --> 02:01:34,978
for your father.

1363
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:40,020
Sorry, for our father.

1364
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:45,361
Yes, we are brothers.

1365
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:49,368
Two sons of the same father.

1366
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:52,037
The only difference is that...

1367
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:55,063
you are the child
born out of love...

1368
02:01:55,641 --> 02:02:00,010
and, l am the child born out of Dr.
Arya's insanity.

1369
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:04,443
Ask him, if you don't believe me.

1370
02:02:08,688 --> 02:02:09,950
Papa?

1371
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:13,617
l have only taken his bone marrow.

1372
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:17,557
lf he survives...

1373
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:19,658
the world will end, Krishna.

1374
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:24,996
Dad, you are asking one
son to kill your other son?

1375
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,740
l like it.

1376
02:02:29,975 --> 02:02:33,911
l will gladly fulfil your wish.

1377
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:33,594
Krrish, my victory
will be marked by death.

1378
02:04:33,666 --> 02:04:37,659
Your and your child's death.

1379
02:04:45,744 --> 02:04:49,908
No member of your
family will survive.

1380
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:15,163
Krishna!

1381
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:20,573
Krishna.

1382
02:05:22,047 --> 02:05:27,144
Look dad,
l made your wish come true.

1383
02:05:30,623 --> 02:05:34,889
Now, l do not even
need to kill you.

1384
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:39,224
Because the death
of your real son...

1385
02:05:39,765 --> 02:05:44,031
will finish you too, Rohit Mehra.

1386
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:04,314
Krishna...

1387
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,985
Krishna, get up.

1388
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,222
Krishna...

1389
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:14,928
Krishna!

1390
02:07:07,753 --> 02:07:09,380
Who are you?

1391
02:07:20,733 --> 02:07:22,724
Hey, did you get that?

1392
02:07:39,385 --> 02:07:42,843
The one that you
all pin your hopes on.

1393
02:07:43,656 --> 02:07:45,351
That you depehd oh.

1394
02:07:45,824 --> 02:07:48,156
Kaal has destroyed him.

1395
02:07:48,794 --> 02:07:51,695
l have killed Krrish!

1396
02:07:51,764 --> 02:07:53,095
What?!

1397
02:07:55,968 --> 02:07:57,663
Oh my God!

1398
02:08:00,239 --> 02:08:05,905
Yes, l have made Krrish a martyr.

1399
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:10,247
Now, it's Priya Mehra's turn.

1400
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:12,280
So bring her to me.

1401
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:23,725
The longer she takes to reach me...

1402
02:08:24,463 --> 02:08:30,129
the more l will torture you all.

1403
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:16,500
A filter with a brain.

1404
02:10:19,945 --> 02:10:21,469
A filter with a brain.

1405
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:28,446
A filter with a brain.

1406
02:10:36,228 --> 02:10:37,889
Please God.

1407
02:10:39,064 --> 02:10:43,000
Please God.

1408
02:11:24,910 --> 02:11:30,007
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1409
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:33,613
Because no one ever really dies.

1410
02:11:34,553 --> 02:11:37,386
The souh... the ehergy...

1411
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,387
it only gets transferred
from one body to another.

1412
02:11:41,193 --> 02:11:44,253
Old lives end but
return as new lives.

1413
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:49,122
Look, Krishna...

1414
02:11:50,035 --> 02:11:52,435
l am coming back
to life within you.

1415
02:11:52,671 --> 02:11:55,003
Our powers are uniting.

1416
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:57,408
We'll always be together.

1417
02:11:58,677 --> 02:12:00,406
l'll stay alive in you.

1418
02:12:00,612 --> 02:12:02,580
And in your memories.

1419
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:09,118
And you will forever
be in my blessings.

1420
02:12:59,538 --> 02:13:02,063
What are you doing, Vicky?
Vicky, where are you going?

1421
02:13:02,207 --> 02:13:03,538
Vicky!

1422
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:26,656
Emotional fools.

1423
02:13:27,432 --> 02:13:30,401
All you silly and helpless
people are like insects to me.

1424
02:13:30,702 --> 02:13:32,033
An inferior race.

1425
02:13:32,104 --> 02:13:34,402
One that l can crush anytime.

1426
02:13:35,374 --> 02:13:38,343
How will you save her?

1427
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:40,241
We'll give our lives for her.

1428
02:13:40,312 --> 02:13:41,643
No!

1429
02:13:42,214 --> 02:13:44,182
We'll take his life.

1430
02:13:44,649 --> 02:13:46,173
l like it.

1431
02:13:46,718 --> 02:13:49,653
You have quite an attitude
for someone so small.

1432
02:13:49,721 --> 02:13:51,348
So what if l am small?

1433
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:53,317
One's courage should be undettered.

1434
02:13:53,625 --> 02:13:54,751
Krrish said so.

1435
02:13:54,793 --> 02:13:57,261
Krrish...is no more!

1436
02:13:57,329 --> 02:13:58,796
This is the era of Kaal!

1437
02:13:59,364 --> 02:14:01,525
Krrish is the courage within us.

1438
02:14:02,501 --> 02:14:04,628
And cannot be killed by any Kaal.

1439
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:12,338
Krrish will remain alive
until the last one of us is alive.

1440
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:14,231
What's the matter, Kaal?

1441
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:15,705
Scared?

1442
02:20:34,893 --> 02:20:36,554
Krishna!

1443
02:20:38,062 --> 02:20:47,801
Such a wonderful family reunion.

1444
02:20:48,907 --> 02:20:51,842
Who do l kill first?

1445
02:20:53,445 --> 02:20:54,776
Father?

1446
02:20:55,447 --> 02:20:58,143
Or son?

1447
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:05,211
Look at yourself.

1448
02:21:06,191 --> 02:21:09,888
You are just an
ordinary human being.

1449
02:21:10,995 --> 02:21:12,929
An ordinary son.

1450
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,926
A weak father.

1451
02:21:24,509 --> 02:21:26,704
Being human is not a weakness...

1452
02:21:27,245 --> 02:21:28,906
it is my strength.

1453
02:21:29,681 --> 02:21:32,650
Because l have the
blessing of every father...

1454
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:34,514
and the love of every child.

1455
02:23:09,113 --> 02:23:10,808
Krishna...

1456
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:23,090
Surprise!

1457
02:23:32,036 --> 02:23:33,901
Krishna, get up.

1458
02:23:34,706 --> 02:23:36,264
Krishna.

1459
02:23:38,876 --> 02:23:42,972
Only those who are born can die.

1460
02:23:43,748 --> 02:23:45,739
l was never born.

1461
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:50,143
So, l can never die.

1462
02:25:19,243 --> 02:25:21,711
No matter how powerful evil is...

1463
02:25:21,979 --> 02:25:26,916
good will always triumph over it.

1464
02:25:46,104 --> 02:25:51,064
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1465
02:25:52,777 --> 02:25:54,438
Because no one ever really dies.

1466
02:25:56,314 --> 02:25:58,179
We'll always be together.

1467
02:25:59,484 --> 02:26:00,974
l'll stay alive in you.

1468
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:03,353
And in your memories.

1469
02:26:04,322 --> 02:26:08,383
And you will forever
