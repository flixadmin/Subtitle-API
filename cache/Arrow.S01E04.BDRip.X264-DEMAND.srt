1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,481
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,887
For five years,
I was stranded on an island...

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,924
survive.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,686
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,326
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,681
You can survive this.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,284
To use the list of names he left me
and bring down those...

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,891
...who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,721
To do this,
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,051
I must become something else.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,401
Previously on Arrow:

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,329
- Sarah!
- How am I supposed to stay...

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,488
...away if you won't stay away from me?

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,610
John Diggle.
He'll be accompanying you from now on.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,644
I'm just beginning to understand
the kind of man you are.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,850
Hey-

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,841
Oliver?

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,405
You're that vigilante.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,611
Take it easy, Dig. You were poisoned.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,768
Son of a bitch!

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,047
I could've taken you anywhere.
Could've taken you home.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
I brought you here.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,244
You did lose your mind
on that island.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,847
- Found a couple of things.
- What, archery classes?

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,451
Clarity.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,362
Starling City is dying.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,251
It is being poisoned
by a criminal elite...

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,967
...who don't care who they hurt...

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,362
...as long as they maintain
wealth and power.

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,087
And what are you gonna do,
take them all down by your lonesome?

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,964
No.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,128
No, I want you to join me.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,161
Special Forces out of Kandahar.
It's perfect.

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,806
You're a fellow soldier.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,207
Oliver, you're not a soldier.

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,366
You're a criminal.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,688
And a murderer.

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,803
Where were you?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,765
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,930
I heard about the shooting and
wanted to make sure you were okay.

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,805
- You did?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,049
I knocked on the door
and I found a family terrified for you.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,084
- They had no idea where you were.
- Oh.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,484
Are you so self-centered that you don't
think that people who care about you...

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,001
...will wonder where you are
after you got shot at?

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,321
You're right.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,249
I made peace with your selfishness
a long time ago...

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,171
...but Moira, Thea and Walter,
they don't deserve that.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,601
They deserve better...

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,844
...someone who doesn't care
only about himself.

51
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,729
Laurel.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,651
Thank you for coming.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,602
I care about the lives of other people,
Oliver.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,083
Maybe you should try it sometime.

55
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,088
Oh, man.

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,642
That was harsh.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,044
- You okay?
-Sure.

58
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,048
Second time tonight
that a friend of mine...

59
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,846
...has taken me to the woodshed.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,010
- Kind of tires you out.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,850
- Good night.
- Night.

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,610
What am I supposed to do with that?

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,243
Does that mean "bird"?

64
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,924
I don't speak Chinese!

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,971
I'm sorry, Laurel. I'm so sorry.

66
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,806
There were no signs
of forced entry or any evidence of a struggle...

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,243
...but hours later, the police found
the blood-stained kitchen knife...

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,330
-...in the trunk of Peter Declan's car.
- Couldn't sleep either?

69
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,000
No. What are you watching?

70
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,967
Peter Declan.

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,525
Hmm?

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,085
Oh, a guy who killed his wife.

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,724
Right. This guy killed his wife
in their baby's room.

74
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,446
- Psycho.
- Camille was everything to me.

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,281
I couldn't kill her any more
than I could kill myself.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,321
So why can't you sleep?

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,610
- Bad dreams.
- About?

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,044
Laurel.

79
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,524
So why don't you make a play?

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,725
I mean, she did come over here
just to make sure you didn't get shot.

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,885
- There are reasons.
- What are they?

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Besides you sleeping with her sister
and her sister dying...

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,124
...and her father hating your guts
and you being a jerk...

84
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,971
...to everybody
since you've been back.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,570
Those are the top ones.

86
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,885
I know that it might not seem like it
sometimes...

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,525
...but I'm not the same person
I used to be.

88
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,361
So show her. Be yourself.

89
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,881
I mean, your new self.

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,401
- How did you sleep?
- Just fine, thank you.

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,329
Mm.

92
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,320
- We have a visitor.
- Mm. Mr. Diggle's replacement.

93
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,050
- Replacement?
- Yes.

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,686
He tendered his resignation
this morning.

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,245
Did he say why?

96
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,529
He said he didn't approve of the way
you spend your evenings...

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,122
...particularly given that they always
begin with you ditching him.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,809
- Hi.
- Mr. Queen.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,048
Rob Scott.
I'll be your new body man.

100
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,691
Firm grip you got there, Rob.

101
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,167
That's five years SWAT
with Monument Point MCU.

102
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,371
I feel safer already.

103
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,884
Thank God we don't have to hear
about this awful man anymore.

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,771
Declan's execution is set for midnight
two days from now.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,321
Camille Declan's former employer,
Jason Brodeur...

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,443
...released a statement saying, quote:

107
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,644
"I hope this gives Camille
the peace she deserves."

108
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,205
Jason Brodeur.

109
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,925
- Thank you, Jessica.
- What?

110
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,202
The dead wife
worked for Jason Brodeur.

111
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,324
Apparently so. What? Why?

112
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,891
No reason.

113
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,890
I wanna go into town.
Could you please get the car for me?

114
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,563
No offense, but I have been filled in
on your tendency to slip the leash.

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,765
If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer
keeping you in my sights at all times.

116
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,722
We're 20 miles from the city.

117
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,288
If you don't drive me,
how else am I gonna get there?

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,730
Right.

119
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,131
I like him.

120
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,404
Hey!

121
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,603
They say Peter Declan murdered
his wife in cold blood.

122
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,404
He had no alibi.

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,648
And all the evidence
pointed toward it.

124
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,481
He was tried, convicted,
sentenced to death.

125
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,603
An open-and-shut case...

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,723
...except for one thing.

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,531
Declan's wife, Camille,
worked for Jason Brodeur.

128
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,088
And Jason Brodeur is on the list.

129
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,764
- Mr. Brodeur.
- Admiring your handiwork, Ankov?

130
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,480
- You should've let me kill both of them.
- Peter Declan is worth more alive.

131
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,081
"Husband Kills Wife"
is a much better headline...

132
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,682
...than "Whistle-blower Uncovers
Toxic Dumping," don't you think?

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,010
Either way, 48 hours,
all this will be over.

134
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,961
The odds are good Brodeur is involved
in this woman's murder, which means...

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,688
...an innocent man is facing execution.
He'll need a good attorney.

136
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,211
So I take it there's absolutely no point
in asking if you'd like to grab a drink.

137
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,325
I can't. I have to go over transcripts
for the Fernands case.

138
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,966
If you go somewhere
that's not work or your home...

139
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,084
...your odds of meeting someone
increase by a gazillion percent.

140
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,284
That's not true. I could still
get mugged on the way home.

141
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,330
In that case,
I hope he's cute and single.

142
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,841
Good night, Joanna.

143
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,121
Hello, Laurel.

144
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,482
Don't move.

145
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,648
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Stay back.

146
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,767
My father is a cop.
You are making a huge mistake.

147
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,362
I'm not the person you think I am,
and I need your help.

148
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,688
Peter Declan is gonna be
executed in 48 hours.

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,245
I think he's innocent.

150
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,526
Declan's wife was gonna blow the whistle
on Brodeur. Brodeur had her murdered.

151
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,883
There are a thousand lawyers
in Starling City.

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,361
Why me?

153
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,321
We're both trying to help.

154
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,409
What makes you so sure
I'm gonna help you?

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,726
Because I know you'd do anything
to save the life of an innocent man.

156
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,484
Ajury has found you guilty, Mr. Declan.

157
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,127
The evidence was stacked against me,
but I didn't kill my wife.

158
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,043
I didn't take my daughter's mother
from her.

159
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,328
The murder weapon was a knife
from your kitchen...

160
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,090
...with your prints on it.

161
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,328
It was found,
along with Camille's blood...

162
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,966
...in the trunk of your car.
Your neighbors said...

163
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,128
...they heard an argument that night.

164
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,210
We had a knockdown fight
over Jason Brodeur.

165
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,564
Camille worked for him...

166
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,162
...and his company had been
dumping toxic waste into the Glades.

167
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,165
Camille told me she'd gone
and told a supervisor about it.

168
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,562
I was afraid for my family's safety.

169
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,282
And we argued...

170
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,330
...very loudly, Yes-

171
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,684
Izzy started crying, so Camille went
and stayed in her room.

172
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,367
In the morning,
I went to apologize...

173
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,764
...and that's when I found her.

174
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,328
So I just grabbed Izzy
and I ran outside and I called 911.

175
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,451
I'm innocent, Ms. Lance.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,607
Well, it looks like someone forgot
a lunch date with his wife.

177
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,326
What do you mean?
Lunch isn't for another...

178
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,009
Forty-five minutes ago. I'm so sorry.

179
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,726
It's all right.
The restaurant is holding our table.

180
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,928
Is there something wrong?

181
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,841
Compliance department tagged
$2.6 million withdrawal...

182
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,088
...from one of our Vancouver
subsidiaries.

183
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,729
Are you saying that someone embezzled
$2.6 million from the company?

184
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,847
It's probably a bookkeeping error, but
Compliance is worried about an IRS audit.

185
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,087
Mm.

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,367
But don't worry.
I'm sure it's nothing.

187
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,688
Come on. We're gonna be late.
I mean later.

188
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,846
Well, I wasn't the lead on this,
but from what I recall...

189
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,410
...we had fingerprints, we had blood,
we got motive, everything.

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,971
Brodeur seems like the type of guy
with resources needed to frame someone.

191
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,687
Laurel, in 24 hours, Peter Declan is
lying down with a needle in his arm.

192
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,642
If I thought we didn't have the right guy
you think I'd be doing anything now...

193
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,683
...except get at what really happened?

194
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,208
Declan said his wife
went to her supervisor...

195
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,244
...with allegations that Brodeur
was dumping toxic waste.

196
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,565
Yeah, but that supervisor,
he said that never happened.

197
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,889
Let me see. What was his name?
Here you go. lstook, Matt lstook.

198
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,084
He said he didn't even see
Camille that day.

199
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,607
- Happy now?
- Yes.

200
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,089
I thought it'd be cold day in hell...

201
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,001
-...before you started defending criminals.
- I'm not sure Declan is a criminal.

202
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,922
Like you said, he's on a clock.
Can't leave any stone unturned.

203
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,450
Oh, yeah.

204
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,727
- So when are you gonna tell me?
- Hmm.

205
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,002
- About what happened to your arm.
- Oh, it's my shoulder, and it's fine.

206
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,043
I knew that Queen guy was trouble.

207
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,322
Hey, I never said this happened
protecting Queen.

208
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,164
Oh, yeah?
Then what's he doing here?

209
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,006
- Area secure, sir.
- Thank you very much, Rob.

210
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,524
Hello, Diggle's sister-in-law Carly.
I'm Oliver Queen.

211
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,564
- I know who you are.
- No, you really don't.

212
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,364
Hello.

213
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,410
I couldn't help but notice
a distinct lack of police cars...

214
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,769
...when I got home. I knew
you wouldn't drop a dime on me.

215
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,885
- So have you considered my offer?
- Offer? Heh.

216
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,050
- That's one hell of a way to put it.
- It is an offer.

217
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,490
It's a chance to do the kind of good
that compelled you to join the military.

218
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,682
Please. You were born with a platinum
spoon in your mouth, Queen.

219
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,009
What, you spent five years
on an island with no room service...

220
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,168
...and suddenly you found religion?

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,445
This was my father's.

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,122
I found it when I buried him.

223
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,767
You said your father died
when the boat went down.

224
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,645
We both made it to a life raft.
There wasn't enough food...

225
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,969
...and water for both of us,
so he shot himself in the head.

226
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,931
As much as he was doing it
to give me a chance to survive...

227
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,044
...I believe that he was also atoning
for his sins.

228
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,761
I need to right the wrongs
done by my family...

229
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,042
...and I'm offering you the chance...

230
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,801
-...to right the wrongs done to yours.
- Oliver, what are you talking about?

231
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,008
Police never caught your brother's shooter.

232
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,170
- You leave Andy out of this.
- The bullets were laced with curare.

233
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,570
That's Floyd Lawton's M.O.
He is the sniper...

234
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,242
...that I stopped.

235
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,481
Are you trying to tell me
that you took down Andy's killer?

236
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,371
I'm giving you the chance...

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,241
...a chance to help
other people's families.

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,929
Do you remember when the people
in this city helped each other?

239
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,364
They can't do that anymore,
because a group of people...

240
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,211
...people like my father...

241
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,245
...they see nothing wrong
with raising themselves up...

242
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,364
...by stepping
on other people's throats.

243
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,647
It does need to stop,
and if it's not gonna be the courts...

244
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,486
...and it's not gonna be the cops...

245
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,530
...then it's gonna be me.

246
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,561
And, I hope, you.

247
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,601
I'm gonna go to the washroom, Rob.

248
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,491
Oh, that boy is long gone now.

249
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,208
- You still following the money trail?
- Mm-hm.

250
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,528
Don't we have accountants
for that sort of thing?

251
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,200
They're being singularly ineffective
in this instance.

252
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,644
Well, then it's fortunate
that I've solved the mystery.

253
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,921
I think I'm the culprit.

254
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,131
Two-point-six million
is a rather specific figure.

255
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,641
That's the exact amount
the company invested...

256
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,730
...in a friend's start-up venture
three years ago.

257
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,047
I will call Accounting. They'll clean it up,
then there's nothing to worry about.

258
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,169
Okay.

259
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,963
You really are putting a lot of hours...

260
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,241
...into this Declan thing.

261
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,727
- You actually think he's innocent?
- Someone does.

262
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,487
So you said,
but you didn't say was who.

263
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,320
A guardian angel.

264
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,966
The guy in the hood?

265
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,650
Wha--? You're kidding.

266
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,161
He tracked me down,
asked me to look into the case.

267
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,050
But you've met him?

268
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,528
But he goes against everything
that I was ever taught to believe in.

269
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,291
He breaks the law
and God knows what else.

270
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,211
How are you not afraid he won't do
"God knows what" to you?

271
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,768
He won't.
I don't know, I can feel it.

272
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,050
When I told you to meet someone,
this is far, far away from what I meant.

273
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,482
I got your message.

274
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,970
Is there a reason
we can't do this face to face?

275
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,730
You've met with Peter Declan.

276
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,369
You were right.

277
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,287
He might be innocent.

278
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,002
Declan said his wife blew whistle
on Brodeur the day she was murdered.

279
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,930
Then we need to get whoever
she told about Brodeur to testify.

280
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,321
He already has.

281
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,164
Matt lstook, Camille's supervisor.

282
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,924
Only he says that she didn't say
a word to him.

283
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,324
- He could be lying.
- Well, if he is, then he's very convincing.

284
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,962
He had the jury
and police believing him.

285
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,050
He hasn't been questioned by me.

286
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,241
I didn't become a lawyer
to break the law or hurt anybody.

287
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,767
I do what's necessary,
what people like Peter Declan need.

288
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,611
If what you're doing isn't wrong...

289
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,723
...then why are you hiding your face
with a hood?

290
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,728
To protect the ones I care about.

291
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,127
- That sounds lonely.
- It can be.

292
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,765
But not today.

293
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,964
I've got one question.

294
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,605
Why am I being fired?

295
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,806
- Ms. Smoak, isn't it?
- Yes.

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,924
And I am, without a doubt,
the single most valuable member...

297
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,170
...of your technical division. That's
including my so called "supervisor."

298
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,131
Letting me go would be
a major error for this company.

299
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,922
I agree,
which is why you're not being fired.

300
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,721
I assumed when you brought me
up here it was because...

301
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,722
It's because I wanted you to look
into something for me.

302
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,449
A variance of $2.6 million
on a failed investment...

303
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,246
...from three years ago.
It was authorized by my wife.

304
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,171
I was hoping you could find out
some of the details...

305
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,408
-...of the transaction for me.
- Find out?

306
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,847
Dig up. Discreetly.

307
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,163
I'm your girl.

308
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,729
I mean, I'm not your girl.
I wasn't making a pass at you.

309
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,281
Thank you for not firing me.

310
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,923
What the--?

311
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,770
Matt lstook.

312
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,131
You're him.

313
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,846
That hood guy
who's been terrorizing the city.

314
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,681
Peter Declan. Your lies
helped put him on death row.

315
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,249
Now, either it's time to tell me the truth,
or it's time for the 10:15 to Bltidhaven.

316
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,968
Ah. Okay. Okay. Brodeur paid me
to say that Camille never spoke to me.

317
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,647
But I didn't have anything to do
with her death.

318
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,161
Oh, God. Please let me go.
I'll do anything.

319
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,010
- You can have the file.
- What file?

320
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,010
Camille gave me a file of evidence
against Jason Brodeur.

321
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,407
- Where is it?
- Let me go, and I'll tell you.

322
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,009
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't go!

323
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,407
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't go! Uh, it's in my desk!

324
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,446
The file, it's in my desk at the office!
You can have it! Get me out of here!

325
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,443
What is that? I'm so hungry.

326
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,528
It smells really good.

327
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,524
Hey, fine, don't share.

328
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,045
Hey-

329
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,489
I'm not gonna kill the bird.

330
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,162
Compliments of Matt lstook.

331
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,567
- What's in here?
- Leverage on Jason Brodeur.

332
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,007
Enough to help save
Peter Declan's life.

333
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,761
As an attorney,
I never would've gotten a file like this.

334
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,328
I always thought the law was sacred.
It fixed everything.

335
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,642
And now, Laurel?

336
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,080
Now what do you think?

337
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,850
I think there's too many people in this
city who only care about themselves.

338
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,326
People who are selfish.

339
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,364
I think they need someone who cares
about the lives of other people.

340
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,322
Someone like you.

341
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,803
Oh, my God.

342
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,287
- What's wrong with your face?
- What do you mean?

343
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,128
There's something really weird on it,
like this thing with your mouth.

344
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,762
- It looks like it's in the shape of a smile.
- Yes. That's cute.

345
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,851
- So why are you grinning?
- I took your advice with Laurel...

346
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,566
-...to be myself.
- And?

347
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,401
-It's helping.
- I got mad relationship skills, bro.

348
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,046
Let me know
if you need trendy places to propose.

349
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,211
I think you're getting
a little bit ahead of yourself. Little bit.

350
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,920
Rob. You gotta keep up.

351
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,687
Hey, you look busy.
Is that the Declan case?

352
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,601
There was a funny development on that.
Matt lstook, he, uh, filed a police report.

353
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,802
He said the Hood harassed him
last night.

354
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,844
And that's funny, because I gave
my daughter lstook's name.

355
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,850
- Dad, I--
- He's a vigilante.

356
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,242
He's a damn criminal,
and you working with him.

357
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,206
- That makes you an accessory.
- I'm trying to save an innocent man's life.

358
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,042
No, you're breaking the law.

359
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,802
I wouldn't have to if the police
had done their job right in the first place.

360
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,248
I asked you how you got this case.
You lied to me straight to my face. Eh?

361
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,008
I thought you and I didn't do that.

362
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,251
Guess I was wrong.

363
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,841
Your Honor,
the mere existence of the file proves...

364
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,726
...that Mr. lstook perjured himself
for Jason Brodeur's benefit.

365
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,321
That's slander.
Jared Swanstrom, Your Honor.

366
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,761
I represent Jason Brodeur
and Brodeur Chemical.

367
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,321
The interests of justice requires you
to stay the defendant's execution...

368
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,171
...pending exploration
of the newly discovered evidence.

369
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,011
Ours isn't a court ofjustice,
Ms. Lance.

370
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,440
It's a court of law.

371
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,160
And under the law,
your evidence is sufficient...

372
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,124
...to warrant a stay of execution.

373
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,169
Your motion for habeas corpus
is denied.

374
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,125
This isn't over. I've got the loose end now.

375
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,082
And no matter what happens, I'll pull
on it until your whole world unravels.

376
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,488
STOCK".
Declan's lawyer is pulling me into this.

377
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,446
I'm gonna go to prison, if not for
murder, then this dumping thing!

378
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,961
That won't happen.
There are steps we can take.

379
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,043
You saw her. She's going after me!

380
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,808
She'll wanna meet with her client
after what happened in court today.

381
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,202
We have friends up in Iron Heights.

382
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,722
Prison can be a dangerous place.

383
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,048
We're not done yet.

384
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,922
I'm an attorney. Trust me, we're done.

385
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,161
What do you need to free
Peter Declan?

386
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,209
At this point...

387
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,171
...nothing short of a signed
confession from Brodeur.

388
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,881
- Where are you going?
- To get a confession.

389
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,770
The company Mrs. Queen-- Steele.

390
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,566
Mrs. Queen-Steele. Is she hyphenate?

391
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,967
She seems like a woman
who would hyphenate.

392
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,087
Right. The company she invested in
doesn't exist.

393
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,442
- I don't understand.
- There was no investment.

394
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,803
The money was used to set up
an offshore LLC called Tempest.

395
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,367
Don't recall the name being under
Queen Consolidated.

396
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,570
It's not. There's nothing registered
with the secretary of state.

397
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,445
No federal tax records,
no patent applications filed.

398
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,248
But in 2009 Tempest purchased
a warehouse in Starling City.

399
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,803
- Enough moping.
- Mm.

400
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,285
You quit. It's done.
My advice would be to move on.

401
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,960
Ah. If it were only that easy.

402
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,606
Except it is.
Personal security is dangerous.

403
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,327
Your nephew already lost his father.
He can't lose his uncle too.

404
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,243
Does it ever bother you they never
caught the guy who killed Andy?

405
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,924
You know, when I was in Afghanistan,
I had a job and I did it.

406
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,446
When I could, I'd help out
the people there so that...

407
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,884
...in some small way, when I left,
I could believe I left it a better place.

408
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,809
But ever since I've been home,
all I do is protect punks...

409
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,245
...and spoiled one-percenters.
I miss feeling like I'm making a difference.

410
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,728
Then get out of personal security
and go do something you believe in.

411
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,567
- Yeah, what if it's wrong?
- John, if you believe in something...

412
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,489
...how can it be wrong?

413
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,489
Jason Brodeur.

414
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,444
- What do you want?
- You'll confess...

415
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,126
...you arranged to have
Peter Declan's wife murdered.

416
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,209
What, so I can take his place
in prison?

417
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,209
So you can avoid the death penalty.

418
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,041
Except if I'm dead, well, then you got
no one to pin Camille's murder on.

419
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,891
You need me
to exonerate Peter Declan.

420
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,527
Maybe you could try to force me
to sign a confession or something-- Ahh!

421
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,324
That might be difficult.

422
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,045
My hand!

423
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,170
Just answer it.

424
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,169
- What?
- It's Ankov.

425
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,249
It's going down. One hour.

426
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,046
What's going down in an hour?

427
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,286
What?

428
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,250
Let's just say Peter Declan's
execution is getting moved up.

429
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,251
Okay, you have to listen to me.
We still have a shot.

430
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,450
You remember the friend I mentioned?
The one who believes in you?

431
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,244
He's working on something.

432
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,766
I told you, Jason Brodeur is powerful.

433
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,967
Time to unlock the cages.

434
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,286
I've been here before.

435
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,007
These lawyers holding out
these little nuggets of hope.

436
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,002
What?

437
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,810
What the--?

438
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,401
Secure all corners in cell block C.

439
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,126
The warden is setting up
a secure perimeter in C block.

440
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,409
- Stay here, Ms. Lance.
- Wait!

441
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,404
Let's go.

442
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,645
GO, go!

443
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,971
Stop!

444
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,840
- Open up the generator area!
- Laurel.

445
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,843
Ms. Lance, stay back. Area secured.

446
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,484
Laurel.

447
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,810
Sweetie.

448
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,370
- What are you...?
- I'm all right.

449
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,887
- You sure?
- I'm sorry about what I said to you.

450
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,401
You were right.
Brodeur's bodyguard confessed...

451
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,166
...to Camille Declan's murder.
We got the wrong guy.

452
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,201
But listen to me.
I'm right too, about him.

453
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,125
He's dangerous. He's outside the law.

454
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,566
I know.

455
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,928
He's a killer.

456
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,043
He would have killed that man.
I looked in his eyes.

457
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,925
It's like he had no remorse.

458
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,920
Hey-

459
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,449
Please.

460
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,889
I'm starving.

461
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,367
I never killed anything before.

462
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,882
I'm sorry.

463
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,568
Let's get you home, sweetie.

464
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,081
How did he get
into that prison anyway, huh?

465
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,011
A grown man in an outfit and a hood...

466
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,487
...that kind of stands out a little,
doesn't it?

467
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,160
He actually wasn't wearing
the outfit this time.

468
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,449
He was in a prison guard uniform
and a ski mask.

469
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,085
- What?
- Nothing.

470
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,725
I just had an idea.

471
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,442
Get in the car.

472
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,042
Okay, here's the security footage
from the Exchange Building shooting.

473
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,330
- I've already scrubbed through all of it.
- Yeah, well, we're gonna do it again.

474
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,608
When you went through
the security tapes...

475
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,928
...you were looking for a guy
in a green hood?

476
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,249
And what do you want me to look for,
a man in a wig and a tutu?

477
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,161
I want you to look for anything that's
out of the ordinary, okay? Just look.

478
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,409
Hey, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait.
Go back 10 seconds. What is that?

479
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,203
I'll be damned.

480
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,165
Play that again.

481
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,925
Thank you, Laurel.

482
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,400
Don't thank me.

483
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,969
Thank Brodeur's bodyguard Ankov
for flipping him.

484
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,927
I think there's someone that wants
to see you.

485
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,565
Izzy.

486
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,931
At least five federal, state,
and local agencies...

487
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,761
...are seeking millions of dollars in fines
and environmental cleanup costs...

488
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,962
...from Brodeur Chemical.

489
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,730
New facts have come to light
that Brodeur Chemical employee...

490
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,686
...Camille Declan had discovered
Brodeur was illegally disposing waste...

491
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,123
...and had collected a file of evidence
against her employer...

492
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
...before her murder in 2007.

493
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,964
Peter Decian, who was convicted
of killing his wife...

494
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,687
...has been released
and the case has been reopened.

495
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,642
Yeah. Bird. I know.

496
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,003
Shengcun not mean "bird."

497
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,561
Shengcun mean "survive."

498
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,370
You speak English?

499
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:20,008
You want survive this place,
bird not last thing you kill.

500
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,524
And forget her.

501
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,087
You look at that all day,
you not survive this place.

502
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,807
You wanted to see me?

503
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,005
You look nervous, Moira.

504
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,681
Do I have a reason to be?

505
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,283
We all do.

506
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,567
A modern-day Robin Hood.

507
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,770
What? Are you worried that
your net worth makes you a target?

508
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,208
Jason Brodeur.

509
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,845
Adam Hunt.

510
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,804
Warren Patel.

511
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,048
Tell me you see a connection, Moira.

512
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,244
- He's not targeting the rich.
- No, he's not.

513
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,721
He's targeting the list.

514
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,451
You here for the bodyguard position?
Because the new guy just quit.

515
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,729
No, I'm not.

516
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,285
I'm here about the other position.

517
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,928
Just to be clear,
I'm not signing on to be a sidekick.

518
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,964
But you're right.
Fighting for this city needs to be done...

519
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,447
...and you'll do this with
or without me.

520
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,045
- Yeah.
- But with me...

521
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,322
...there'll be fewer casualties,
including you.

522
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,166
Diggle, I'm not looking for
anybody to save me.

523
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,045
Maybe not, but you need someone
just the same.

524
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,368
You are fighting a war, Queen...

525
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,131
...except you have no idea
what war does to you.

526
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,160
How it scrapes off
little pieces of your soul.

527
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,328
And you need someone
to remind you...

528
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,045
...of who you are,
not this thing you're becoming.

529
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,325
- Oliver Queen.
- What is this?

530
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,842
- You can't barge in here.
- I got a badge and a gun that say different.

531
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,646
- What the hell is going on?
- Oliver, what's happening?

532
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,083
You're under arrest for obstruction
ofjustice, aggravated assault...

533
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,204
- Walter, stop them.
-...trespassing, acting as a vigilante...

534
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,011
- Are you out of your mind?
-...and murder.

535
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,330
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right...
