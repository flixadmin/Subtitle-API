00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,875
[child 1] Come on, this way.

00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,208
[child 1] Mom!

10
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,624
Rose!

11
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,708
[Rose] Mom, where are you?

12
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,312
[child 3] Mommy!

13
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,958
[Rose] Help us! Mom!

[sighs]

20
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:16,750
[parent] Dear Lord,
we ask that you keep the storms at bay.

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,833
Calm the dust.

22
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,333
We thank you for bringing Henry this job.

23
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,583
Preserve those who travel.

24
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,875
Bring Henry in safety
to his journey's end.

25
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,333
Let him earn enough to finish our home.

<i>Plant a crop.</i>

27

<i>Help me.</i>

28
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:41,667
<i>Help me to see the gifts you've given me
rather than the things you've taken away.</i>

29
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,792
<i>Help me to keep
Rose and Ollie healthy and safe.</i>

<i>Don't let them fall ill
like the other children.</i>

31
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,875
Rose, toss down some hay, sweetheart.

32
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,375
Just a little.

33
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,042
We have to make it last.

34
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,457
<i>Bruise me, bloody me,</i>

35
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,500

won't touch a hair on their heads.</i>

36
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,125
<i>Please kiss Ada for me.</i>

37
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,854
<i>Promise her that I will
fend off my human proneness</i>

38

39

<i>All of us.</i>

[parent] <i>And when I lie awake tonight,
banish worry from my heart.</i>

<i>Reward me with peaceful black sleep.</i>

42
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,208
Amen.

43
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
[sighs] I asked your daddy to patch this.

44
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,208
There's just never enough time.

45
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,167
You think he'll see Philadelphia?

46
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,042
No, it's too far east.

47
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,583
Well, I wanna see it.

48
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,791
Hmm.

49
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,500
[Rose] I wanna see what it's like.

50
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,333
Maybe next summer.

51
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,958
If the crops come in.

52
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,833
Lock this behind me.

53
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,667
[Rose] Follow my finger as I read, okay?

54
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,707
"The Grey Man locked his lovely wife

55
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,667
and five children in the bedroom,
then gathered embers from the fire.

56
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,833
He aimed to burn the six angels up,
but fate had one more victim in mind.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,458
As the flames leaped higher,

58
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,417
the Grey Man
realized his shirt was caught.

59
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,292
It was no use.

60
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,208
The flames consumed him.

61
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:23,542
Now, during a dust storm,
the Grey Man's ashes blow together.

62
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,708
He walks the night.

63
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,583
If you don't wear your mask,
you'll breathe him in,

64
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,750
and he'll make you do terrible things."

65
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,792
[breathing heavily]

66
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,208
[parent sighs]

67
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,625
[Henry] You could come with me.

68
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,125
[sighs]

69
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,875
I won't put them in a tent,
lose what little we have.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I won't leave her out there.

71
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,250
Alone.

72
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,333
[gulps]

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083

[knocking]

76
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,792
[neighbor] So, how'd
Henry get off last week?

77
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,624
- Well...
- Yeah?

78
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,292
There were quite a few heading out.

79
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,042
Last man standing.

80
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,625
- [neighbor] Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

81
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,958
Just... It's hard to keep up with.
[chuckles]

82
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,208
[coughing]

83
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,332
He's been at that all night.

84
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,791
Is it that cold that was going around?

85
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,625
It started out like that,
but it's just... it's just gotten worse.

86
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,625
- It's pneumonia, Dr. Cox says.
- [child coughs]

87
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,445
[neighbor] Oh, it's not catching.

88
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,250
Doctor says it's
just too much dust in the air.

89
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,333
What are we meant to do about that?

90
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,958
It's a battle.

91
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,250

[inhales deeply]

96
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,624
[parent] Thomas has been poorly.

97
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,458
[churchgoer 1] Well, they should go see
that faith healer over in Guymon.

98
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,958
He pulled the arthritis
right out of an old man's fingers.

99
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,167
Bones just straightened right out.

100
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:40,250
[chuckles]

101
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,083
It's good you brought the girls, Margaret.

102
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,917
Why is that?

103
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,625
I guess you haven't heard about Calabash.

104
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,332
The daddy said the door was locked.

105
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,875
But the drifter
got into the house somehow.

106
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,166
Ransacked the pantry.

107
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,229
They found him
eating crackers over the baby.

108
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,292
No, Birdie,
he'd already finished the crackers.

109
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,000
He was just looking at the baby.

110
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,707
[stammers] He must have been hungry.

111
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,500
[churchgoer 1] Hunger don't explain
staring at a baby like that.

112
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,457
[Birdie] Just staring.

113
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,792
[churchgoer 1] And it certainly don't
explain what he did after.

114
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,000
[smacks lips] He tied the daddy up

115
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,417
and made him watch
while he killed the mama and the kids.

116
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,958
[Birdie] Gutted like hogs.

117
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,000
Can't keep up with chores as it is.

118
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,667
How am I supposed
to watch out for fiends too?

119
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,250
You keep your guard up.

120
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,750
Always.

121
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,227
[churchgoer 2] Did they ever catch him?

122
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,458
The drifter.

123
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,082
No, not yet.

124
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,957
And I can't figure it.

125
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,832
Nobody saw him leave.

126
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,375
It's like he just melted into the dust.

127
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,417
- [door slams]
- [all gasp]

[wind howling]

129
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,625
[churchgoer 3] Oh, sweet Jesus.

130
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,292
[Margaret] Goodness. [sighs]

131
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:16,250
- You're not leaving today.
- [horse whinnies]

132
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,332
[neighbor] Trying to.

133
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
[Margaret] The wind is terrible.
There must be a storm coming.

134
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,749
[neighbor] There's always a storm coming.

135
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,833
But people die in them and
you'll be exposed on that cart, Esther.

136
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,000
Unprotected.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,458
All you need to do is make sure
Thomas and Jacob stay inside.

138
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,332
Clean. Seal the house.

139
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,500
[sighs] Even so,
it seeps through everything.

140
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,667
Keep finding it in the oddest places.

141
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,291
[breathes shakily]

142
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,833
I had a dream last night that, um...

143
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,583
He would not stop coughing.

144
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,874
[Thomas coughing]

145
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,958
I took a handkerchief,
and I stuffed it in his mouth.

146
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:58,083
Over and over and over.

147
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,583
[Thomas coughs]

148
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,917
[sniffles]

149
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,625
Sorry. [cries]

150
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,542
I just got to get my boys outta here.

151
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,375
[Thomas coughing]

152
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,917
[horse whinnies]

153
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,917
[Jacob] Whoa. Easy. Easy.

154
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,458
[rattling]

155
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:38,083
[Margaret, Rose panting]

[panting]

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,958
[Margaret] Girls, grab the twine
or you'll get lost in the dust!

161
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,917
[Rose] Where's Ollie?

162
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:15,542
I can't see her.

163
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,083

[breathing shakily]

167
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,625
[Margaret] What man?

168
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,208
Stay here.

169
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
[Rose] Mom, don't go out there.

170
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:35,167

00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,167
The Grey Man?

174
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,875
You scared her with this, Rose.

175
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,042
Didn't I tell you to get rid of this?

176
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,167
Yeah.

177
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,542
This should help with the dust, okay?

178
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,375
[Rose] What about that man?

179
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,541
That drifter that disappeared.

180
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,333
There isn't anyone out there.

181
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,083
Understand?

182
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,208
I'm taking this.

183
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,332
[sighs]

184
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,083
[creaking]

185
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,667
Will you tell us about the wheat?

186
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,500
[sighs]

187
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,833
The first year we planted,
it just took hold.

188
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:31,542
When the wind blew,
the weeds would wave like the ocean.

189
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,208
And one day, we played hide-and-seek
in the tall grass for hours.

190
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,875
Come on.

191
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,291
Hurry up. [laughs]

192
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:51,083
[Margaret] <i>You could hide
inches away, and I couldn't see you.</i>

[kisses]

198
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:09,958
Good night.

204
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,542
[panting] What? What happened?

205
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,333
[pants] Ollie was right.
Someone's outside.

206

[creaking]

207
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,625

[churchgoer 1] It's Jacob.

222
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,000
Esther's boy.

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,542
[sheriff] Cart must have gotten
overturned in the storm last night.

[villagers whispering]

225
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,874
Where's Esther?

226
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know.

227
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,208
I found Thomas
hiding under the cart alone,

228
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,000
so scared I could barely
get him to come out.

229
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,500
Probably left him there when
she went to go look for Jacob.

[Birdie] The Lord

[churchgoer 1 speaks indistinctly]

239
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,500
[Birdie] But he's a wise provider.

240
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:49,582
[sniffles]

241
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,457
All you can do is hold faith.

242
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,083
Faith that He has a plan for Jacob.

243
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:59,625
A plan more important
than we may ever understand.

244
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,333
I guess some things...
[sniffles]...are just out of our hands.

245
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,792
Some things aren't.

246
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:11,125
You can't just have faith
that He'll do something,

247
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,000
that it's part of the plan or they'll die.

248
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,187
We'll all be buried.

249
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:17,708
Sounds like pride to me.

250
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,458
Better than burying another child.

251
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,667
I tried to leave.

252
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:23,750
In a storm.

253
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,292
[Esther]
I can't change the weather, Margaret.

254
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:27,708
I can't make it rain.

255
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,562
[cries] What should I do?

256
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:30,917
You might try sweeping.

257
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,917

[breathes deeply]

260
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,083
Fit as a couple of fiddles.

261
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,458
It just started bleeding.

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,292
It wouldn't stop.

263
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,333
Well, air is dry.

264
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,125
That'd be my guess.

265
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,375
Your guess?

266
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,292
[sighs]

267
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,833
After Ollie and Ada, I just...

268
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:56,417
I worry.

269
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,583
Ada used to have
nosebleeds just like this.

270
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,583
Hmm.

271
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Esther mentioned something
about the dust making Thomas ill.

272
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,875
The air.

273
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,000
[Dr. Cox exhales]
I got some masks for sale.

274
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,417
Might help.

275
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,458
[sighs]

276
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,125
You're taking your sleeping aid?

277
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:27,582
Mm-hmm.

278
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,957
[Dr. Cox] Well, you want my advice?

279
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:33,000
I say keep the house sealed
best you can, wear the masks.

280
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,333
Relax.

281
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,958
[wind howling]

282
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,208
[Rose] Mom, are you awake?

283
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,833
We're not even supposed to
sleep in the same room as you.

284
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,500
[Margaret] There was only enough fabric
to seal one room.

285
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,125
What if it happens again?
What if you stop sleeping?

286
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:26,583
Don't you understand that
the dust seeps through every opening?

287
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:31,542
That's why your cousin, Thomas, is sick
and it's why your nose is bleeding.

288
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,792
Well, I want to leave.
I want to go to Dad.

289
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,958
Well, when your father sends more money,
we'll take the next train.

290
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,333
I promise.

291
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,917
[Margaret] Has anyone had any mail?

292
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,583
We're going to try to leave
when Henry's next letter arrives.

293
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:16,499
Well, I guess you hadn't heard.
Service has been halted indefinitely.

294
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,145
Dust built up so much, a train in Woodward
skipped plumb off the tracks.

295
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,792
Killed every soul on board except for
one donkey in the freight car.

296
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,417
[chuckles]
You're stuck with us, looks like.

297
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,708
I see.

298
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,917

[sighs]

300
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,833
Any word on that drifter?

301
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,708
Well, now they're wondering
if the daddy did it himself.

302
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,167
Killed those kids and made up
the intruder wholesale.

303
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,333
Our neighbor said he'd been
acting off right before,

304
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>like a different man entirely.</i>

305
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,458
<i>Think about it.</i>

306
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>No one saw that drifter coming or going.</i>

307
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,125
Put your nightgown on, sweetheart.

[door opens]

311
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,167
- Didn't I ask you to tie the doors?
- I did.

312
00:28:47,168 --> 00:28:49,082
[Margaret] That cow is keeping us alive.

313
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,667
She's already starving
and something could have gotten to her.

314
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,167
- She could have died.
- [Rose] I tied it.

315
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:54,687
Well, then it has to be tighter. What?

316
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:57,416
[Margaret] Stop.

317
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:00,667
No more Grey Man, understand?

318
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,333
You need to finish your chores.

Rose.

322
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,375
Toss down some hay, would you?

323
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
[scoffs]

324
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,708
I'm sorry we argued, but...

[panting]

329
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,667
In the barn, who did you see?

330
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,458
[panting]

331
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,167
But I thought you said he wasn't real.

332
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,667
That doesn't mean no one's out th...

333
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,750
[breathing heavily]

334
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,583
Stay.

335
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,583
[Margaret breathing heavily]

336
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:28,458
Come out or I will burn this whole thing
to the ground, I swear to God.

337
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,833
[breathing heavily]

338
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,957
[gasps]

339
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,042
[breathes heavily]

340
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,708
I told you to stay downstairs.

341
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,708
[Rose] We're scared.

342
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,542
[wood creaking]

343
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,500
[Rose gasps]

344
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,500
[gasps]

345
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,417
Stay back, girls.

346
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:13,292
[breathing heavily]

347
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,375
Who are you?

348
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,583
Name's Brother Wallace Grady.

349
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,250
I mean you no harm, ma'am.

350
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:29,958
Just needed shelter.

351
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,458
Henry told me y'all had this barn.

352
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:35,624
Henry? [breathes shakily]

353
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,583
Don't you recognize his jacket?

354
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:38,667
[sighs]

355
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:40,167
Did you hurt him?

356
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,000
Of course not, ma'am.
I'm a man of the cloth.

357
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:49,708
I, uh, stopped through the works detail
on my way west

358
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,417
and, Brother Henry, he give me this,

359
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,000
and he asked me to check in on y'all.

360
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,749
Why not just knock on the door?

361
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,917
That was my intention, ma'am,
soon as I had a chance to recover.

362
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:08,042
See, I got caught in that storm
on account of my bad leg.

363
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:10,707
Thought I looked too poorly.

364
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:14,125
I didn't want to scare your girls,
uh, scare you.

365
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,167
Rose, right?

366
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,458
And you're Margaret.

367
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,875
Henry would have told me.

368
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,500
The mail is slow going
with the trains out.

369
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,541
[panting] You have to go. Now.

370
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:42,083
I could earn my keep.
People need the Word of God these days.

371
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:45,625
- People need rain.
- [Wallace] One follows the other, ma'am.

372
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,417
Just get out! Out!

373
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,875
It's just your cow's starving,
which means you're about to be.

374
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,333
Right?

375
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,332
[Rose breathing shakily]

376
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:05,125
[Wallace] The milk's dried up.
I could get her producing again.

377
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,457
[Rose gasps]

378
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,207
- Okay. It's okay, it's okay.
- Oh, darlin'.

379
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,542
- [breathes shakily, spits]
- [Margaret] You're okay.

380
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:13,957
[Rose] Mom, help.

381
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,792
- [breathes heavily]
- Breathe. Breathe.

382
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,457
Stay back.

383
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,792
- Ma'am, I can help...
- [Rose breathes heavily] Mom.

384
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,875
...but I'd have to touch her.

385
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,000
Why?

386
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,875
- I lay hands.
- [Rose breathes heavily]

387
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,333
I can heal. Truly.

388
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,292
Even if you don't believe,
what could it hurt?

389
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Margaret.

390
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,333
[Rose breathes heavily]

391
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,708
[coughs]

392
00:34:56,542 --> 00:35:00,750
- [whimpers, breathing heavily]
- [speaks indistinctly]

393
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,333
[Rose groaning]

394
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,124
[muffled] Mom, help!

395
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,333
- [groaning]
- Let her go.

396
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,667
Let her go!

397
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,167
- [Wallace grunts]
- [Rose cries]

398
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,865
- [Wallace groaning]
- [Margaret] What did you do to her?

399
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,875
[panting]

400
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,458
Mom.

401
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,208
It stopped.

402
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,458
[breathes heavily]

403
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,833
[Wallace] I'll go. I'll go.

404
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,292
I just gotta rest.

405
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,167
[exhales deeply]

406
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,250
You said you could get our cow producing.

407
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,292
How?

408
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,125
[pants]

409
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,292
Tumbleweeds will soak this water right up.
Yield a lot of feed.

410
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:33,333
I sleep with this,
and I know how to use it.

411
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:35,708
Do you understand?

412
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:41,792
[sighs]

413
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,750
People will talk if I let you stay.

414
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,958
I could keep out of sight for a bit.

415
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,292
Stick to the barn.

416
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,292
[Rose] Did he heal me?

417
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,375
I don't know.

418
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:42,083
- [thunder rumbling]
- [gasps, panting]

419
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,375
[gasps] Rose!

420
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,625
[thunder rumbling]

421
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,667
[Birdie] Well, I hate you, Margaret.

422
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,165
What a fine hand you have.

423
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:12,458
Oh. [chuckles]
It's just our dream for the house.

424
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,000
Missed you in church this week, Margaret.

425
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,583
We were worried about you.

426
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,917
[Rose] Mom, it's Thomas.

427
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
[Thomas coughing]

428
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,707
[churchgoers chatter]

429
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:35,417
[Margaret] Where's Esther?
How did he get here by himself?

430
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:36,499
[Birdie] Oh, poor thing.

431
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,583
- Birdie, go fetch the sheriff.
- [Thomas coughing]

432
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,458
[Birdie] This is heartbreaking.

433
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,042
[sheriff]
She's not looking after him, Margaret.

434
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,958
Maybe find out if it's
a short-term grief kind of aberration

435
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,250
or something more serious.

436
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,542
[flies buzzing]

437
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,000
Esther. It's Margaret.

438
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,000
Esther?

439
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:17,375
[Esther breathing heavily]

440
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,333
[Margaret] Remember when Ada passed?

441
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:31,000
For a long while,
I thought I might just join her.

442
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,083
But you have to think of your other child.

443
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,583
His health.

444
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:46,167
The man has... been looking after him.

445
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,625
Or was that a dream?

446
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,458
[flies buzzing]

447
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,708
Have some water.

448
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,833
Just a sip.

449
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,083
How long have you been lying here?

450
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,167
[coughing]

451
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,292
She... She's not fit. [cries]

452
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,082
You sure?

453
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,125
I'd take him,
but we can't feed him. [sniffs]

454
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,833
Come with me, little Thomas.
[grunts] Yeah.

455
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,707
- [Esther] Margaret. [cries]
- [sighs]

456
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:53,583
[sighs] Thank you.
Thank you for visiting me.

457
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,125
[cries]

458
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,583
[Margaret] It's all right.
You just have to take care of yourself.

459
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,083
[sighs] What's going on?

460
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,680
[sheriff] Just for a little while, Esther.

461
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,750
What's for a little while?

462
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,000
Just until you get back on your feet.

463
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,667
Are you taking him? Where you taking him?

464
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,333
[sheriff] I won't... Oh. Hey.
Let's just take a moment here.

465
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,083
[cries]

466
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,041
[Esther]
He's my son. He's all I've got left.

467
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,958
You're no different than me,
you know. You know that?

468
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,125
You're no different than me.
You always thought you were.

469
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,167
You'll be just like me, you hear me?

470
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,707
I'll show you what it's like.

471
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:44,125
Look at me. You'll be just like me.

472
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:45,874
You see me?

473
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,667
You'll be just like me.
You'll see. You'll be sorry.

474
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,583
Don't take him from me.

475
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,292
[Wallace] <i>"Count it all joy
when you fall into various trials,</i>

476
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,542
knowing that the testing of your faith
produces patience."

477
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,208
It's lovely.

478
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,374
Yours?

479
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,562
It was my mother's.

480
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,750
[Margaret] Hmm.

481
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,792
Is she how you got into the church?

482
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:27,792
Partly.

483
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:32,333
My daddy was a preacher.
He told me I had the touch young.

484
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:36,625
All my siblings do. I have four sisters.

485
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:39,417
Where are they now?

486
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:45,167
[sighs] Two are in Texas
and, uh, scarlet fever took the others

487
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:46,833
while I was off spreading the Word.

488
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,917
Ollie had it. Scarlet fever. And Ada.

489
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:20,667
When they went into quarantine,
Ada never stopped calling out for me.

490
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,958
I clawed the door separating us until
my nails were ripped away from the quick.

491
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,208
Temporary parting is a burden
of our earthly lives.

492
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:39,792
But there's a reunion
that lasts an eternity.

493
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:43,292
You believe that?

494
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,292
I have to.

495
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:48,958
Don't have a choice.

496
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,749
[Rose laughing]

497
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,417
Those girls are lucky to have you.

498
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,042
You don't think that?

499
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:16,833
After Ada, my sleep was fitful.

500
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,333
And I... [softly] I'd do things.

501
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:32,000
No mail today. But the letter carrier said
a haze is dropping in.

502
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,958
[Wallace] God above, I thank you.

503
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,458
I thank you for the warmth
of the Bellum family.

504
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,333
You connected us through Brother Henry,
and for that, I am eternally grateful.

505
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,625
Thank you for Rose's continued health,

506
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,792
and we ask that you hold little Ollie
in your ever-loving light.

507
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:09,833
I'm reminded of a verse
that my father taught me.

508
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,667
"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,

509
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:19,292
but this happened so that the works of God
might be displayed in Him."

510
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,917
Thank you for this nourishment.

511
00:46:22,918 --> 00:46:25,104
And thank you for this.

512
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:27,291
[Margaret] This came today?

513
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:29,666
- Ooh, is that from Daddy?
- [Rose] Mm-hmm.

514
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,625
- Mm-mmm. Next one, little...
- [Wallace] What's he got to say?

515
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:32,582
Stop!

516
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,000
- [Margaret] Rose.
- Well, I...

517
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,417
Hey.

518
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,875
[clears throat, chuckles]

519
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,062
[chuckles]

520
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,250
"Dear girls,

521
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:57,500
my first hope is that
you can... d... deci... "[mutters]

522
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,542
[Margaret] Decipher.

523
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,708
- [Rose] Decipher.
- [Margaret] Mm-hmm.

524
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,792
- "Decipher my chicken scratch."
- [Margaret chuckles]

525
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:09,458
"My second hope is that these
blades of grass will still be green

526
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,375
- by the time they reach you."
- [Margaret] Mmm.

527
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:13,041
[Rose] "Just know that when I picked them,

528
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,500
they were the brightest thing
you ever saw." [chuckles]

529
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,208
"This next bit's just for Mama, girls."

530
00:47:19,209 --> 00:47:20,292
[Margaret] Oh.

531
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,500
Come on. [chuckles]

532
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,792
Y'all telling secrets over there?

533
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:52,958
Now, Rose.

534
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:56,708
Put her down.

535
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:02,042
[Wallace] That seems like a bad idea.

536
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:03,958
Who are you?

537
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,916
Rose, read the letter. Aloud.

538
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,957
[stammers] "I'm fine, Margaret,
but my jacket was took.

539
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:15,625
Along with the letter in its pocket,
money, and sweets for the girls.

540
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,000
There was a preacher hanging about,
asked to stay the night.

541
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,542
Next day, my bunkmate didn't
come back from lunch.

542
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:28,917
Found him with his head cracked open
like an egg, boots pulled off his feet.

543
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:33,750
Nobody knows how the preacher made off.
Like he just vanished."

544
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,125
I wouldn't have hurt y'all.

545
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,457
[Rose whimpers]

546
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,167
- Where's the money?
- [Wallace] Gone.

547
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,874
Where's yours?

548
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,458
Gone. Let her go.

549
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,625
I will. In exchange for that letter.

550
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,292
We better hold on to it.
[breathes shakily]

551
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:56,667
See what the sheriff thinks.

552
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,958
[gunshot]

553
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,458
[crashes]

554
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,374
Y'all would've starved without me.

555
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,750
Without you, his first letter
would have gotten to us.

556
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,291
We could have left!

557
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,875
[Wallace] "Do not neglect
to show hospitality to strangers,

558
00:49:28,876 --> 00:49:31,250
for thereby some have
entertained angels, unaware."

559
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,583
- Angels.
- [Wallace] I fixed her, didn't I?

560
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,083
How about I undo it?

561
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:37,957
Put her back the way she was.

562
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:41,458
[breathes heavily]
Fixed her? You're a con.

563
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,167
Your father, the preacher, a con too?

564
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,792
My father, he'd like you.

565
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,917
Get out.

566
00:49:58,458 --> 00:49:59,750
Get out!

567
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,167
[Wallace] I'd be scared too.

568
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,542
You're out here all alone.

569
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,333
Don't know when a man could come by.

570
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,250
A few locks. Some twine?

571
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:37,083
That's not gonna stop me. [chuckles]

572
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,250
That's not gonna stop the Grey Man.

573
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,083
[glass shatters]

574
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,333
I'll be seeing y'all.

575
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,333
[Ollie breathes shakily]

576
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,750
[Margaret breathing shakily]

577
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:04,917
[door creaks]

578
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:22,000
[creaking continues]

579
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,792
[huffs, moos]

580
00:52:58,417 --> 00:52:59,417
[Ollie whispers] Mommy.

581
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,250
[Margaret] Ollie.

582
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,833
Did you say that?

583
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,333
[gasps]

584
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,125
What are you doing, Esther?

585
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,750
You'll be just like me.

586
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:47,625
You'll see. You'll breathe him in. He'll
make you do [distorted] terrible things.

587
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,250
[screaming]

588
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:59,333
Mama. Mama. Mama.

589
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,042
[whimpers]

590
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:07,125
Were you outside all night?

591
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:34,875
[wind whistling]

592
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:01,000
[furniture dragging]

593
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,667
[wood creaking]

594
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,750
- [Wallace] <i>Margaret.</i>
- [gasps]

595
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:30,250
<i>It's not gonna stop.</i>

596
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,833
[door slams]

597
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,875
- [pounding on door]
- [Rose] Mom! Get us out!

598
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:04,207
[sobbing] Mom! Mommy! Mom!

599
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:07,875
- [sobbing, screaming]
- Open the door! Unlock it, please!

600
00:56:07,876 --> 00:56:09,875
- [Rose] Mom! [sobbing]
- Is he in there?

601
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,458
- [Rose] Get us out!
- [panting]

602
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:17,916
Mommy! [sobbing]

603
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,667
[Margaret] Get out of here! Go!

604
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,082
[sizzling]

605
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,083
[panting]

606
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,708
[Rose] Did you knock the lamp over?

607
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:44,042
[Margaret] No, it's Wallace.

608
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:45,500
How's he doing it?

609
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,833
I was up the whole night.

610
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,750
And the doors are still locked.

611
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,667
Unless he doesn't have to use doors.

612
00:56:58,668 --> 00:56:59,792
Mom, what do you mean?

613
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,875
[breathes heavily]

614
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,000
I should have sealed under this door.

615
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:15,458
Mom. But the... the Grey Man's
just a story, like... like you said.

616
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:18,167
I-I lent Wallace the book one day.

617
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,750
But he healed you,

618
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:33,167
right?

619
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:39,292
And he came into a locked house
while I stood watch.

620
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,875
[knocks on door]

621
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:42,875
[shushing]

622
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,317
[whispering] That is what he wants.

623
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,333
Go get your sister.

624
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:53,750
Slide fabric under the door
and don't come out.

625
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,333
[unlocks door]

626
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,250
Hi.

627
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,875
[Margaret] You're looking well.

628
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,667
What are you doing here?

629
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:11,542
I've come to apologize, Margaret.

630
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:18,875
The things that I was thinking and...
[sighs]...the things I said, I'm sorry.

631
00:58:18,876 --> 00:58:20,082
We're family.

632
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:23,625
Can't we put this all behind us
and just start fresh? I miss you.

633
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,583
I miss the girls and...

634
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,042
Well, you know...

635
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,583
folks are starting to worry.

636
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:35,208
They haven't seen you in a while.

637
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,833
It's difficult with such low light.
[sighs]

638
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:56,000
It's much easier to breathe though.

639
00:58:58,042 --> 00:58:59,916
[creaking]

640
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:02,291
[wind whistling]

641
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,125
I wonder if it might help to get out more.

642
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,291
It's wild what happens upstairs
when you're allowed to stew. [chuckles]

643
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:14,583
It might be good to take the lid off
and let some of that steam out.

644
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:17,499
You know,
I've been trying to get out more too.

645
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,250
I've been working with the preacher,
praying to get my head right.

646
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,208
I've been visiting Thomas...

647
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,749
[knocking]

648
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,083
[wind whistling]

649
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:28,625
Margaret?

650
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,333
You might could start
with the dance tonight.

651
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:39,000
Take it from me, you don't want people
speculating the way they have been.

652

You might want to show 'em you're okay.

Esther said
people were worried about us, so...

659
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,042
We have to put on a good face and go.

660
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,208
Well, Sheriff Bell will be there.

661
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,917
We could tell him about Wallace,

662
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:16,667
what's been happening.

663
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,958
Without the letter from your father...

664
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,166
If the sheriff thought
something was wrong, or...

665
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:33,167
[voice cracking] He could take you both.
Promise me you won't mention it.

You'll still look perfect.

It's not just the dress.

What are you...

690
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:31,957
Stop!

691
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,458
It's all right, Rose.

692
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,625
Daddy will be home soon,
and we'll sort everything out.

693

Until then, I just need to go

[breathing shakily]

818
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,542
[Rose] Mom? [breathing shakily]

819
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,667
[Wallace] You're asleep.

820
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:02,708
It's you.

821
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,750
You're sleepwalking again.

822
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,791
It's me.

823
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:11,333
It's Rose.

824
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:14,437
[breathes shakily]

825
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:16,958
Mom, it's me! Wake up.

826
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:19,583
- [Wallace] Don't shoot, it's Rose!
- [Rose] <i>Don't shoot, it's Rose!</i>

827
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:21,417
- It's your daughter!
<i>- It's your daughter!</i>

828
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,332
Don't shoot.

829
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,792
- [Wallace] Put the gun down.
- [Rose] <i>Put the gun down.</i>

830
01:14:25,793 --> 01:14:26,707
[Rose sobs]

831
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:29,250
- [Wallace] Mommy, I'm really scared.
- [Rose] <i>Mommy, I'm really scared.</i>

832
01:14:29,251 --> 01:14:30,707
- You have to trust me!
<i>- You have to trust me!</i>

833
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,958
- You have to wake up!
<i>- You have to wake up!</i>

834
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:33,125
You're not Rose.

835
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,124
Mom.

836
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:37,937
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

837
01:14:37,938 --> 01:14:41,750
- Mama! Ma...
- Mama!

838
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:44,208
[sobbing]

[breathing shakily]

840
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:53,042
Rose, what are you doing out here?

841
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,833
[sobs] The Grey Man isn't haunting us.

842
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,292
What are you talking about?

843
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:01,958
It's you.

844
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:05,291
[inhales sharply] You're
doing things in your sleep again.

845
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,125
That's how the chairs moved
and how the bed caught fire.

846
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:22,125
You can never say that again
about the sleepwalking.

847
01:15:22,126 --> 01:15:23,208
Not to anyone.

848
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,375
[sobs]

849
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,917
Mom, why are you doing this?

850
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:30,875
Why?

851
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:33,333
To protect you.

852
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,125
[sobs] Then we should have left.

853
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,708
- I was trying to keep us all together.
- [sobs] Mom.

854
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
You, me,

855
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,749
and your sisters.

856
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,250
Ada is dead! [gasps]

857
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,125
Don't you understand?

858
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:02,417
You girls are me.

859
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,917
Parts of me.

860
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:10,542
- Cutaway pieces that never heal.
- Mom, you're scaring me.

861
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,500
I bleed when you're hurt.

862
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:19,332
- I'm alive in that grave...
- [sobbing]

863
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,417
...suffocating under
the dirt with your sister.

864
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,083
And I would do anything,

865
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,542
anything to keep us together,

866
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,791
to keep us whole.

[door creaking]

[grunts]

874
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:16,542
[Rose grunting]

875
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:24,958
[gasps] Aunt Esther?

876
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,542
[gasping, sobbing]

877
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,458
- [wind rumbles]
- [weather vane squeaks]

878
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:53,750
[Margaret] It's too late!

879
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,083
There's nowhere to go, Rose!

880
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,833
Let her go!

881
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:01,791
Mom!

882
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:03,750
[sobbing]

883
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,750
[pants] That wasn't Wallace.

884
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:09,666
You killed Aunt Esther.

885
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:11,541
[Margaret] You're hurting her, Rose!

886
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:13,417
- [Rose] Let her go!
- [knocking]

887
01:18:13,418 --> 01:18:14,416
Help!

888

- [screaming, grunting]
- [knocking]

890
01:18:18,876 --> 01:18:20,625
[Margaret] They will take you.

891
01:18:20,626 --> 01:18:23,000
They will take you away. Please.

892

[Margaret shushes, distorted]

896
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,708
Hi, sweet pea.

897
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,000
Where's Mama?

898
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:09,624

[whimpers, breathes shakily]

900
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:15,000
Rose, you all right?

901
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,417
She's not fit.

902
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:23,417
Rose.

903
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:27,875
All right now.

904
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,333
You two just go wait in there.

905
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:36,791
Don't worry.

906
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:39,083
We're just gonna have
a nice little chat, all right?

907
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,458
I don't know what's gotten into her.
[inhales deeply]

908
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:49,333
For the coyotes.

909
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:53,917
Had one recently?

910
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,083
They're always around.

911
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,249
Did, uh, did...
did Esther come by, Margaret?

912
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:13,125
- She-She said she was gonna check in.
- [wood banging]

913
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:15,958
I hope she wasn't lost in the storm.

914
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,333
Margaret, the-the girls seem rattled.

915
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:27,583
Stir crazy, I guess.

916
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,792
Maybe I ought to take 'em.

917
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,458
Just till Henry gets back.

918
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:43,625
- Hey, now, hey.
- [sobbing]

919

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,457
Hey, hey, hey.

921
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:53,000
Margaret, it's just a few days now,
just a few days.

922
01:20:53,001 --> 01:20:55,458
You done good. You done real good.

923
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,249
[shushes]

[breathes shakily]

01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,750
They're going to hang me, Rose.

934
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,833
But there is a way around it,

935
01:22:21,958 --> 01:22:24,375
a way to stay together.

936
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:29,292
A reunion that lasts an eternity.

937
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:36,875
We just go to sleep like any other night,

938
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:39,667
but longer.

939
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,667
Please, no.

940
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,167
Yes, baby.

941
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,167
- It's the only way.
- [sobbing]

942
01:22:56,417 --> 01:22:58,583
It's okay to be scared.

943
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,125
It's okay. Come here.

944
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:03,125
Come here.

945
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,000

01:23:11,001 --> 01:23:12,250
Oh.

01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:20,125
I'm sorry.

948
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,707
I'm so sorry for everything, Rose.

949
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:29,792
You're the loves of my life,
you know that.

I'm just so tired, Mommy.

Let's go be with Ada. All right?

Can you tell us about the wheat first?

958
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:30,917
Yes.

959
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:41,667
Our first year, it just took hold.

960
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,375
The field was-was chest-high.

961
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:52,375
And when the wind blew, the wheat
would ripple and wave like the ocean.

962
01:24:52,376 --> 01:24:57,375
And we'd play in that field for hours.
[inhales sharply]

All together.

964
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,667
Could we have the medicine
in some peaches?

965
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:11,292
I think that's a wonderful idea.

01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:37,875
[Rose] Ollie!

[Rose] Mom!

I-I tried to stop her,
but Ollie got scared and ran out.

01:25:45,043 --> 01:25:47,917
[breathes shakily] She has to be with us.

970
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,167
She could be drowning!
