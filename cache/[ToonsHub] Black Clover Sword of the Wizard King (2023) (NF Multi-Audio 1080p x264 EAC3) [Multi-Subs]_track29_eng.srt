1
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:28,922
Why?

2
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,092
Why do you get in my way, Julius?!

3
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,596
Because what you're trying to do
is wrong, Conrad.

4
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,016
You must give up.

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,685
You don't have enough magic
left in you to resist--

6
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,312
The one who's wrong…

7
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,775
is you!

8
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,521
That sword!

9
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,482
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia!

10
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,037
<i>He shortened his own life?</i>

11
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,423
I must create it.

12
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,014
A world where everyone respects each other

13
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,474
and laughs with one another!

14
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,396
How could I be wrong
to want such a world?!

15
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,570
Is this for real?

16
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,805
Because there is no future
where you're headed.

17
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,989
Even you deny me?!

18
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,826
If you seal me right now,

19
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,329
you'll lose access to the Imperial Sword!

20
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,791
It does pain us
to lose our national treasure.

21
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:15,129
But we no longer have
enough power to get it back.

22
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,132
I take full responsibility for this

23
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,468
as the next Wizard King.

24
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,519
I won't give up. I will not, Julius!

25
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,105
Never giving up is my…

26
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,748
SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

27
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,509
CLOVER KINGDOM

28
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,838
Welcome, everyone,

29
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,050
to the festival of magic battles
that takes place once a decade,

30
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,176
the Triumph!

31
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,057
The Triumph is a tournament of duels

32
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,685
to decide the strongest Magic Knight!

33
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,063
It's long been said

34
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,190
that the mage who wins this tournament

35
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,609
would eventually be chosen
as the Wizard King!

36
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,321
As you know,

37
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,574
there are nine Magic Knights Squads
consisting of mages

38
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,576
who specialize in battle.

39
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,787
And under the direction
of the Wizard King,

40
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,541
the strongest mages
from the top Magic Knights Squad

41
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,669
protect the peace
of the Clover Kingdom every day.

42
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,047
We will determine
the strongest member of the Magic Knights.

43
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,342
Today is sure to be a memorable day!

44
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,178
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,763
The Triumph commences…

46
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,227
Now! Shall we?

47
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,200
By the way, Klaus,

48
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,078
why were we chosen
as the masters of the ceremony?

49
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,331
Because we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

50
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,000
the Golden Dawn Squad, of course!

51
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,752
Turn off the Amplification Magic first
before you talk!

52
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,588
Oh my, it totally slipped my mind!

53
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,215
Well… pardon the belated introduction.

54
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,093
My name is Mimosa Vermillion,
and I'll be your commentator.

55
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,761
This here is Klaus.

56
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,056
Now is not the time
for introducing ourselves!

57
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,310
Who in the world
chose Mimosa as a commentator?

58
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,812
But, man, look at all these people.

59
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,772
It's almost a full house.

60
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
Of course it is. Because, you see…

61
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,077
Yuno, my love!

62
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,836
In the first round is Yuno,
the vice captain of the Golden Dawn Squad.

63
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:30,009
Hooray, hooray, Yuno! Go, go, Yuno!

64
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,721
So Pretty Boy is in the first round.

65
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,932
Of course, everyone wants to see him.

66
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,933
Right?

67
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,603
I only want to see
my dearest little sister, Marie.

68
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,356
As expected from Gauche…

69
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,025
Man, I'm so ready to fight too!

70
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,110
I wish Asta could have joined us.

71
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,615
He's in exile because of the demon trial.

72
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,158
What a drag.

73
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,369
Why am I even on the roster?

74
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,912
Go for it!

75
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,872
Oh, here he comes!

76
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,707
What's that?

77
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, who the hell is that?

78
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,174
Up against Yuno is, um…

79
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,678
"the Masked One"?

80
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,014
There's no way you could enter
with such a ridiculous name…

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,140
Oh, you're right.

82
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,394
What's with their getup?

83
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,146
Mocking Yuno, are they?

84
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,192
Festival of magic battles, the Triumph.

85
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,571
The first round is
Yuno vs. the Masked One.

86
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,655
The match begins!

87
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,800
Attaboy, Asta!

88
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,681
The first attack is by Yuno!

89
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,975
He used strong Wind Magic,

90
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,352
but the Masked One cut it in half,

91
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,396
completely neutralizing it!

92
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,690
I guess it's begun.

93
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,586
Well then, Julius, shall we begin as well?

94
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,129
Uh-huh!

95
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,132
Barrier Magic, "Voodoo Shangrila"!

96
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,519
What is this enormous magical power?!

97
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,773
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

98
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,402
Today, I will change this country!

99
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,930
How fragile you look, Julius.

100
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,393
I absorbed only a little bit of magic,
and this is the toll it takes on you?

101
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,605
I never expected to meet you again.

102
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,108
<i>I see. So, back then, you…</i>

103
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,903
<i>Yes, I hope</i>
<i>you didn't mind me breaking the seal.</i>

104
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,907
<i>You were distracted for a second.</i>

105
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,493
And are you still…?

106
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,164
My ambition
has not changed a bit since then.

107
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,376
I must create a world

108
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,837
where everyone can respect each other

109
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,047
and laugh with one another.

110
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,216
And for that…

111
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,053
My soldiers, it's time for domination.

112
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,432
We shall overthrow the Clover Kingdom!

113
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,768
Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.

114
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,372
Stop it, Conrad!

115
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,271
All right, old man?

116
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,024
Oh, thank you!

117
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,822
Everyone, this way!

118
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,033
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

119
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,706
Klaus, leave this to me!

120
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,184
Why am I being targeted?!

121
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,689
Yuno!

122
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,652
Jeez, what's up with these guys?!
They totally ruined my perfect disguise!

123
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,364
Here I thought you were some lost kid
from the festival who wandered in.

124
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,949
Who are you calling a kid?!

125
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,451
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

126
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,286
Whoa!

127
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,038
Stupid Asta!

128
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,374
You could have told me
you were participating!

129
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,458
Noelle!

130
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,460
I know you probably can't feel it,

131
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,130
but it seems like everyone here
is getting their magical power absorbed.

132
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,800
Those with little magical power
are unable to move!

133
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,678
Oh no, really?! Are you okay?

134
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,221
I'm a royal!

135
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,307
A little loss of magic is nothing to me!

136
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
Well then, that just means

137
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,687
I'll have to work harder than anyone here!

138
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,356
Don't get too carried away.

139
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,149
I got your back!

140
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,861
You just need to look ahead!

141
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,863
Yeah! Thanks!

142
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,976
Those three?

143
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,353
But that's impossible!

144
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,440
You must know them
if you're a Wizard King.

145
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,984
Those three who had their status
as Wizard King revoked

146
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,612
because of their austerity and cruelty…

147
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,781
Who the heck are you?! Is this your doing?

148
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,743
What's with this child?
How come he can move?

149
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,994
Uh-huh?

150
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,164
He doesn't have
any magical power to begin with.

151
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,167
No juice to speak of, huh? What a weirdo.

152
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,380
There is no way my soldiers would be
defeated by someone with no magic.

153
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,174
How interesting.

154
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:31,639
I managed to revive them with my magic
and the power of the Imperial Sword.

155
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,689
Unlike you, those three have become
great supporters of my cause.

156
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,318
The four of us will create a new world!

157
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,028
That's right.

158
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,947
And you're in our way.

159
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,116
Say what?!
I don't know what exactly you're up to,

160
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,619
but I know that you're the bad guys!

161
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,287
I will defeat you!

162
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,247
Aren't you a lively one?

163
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,834
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!

164
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,134
<i>He neutralized magic?</i>

165
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,265
Conrad, I found a new toy you might like.

166
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,601
You wanna play?

167
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,859
Wizard King, are you all right?!

168
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,195
No, Marx! Stay back!

169
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,366
Well, well, that's interesting magic.

170
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,662
Huh, so he's not gonna answer me.

171
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,789
I take it I should do whatever I want?

172
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,291
Do not hurt him unnecessarily.

173
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,752
Have the decency
to finish him in one blow.

174
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,879
Hey, my toy!

175
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,761
-Asta!
-La!

176
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,680
Thanks, you all!

177
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,066
Oh? Nice magic you got there.

178
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,320
It's useless against a Wizard King.

179
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,531
What can a normal Magic Knight do?

180
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,953
A peasant kid with no magic like him
is a Magic Knight?

181
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,622
It seems things have fallen far, Julius.

182
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,043
I wouldn't be so sure.

183
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,878
Come again?

184
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,089
I don't think we've fallen that much.

185
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,633
Not me, nor the Magic Knights Squads.

186
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,848
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

187
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,868
Thanks for waiting!

188
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,788
A strong helper is here to assist you!

189
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,791
Wait, what is this sinister magical power?

190
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,587
It looks like I can paint
another masterpiece based on this!

191
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,797
You're fighting me!

192
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,841
I'll burn you to ashes
with the flame of justice!

193
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,386
That silhouette… You must be…

194
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,973
Kaiser.

195
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,351
It's been a while.

196
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,269
Captain Yami!

197
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,187
My bad.

198
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,440
I was taking a dump,
and it took me a while so I'm late.

199
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,400
And who are these guys?

200
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,277
Not exactly sure,

201
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,113
but I know they're really bad!

202
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,281
And things are really bad too!

203
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,742
For real? Your vocabulary is really bad.

204
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,869
He isn't wrong, you know.

205
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,831
It'd be difficult
to defeat them as we stand.

206
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,333
One possibility would be…

207
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,001
Yami.

208
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,713
Please head to the Magic Tool
Research Lab's Branch Zero right away.

209
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,883
I need you to bring the magic tool
we're co-developing with Nero.

210
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,011
-No, thanks.
-Huh?!

211
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,724
If I went, then who'll have your back?
You're totally vulnerable.

212
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,728
I have no interest in going through
what I did back then again.

213
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,148
Yami…

214
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,276
I mean, if that's all you need,
we can send this guy.

215
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,153
-Hey, kid, you're up.
-Huh?

216
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,989
Yo, Finral. You heard him.

217
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,949
Go to Branch Zero with him.

218
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,117
Yes, sir!

219
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,494
But if I went, this place would be…

220
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,541
So this is where you were hiding.

221
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,543
Stop running around.

222
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,503
I can't kill you swiftly.

223
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,475
Oh?

224
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,395
Stop blubbering and go already!

225
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,065
If you don't come back soon,
I'll kick their butts all by myself!

226
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:52,983
Yes, sir!

227
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,655
Captain Yami!

228
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,073
Quickly, Asta!

229
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,244
Because of that black barrier,
it's difficult to maintain spatial magic!

230
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,581
You're a member of the Black Bulls Squad!

231
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,124
Listen to your captain!

232
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,626
Nice, Noelle!

233
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,252
Whoa, whoa.

234
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,214
A magic like that exists in this era?

235
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,091
Well, I guess I can analyze it later.

236
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,760
Whoa.

237
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,389
Voiuvre's Roar!

238
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,315
Running away is pointless, I guess.

239
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,486
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

240
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,489
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

241
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,124
Their defense is getting
harder and harder.

242
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,710
The kids have come far.

243
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,630
No, they've got a long way to go.

244
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,716
A long way to go
before they can fight alongside me.

245
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm sorry, I wasn't able to contain them.

246
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,476
No, you've done well.

247
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,980
Thanks to you, I got to send
my guys out on an errand.

248
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,941
Whatever you do, it is pointless.

249
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,402
If the Imperial Sword's magic
is activated,

250
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,821
the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed.

251
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,157
Repeating the same thing
from ten years ago.

252
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,161
Wait, wasn't the Imperial Sword
something that could absorb

253
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,081
and store magical power and stuff?

254
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,710
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

255
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,463
It can unleash
the stored magical power all at once.

256
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,093
Right now, the magical power
absorbed from everyone at the stadium

257
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,137
is stored inside the Imperial Sword.

258
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,597
With his magic,

259
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,518
he could abuse that magical power
and the Imperial Sword as he wishes.

260
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,731
"Abuse"? I'm using it to save the world.

261
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,859
I'd say it's the proper way to use it.

262
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,202
Are you all right, Wizard King?

263
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,289
We have completed
the evacuation of the audience.

264
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,875
All that's left is to defeat the rebels.

265
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,210
Fuegoleon and Nozel.

266
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,379
Have you gotten any stronger?

267
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,468
I never expected to fight
this monster again.

268
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,803
Oh yeah, back then,

269
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,432
Nozel got spooked, fell down,
cried, and soiled his pants, didn't he?

270
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,601
Want me to dunk you in mercury, foreigner?

271
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,187
Hey, those guys weren't there back then.

272
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,146
Who are they?

273
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,399
That woman's magic,
which produces magic soldiers…

274
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,651
I remember seeing it
in my great-grandfather's journal.

275
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,489
My sister was captivated by it,
so I remember it well.

276
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,406
No way!

277
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,160
Historical figures who died long ago…

278
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,164
Wait, does that mean
former Wizard Kings have returned?

279
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,958
Seriously?

280
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,378
I gotta get their autographs
and scalp them.

281
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,713
The former Wizard Kings have been revived?

282
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,008
It's so strange. I'm awake for a change,

283
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,635
but this is like a dream.

284
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,389
It gives me lots of inspiration!

285
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,225
But maybe now's not the time for that.

286
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,773
You seem to have gathered enough people,

287
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,191
but this is where it ends.

288
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:36,957
There are countless singular points
where veins of mana interact.

289
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,084
This stadium is one of them.

290
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,503
Ten years ago,

291
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,630
I altered this stadium

292
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,298
and turned it into a weapon.

293
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,553
You all interrupted me
before I could activate it.

294
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,006
The festival stadium.

295
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,594
Also known as
the "Triumph" flying fortress.

296
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,015
Now, there's no way to escape.

297
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:39,769
Julius, it's time to turn the hands
of the clock you took away from me.

298
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,945
Here we are. This is Branch Zero.

299
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,783
Hey!

300
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,537
I'm Asta from
the Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad!

301
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,788
Open the door!

302
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,123
That won't do, Asta.

303
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:05,253
Only a limited number of nobles
know about this lab.

304
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,007
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magic…

305
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,346
You are…

306
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,224
You must be the Black Bulls.

307
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm Millie Maxwell,
the coordinator at this branch.

308
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,730
Come on, hurry up.

309
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,106
Alright!

310
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,859
We've been debriefed about the situation.

311
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,862
From here on, she will show you around.

312
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
I'll leave you to it.

313
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,492
Nero!

314
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,579
The magic tool Julius needs

315
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,082
is stored in a place quite far away.

316
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,709
Right now, Sally is making an adjustment.

317
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,170
Experiment, experiment!

318
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,257
So Sally is here too, huh?

319
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,927
Nero, you've watched the Clover Kingdom

320
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,137
over the last 500 years, right?

321
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:00,308
Do you know the people
who attacked the stadium?

322
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,727
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,146
I don't know everything, but…

324
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,983
the mastermind is Conrad Leto.

325
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:08,942
What?

326
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,403
I believe you've at least heard the name?

327
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,904
Conrad?

328
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,739
You don't mean…

329
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,785
Yes.

330
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,038
He used to be
a Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom.

331
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,709
He's the predecessor of Julius Novachrono.

332
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,211
A former Wizard King.

333
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,717
But I thought the former Wizard King
died from a disease ten years ago.

334
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,927
I'll explain.

335
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
Get on.

336
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,060
Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King.

337
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,688
Before he was chosen as the Wizard King,

338
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,482
he was known as a powerful man
in the Clover Kingdom.

339
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,278
<i>He became a Magic Knight captain,</i>

340
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,032
<i>establishing an impressive track record</i>
<i>with his squad.</i>

341
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,118
<i>The citizens trusted him,</i>

342
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,412
<i>and his abilities were recognized.</i>

343
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,831
<i>He was finally chosen</i>
<i>to be the Wizard King.</i>

344
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,001
<i>But he changed.</i>

345
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,338
<i>He rebelled against the Kingdom,</i>

346
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,341
<i>and as a result,</i>
<i>his status as the Wizard King was revoked.</i>

347
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,509
<i>"Rebelled against"?</i>

348
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,181
<i>He tried to destroy the country.</i>

349
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,976
What?! The Wizard King's job
is to protect the peace for everyone.

350
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,479
Why did he try to do something so crazy?

351
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:28,980
I don't know.

352
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,441
But he used Lemiel's…

353
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,611
<i>He used</i>
<i>the first Wizard King's magic item,</i>

354
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,947
<i>the Imperial Sword Elsdocia,</i>
<i>to make it happen.</i>

355
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,201
<i>Julius and the others learned of his plan</i>

356
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,827
<i>and sealed Conrad to stop him.</i>

357
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,954
"Sealed"?

358
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,084
They announced that he died of an illness
so as not to panic the citizens.

359
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,920
The current Wizard King, Julius,

360
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:56,549
couldn't defeat him, even with all
the Magic Knights Squad elites.

361
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,677
Julius had no choice

362
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,347
but to use his Time Magic
to continue sealing him.

363
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,391
He's incredibly strong.

364
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,768
What kind of magic does he use?

365
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,727
Key Magic.

366
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,064
He can open or close
anything and everything

367
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,066
with a key he creates with his magic.

368
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,069
The magic space he opens with his key

369
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,196
can absorb anything.

370
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,865
Magic tools, grimoires.

371
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,617
Even magic itself…

372
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,618
Magic itself?!

373
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,745
What? No way!

374
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,663
Yes.

375
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,999
He can steal the magic of others.

376
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,753
And he can use it as he pleases.

377
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,800
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

378
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,816
How far are we going?

379
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,860
The security is extremely tight.

380
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,069
Indeed.

381
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,779
Because beyond this point…

382
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,087
This is the innermost part of Branch Zero.

383
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,800
This is where we store and research
the most important magic tools in the lab.

384
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,138
Is what we've been asked to retrieve
also rare?

385
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,055
Yes.

386
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,641
It controls the power
of the Imperial Sword

387
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,685
that Prince Lemiel was developing.

388
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,897
Something that serves as a sheath
for the Imperial Sword.

389
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,232
It's still a prototype,

390
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,777
but we'll have to use it to seal Conrad.

391
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,076
How?!

392
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:52,540
I had high hopes hearing that
it was a magic tool Lemiel was working on.

393
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,293
But it turns out it was just a toy.

394
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,589
-Don't!
-Sally!

395
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,759
Demon Slayer!

396
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,389
Oh?

397
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,020
Finral!

398
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,443
I know you.

399
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,532
How did you find this place?!

400
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,327
You're Secré Swallowtail,

401
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,913
a member of the Black Bulls Squad.

402
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,082
And you too, Asta.

403
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,834
Noelle Silva.

404
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,211
Finral Roulacase.

405
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,799
Memory Exchange Magic, which allows
you to peek at someone else's memory.

406
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,385
It's a magic of poor taste,

407
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,972
but thanks to that,
I was able to easily locate this place.

408
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,723
You used Marx's…

409
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,725
I'll tell you one more thing.

410
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,939
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

411
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,985
Surrender immediately
and offer your magical power as a tribute.

412
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,695
Resistance is futile.

413
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,489
My Legion Magic soldiers

414
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,951
will stop at nothing
until their last bit of power is spent!

415
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,746
<i>One of the former Wizard Kings, Princia.</i>

416
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,917
<i>The Imperial Sword is supplying her</i>
<i>with the magical power it stored,</i>

417
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,669
<i>and her magic will have no limit.</i>

418
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,214
<i>The Magic Knights Squads</i>
<i>have been wiped out.</i>

419
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,218
<i>The citizens and the major facilities</i>
<i>of the kingdom have all been seized.</i>

420
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,970
No way…

421
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,889
Impressive, no?

422
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,016
Tens of thousands…

423
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,228
She can create even more magic soldiers.

424
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:41,357
You're being invaded by a military power
equal to an entire country.

425
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,402
Those captains who helped you escape…

426
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,739
Captain Yami!

427
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:54,662
As you can see, they just went to sleep.

428
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,248
The people at the stadium…

429
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,667
Brother Nozel!

430
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,296
You're the youngest daughter
of the Silvas?

431
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,174
A leftover child
of the Steel War Princess,

432
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,675
Acier Silva.

433
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,305
How pathetic of Nozel
to fall before his little sister.

434
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,933
To think that a coward like him

435
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,477
is the Magic Knights Captain!

436
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,272
Sea Dragon's Roar!

437
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,200
Noelle! Dammit!

438
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,077
Oh?

439
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,705
Still rough around the edges,
but this water magic is of high purity.

440
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,666
I will take it.

441
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,385
When there is such a clear difference
in abilities, it's so easy to take magic.

442
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,182
My magic…

443
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,816
Bastard… What did you do to Noelle?!

444
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,443
Learn this the hard way.

445
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,280
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar.

446
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,541
That's Noelle's magic…

447
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,542
Give it back to her!

448
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,892
I'll defeat you here and now!

449
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,396
So this is Anti-Magic,
the power to neutralize magic.

450
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,108
Demon-Destroyer!

451
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,322
What a wonderful power you possess.

452
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,908
It can neutralize not only magic,

453
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,911
but also phenomena derived from magic.

454
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,789
I'd like to take your magic as well,

455
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,166
but perhaps I should refrain.

456
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,419
I wouldn't want it
to affect my other magic.

457
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,546
Let's talk.

458
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,174
The paths we walk are one and the same.

459
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,218
What the heck are you talking about now?!

460
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,385
Of course they're not!

461
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,348
The magic tool developed by Lemiel,
the first Wizard King,

462
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,100
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia.

463
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,312
It is quite compatible with my Key Magic.

464
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,733
<i>The Imperial Sword was created</i>
<i>to leave behind the exceptional magic</i>

465
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,820
<i>of great mages and heroes</i>
<i>as a legacy for future generations.</i>

466
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,406
<i>It stores every Wizard King's magic</i>
<i>and wisdom,</i>

467
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,493
<i>not to mention a part of their souls.</i>

468
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,745
<i>And one more thing.</i>

469
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,581
<i>Using the function to absorb, store,</i>

470
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,001
<i>and unleash the magical power all at once,</i>

471
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,754
<i>I will compound</i>
<i>the generations of Wizard Kings' magic</i>…

472
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,880
FLAME EARTH WATER WIND

473
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,341
<i>…with the plethora of magic I've stolen</i>

474
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,386
<i>and create Gargantuan Compound Magic!</i>

475
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:43,683
<i>Our goal is to drive that</i>
<i>into the vein of the earth here.</i>

476
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,645
<i>It will cause unprecedented disaster.</i>

477
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,022
<i>The foundation of the continent</i>
<i>will be destroyed,</i>

478
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,525
<i>and every single citizen will die.</i>

479
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,194
But have no fear.

480
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,614
The Imperial Sword
can store the departed souls.

481
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,116
So we will select

482
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,411
and bring back only those people
who are valuable enough

483
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,163
to live in the new world!

484
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,874
I've seen it in people's memories.

485
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,002
I was once loathed
and disliked because of my magic.

486
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,171
So I know exactly how you feel.

487
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,923
Those with magical power own everything,

488
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,801
and those without die helplessly.

489
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,387
It's impossible, Asta.

490
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,556
We must destroy everything first.

491
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,393
Join me and together we'll create

492
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:32,690
an ideal world where everyone respects
each other and laughs with one another!

493
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,695
Everyone who lives there respects
each other and laughs with one another.

494
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,781
That's the country I want to create
when I become the Wizard King!

495
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,158
No!

496
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,911
That's bullshit!

497
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:50,416
The Wizard King is there
to protect the nation and its people!

498
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,919
I will not let you destroy it!

499
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,421
That's not what the Wizard King does!

500
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,133
An ideal world will be built
upon the meaningless lives

501
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,427
of those who are oppressed.

502
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,264
I can give meaning to their lives!

503
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,141
Why can't you see that?!

504
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:13,105
Of course I can't!
What you're saying is absolutely crazy!

505
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,985
You don't see
the true nature of the world yet.

506
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,487
I'm disappointed.

507
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,948
Shut up!

508
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,910
You're just thinking of yourself!

509
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,421
Why can't you understand?!

510
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,094
I know you've experienced it!

511
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:47,515
The unfairness! The betrayal!
And the inequality of this country!

512
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,105
Choose, Asta.

513
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,274
Walk this path with me

514
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,735
or die.

515
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,717
Give up already, Asta.

516
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,427
You are me.

517
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,846
You can be me.

518
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,726
By dawn tomorrow,
the fusion of magic will be complete.

519
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,103
At that point, you will be…

520
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,986
Give… Noelle back… her magic…

521
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:44,947
I see.

522
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,118
It's truly regrettable.

523
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,246
I will

524
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,665
not give up.

525
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,210
Never giving up

526
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,630
is my magic!

527
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,558
I have no magical power left.

528
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,435
What do I do?

529
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,396
But we still have to give it a try!

530
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,868
You… you're Yuno!

531
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,870
Millie!

532
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,956
He insisted he came to help you all.

533
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,583
Drink up, Sally!

534
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,627
Okay.

535
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,672
Sorry, but we'll have to play this by ear.

536
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,591
Play it by ear?

537
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,134
Sounds fun!

538
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,677
Not at all.

539
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,597
It's the phrase
I hate the most in the world.

540
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,207
Yuno…

541
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,340
I never thought I'd use it like this,

542
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,219
but let's try and activate it
with all the magic we have!

543
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,595
Nonsense.

544
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,472
It may be. But…

545
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,808
I can hit you thanks to everyone's help!

546
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,811
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

547
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,529
He's a monster!

548
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,157
We'll retreat for now!

549
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,306
It's me. How is the fusion of magic going?

550
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,767
Uh-huh? We're at about 20%.

551
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,978
Generally speaking, it's going well.

552
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,356
<i>It should be completed by dawn,</i>
<i>as scheduled.</i>

553
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,816
Understood.

554
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,902
Thank you.

555
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,987
For walking this path with me.

556
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,114
Finally, we'll create it.

557
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,699
The strongest country

558
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,494
with no tears and where no one
is robbed of what they have!

559
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,873
Once again, save the poor lost souls…

560
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:47,087
What I seek is a world
where no one oppresses or is oppressed.

561
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:51,926
<i>I trust that you can achieve that, Conrad.</i>

562
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
Yes.

563
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,930
How about the veins?

564
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,892
<i>Uh-huh? I found the perfect one.</i>

565
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,061
<i>It's at a village called Hage,</i>

566
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,814
<i>in the Forsaken Realm</i>
<i>where the demon's skeleton lies.</i>

567
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,786
My Key Magic is useless
unless I borrow someone's power.

568
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:23,666
That's why it is meaningful
that I'm the one who finishes this.

569
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,586
One day, I will even change this country.

570
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,260
Never giving up is my magic!

571
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,478
Never giving up…

572
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,914
Where am I?

573
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,710
Oh, Noelle!

574
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,462
You're awake.

575
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,132
I'm sorry that all I could provide
was first aid.

576
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,466
Mimosa.

577
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,677
You're safe.

578
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,019
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

579
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,521
It's still under construction,

580
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,315
so only a few members know about it.

581
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:34,028
We were almost captured
and our magic stolen,

582
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,196
but the captains let us escape.

583
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,164
Take care of the kid for me.

584
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,793
I don't know what happened afterwards,

585
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,087
but if they're not here yet…

586
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,967
Hey, are you okay?

587
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,219
Asta! Please excuse me.

588
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,430
Asta!

589
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,932
You should not move
until the treatment is over.

590
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,936
Conrad… needs to be stopped.

591
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,065
He's going to destroy this kingdom.

592
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,983
If we don't do something,

593
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,486
it will happen tomorrow at dawn!

594
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,904
At dawn?

595
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,156
But if the enemies are so formidable…

596
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,367
Why would a former Wizard King…

597
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,744
What could we possibly do by ourselves?

598
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,957
What could we do?

599
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:32,086
Now that it's come to this,
we should run away!

600
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,129
There's nothing we can do with so few,

601
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,507
and who knows when they'll find us here!

602
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,508
Let's run!

603
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,009
To some other country!

604
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,512
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.

605
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,015
This is not a problem we alone can solve…

606
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,518
Yes, we could ask other nations for help.

607
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,313
There are injured people.
Getting them to the border would be tough.

608
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,692
If the enemy is the former Wizard King,
do we have any chance of winning?

609
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,652
With Julius gone…

610
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,779
What could we do by ourselves?

611
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,534
We gotta do something!

612
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,077
If we cave in,

613
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,497
then who will protect this kingdom
and everyone in it?

614
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:13,168
Aren't we the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom?!

615
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:18,173
We've been able to live
happily and peacefully

616
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,427
thanks to the Wizard King
and the Magic Knights Squads!

617
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:26,849
Before we joined, or when we were kids,
or even before we were born,

618
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,436
the Magic Knights Squads
were fighting for us.

619
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:36,442
And the Wizard King has stood
at the helm to protect this kingdom.

620
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,945
It's thanks to those efforts
made by one person for another

621
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,198
that the Clover Kingdom exists now.

622
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,242
That's why we are here!

623
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,452
Asta…

624
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,996
I can't just sit and watch!

625
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
It's my turn to protect

626
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:55,252
what the Wizard King
and the captains have protected!

627
00:45:56,003 --> 00:46:00,424
But it's not just me. It's our turn!

628
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,927
I can heal an injury like this
with my fighting spirit!

629
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,765
And then I will kick his butt,
for real this time!

630
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,527
With all of us, we can stop Conrad!

631
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,698
We may not be strong enough by ourselves,

632
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,368
but if we come together,
we can become an immense force!

633
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,040
That's why we,
the Magic Knights Squads, are strong!

634
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,960
If all the Magic Knights Squads
join their power,

635
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,254
we could face any enemy!

636
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,591
I'm not forcing you to come with me.

637
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,927
Like Sekke said,

638
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,555
you can still escape to the Heart Kingdom
or elsewhere if you go now.

639
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:54,102
But if any of you
is willing to lend me your power…

640
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,650
Jeez, what you suggest is so reckless.

641
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,862
But coming from you, who's trying to do
the most reckless thing,

642
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,072
I guess I can't say no.

643
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,296
I'm not letting you go alone.
Not a chance.

644
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,972
The Wizard King isn't here!

645
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,307
We don't have the captains to rely on!

646
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,518
But that doesn't matter!

647
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,062
Now it's our turn to carry on!

648
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,691
We'll fight on their behalf!

649
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,317
I'll say it again.

650
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:46,363
We are the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom!

651
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,824
Right here, right now!
We'll surpass our limits,

652
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,617
and protect this country!

653
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,578
Yeah!

654
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,955
And what is the actual plan?

655
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,291
I'm going to figure that out now!

656
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,584
What?!

657
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,794
<i>I can't take this anymore, bwa-ha!</i>

658
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:05,173
<i>Now that it has come to this,</i>
<i>I have to escape, even if it's just me!</i>

659
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,593
Huh?

660
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,802
Bwa-ha!

661
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,392
Without any plans…

662
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,899
Stop boasting, you imbecile!

663
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,411
Lady Big-sis-leon! Everyone else, too!

664
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,915
I didn't know you were alive! Ouch!

665
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,792
Who are you calling "Big-sis-leon"?

666
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,919
And don't assume I'm dead.

667
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,631
I was away for training.

668
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,593
But it seems…

669
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,305
something fun is going on.

670
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,934
I've also been away
on a mission with Jack.

671
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:02,147
<i>Which is why I didn't get caught by</i>
<i>pursuers and was able to arrive here.</i>

672
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,942
Same for me.

673
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,110
We must go rescue everyone.

674
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,445
Hehe.

675
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,115
Some of the people who went on a mission
with us are fine as well.

676
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,995
<i>They're out there,</i>
<i>surveilling that huge flying fortress.</i>

677
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:21,458
<i>It looks like Yami</i>
<i>and the other captains are alive.</i>

678
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,170
<i>They're trapped inside a barrier though.</i>

679
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,630
Captain Yami!

680
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,215
My brother Nozel!

681
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,968
<i>Yami! I'm so glad!</i>

682
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,136
But I don't get it.

683
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,473
Why have the enemy captured
the citizens and the Magic Knights Squads

684
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,225
but are keeping them alive?

685
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,560
Because they need their magical powers.

686
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,357
If they absorb power through the Sword
and supply it to their members,

687
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,484
they will never run out of magical power.

688
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,112
Hehe, so they're the feed.

689
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,865
Oh man! He also mentioned
that he needs lots of magical power

690
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,993
for his crazy ambition to come true!

691
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,662
So that's why he's keeping them alive.

692
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,581
So if their magical power runs out,
Yami and the others will be…

693
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,126
We don't have much time left.

694
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,669
Asta, everyone.

695
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,505
Let's join forces
to take back this kingdom.

696
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,965
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

697
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:14,803
Before we do, we must eat-la!

698
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,691
Oh! Charmy, you're okay!

699
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,611
Yup. Thanks to Rouge and Captain Yami,
who let me escape.

700
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,364
Oh! You all!

701
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,200
Noelle, I'm glad you're okay.

702
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,662
Our base was trapped
inside the barrier as well.

703
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:45,000
Henry and Gordon are trapped inside,
but they're okay for now.

704
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,168
Then,

705
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,755
we gotta go get them, right?

706
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,841
The base of the Black Bulls…

707
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,098
The Imperial Sword has collected
the magical power of all the citizens,

708
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,768
which will be driven into
a "singular point" vein of mana.

709
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:07,064
Ha! Then that's the end for this kingdom.

710
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,857
The enemy Wizard Kings

711
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,778
must have been revived with
the Imperial Sword and Conrad's magic.

712
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:18,283
So if we destroy the Imperial Sword,
do we stop the power of the Wizard Kings?

713
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,286
Judging from Conrad's actions,

714
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,788
that's highly likely.

715
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,790
Very well!

716
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,418
The final goal is to destroy
the Imperial Sword and neutralize it!

717
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,214
Go and prepare for encountering the enemy!

718
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,426
We don't have much time before dawn,
our time limit!

719
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,271
<i>I still can't use</i>
<i>the spells in my grimoire,</i>

720
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,358
<i>but thanks to Charmy,</i>
<i>my magic has returned.</i>

721
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,028
<i>I'll focus on what I can do now!</i>

722
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,545
Yuno!

723
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,301
Are you ready, Asta?

724
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,845
Yeah!

725
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,852
BLACK BULLS SQUAD BASE

726
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,773
This is strange. When I got back
from training, there was only Henry here.

727
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:35,694
And former Wizard Kings have been revived,
and they've taken over the capital…

728
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,039
I'm going to retake the base!

729
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,168
First, we will go and rescue
those at the Black Bulls base.

730
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,588
Are you sure?

731
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,842
This plan depends on how much
fighting power we can preserve.

732
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:03,972
For that, we need something that allows us
to move safely but in large numbers.

733
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,890
I see.

734
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,017
Don't you get it?

735
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,853
At your base, that's possible.

736
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:16,067
But Conrad is a formidable foe
who uses many types of magic at will.

737
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,946
Normal magic attacks will be canceled out.

738
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,240
And that's where you come in, Asta.

739
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:27,287
Since you have Anti-Magic,
which neutralizes any kind of magic,

740
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,956
only you have the chance to defeat Conrad.

741
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,459
This is the key point of the plan.

742
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,837
Please stop Conrad. Can I count on you?

743
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,797
Yes, sir!

744
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,391
All right!

745
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,102
Welcome back, everyone.

746
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,938
And we have so many guests…

747
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,981
That's the story, Henry.

748
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,317
Can you do it?

749
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,196
Okay!

750
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:06,910
Well then! You recover
the magic you lost by eating-la!

751
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:16,211
I've never felt
this much magical power before!

752
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,527
Cool!

753
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,363
So this is the flying style
of the Black Bulls!

754
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,491
Is this really going to fly?

755
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:51,871
If there's enough magical power,

756
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,665
I think it will--

757
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,214
More than we expected, huh?

758
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,716
Hehe!

759
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,301
Severing Magic…

760
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:10,056
Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

761
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,101
Briar Magic…

762
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,395
Crimson Vine Spear.

763
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,573
A drop in a bucket, was it?

764
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,075
Hehe! How annoying.

765
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,494
What?!

766
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,704
Bwa-ha!

767
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,173
Hehe! Looks like this is worth severing!

768
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
We will stop them here!

769
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,887
You all go on ahead!

770
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,306
Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!

771
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,016
This will be pointless if you go!

772
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,311
But those two alone couldn't…

773
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,688
It might be impossible, yes.

774
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,606
Then,

775
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,274
how about three?

776
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,533
World Tree Magic…

777
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,744
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

778
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,963
Now, go while you can!

779
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,298
Captain Vangeance!

780
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,134
Are you ready?

781
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,950
Yuno.

782
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,993
I'm leaving the Wizard King in your care.

783
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,121
Well then,

784
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,665
let's have the barbarous guests leave.

785
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,840
Listen up, everyone!

786
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,176
We are minus three captains,
but we'll head into enemy territory…

787
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,928
No, Asta.

788
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,929
You tell them.

789
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,937
Okay, let's go, everyone!

790
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,772
We'll kick their butts

791
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,984
and get the Clover Kingdom back!

792
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,987
Yeah!

793
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,452
A report from my soldiers.

794
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,372
The rebels have started to move.
How shall I deal with them?

795
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,624
So you're here.

796
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,795
That's right. I knew you would come.

797
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,882
It is time for the finale.

798
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,634
I saved you the best seat.

799
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,721
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

800
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,890
even after I've lost most of my power?

801
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,934
Those you love, those you want to protect.

802
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,898
Burn into your eyes the image of
your trusted ones dying miserable deaths.

803
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,443
Die as you agonize
over how powerless you are.

804
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,530
This is the beginning
of a new Clover Kingdom.

805
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,658
Let us turn a new page!

806
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,383
What is that?!

807
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,639
Whoa, it's enormous!

808
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:42,393
It's incomparable to the one that was
at the Magic Knights Squad base!

809
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,853
Everyone, look!

810
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:54,781
Well, well, let me see
the last squeeze of power you have.

811
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,533
And let me teach you

812
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:01,538
that the Wizard King
is never caught off-guard!

813
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,464
So, what are you going to do?

814
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,386
This is the power of the Wizard King?

815
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,222
It's in another league! What should we do?

816
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,182
Asta!

817
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,310
It's not your turn yet!

818
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,272
What do we do?
More like, what don't we do?

819
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:31,067
We've always surpassed our limits, right?

820
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,198
Ready, you guys?

821
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:40,410
-Let's show him what we're made of!
-Yeah!

822
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:44,372
Flame Magic: Exploding Fireball!

823
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,375
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

824
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,378
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

825
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,589
Everyone!

826
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,966
Are you ready?

827
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,468
Yeah!

828
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,018
Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Refrain!

829
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,523
Go!

830
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,873
Bwa-ha! Again?!

831
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,082
Now's the chance!

832
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,460
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

833
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,465
Well, well.

834
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:39,927
Whoa, whoa, we're about to arrive
at the enormous barrier!

835
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,889
<i>The space is shut off from here on,</i>

836
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,932
<i>so I can't break through with my magic.</i>

837
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,685
<i>So, I'm counting on you.</i>

838
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,734
<i>I know you can do this.</i>

839
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,402
<i>Asta!</i>

840
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,542
Stop running around!

841
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:19,300
Thanks for voluntarily walking
into the trap.

842
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,011
Magic like this will not--

843
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,347
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

844
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,309
Finral, now! Do it quickly!

845
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:31,562
Alright! Not said this in a while,
but remember I'm your senior!

846
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,315
Good. Now…

847
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,199
Didn't I tell you?

848
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,118
I'm never caught off-guard!

849
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,259
Thank you so much!

850
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:11,894
Uh-huh? This special barrier has been
fortified with the Imperial Sword,

851
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,648
so even if it gets broken,
it'll regenerate and not be a problem.

852
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:21,195
To create the perfect world, we should
get rid of those who get in our way.

853
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,030
This is the end!

854
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,449
For you!

855
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,751
I love it, I love it! Struggle for me.

856
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,462
Mana Zone: Fangs of Riot…

857
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,504
Double Attacks!

858
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,175
Was that supposed to hurt me?!

859
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,635
Now! Fire at will!

860
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,976
One more time!

861
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,358
Are you ready?

862
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,781
I love it, you guys.

863
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,324
Bring it on!

864
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,380
-Go!
-Go!

865
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,351
Ha! Are you serious?

866
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,645
You guys are amazing!

867
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,355
However!

868
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,899
Everyone!

869
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,151
I'm counting on you, Asta!

870
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,487
You defeat him!

871
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,949
Alright! I'm off!

872
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,911
Hey, check that out.

873
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:53,913
Conrad?!

874
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,873
Why is he there?

875
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,876
Oh, the singular point…

876
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,672
Is it the skeleton of a demon?

877
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,469
Uh-huh!

878
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,932
Don't you dare get in our way!

879
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,442
Asta! You go to Conrad!

880
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,447
Give him all you got!

881
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,533
Yeah!

882
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,255
Let's go, Bell!

883
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,172
I'm ready!

884
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,717
Going all out!

885
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,477
Spirit Assimilation…

886
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,604
Spirit Dive!

887
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,027
All units! Get into your positions!

888
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,322
Just as planned, we succeeded
in splitting the enemy force!

889
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,200
Now each of you will fight to the end

890
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:16,120
with the pride of a Magic Knights Squad!

891
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,707
If you don't,
then you have me to answer to!

892
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,003
And not one of you
is allowed to die either.

893
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,548
If you slack off, or if you die,

894
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,717
then I will burn you to death myself!

895
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,304
Listen well, all of you.

896
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,972
If you don't want to die,

897
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,266
then fight on, even if it kills you!

898
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,102
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

899
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:46,025
No tricks to speak of
for fighting against me?

900
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:50,279
Just my luck to have
such a boring fool as my enemy.

901
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,073
"Tricks"?

902
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,284
Why would I need tricks to face you?

903
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,328
Princia Funnybunny.

904
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,791
A mighty warrior among the Wizard Kings,
whose combat strength

905
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,876
is worth a thousand soldiers!

906
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,755
The records say that you've never lost

907
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,633
in any combat where you were involved.

908
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,344
Why would I rely on some silly tricks

909
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,055
when facing such a foe!

910
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,350
Very well, I take back my words.

911
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,312
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

912
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,983
If you want me to play with you,

913
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,026
then show me your strength first.

914
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,702
A test of strength?
I accept the challenge.

915
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:42,498
But I hope you don't hold back on me!

916
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,429
Next…

917
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,305
Where are you aiming?

918
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,274
Did you actually think
you managed to lure me in?

919
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,776
Just the opposite, silly you!

920
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,113
I'm the one who lured you here.

921
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,823
The truth is,

922
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,701
we can use the magical power

923
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:22,079
that's fueling this flying fortress
as our own!

924
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,540
So, as long as I'm in here,

925
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,377
I can replenish my magic endlessly!

926
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:35,051
And you think you've won just for that?

927
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,469
Against us?

928
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:37,928
"Us"?

929
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,724
Hey, hey, Pretty Boy.

930
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,934
Didn't anyone teach you

931
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,979
that a damsel in distress
should be rescued gently?

932
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,733
I'm a Virgo, you know!

933
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,986
<i>The earlier attack…</i>

934
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,655
<i>This is what he was aiming for.</i>

935
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll remember that.

936
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,410
Are you ready to go?

937
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,996
Can't have my subordinates taking risks

938
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,666
without me, the captain,
surpassing my limits first, can I?

939
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,210
Right, you guys?

940
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,755
You don't need to tell me.

941
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,177
We will show you the might
of the Magic Knights Squads, here and now!

942
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,179
Yuno! We will back you up!

943
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,058
You focus on attacking!

944
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,902
Uh-huh?

945
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,405
Don't make me yawn,
you nearly dead idiots.

946
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:43,327
These guys here have been kept alive

947
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:47,456
so that we could suck their magical power
to fuel the fortress.

948
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,795
They have little magical power left.

949
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,296
And?

950
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,049
Is your grit going to help
regain your magical power?

951
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:00,302
Huh? Surpassing limits?

952
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:03,305
You can't get strong that quickly!

953
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:09,353
You called yourself Wizard King
when you didn't even know that?

954
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,313
Unbelievable.

955
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:15,818
Bring it on, bastards!

956
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,864
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

957
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,931
Here it is! Grey!

958
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,851
Okay!

959
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,395
Magic Conversion!

960
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,207
Thank you…

961
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,918
<i>I can't use strong magic,</i>

962
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,003
<i>but I can manage this much</i>
<i>without my grimoire…</i>

963
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:18,214
Looks like we can handle this.

964
01:10:18,839 --> 01:10:19,673
Right.

965
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,135
The revived Wizard Kings
and the magic to destroy this kingdom…

966
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,138
If Asta can touch the Imperial Sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

967
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,640
they can all be neutralized.

968
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,310
All we have to do is to stop them
until he can do that!

969
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,563
How pitiful…

970
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,775
I'm saying this for your sake.

971
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:39,068
Surrender now.

972
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:43,948
And, please, leave
and go somewhere out of our sight.

973
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,909
That's mighty nice of you.

974
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:51,497
Isn't it your purpose to kill us off?

975
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:58,170
If you were nobles and royals
who only think of benefitting themselves,

976
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,005
then I'd have no mercy for you.

977
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:05,177
But your hearts aren't impure like theirs.

978
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:06,637
Retreat now!

979
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,682
If you promise not to get in our way,

980
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,433
I will let you go.

981
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,436
That means,

982
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,606
"Just shut up and watch
as this country breaks apart," right?

983
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,191
In that case…

984
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,695
We would not retreat even if it kills us!

985
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,534
Being foolish is… pitiful.

986
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:34,164
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Church.

987
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:47,344
And here you thought you could beat me
with this level of magical power.

988
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,596
My mana zone allows me

989
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,350
to lower the temperature
of a space to below freezing!

990
01:11:56,061 --> 01:12:01,066
Amateurs won't be able
to even breathe in this space!

991
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,489
Move…

992
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,116
I don't understand.

993
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,494
You were also oppressed by this world.

994
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,497
Why do you reject our ideas?!

995
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,249
Don't underestimate us…

996
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,503
Everyone's giving their all to survive.

997
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,465
Even if it's hard, they're not giving up!

998
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:30,012
You have no right to take away
the lives of people like that!

999
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,432
Indeed.

1000
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,144
<i>No one has the right to do so.</i>

1001
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,855
And that's why I must do what I must.

1002
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:43,442
In order to create a world
where those without magic

1003
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:46,320
and outsiders can smile as they live!

1004
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,530
But that doesn't justify--

1005
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,868
Being weak is also pitiful.

1006
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,750
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1007
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:09,385
It's useless. You will never reach me.

1008
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,641
Go to sleep.

1009
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,643
I refuse.

1010
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,647
I just need to burn everything down.

1011
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,857
Mana Zone…

1012
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,942
Full Release!

1013
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,902
Flame Magic…

1014
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,197
Calidos Brachium…

1015
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:32,866
Purgatory!

1016
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,416
Now!

1017
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,544
Time to play!

1018
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:58,559
Your name was Mereoleona, was it?

1019
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,895
You made me use my fist.

1020
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,816
You are very interesting.

1021
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:23,083
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone.

1022
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,211
Very good, Mereoleona.

1023
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,338
I will admit it.

1024
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,840
You are strong!

1025
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:34,136
But not as strong as me!

1026
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,141
What are we going to do, Yuno?

1027
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:41,727
At this rate,
Yami and the others won't last.

1028
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,686
I know!

1029
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,404
Captain Nozel!

1030
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:58,619
Yuno, don't try to do something you can't.

1031
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,537
You are strong.

1032
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,790
Try and face
what you are capable of right now.

1033
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,128
Don't worry about us.

1034
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,307
Please buy me a little more time!

1035
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,562
I'll finish him with the next blow!

1036
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:35,489
Hey, hey, beardy macho man!

1037
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:37,908
Did you run out of energy at the start?

1038
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,204
Your taste in nicknames is horrible!

1039
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,124
No matter how you look at it,

1040
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,795
I'm obviously more of
a "cute and girly" kind of macho!

1041
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,246
Don't you know any other moves?

1042
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,005
<i>This guy…</i>

1043
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:37,009
<i>He's pouring all his magical power</i>
<i>into this blow!</i>

1044
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,061
You powered your way through after all.

1045
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,398
A rather unrefined move, Pretty Boy!

1046
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:05,662
Aren't you interesting?!

1047
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:26,016
So you've been protecting
this land all these years…

1048
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,312
Lemiel.

1049
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,731
The world you envisioned,

1050
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,151
I will make it come true.

1051
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,490
Conrad!

1052
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:46,036
So you've arrived, Asta!

1053
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,124
You were a little too late, Asta.

1054
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:54,878
This is…

1055
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:55,879
Stop!

1056
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,381
…the end.

1057
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:10,227
And a new beginning for this world!

1058
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,171
Give up, Asta.

1059
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,925
I drove the magic of the Imperial Sword
into the singular point.

1060
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:46,763
No one can stop
the destruction of this kingdom!

1061
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,770
Not yet!

1062
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:57,941
I'll pull that sword out
and kick your butt!

1063
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,318
I'm really persistent.

1064
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,155
If I decide to do something,
I'll do it even if it kills me!

1065
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,449
It's you who should give up!

1066
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,786
Then you understand me, Asta.

1067
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:17,210
-Never giving up is my magic!
-Never giving up is my magic!

1068
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,721
If someone like you had been around me,

1069
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:30,974
then my loneliness
may not have been as bad,

1070
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:34,728
Mereoleona.

1071
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:42,360
Hey.

1072
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,116
The battle…

1073
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:52,704
is not over yet!

1074
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:58,335
<i>Impossible!</i>

1075
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,628
<i>Her power increased?!</i>

1076
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:01,379
You!

1077
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:03,381
How can you still move?

1078
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,302
Ugh, Big-sis-leon.

1079
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,970
What's up! Lady Mereoleona!

1080
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,139
Good morning, big sister!

1081
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,433
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1082
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,685
Big sister!

1083
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:21,942
It's my grit!

1084
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:24,903
Also,

1085
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,572
if I kick the bucket in a place like this,

1086
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:32,327
they'll surely laugh at me!

1087
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,972
And one more thing!

1088
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,267
Unless I stay the strongest,

1089
01:20:56,393 --> 01:21:01,064
I won't be able to call
a certain someone "my rival"!

1090
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,028
Drawing strength from your comrades…

1091
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,824
That sure is a trick I'll never learn.

1092
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,409
However…

1093
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,581
Well done, Mereoleona.

1094
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,084
To think that I'd lose in a fist fight.

1095
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,420
You just might be

1096
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,883
strong enough to fight me
when I go all out!

1097
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:33,054
Oh man, you're really strong.

1098
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,599
You even made me use my trump card.

1099
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:39,102
Had I met you when I was the Wizard King,

1100
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:41,855
I might have made you my advisers.

1101
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,106
Maybe!

1102
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,945
You are wrong!

1103
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,865
Don't give me that crap.

1104
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:57,871
No one knows
what's right and what's wrong!

1105
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,248
We're the same as you!

1106
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:06,129
Conrad and I, we fight for our beliefs!

1107
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,508
I get that!

1108
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,720
In a fight like this,
there's no right or wrong!

1109
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,390
But to protect what matters to us…

1110
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,394
we both plant our feet and fight!

1111
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:22,979
Combo Spell…

1112
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,940
Dimension Slash!

1113
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,733
Scorching Light!

1114
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:41,915
I won't lose…

1115
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,794
I won't lose to something like this!

1116
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:47,545
That's too bad!

1117
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,131
Asta, I'm borrowing your skill!

1118
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:54,803
I hate losing more than anything too!

1119
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,321
Whatever.

1120
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:17,075
I don't care about preserving
magical powers for the fortress anymore.

1121
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:23,832
I'll use all my power to crush you all!

1122
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:33,425
Reconsider, Asta.

1123
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:38,847
This crazy world is not worth protecting.

1124
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,601
Let's build a new world together!

1125
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,775
I don't care about your new world!

1126
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,362
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1127
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,864
Nonsense.

1128
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,076
Becoming a Wizard King in this world
will change nothing.

1129
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:02,954
That's right.

1130
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,247
Nothing…

1131
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:46,081
All routes are shut down.

1132
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:49,918
Your sword will never reach me.

1133
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,170
No matter how you struggle,

1134
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,506
this is your limit.

1135
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,426
I'll say it one last time.

1136
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,845
Come with us, Asta.

1137
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:05,391
You can be my successor.

1138
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,478
Become the Wizard King in the new world.

1139
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:17,445
Not in a million years!

1140
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,698
Someone can't turn you
into the Wizard King.

1141
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,326
You become one on your own merits!

1142
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:26,287
And there is a way!

1143
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:29,374
If there isn't,

1144
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,669
I'll make one!

1145
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:42,053
I've always been told
to surpass my limits!

1146
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:51,729
That was a good hit.

1147
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,566
So I didn't parry and took it.

1148
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,986
Along with your ambition.

1149
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,574
But playtime is over, Asta.

1150
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,743
If we can't walk the same path together,

1151
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,329
then there is no point
in holding back anymore.

1152
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,789
Asta.

1153
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:15,837
The biggest reason I asked you to join us
is not because of your power.

1154
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,674
Nor is it because
you were in the same boat as me.

1155
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,720
I wanted you,
who has the same ambition as me,

1156
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:25,763
to be rewarded!

1157
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,560
But I was not able
to open your eyes to the truth.

1158
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:33,354
How regrettable…

1159
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,648
<i>I'm neutralizing him with my Anti-Magic,</i>

1160
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:18,650
<i>but I can't keep up!</i>

1161
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,489
Now!

1162
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,535
I've been waiting

1163
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:33,539
for the moment you'd take it easy
and drop your guard!

1164
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,042
Exploding Fireball!

1165
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,755
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1166
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:44,926
Full Reflection!

1167
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:54,102
Ice Wedge Magic…

1168
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,646
World End Martyr!

1169
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,571
This is what…

1170
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,866
"taking it easy" means!

1171
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,707
You learn something new every day,
don't you, young one?

1172
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,710
Thanks for nothing, old fart!

1173
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,462
<i>Hurry up, Asta!</i>

1174
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,340
<i>Our magic won't last much longer!</i>

1175
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,343
Black Hurricane!

1176
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,099
It's admirable how you can
keep your spirits up,

1177
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:35,351
but your movements are getting slow!

1178
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,107
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1179
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,491
No matter how much you struggle,

1180
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,494
this gap between us will never be filled!

1181
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,123
This is the power of the Wizard King!

1182
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,256
I will never…

1183
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:10,553
acknowledge a guy like you
as the Wizard King!

1184
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,141
<i>Crap, if I let my guard down,</i>
<i>my Black form will become undone.</i>

1185
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:18,770
<i>I need to land a hit</i>
<i>with everything I've got left!</i>

1186
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,106
Stop seeing your dreams
in the Wizard King!

1187
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,776
No one, not even the first Wizard King,

1188
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:28,780
has been able to bring
revolution to this kingdom.

1189
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,574
In fact, far from changing the nation,

1190
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:35,036
Julius ended up getting beaten
by the Elves in the earlier war,

1191
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,040
and the Clover Kingdom
almost faced its doom.

1192
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:42,168
They can't protect anything.
They can't change anything.

1193
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:45,671
Wizard Kings are utterly useless!

1194
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,174
That's not true…

1195
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:56,057
The current Wizard King protected
all the citizens in exchange for his life!

1196
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,309
Same with the first Wizard King!

1197
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,687
He protected everyone
at the expense of his life,

1198
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,940
and even after that,
for hundreds of years,

1199
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,818
he kept on sleeping

1200
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:11,989
so he could help us and this country!

1201
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:22,208
<i>Clover leaves each represent</i>
<i>faith, hope, and love.</i>

1202
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,878
<i>Within the fourth leaf dwells good luck.</i>

1203
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:30,299
<i>In the fifth leaf resides the devil.</i>

1204
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:36,013
Is he about to die again?

1205
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,641
Man, what a piece of work.

1206
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:42,854
I guess I'll get the payment
in a lump sum later.

1207
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,067
You became the Wizard King

1208
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:52,113
because a lot of people acknowledged you,
didn't you?

1209
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:56,242
Betraying those people
makes you unfit to be one!

1210
01:30:57,326 --> 01:30:58,953
I won't acknowledge you!

1211
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:05,042
Wizard Kings inspire people!

1212
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,005
They can be someone's hopes and dreams!

1213
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:11,132
They are not useless at all!

1214
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:17,513
You don't understand
the true nature of this country yet.

1215
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:21,601
The discrimination and prejudice
rampant in this country

1216
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:25,271
have crushed people's dreams
and hopes again and again!

1217
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:29,650
Unless we make a fundamental change,
this country will not change!

1218
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,695
That's not for you to decide!

1219
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:34,489
Right now,

1220
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,575
regardless of their social status,
everyone from peasants to royals

1221
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:41,329
is working hard together
to make this a better country!

1222
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,664
So don't get in our way!

1223
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,918
A country cannot change
with such simple measures!

1224
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:49,504
Don't get in my way!

1225
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,553
What the hell?
I'm not sure what's going on,

1226
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:00,973
but I feel like
I finally got to talk to the real you.

1227
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:03,309
Shut up.

1228
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:09,232
I'm no longer interested in listening to
pipe dreams from a kid who knows nothing!

1229
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:17,114
<i>Crap! My Black form is coming undone!</i>

1230
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,618
True, there was a time
when I trusted the country and its people

1231
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:25,873
and tried to bring changes
to the Clover Kingdom as the Wizard King.

1232
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:28,626
But people betray you.

1233
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,128
You must know what that's like.

1234
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,258
Just because a small portion
of your community changed,

1235
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:39,512
do you seriously think
that a whole country will change?

1236
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,847
It's not that they change.

1237
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,517
It's that we bring change together!

1238
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,269
The world you're trying to create

1239
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:50,856
is an egotistical world
where you're the only one who's laughing!

1240
01:32:51,357 --> 01:32:54,777
I want to laugh with everyone.
I want to become happy with everyone!

1241
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:59,907
I will change this country with everyone!

1242
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:02,243
A country where everyone who lives there

1243
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:05,496
respects each other
and laughs with one another!

1244
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:09,500
That's what I'm going to create!

1245
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,680
My magic is back!

1246
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,393
Noelle!

1247
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:35,318
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

1248
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,069
Yeah!

1249
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,487
What a futile struggle.

1250
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:42,658
You defying us only pushes us
away from an ideal world!

1251
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,869
Why can't you see that?!

1252
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,081
An ideal world

1253
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,667
isn't something that's forced upon you.

1254
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,170
It's something you earn yourself!

1255
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,922
Noelle! Look at me!

1256
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:00,343
Mirror Magic…

1257
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,678
Mirror Brigade!

1258
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:08,351
<i>I used to resent this world as well.</i>

1259
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:11,520
<i>I couldn't learn to control</i>
<i>my magical powers</i>

1260
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,522
<i>and was abandoned by my family.</i>

1261
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,734
<i>I thought I was alone in the world.</i>

1262
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:20,655
<i>But I now have friends</i>

1263
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:24,283
<i>who make me feel I belong!</i>

1264
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:26,702
<i>They accept me with my shortcomings,</i>

1265
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:32,500
<i>and they stay right beside me</i>
<i>as we move forward!</i>

1266
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:35,127
<i>Combo Spell…</i>

1267
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,630
<i>Mirror Meteo…</i>

1268
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:41,759
<i>Dragon!</i>

1269
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,515
Magic Conversion!

1270
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,600
Ice to Water!

1271
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,395
Right here, right now…

1272
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,398
<i>Fate Manipulation…</i>

1273
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,774
<i>Absolute Evasion!</i>

1274
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,568
<i>Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!</i>

1275
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:03,155
I will surpass my limits!

1276
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:08,285
Jeez.

1277
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,912
Just go already!

1278
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:12,164
Leave it to me!

1279
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,421
The world can be changed.

1280
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:21,716
Fate can be manipulated!

1281
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,886
I will not let you destroy

1282
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:32,685
even the possibility of it!

1283
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,911
How about that?

1284
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:54,665
If that's not enough for you,
then I can do this all day.

1285
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,084
But…

1286
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:03,549
Start over with us, together.

1287
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,469
I don't mean to boast,

1288
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:09,805
but I can't do anything
without everyone's help!

1289
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:13,017
I nearly died many times,

1290
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,604
but I was able to come this far
with their help!

1291
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:17,855
Shut up!

1292
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,904
I want to create a world where everyone
can laugh together in a way

1293
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:27,490
that everyone can accept.

1294
01:36:29,074 --> 01:36:32,328
If you have to kill
a lot of people to create it,

1295
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:35,581
no one will accept that!

1296
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,531
You… What is your name?

1297
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:11,033
Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1298
01:37:11,116 --> 01:37:13,536
From the royal house of Silva…

1299
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:15,329
I see.

1300
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,207
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1301
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,962
You're a royal, and yet
you can empathize with the weak.

1302
01:37:24,129 --> 01:37:27,550
If a person like you exists,
then surely this world…

1303
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,555
Hey, hey, hey…

1304
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:36,308
Are you serious, Conrad?

1305
01:37:38,435 --> 01:37:40,813
I can still fight!

1306
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,357
Me too.

1307
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:48,237
But it looks like
it's my turn to go to sleep.

1308
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,699
It was a lot of fun.

1309
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:57,496
I did it…

1310
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,039
I did it!

1311
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:00,457
Everyone!

1312
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:03,919
Not… yet…

1313
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,715
Not yet…

1314
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:15,973
It's a forbidden spell
that's activated in exchange for my life.

1315
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:19,518
Doom's Gate.

1316
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:31,405
I will not give up.

1317
01:38:31,488 --> 01:38:33,490
I will not give up, Asta.

1318
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:52,384
I will… not give up either.

1319
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:56,388
I'm going to be the Wizard King.

1320
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:01,644
In order to be the Wizard King…

1321
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,396
I am!

1322
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:08,233
Right here!

1323
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,903
Asta!

1324
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:18,786
Asta, take this.

1325
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:22,206
The Wizard King!

1326
01:39:22,998 --> 01:39:25,167
You won't need an explanation.

1327
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:27,670
That sword will show you.

1328
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:30,005
The future of this nation…

1329
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:30,923
The space…

1330
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,008
…is in your hands.

1331
01:39:38,263 --> 01:39:39,098
<i>I feel it.</i>

1332
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,643
<i>This is everyone's power!</i>

1333
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,104
<i>Their hopes and dreams!</i>

1334
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:50,734
<i>I feel everyone…</i>

1335
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:53,112
<i>everyone is there!</i>

1336
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,700
Master Nacht, please stop it!

1337
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:03,205
You've been working non-stop
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom!

1338
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:08,168
If you give away your magical power
on top of that, you'll pass out!

1339
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,462
I don't mind passing out

1340
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:15,884
if that means someone
who's doing the right thing gets rewarded.

1341
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:19,930
<i>Right here…</i>

1342
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:21,473
<i>Right now…</i>

1343
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:23,809
<i>Let's all…</i>

1344
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:30,065
surpass our limits.

1345
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:35,738
The Imperial Sword?

1346
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,532
What is going on?

1347
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:43,996
Go, Asta!

1348
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,099
With this…

1349
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:18,781
You bastard, how badly
do you want to destroy this country?!

1350
01:41:18,864 --> 01:41:20,824
Oh, you have no idea!

1351
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,284
It needs to be destroyed!

1352
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,120
This nation is rotten to its core.

1353
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:29,166
The very foundation of it
needs to be destroyed.

1354
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:34,046
I have to save everyone. I must!

1355
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:39,343
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?!

1356
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:43,138
All those who are unreasonably oppressed!

1357
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,516
For their sake, I…

1358
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:58,570
I will…

1359
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,406
I will…

1360
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,080
Even if you're a peasant
or don't have magical power,

1361
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:10,582
you can be stronger
than anyone else in the world.

1362
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:14,086
You can be everyone's hope!

1363
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,506
And to prove it…

1364
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:22,678
I am going to be

1365
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,847
the Wizard King!

1366
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:54,960
<i>Did I… lose?</i>

1367
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:58,797
<i>Then why…</i>

1368
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:02,092
<i>why do I feel so at ease?</i>

1369
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,017
<i>Now I see it.</i>

1370
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:14,271
<i>Asta. Become the Wizard King.</i>

1371
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:20,903
<i>Share that warm world of yours</i>
<i>with every citizen in this nation.</i>

1372
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:24,907
<i>Never giving up is your magic.</i>

1373
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:26,575
<i>I know you can…</i>

1374
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:31,330
<i>You all…</i>

1375
01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:44,843
<i>I see.</i>

1376
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,243
Cheerful and honest,

1377
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:12,871
he knew how to empathize with the peasant.

1378
01:44:13,538 --> 01:44:18,293
Conrad used to be
a strong, kind man like Asta.

1379
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,089
But he was framed by the royalists,

1380
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:25,384
and ever since his squad
and his wife were slaughtered,

1381
01:44:26,009 --> 01:44:27,594
he changed.

1382
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:31,056
Asta.

1383
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,891
Thank you for stopping him.

1384
01:44:34,434 --> 01:44:38,939
Why was I able to use
the Imperial Sword at the end?

1385
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:39,898
What do you mean?

1386
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:43,402
When I hit the Imperial Sword
with my Demon-Slayer Sword,

1387
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:46,113
the magic of the Imperial Sword
must've been neutralized.

1388
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,198
So I was wondering…

1389
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,077
Well, that's because…

1390
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,583
<i>Generations of Wizard Kings…</i>

1391
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:05,590
…generations of Wizard Kings
lent you their miraculous power.

1392
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:08,927
Wow, that sounds so cool!

1393
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:11,346
Silly, he's teasing you.

1394
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:12,723
That's not true!

1395
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:15,142
<i>Generations of Wizard Kings.</i>

1396
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:19,563
<i>The clovers responsible for the future</i>
<i>of this kingdom are growing up nicely.</i>

1397
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:22,482
-You making fun of Prince Lemiel?
<i>-</i>How about it, Asta?

1398
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:25,152
The Wizard King is incredible, right?

1399
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:26,403
I knew that, sir!

1400
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,489
And one day,
I'll be that incredible myself.

1401
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,616
I will become the Wizard King!

1402
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:32,857
Don't you be slacking here.

1403
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:35,235
I worked my butt off, you know?!

1404
01:49:39,197 --> 01:49:41,032
The place was a total shambles,

1405
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:44,119
but it looks like things might be
restored sooner than I thought.

1406
01:49:44,202 --> 01:49:45,245
Yeah.

1407
01:49:50,041 --> 01:49:52,752
Conrad was the Wizard King, too, huh?

1408
01:49:54,504 --> 01:49:55,338
Ouch!

1409
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:57,340
Not a chance.

1410
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:00,468
You're right!

1411
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:04,264
I'm going to be the Wizard King, anyway.

1412
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:05,682
No, I will!

1413
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:07,267
I'm going to be the Wizard King!

1414
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,936
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1415
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,646
Wanna go?

1416
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,732
The Triumph was canceled,

1417
01:50:13,815 --> 01:50:16,776
but you and me gotta settle this match!

1418
01:50:18,194 --> 01:50:19,279
Not a chance.

1419
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,581
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
