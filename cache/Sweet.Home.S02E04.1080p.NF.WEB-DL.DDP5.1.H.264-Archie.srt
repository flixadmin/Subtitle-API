We'll go in five minutes. Be ready.

[Sang-jin] Is the danger even real?

109
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,906
Or are your so-called excursions
an excuse for keeping the riches?

110

What the hell did you say, you idiot, huh?

Am I wrong?

112
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
You used to take
as many survivors as you could.

What's up with recent ban?

114
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,874
You even turned a blind eye to the murder.

115

I just find it
really hard to believe that…

you're suddenly looking out for us!

117

Take this. It's dangerous.

118

So, can I really go out?

119

Isn't that what you wanted?

Yeah.

We're putting our lives
on the line for you.

If you're so sure of your skills,
fend for yourselves out there.

It won't be long
until you learn to acknowledge

the peace you've grown so accustomed to.

131

-I know that much.
-Keep it down, okay? They'll hear you.

-Let them hear for all I care!

They can't touch us no matter what we do!

Think of it this way.

That Crow Platoon,
they're basically glorified bodyguards

They can't protect us and hurt us.

-They can all go to hell!
-[Dong-gi] Be quiet.

Don't go, it's not worth it.

Not everyone feels like that.

It's because of you, we're still alive.

Don't touch it.

153

It'll take time to heal.

154

We all have to do it.

I'm fine.

Don't worry, be patient.

But we're low on ammo.

00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,220
-Besides, nothing happened last time.
-Well, when you put it that way,

486
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,431
I guess it's a lot better
than going on an expedition.

487
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,434
Sure, it's safe, but the real issue
is that we don't get much from it.

488
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,562
To be honest, we get close to nothing
in terms of rations.

489
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,148
Going on such expeditions
was a really wonderful job.

490
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,691
We can get drunk, right?

491
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,651
-[chuckling]
-Damn, I should've thought of it.

492
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,362
-Now I want booze.
-Where are we going today for work?

493
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,366
Wait a minute. You're really here to work?

494
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,993
Well, a man's gotta eat, you know.

495
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,037
-[chuckles]
-He can't be serious.

496
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,747
Guess his gambling money has run out.

497
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,665
I can't believe
how arrogant you are, dude.

498
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,125
Why would Chief Ji take you, huh?

499
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,501
[Gi-chun] He's right.

500
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,545
Just scamper off somewhere else.

501
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,213
-Jesus!
-Huh? Get the hell out of here.

502
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,674
I won't go.
I mean, why should I have to do that?

503
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,384
What the hell did I do wrong?

504
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,469
Are you for real, man?

505
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,763
Aren't you from that witch's family?

506
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,264
[scoffs]
That's not true!

507
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,059
Oh! My God! My name is Kang! Jesus Christ!

508
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,812
I don't even have a drop of blood
in common with Lee Eun-yu!

509
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,816
When you have a sworn enemy,
you hate anyone with an association.

510
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,944
Chief Ji's only letting you people
stay here because she's a good person.

511
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,822
But we should've cut you
and your lot loose a long time ago.

512
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,033
-Assholes!
-What did you say, you fucker?

513
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:37,992
Nothing, sir.

514
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,452
-Let it go.
-Prick.

515
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,621
[sighs]
Shit.

516
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,622
Damn.

517
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,668
[Seung-wan] Um… Ms… Ms. Jung?
[awkward chuckle]

518
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,337
Um, could you, um…

519
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,464
Could you put in a good word
to the chief for me

520
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,466
-so I can go out and…
-[Ye-seul scoffs]

521
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,385
Again, why do you keep
bringing this up with me?

522
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,346
Everything they said was legitimate.

523
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,849
Well, it's just, you know, uh,
it feels unfair, that's all.

524
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
You have Lee Eun-yu to thank for that.

525
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,187
That crazy bitch put you in this position.

526
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,356
-[gate opens]
-Oh, I was embarrassed.

527
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,149
Mom!

528
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,401
-[woman] Hi, ma'am.
-[man] Hi, Chief Ji.

529
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,570
-Mom.
-Hi, everyone.

530
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,782
How's your back?

531
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,325
All better now, Chief, thanks to you.

532
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,660
-Feeling all right?
-Yeah.

533
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,996
Hello, everyone.

534
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,039
[man] Hello.

535
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,877
Today, we'll be repairing
the east side of the outer wall.

536
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,588
Since we're going outside,
we have to be extra careful.

537
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,382
Please understand that only a few can go.

538
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,592
-Mr. Yoon?
-Yes, Chief?

539
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,678
-[Chief Ji] Where's Cheol-yong? Right.
-Right here, ma'am.

540
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,388
-[Chief Ji] Mr. Kim.
-[Mr. Kim] Thank you, ma'am.

541
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,848
-[Chief Ji] And, uh, Jae-chan.
-Yes.

542
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,932
[Chief Ji] Seok-chan.

543
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,392
-Skinny!
-Here!

544
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,852
[Chief Ji and men chuckling]

545
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,563
[Chief Ji] And lastly…

546
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,359
Seung-wan.

547
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
[Seung-wan] Yes?

548
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,612
Oh. Yeah!

549
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,323
[Chief Ji] Let's try to get this done
before sundown, all right?

550
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,117
-Let's go.
-[man] Yes, ma'am.

551
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,118
Oh.

552
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,037
Right, I can do this. I can do this.

553
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,498
[Ye-seul] That's all.
Back to what you were doing, everyone.

554
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,209
Return to your stations.

555
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,089
She's such a joke. I swear.

556
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,716
She's just a freaking joke.

557
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,384
Why would she pick that lazy bastard?

558
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,385
Hey, come on.

559
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,012
Watch your mouth.

560
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,933
She's the one who keeps this place
running with electricity and all.

561
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,353
I even gave her a heart,
and now I'm hurt I didn't get to go.

562
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,396
I get it.

563
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,108
Come to the testimony meeting.

564
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,447
[Peter] Do attend and hear the good word.

565
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,993
And just unload all that pent-up stress.

566
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,286
Thank you so much.

567
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,663
[Peter] I'll give you one if you attend.
[soft chuckle]

568
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,295
Come and relieve your suffering.

569
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,506
And do the job you have to do.

570
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,551
Why let a pretty face like that
go to waste?

571
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,054
Don't you think, Jin-a?

572
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,270
[Yong-seok] Go to the right.

573

Chief Ji.

577
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,454
Couldn't you squeeze me in as well?

578
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,956
It's tough work.

579
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,082
I'll be fine, I swear.

580
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,002
I used to work an entire farm myself,
you know.

581
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,253
Sorry, I can't.

582
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,130
It's just…
[breathing heavily]

583
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,216
…you give more pay
to those who work, right?

584
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,220
You know I'm old, but not a burden.

585
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,598
And I could really use some sun.

586
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,351
I need to get some exercise. Please.

587
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,522
I'll take half
of what you pay the others, okay?

588
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,441
Ma'am, that's not the issue.

[Ye-seul] Yeah, right.

And those around the corner?

595
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,741
They're all mine, so…

596
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,994
[Seon-hwa] No way.

597
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,662
I'm so much richer than you are.

598
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,624
Give me some money then.
I deserve it, don't I?

599
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,751
Why would I do that?

You take me for a chump.

Huh?

That's why I'm getting myself a makeover.

00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,297
I wanted to leave.

[somber music playing]

00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,559
I wanted to disappear quietly,
but I guess that was too much to ask.

649
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,771
All that nonsense
about accepting death with grace is a lie.

[breathing shakily]

I'm… really scared.

00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,116
I just wanna keep on living.

Back off now.

Both of you, there's no reason
to injure yourself

for a useless old lady like me.

I just cause trouble for everyone.

Don't get any closer!
I told you not to come! Don't!

There, give me your hand.

Do you know how to disarm that thing?

You did this to yourself.

[Seung-wan] No, no, no,
we just need to go back inside, okay?

-I can't leave him out there.

You have to. It's not up to us.

[Jun-il's mom] That's enough. Go now.

Why would I do that?

705
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,549
Because I need to ask a favor.

706
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,179
I left without even saying
a proper goodbye to Jun-il.

707
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,806
He'll think I abandoned him…

708
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,934
if I die like this, you understand?

709
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,270
Tell him that's not how it was.

710
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,483
Please tell him I would never abandon him.

711
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,984
You'll tell him yourself.

712
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,154
Something so important
should be said in person.

[In-hwan] How long has it been?

I'm sorry, sir.

I can't do that.

She's only alive
because she's not a monster yet.

It's pure conjecture for the time being.

Sir, if you don't mind, I'd like
your permission to do everything we can.

00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
You want to ditch him and leave?

806
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,465
Would you abandon him
if he was your brother?

807
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,634
That's a useless distinction.
We're all brothers here.

808
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,428
You're the one that referred to him
like a total stranger, you punk.

That came from the camp, right?

Kang Seok-chan.

818
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,031
[Seok-chan] Yes, sir.

819
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,534
Was there any evidence of blood
or struggle back at the mall?

820
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,369
[Seok-chan] No, sir.

821
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,037
Then we'll return for now.

-The stadium comes first.

We brought most of the firepower with us.
We have to return.

824
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,547
Provided Yong-seok isn't harmed,

825
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,632
he can make it back alone.

826
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,969
Then if not, we'll go look for him.

827
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,346
We have to go.

828
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:57,849
Let's go.
