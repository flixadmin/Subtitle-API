1
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:06,230
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,662
Star City's seen better days.

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,298
They built a wall.

4
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:12,725
Star City is a wall-free zone once again.

5
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:14,344
Restoring The Glades won't be easy.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,788
The four of you are the
heroes that this city needs.

7
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,034
We're stepping back.
We're leaving Star City.

8
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,256
What now?

9
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:21,858
A crisis is imminent.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,359
What does the multiverse require?

11
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,103
We seek to prevent the inevitable.

12
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,571
What are you not telling me?

13
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:28,347
I've seen your future, Oliver,

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,254
inexorable and unavoidable.

15
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:32,051
I have watched you die.

16
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,477
Among the many misconceptions
humanity holds dear is

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,796
the fallacy that all
beings are created equal.

18
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,279
In truth, there are
those who are greater.

19
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:12,075
They are called heroes.

20
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:19,323
But even among heroes,
there are different echelons.

21
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:23,828
The highest belong to
those known as the paragons.

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,299
And they are the only
hope of all creation.

24
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,526
Oliver?

25
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,097
Hi, Mom.

26
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,450
Ohh. Ohh.

27
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,829
I missed you so much.

28
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:59,955
Oh, my beautiful boy. My beautiful boy.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,553
Your room is exactly as you left it.

30
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:25,172
I never had the heart
to change anything.

31
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:28,893
I can't tell you how
great it feels to be home.

32
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:32,355
Oliver, it's really you.

33
00:02:32,357 --> 00:02:34,765
Hi, Malcolm.

34
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,160
Welcome home.

35
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:42,319
Okay, what... where's... Where's Walter?

36
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:44,673
He sold his shares of the company

37
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,134
when the Gambit went down.

38
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:51,380
Okay. Okay.

39
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,347
What'd I tell you?

40
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,331
Yachts suck.

41
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,793
I knew it. I knew you were
too stubborn to be dead.

42
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,734
Tommy.

43
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:13,363
Come on, man. Why are
you looking at me like

44
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,531
I'm the one who's been gone a decade?

45
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,116
I just missed you.

46
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:21,913
Where's Thea?

47
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:26,692
Sweetheart, um, why don't you settle in?

48
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:28,544
I mean, you must be exhausted.

49
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:30,755
Yeah, but I'd like to see Thea.

50
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:36,386
Oliver, when you and
your father disappeared...

51
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,164
It wasn't easy on her.

52
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,874
She took things really hard.

53
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,923
And there is this new
drug called Vertigo.

54
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,024
- I swear to you...
- Tommy.

55
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,139
I tried my best to look...

56
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,233
Tommy, Tommy, look,
it wasn't your fault.

57
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,388
What wasn't his fault?

58
00:03:56,398 --> 00:04:00,376
Thea, on her 18th birthday...

59
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,248
She overdosed.

60
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,840
Raisa's famous chicken Marsala?

61
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:17,923
I used to make this for
William all the time.

62
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,584
Who's William?

63
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:20,704
Oh, I know.

64
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:23,389
He was, like, your Wilson
on the island, right?

65
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:24,540
Something like that.

66
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:28,271
How did you manage to survive
by yourself all that time?

67
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:31,298
It's a long story.

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,609
So, uh, things you missed

69
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,469
while you were gone.

70
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:39,223
I got married and divorced twice.

71
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:43,477
Ah, let's see. What
other gossip did you miss?

72
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,371
Our parents getting married.

73
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,855
- It's, um...
- Complicated.

74
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:56,027
Oliver, I know this must all be a lot.

75
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,461
Well, mom, my apologies, but
I actually am a little tired,

76
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,497
and I think I'm gonna
head up to my bedroom.

77
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,099
Thank you for dinner.

78
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:36,789
Hey.

79
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,749
Your bed has been made.

80
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,891
And there are fresh
towels in the bathroom.

81
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,346
Thank you.

82
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:48,259
I know the changes must be overwhelming,

83
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,269
and you must feel like you're

84
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,045
on a different planet or something.

85
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:53,772
You could say that.

86
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,478
It couldn't have been easy
all those years on that island.

87
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,856
Sounds like it wasn't that easy here.

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,033
Now, you're not the same
man as when you left.

89
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,536
And don't take this the wrong way,

90
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,588
but I get the sense that it's...

91
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:11,457
it's for the better.

92
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,087
I'm not so sure.

93
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:20,032
Mom, when we were growing up,

94
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:26,848
if you had to leave me
and Thea to protect us...

95
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,804
Would you have done it?

96
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:38,025
Oliver, whether right or wrong,

97
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:41,509
everything I've ever done
was to protect my children.

98
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,990
It's all a parent can do.

99
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:50,949
And someday, hmm,
when you have children,

100
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,769
you'll understand.

101
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,901
Mom, I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:58,496
Ohh. Ohh.

103
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,068
Everything's okay.

104
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:03,885
You're home. You're safe.

105
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,812
Close your eyes, sweetheart.

106
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:09,531
Get some rest, okay?

107
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:10,959
All right.

108
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,296
You have failed this city.

109
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,329
Hyah!

110
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:46,269
Stand down.

111
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:49,181
Oliver, what the hell are you doing

112
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,075
on my Earth?

113
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,792
Showoff.

114
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:17,485
Jealous?

115
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,946
Nostalgic.

116
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:22,490
It seems Adrian and I
have the same design sense.

117
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:26,786
If by that you mean Felicity, yeah.

118
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:29,163
But this is my bunker.

119
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:30,498
And chase?

120
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,998
He's one of the good guys, literally.

121
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,979
And you're helping him in Star City.

122
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:38,830
Starling City. And he's helping me.

123
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,301
We make a pretty good team, actually.

124
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:44,229
Not that kind of a team.

125
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:47,015
So how much small talk
do I have to endure

126
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,265
before you tell me what
it is exactly you're doing

127
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:50,684
on my Earth?

128
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,496
Yeah, it's a long story.

129
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:54,314
Why don't you start by telling me

130
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,009
what you were doing on Lian Yu?

131
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,151
You know, if you wanted to
pretend to be back from the dead,

132
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,671
you could've just showed up in town.

133
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:00,957
I wasn't given a choice.

134
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,698
I was sent to your Earth,
and I arrived on Lian Yu.

135
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:07,344
Sent? Sent by who?

136
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:09,655
You get him to tell you
the truth yet, pretty bird?

137
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,348
And nothing but.

138
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,631
Seems Mr. Queen survived the Gambit

139
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,926
and has spent the last 12 years
on an island called Lian Yu.

140
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,839
That means "purgatory"
if I'm not mistaken.

141
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:21,766
It still doesn't
explain what you're doing

142
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,371
running around in my hood.

143
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,278
I needed an identity to work under,

144
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:26,855
and yours seemed convenient.

145
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,274
Sorry.

146
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,034
What were you doing at Queen-Merlyn?

147
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:32,444
Not killing those scientists,

148
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,020
if that's what you are implying.

149
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:36,206
Well, I'm using Laurel's
equipment to compare

150
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,691
the metallurgy of your arrows
to the ones that we found

151
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,711
in those men and women, so we'll see.

152
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,338
Speak of the devil.

153
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,550
Literally.

154
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,824
The Dark Archer? Name's
a bit on the nose,

155
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:50,203
but it's descriptive.

156
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,746
Dark costume, jade pendant.

157
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,022
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

158
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,179
- Yeah, we thought so, too.
- Ruled him out months ago.

159
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,135
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

160
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,736
And he killed those
scientists for a reason.

161
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,497
Where are you going?

162
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,550
I'm gonna have a
conversation with my stepdad.

163
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,947
It never ceases to impress...

164
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,161
Humanity's capacity for invention.

165
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,780
Hmm. Infinite number of worlds,

166
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:29,501
and not a single one where
man fails to emerge from caves

167
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,756
and hold dominion over the Earth.

168
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,779
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,788
Reminding you what you are doing here,

170
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,299
which does not include interfering

171
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,768
in the events of this Earth.

172
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,199
I have no intention of interfering.

173
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,254
Well, you're not here to
confront Malcolm Merlyn

174
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:44,146
with your suspicion that
he is the Dark Archer.

175
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,759
Well, I went to applied
sciences last night

176
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:48,517
to retrieve the Dwarf Star particles

177
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,946
just like you asked me to.

178
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,783
You make it sound like a trifle.

179
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:55,694
Those specific particles
can only be found

180
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:57,416
on this Earth out of a multitude.

181
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,198
My point is that when I arrived,
Malcolm had already stolen them.

182
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,609
You know what might help?

183
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,731
If I actually knew why I was after them.

184
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,985
That I have tasked you
should be reason enough.

185
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:12,618
Or have you come to doubt your
commitment to this mission?

186
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,596
No, I have not.

187
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,626
At Harris Consolidated, we see the
wall coming down as an opportunity.

188
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:23,061
For the criminals of Star
City to rob The Glades blind?

189
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:24,207
To reunite the city.

190
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,136
I don't think people in
The Glades got that memo

191
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,301
'cause last I checked, crime's up 300%

192
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:29,554
since the wall went down.

193
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:32,730
There's an old saying...
There are 3 kinds of liars:

194
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:36,814
Liars, damn liars, and statisticians.

195
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:39,767
You're focusing on The Glades
to the exclusion of Star City

196
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,790
while net, there's been a
citywide reduction in crime.

197
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:46,858
And we have the vigilantes who brought
down the wall in the first place

198
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,277
to thank for that.

199
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,339
Hear that, guys? We're famous.

200
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:53,600
Really? 'Cause it sounds
like we got a long way to go.

201
00:12:53,603 --> 00:12:55,395
Which is why we're here, to make sure

202
00:12:55,398 --> 00:12:57,830
nothing happens to Mr. Vasquez.

203
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:01,000
Whoa. And where do
you think you're going?

204
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:04,548
Movement outside. Gonna check it out.

205
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,671
Negative.

206
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,006
Don't break perimeter.

207
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:08,525
Relax. It'll take a sec.

208
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,026
Just like Pennytown.

209
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:12,145
What was that, Mr. Harris?

210
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,532
Uh... oh. I... I was just
saying that the unification money

211
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,368
put into Pennytown prevented
a potential disaster

212
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,780
because we listened to each other.

213
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:24,247
Well, she's either
ignoring you, William...

214
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,784
For the second time this month.

215
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:27,193
Or the comm systems are failing.

216
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,545
For the fifth time this month.

217
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,253
It's a new era.

218
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,566
Growing pains are to be expected. Heh!

219
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,871
Mia, do you copy?

220
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,965
Excuse me, miss.

221
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,963
Mr. Vasquez doesn't want any
guests wandering the property.

222
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,563
This neighborhood just...
just isn't safe anymore.

223
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,232
Sorry. I just, uh, wanted a look around.

224
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,383
Mia.

225
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:54,821
Allow me to escort you back in.

226
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:06,809
We recently completed
a total I.T. upgrade.

227
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,920
500 miles worth of
high-capacity fiber optics

228
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,199
married to an underground server farm.

229
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:15,408
Is something like that
for applied sciences?

230
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,785
We had a small incident
there last night.

231
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,620
Very unfortunate.

232
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,414
The police are investigating.

233
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,083
Oh, that's too bad. I
hope no one was hurt.

234
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,102
So do you think it had
anything to do with the, um,

235
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,296
the Dwarf... the Dwarf Star project?

236
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,589
How do you know about that?

237
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,775
Oh, the Internet. Heh!

238
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,845
I didn't know you had Wi-Fi on Lian Yu.

239
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,948
No, no, no. I wish. I stayed
up late at the house last night,

240
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,764
doing my research, catching up.

241
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,975
Well, the press coverage
hasn't been particularly kind.

242
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:43,102
Everyone wants to make
the Dwarf Star project

243
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:44,955
out to be something sinister,

244
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:48,316
but it's just an alternative
energy source project,

245
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,109
completely benign.

246
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,820
I suppose everything's a
matter of interpretation.

247
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,991
Now, do you think that
someone could show me

248
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,543
to the most important room on this tour?

249
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:01,137
And, uh, what would that be?

250
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,014
The bathroom.

251
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:14,985
It's supposed to be red.

252
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:16,501
Excuse me.

253
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:20,152
Nothing. Sorry. I'm
looking for Felicity Smoak.

254
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:23,351
Ha ha! Like Felicity
Smoak would slum it in I.T.

255
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:24,919
Instead of running Smoak Tech.

256
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:27,688
Oh, good for her. Sorry.

257
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,583
Who does run the I.T. department?

258
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,689
There you are.

259
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:10,856
Malcolm Merlyn, you
have failed this city.

260
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:13,501
I... I... don't know what
you think I did, but I...

261
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,424
Aah!

262
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,466
Oh, God.

263
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,894
Get out of here!

264
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,297
Oh, no.

265
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:17,192
So that's your story.

266
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:20,422
An Archer in black flew
in and attacked the hood.

267
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:22,413
Hmm?

268
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:26,584
Well, who is he? Why did he do that?

269
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:30,237
I don't know. Find him, and you ask.

270
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:32,906
First there was an attack
on applied sciences.

271
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,980
Now there's a war between
two masks in your own office.

272
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,252
And your point, Sergeant?

273
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,079
My point is that I highly
doubt this is a coincidence.

274
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,049
Well, obviously not.

275
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,066
Somebody is clearly
targeting my father's company.

276
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,616
Right. Except from his statement,

277
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,256
your father claimed the hood

278
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:51,091
was targeting him.

279
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,903
It's funny. He doesn't
usually go after the good guys.

280
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,947
All right. Interview's over.

281
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,898
Anything else you need, Sergeant Drake,

282
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,618
you can either go through
me or Mr. Merlyn's attorney.

283
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,788
Perfect. I needed something
to look forward to.

284
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:10,303
She's got a point.

285
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,463
It's a lot of drama
for the past 24 hours.

286
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:15,098
Maybe we should reconsider
Oliver's welcome home party.

287
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:16,950
No, no, no, no. It'll just look like

288
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,493
we're trying to cover something up.

289
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,222
Yeah. And I missed tequila.

290
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,928
Oliver.

291
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,753
I want you to meet John Diggle.

292
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:31,506
He'll be accompanying you from now on.

293
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,843
Er... no. Sorry. No. I
don't need a babysitter, Mom.

294
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:37,846
No, this is something that I need.

295
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,782
Yeah.

296
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,775
So what do I call you?

297
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:52,132
Diggle. Dig if you want.

298
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,345
Sorry, Oliver. Fool me once.

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,376
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't easy.

300
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:09,520
It was like you disappeared
off the face of the Earth...

301
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:13,131
Until Felicity figured out
that it was only our Earth.

302
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,387
Still, John, it's not like
you can just charter a jet.

303
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:19,563
Cisco let me borrow it.

304
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,473
And now if I'm done
answering your questions,

305
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:22,867
I have a few of my own.

306
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,702
- Can't talk about it.
- Can't or won't?

307
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:27,020
You know, Oliver, it's interesting

308
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,730
that we're revisiting when we first met.

309
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,010
You going at it all
alone is like deja vu.

310
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,587
I thought you and I were past that.

311
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,547
This is new. It's bigger.

312
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:42,162
And I'm not going to ask you
to take the risk it involves.

313
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,538
Oliver, that's the thing
about being brothers.

314
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,681
You never, ever have to ask.

315
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:51,228
Can you just believe me when
I tell you this is different?

316
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,494
Yeah. Felicity told
me. Some godlike being

317
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,622
talking about the end of the universe?

318
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,909
What didn't she tell me, Oliver?

319
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,953
A crisis is coming, John.

320
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,942
He's seen what happens.

321
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,754
He's watched me die.

322
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:23,356
Thank you for not making a
fuss about coming back in.

323
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,063
I wouldn't want you and your friends

324
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:26,338
to miss out on the party.

325
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:43,948
Don't engage the Deathstrokes.

326
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,617
They're a distraction.

327
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,662
Guys! No one listens to the tech guy.

328
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,256
Fine. I guess I'll do it.

329
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,059
William.

330
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,252
You okay?

331
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:15,628
Yeah. Mia, you okay?

332
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,314
They took Vasquez.

333
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,174
The Deathstroke Gang.

334
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,559
Screw them.

335
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,289
Who's the one playing security guard?

336
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,729
He knew who I was.

337
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,232
He knows who we all are.

338
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,475
What? How?

339
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:28,993
He's my brother.

345
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,179
that I made sure the bar
was stocked with Pinot Noir.

346
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,436

348

You know, the party's back that way.

349
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,561
I don't have time for this, John.

350
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:11,438
Oliver...

351
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,854
Has it occurred to you that
whatever happens in this crisis

352
00:22:13,856 --> 00:22:16,195
happens because you push the
people closest to you away?

353
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,233
So you're in a forward area.

354
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:21,378
Somebody throws a grenade right
into the middle of your platoon.

355
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,955
What do you do?

356
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:24,456
I jump on it. I contain the blast.

357
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,335
That's what I'm doing.

358
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:29,794
I can't prevent whatever it is
that's going to happen to me,

359
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:34,182
but I will be damned if I'm
going to put other people at risk.

360
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,227
And I will be damned

361
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,472
if I just let you go
gently into that good night.

362
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:43,121
Okay.

363
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:44,527
All right.

364
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:51,733
You always fall for this move.

365
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:03,254
Wow. That Lian Yu must have
been one hell of a place...

366
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,673
Oliver.

367
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,747
So were you ever really gone?

368
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:15,981
Because it looks like
you've been running around

369
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,609
in a certain green hood.

370
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:20,629
Like you've been running
around in a black one?

371
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:24,797
Heh. Ah, Ollie, you never should've
gotten yourself involved in this.

372
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:46,698
Hope I didn't hurt you.

373
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,209
Leave us.

374
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,010
So I've been thinking it over,

375
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,049
and you really were on Lian Yu,

376
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:03,926
because if you had been here, you
would've been protecting our sister.

377
00:24:06,604 --> 00:24:09,352
So the question is,

378
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,987
why are you running
around in the hood's hood?

379
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,209
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

380
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:17,512
The hood is running around
this city, thinking that

381
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:22,225
he's saving it, and nothing can save it.

382
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:26,187
You don't understand the cancer

383
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:29,124
that has taken over this city.

384
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:34,546
Oh, my God. This is the undertaking.

385
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:40,928
You stole the Dwarf Star
particles because you want...

386
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,707
to destroy The Glades and
get vengeance for Thea.

387
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,684
How could you know that?

388
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:58,487
And what happened to you on that island?

389
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:03,617
What happened to you
while I was on the island?

390
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:11,416
While you were gone, this
city has been rotting.

391
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,919
It can't be saved!

392
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:15,945
That's not true, Tommy.

393
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,240
I have seen Starling City come back

394
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,075
from darker moments than this.

395
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:25,288
It can be redeemed. You can be redeemed.

396
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,416
You don't understand what I've seen.

397
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,102
You don't know

398
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:32,378
how I found our sister.

399
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,443
Every time I close my eyes, I
see her body lying there, cold,

400
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,970
on a dirty floor.

401
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:44,258
So I swore that I would
get vengeance on The Glades

402
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,755
for what it did to Thea,

403
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:49,229
and I am not going to
let her down. Not again!

404
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,256
That's not gonna make
you feel better, Tommy.

405
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,485
I don't care about feeling better.

406
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:57,320
I just want The Glades to suffer.

407
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,006
You're a better man than this.

408
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:02,384
That was a different me.

409
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:06,096
Good-bye, Oliver.

410
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,000
Tonight was a disaster.

411
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,212
You mean you were. JJ never
would've gotten past us

412
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,411
if you hadn't abandoned your post.

413
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:15,653
Oh, you think this is my fault?

414
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,557
What I think is that you
need to stop going rogue

415
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,151
and start acting like
you're part of this team.

416
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:22,345
Hey, guys, can we save
it for the Deathstrokes?

417
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,620
Speaking of your evil brother
and his masked maniacs,

418
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:26,516
we're gonna talk about that, right?

419
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,994
Wrong. What do you got?

420
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:32,405
Nothing good. Ever since we
brought down the wall, your broth...

421
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,857
The Deathstroke Gang has
really upped their game.

422
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,325
They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.

423
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:38,558
Unintended consequences.

424
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:41,030
Yeah. But that doesn't explain
why they went after Vasquez.

425
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,220
Vasquez is one of The
Glades' wealthiest citizens.

426
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:45,106
And maybe the deathstrokes
plan to extort him.

427
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:47,109
Yeah, that or they're
planning to ransom him off.

428
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:49,314
Either way, this guy's screwed
if we don't find him soon.

429
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,475
Way ahead of you.

430
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,570
Satellite imaging indicates
that the Deathstrokes

431
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,599
have assumed control of the
old Galaxy One headquarters.

432
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:55,929
It could be where
they're holding Vasquez.

433
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,649
If he's even still alive.

434
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:00,891
There's only one way
to find out. Suit up.

435
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:09,559
Let me guess. When mom and O.G.
Team Arrow anointed us version 2.0,

436
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,395
you expected things to
go a little better, right?

437
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,398
I'm sure they had their
growing pains, too.

438
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,876
And, look, I know that working

439
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:19,527
and playing well with others is still

440
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:22,295
a new concept for you, but do you think

441
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,446
you could just follow
Connor's lead this one time?

442
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:27,552
I mean, the guy is a Knightwatch Agent.

443
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:29,462
He eats, sleeps, and
breathes tactical operations.

444
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:32,582
Yeah. And our target is his own brother.

445
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,632
I believe that fate brought the
four of us together for a reason

446
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:37,470
just like it did our parents

447
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:39,981
when they decided to save this city.

448
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:45,987
Now it's our turn.

449
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,032
We don't want to mess it up, do we?

450
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:08,956
Uh!

451
00:28:29,497 --> 00:28:30,955
How did you find me?

452
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,645
- Tracking your shoe.
- Really?

453
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:33,810
Just kidding. That
was the way I found you

454
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,222
last time this happened, remember?

455
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:38,272
Yeah. Yeah. It's not the only
history that's repeating yourself.

456
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:40,972
Tommy's planning his
very own undertaking.

457
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:44,037
Don't worry. We'll stop him.

458
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,822
John, I appreciate the assist,

459
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,658
but I still have to do this on my own.

460
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,004
Right, because you think
you have to die, right?

461
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:52,995
No. I know I'm gonna die.

462
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,987
And I know that I don't
have to accept that.

463
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,122
If I let you help me, you will
get hurt or you will get killed.

464
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,666
And it will be because of me.

465
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,089
- You don't know that.
- I do know that.

466
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:06,610
Because everyone else in my
life is either dead or alone.

467
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:09,303
Look at the Earth that we're on.

468
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,898
I've been gone 12 years.

469
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:13,632
My mother's alive. Tommy's alive.

470
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,735
Laurel's alive.

471
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:17,403
Thea is dead.

472
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,522
And, yes, Tommy's alive.

473
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,984
But he's trying another undertaking
with Rene and Dinah helping,

474
00:29:22,986 --> 00:29:26,687
who, if you haven't noticed,
are very bad people here.

475
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,187
Oliver, this world isn't better.

476
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,824
It's much, much worse.

477
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:31,993
You know why?

478
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:33,803
Because you weren't in it.

479
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:40,626
I've known you long enough to
know I can't talk you out of this.

480
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:43,045
You better have a good plan.

481
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,354
Oh, look who it is,
and you brought a friend

482
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,878
to my secret bunker.

483
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,381
I've been here before.

484
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:55,850
Oh, great. You're here, too.

485
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:58,945
Uh, Adrian, this is John Diggle.

486
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:01,373
He's my... bodyguard.

487
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,991
You need a bodyguard?

488
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:04,742
He's not a bodyguard.

489
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,902
And I thought you didn't need our help.

490
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:09,956
I've been wrong before. The Dark
Archer stole Dwarf Star particles

491
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:13,459
and is planning to use them
to level The Glades tonight.

492
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:14,732
And you know that how?

493
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:16,421
Because I was just with him.

494
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,375
Tommy Merlyn is the Dark Archer.

495
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:19,891
Are you sure?

496
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:22,686
He blames The Glades for
what happened to Thea.

497
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,715
If you wanted to level
an entire neighborhood,

498
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,300
how would you do it?

499
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,177
I'd use an earthquake machine.

500
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,262
That sounds like science fiction to me.

501
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,599
And Merlyn stole Dwarf Star particles,

502
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,735
which would make for a very real weapon.

503
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,690
Overlaying the blast radius
with a map of The Glades

504
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,212
should allow us to pinpoint
its optimal location.

505
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:48,165
He's like you, Curtis, and
Felicity all rolled into one.

506
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:50,738
I could only narrow it
down to 4 square blocks.

507
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:52,749
So we split up, find it on foot.

508
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,012
No, we don't. Thea died in The Glades.

509
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,732
We find out where, we find Tommy.

510
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,184
What are you, some kind of psychic?

511
00:30:58,187 --> 00:30:59,954
Maybe I'm just 10 steps ahead of you.

512
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,962
4587 Burke,

513
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:09,274
favorite hangout of The
Glades' worst drug dealers.

514
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,633
Good. That's where we head.

515
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,485
Suit up.

516
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,532
Tommy could be anywhere inside.

517
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:24,078
Start with the ground
floor. Work our way up.

518
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:27,032
Let's do this.

519
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,951
You should've stayed on that island.

520
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,878
Back on my Earth, you
had a better teacher.

521
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:36,757
You don't have to do this.

522
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,143
I was thinking the same thing.

523
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:41,753
This is not what Thea would have wanted.

524
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:45,472
That's funny. You know
what she used to say?

525
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,440
The dead don't want anything.

526
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:49,933
It's one of the benefits of being dead.

527
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,197
Tommy.

528
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:53,614
You can't. It's encrypted
by my personal code.

529
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,451
You can't break it in time.

530
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:58,219
You can.

531
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:04,258
I know how devastating it must have been

532
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,855
to lose Thea because we're only as good

533
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:12,049
as the people we have in our lives.

534
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:16,178
I lost people, too, Tommy.

535
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,668
I lost people closer to me

536
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:21,074
than I could possibly explain to you.

537
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:24,353
Every one of those losses
brings with it a choice

538
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:27,624
between darkness and light.

539
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:33,663
Make the right choice.

540
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:38,459
Are you gonna kill
thousands of innocent people,

541
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:42,931
or are you gonna be
the man I know you are?

542
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:13,544
That was a pretty good speech.

543
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:30,945
As agreed. The Dwarf Star particles
that power Merlyn's weapon.

544
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:32,287
Thank you.

545
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,603
And now you're gonna tell me
what you're gonna do with them?

546
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:38,528
Not destroy a city. Don't worry.

547
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,532
You're from a parallel
universe, aren't you?

548
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:44,793
The hood from another reality?

549
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:46,124
How did you know that?

550
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:49,818
Bruce Wayne once told me that
if you eliminate the impossible,

551
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:54,418
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

552
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:58,590
Well, as the hood from
a parallel universe,

553
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,051
may I offer you some advice?

554
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:05,008
Change "The Hood" to
Green Arrow. Trust me.

555
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,729
Why do I get the sense that you guys

556
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:15,487
won't be sticking around
for a victory drink?

557
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,002
We have to get back home to our Earth.

558
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,498
This city's lucky to have
a hero like you in it.

559
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:28,825
Wow. That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

560
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:30,580
Thank you.

561
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:32,958
You take care of yourself...

562
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,584
both of you.

563
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:40,775
You okay?

564
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:42,109
I'm alive.

565
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:43,686
You say that like it's a bad thing.

566
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:45,656
Well, it's a temporary thing, John.

567
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,356
Oliver, you don't know that.

568
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:49,570
And I don't know this
monitor, but what I do know,

569
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:51,118
that no one's fate is sealed.

570
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,437
- He saw me die.
- In the future...

571
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:55,498
Which means we can still prevent this.

572
00:36:58,277 --> 00:37:00,032
Oliver, you're not alone in this.

573
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:02,630
Well, not anymore.

574
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:04,322
Thanks for having my back.

575
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:07,635
Always. Now, can we go home now?

576
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,767
Just one more thing I got to do.

577
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:25,820
We'd better find Vasquez fast.

578
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,179
Where to, William?

579
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,897
Top floor, southwest corner office.

580
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:30,640
And JJ's got at least 4 friends.

581
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:32,517
The second I walk through
that door, JJ's gonna try

582
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,019
to run a sword through my chest.

583
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,854
But that should keep
him occupied long enough

584
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:37,355
for you to rescue Vasquez.

585
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:40,000
Whoa. You're using yourself as bait?

586
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:44,171
Yeah. And it'll work, too. Trust me.

587
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:49,658
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

588
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,174
Please stop.

589
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,952
The codes.

590
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:03,895
This better be everything.

591
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,159
It is. I swear.

592
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:11,907
Okay.

593
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:19,540
What's up, JJ?

594
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:23,169
- Miss me?
- Kill his ass.

595
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,683
Come on. Let's get you out of here.

596
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,820
You think that you can save this city?

597
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:54,074
I got news for you. I own this city now.

598
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,773
Mia!

599
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:06,245
I am so sorry, okay?
I underestimated him.

600
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,702
It will never happen again.

601
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,013
No, it won't, because from now on,

602
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,550
we're gonna do things my way.

603
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:20,861
Hey.

604
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,587
Hey.

605
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,589
You okay?

606
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:27,966
I don't know.

607
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:32,785
I haven't known
anything since Thea died.

608
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,190
I understand that.

609
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:36,617
I don't know, Ollie.

610
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:39,578
Just I... I can't shake this feeling...

611
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,024
That our sister would still be alive

612
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:46,109
if you had...

613
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:48,128
If you had just been here.

614
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,491
I've made my own mistakes.

615
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:55,377
Oh, God.

616
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,587
Tommy, are you okay?

617
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,567
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

618
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,728
I am so sorry.

619
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:12,719
I have to go. Mom?

620
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:23,414
Bye, Mom.

621
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:26,166
I love you.

622
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,851
I love you, too.

623
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:32,656
Hey.

624
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:34,824
I'll see you at the house.

625
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:36,093
Okay.

626
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,851
- All good?
- Let's go home.

627
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:54,146
What's going on?

628
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,014
My computer went down!

629
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,337
Oh, good. You're still here.

630
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,020
What's going on?

631
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:05,589
The city's under attack.

632
00:41:05,592 --> 00:41:07,115
By who?

633
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,223
We have to get the hell out of here.

634
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:22,554
- And go where?
- Home. Cisco's device.

635
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,104
- Oliver?
- Mom?

636
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,979
Dig, you got to go. Go now!

637
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:39,282
What's happening?

638
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,534
Oliver? Oliver!

639
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,840
Laurel, come on.

640
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:54,262
