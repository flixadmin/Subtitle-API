1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,341
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,804
<i>Six criminally-insane inmates
busted out of Arkham Asylum.</i>

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,307
<i>They want mass panic.</i>

5
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,105
Hello, Jim. How do I look?

6
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:22,023
Barbara!

7
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,234
- Yo, Commish.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,196
Don't move.

9
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:31,574
You should probably
get back to work.

10
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,785
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone.

11
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:37,080
It's a new day, Jim.

12
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,269
Jerome Valeska.

13
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,938
The attack on the G.C.P.D.

14
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,316
Someone on the streets is talking.

15
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,318
Somebody knows something.

16
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,988
Valeska has red hair. Crazy laugh.

17
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,115
Might be rolling with the blonde number.

18
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,409
I don't know anything. Honest.

19
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,994
- You believe him?
- Nope.

20
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:17,412
Me neither.

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,498
It's the truth!

22
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:22,167
But, hey, I can help you guys.

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,336
- You know, spread the word and stuff.
- Valeska killed a friend of ours.

24
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,924
Anybody hides him, anybody protects him,
they go down, too.

25
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,426
- You got it?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,720
- Now spread the word.
- No. No!

27
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,406
<i>Sneaking out?</i>

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,617
Just like a guy.

29
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,369
There are loose ends that need tying.

30
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,663
Need this?

31
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,801
Bring back bagels.

32
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,427
<i>No need for that.</i>

33
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,722
I thought Miss Kean and I could have
a little chat. Good morning.

34
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,517
Jerome's waiting outside.

35
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,353
<i>Try and keep him focused.</i>

36
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:38,785
You be nice.

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,581
You two seem to be getting along.

38
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,041
I'm so glad.

39
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,584
She needs a friend.

40
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,463
My sister is a very special person.

41
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,885
She seems so strong,
but yet she's quite fragile. Sugar?

42
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,387
Sure.

43
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:03,226
You acquitted yourself very well
at the adventure at the G.C.P.D.

44
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,354
Jim Gordon escaped the carnage unscathed.

45
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:09,148
- Top marks.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,778
Did you know my family built this city?

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,283
We carved the bedrock
upon which it stands.

48
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,537
But there is not a bridge, an alley,
a ditch that carries our name.

49
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:27,083
My forefathers were betrayed.
Their legacy erased.

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,836
And I am here to punish those
who wronged us,

51
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:32,005
and reclaim what is ours.

52
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,925
Strawberry?

53
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,137
I didn't ask.

54
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,557
So you're gonna take over Gotham
by unleashing a bunch of loonies.

55
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,808
Awesome plan.

56
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,393
That's only part one.

57
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,605
- So what's the second part?
- Oh, you're gonna love it.

58
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,398
There's a starring role for you.

59
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,152
You'll be famous and powerful.
And your fondest dream will come true.

60
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,779
You know my dreams, do you?

61
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,158
When Jim Gordon has
outlived his usefulness,

62
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:02,118
I'm gonna help you destroy him.

63
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,536
<i>Not kill him.</i>

64
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,997
<i>Destroy him.</i>

65
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,042
Body and soul.

66
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,923
<i>Bang</i>.

67
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>Shocking images.</i>

68
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,176
<i>Gotham is on high alert today after--</i>

69
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,510
Look,
I'm just saying, I'll chuck mopes

70
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,179
out of windows
until the cows come home,

71
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,264
but at some point,
we gotta go see Penguin.

72
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,434
Why would he break Jerome out of Arkham?
Or attack the G.C.P.D.?

73
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,394
He wouldn't.
But that weasel's running things now.

74
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,396
- If there's chatter, he'd know it.
- I'll think about it.

75
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,190
- Jim--
- I'll think about it.

76
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,525
Alvarez, where are you with
Jerome's circus contacts?

77
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,903
- Circus is upstate. I'm just waiting--
- Follow up.

78
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,112
His father's probably with him.

79
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,199
He covered for him once before.
He might have some information. Do it.

80
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,786
You, Detective.
Which escapee are you tracking?

81
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:46,037
Helzinger. No one's seen him.

82
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:48,706
He's 6'7", two-seventy-five
with the mind of a five-year-old.

83
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,291
Somebody's seen him.

84
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,586
Hey!

85
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,213
What are you doing?

86
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,091
That stays up until we have her killer
in custody, you understand?

87
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,425
Yes, sir.

88
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:07,475
Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers
were killed in this house.

89
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,268
In our house.

90
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,856
Their murderer stood right there
and he laughed at us.

91
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,151
Never forget that.

92
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,699
What?

93
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,244
- So how are you?
- I'm fine.

94
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,329
Really?

95
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,792
Look, I know Essen was your friend.

96
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,502
Lee, whatever you're about to say,

97
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,672
I know it's coming from a good place,
but I can't hear it right now.

98
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,388
So, the Gotham Children's Hospital gala
is tonight,

99
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,223
which I helped organize.

100
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:48,850
I can't.

101
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,852
- You can't go?
- No.

102
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,188
Even though a few hours away
from all of this might actually help.

103
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,440
Lee.

104
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:56,858
Okay.

105
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,985
I just have to tell you something,
because if I don't

106
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,362
and you find out, you're gonna be pissed.

107
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,365
There's gonna be a magician.

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,540
Yeah, you're right.

109
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,419
- Stop beating yourself up.
- I'm trying.

110
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,047
- I know you are.
- I should have been here. I wasn't.

111
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,465
Stop it.

112
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,425
Kiss me.

113
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,470
Kiss me.

114
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,020
Better?

115
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,822
Not to interrupt your
weirdly-timed make-out session,

116
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,283
<i>but Alvarez got in touch
with the circus manager.</i>

117
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,036
The blind fortune teller,
Jerome's dad, bailed on him.

118
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,121
Stayed in town. Got an address.

119
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,541
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

120
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,144
Who's there?

121
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,191
I know someone's there.

122
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,529
Hiya, Pops.

123
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,907
Long time, no see.

124
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,001
<i>So, how you doing?</i>

125
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,213
Ah, silent treatment, eh?

126
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,841
Here, I'll tell you a story.

127
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,551
Ah.

128
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,178
You remember Kansas City, Dad?

129
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:54,684
The circus went through town every spring,
right around my birthday.

130
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,938
There was this guy.

131
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,151
Him and my mom used to drink and fornicate

132
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,278
and beat the crap out of me.

133
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,363
<i>They would make a whole night out of it.</i>

134
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,740
And I remember one time.

135
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,077
It was my ninth birthday.

136
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:18,583
Him and my mom had just finished round one
of boozing, boning, beating up Jerome,

137
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,751
and were deciding to take a little break.

138
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,753
Anyway, hmm,

139
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,134
I was outside the trailer,
and you were there.

140
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,595
And you said,

141
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,431
"Why are you crying, Jerome?"

142
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,934
"It's my birthday,

143
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,687
"and my mom and the snake guy
are beating me."

144
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,272
And then you said,

145
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:46,277
"This world doesn't care about you
or anyone else, Jerome.

146
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,530
"Better to realize that now."

147
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,618
And that was it.

148
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,288
Well, you see, there's this guy, Dad.

149
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,166
He believes in me.
He thinks I'm gonna be a star.

150
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:04,503
And tonight,
all of Gotham will see that, too.

151
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,841
Except for you, 'cause you'll be,
you know, dead.

152
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,509
- Jerome--
- Oh, is this the part where you say

153
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,929
how sorry you are? Hmm?

154
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,639
How you should have believed in me?

155
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,641
How it's not too late to start again?

156
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,060
News flash, Dad, it's too late.

157
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,103
You don't have to do this.

158
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,899
No. I'm pretty sure I do.

159
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,194
I was a bad father. But I did love you.

160
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,363
To kill me for that--

161
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,328
It's not why I'm gonna kill you.

162
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,207
Plans to Arkham Asylum.

163
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,376
And look at these.

164
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,006
Letters between you and your troubled son.

165
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,133
Innocent at first glance,
but Detective Gordon--

166
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,593
You remember him, right?

167
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,930
He'll feel little bumps,

168
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,975
a secret message written in braille

169
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,520
between you and your son
discussing my escape.

170
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,442
Finally, the knockout gas
used to disable the orderlies.

171
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,945
'Cause you see, Dad,

172
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,531
this guy I was telling you about,

173
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,742
he's the one who broke me out of Arkham.

174
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,870
He doesn't want anyone to
know about that, obviously.

175
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,625
So, the police will find
these letters. Hmm.

176
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,211
They'll think,

177
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,715
"The blind old fool really loved his son.

178
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,718
"What a wonderful father."

179
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,387
There won't be a dry eye in the house.

180
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,597
They'll never believe it.

181
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,726
Ah, sure they will. Cops are dumb.

182
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,812
There's nothing to eat in this dump.
Finish up and let's go.

183
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,398
Sorry you're gonna miss my big night, Dad.

184
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,193
But, hey, you're psychic,

185
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,738
so tell me, do I kill?

186
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:58,701
You will be a curse upon Gotham.

187
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,622
Children will wake from sleep,
screaming at the thought of you.

188
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:08,794
Your legacy will be death and madness.

189
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:19,013
Well, say hi to Mom for me.

190
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,516
<i>G.C.P.D.</i>

191
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,816
G.C.P.D.

192
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,277
Mr. Cicero, it's Detective Gordon.

193
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,613
We need to speak with you about your son.

194
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,283
Mr. Cicero?

195
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,495
Mr. Cicero?

196
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,754
Harvey. Window.

197
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,143
Harvey.

198
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,123
Detective Gordon, old pal,

199
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,750
that gas sure packs a wallop, huh?

200
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,962
That's cute.

201
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,637
I'm sensing anger.

202
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:46,517
You killed Sarah Essen,
now I'm gonna kill you.

203
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,185
Mmm-mmm.

204
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,896
Don't shoot him.

205
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,318
How about a little flesh wound?

206
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,362
<i>No, no.</i>

207
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,906
My dibs.

208
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,386
This is a waste of time.

209
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,389
We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce?

210
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,434
Part of which was
you resuming a normal lifestyle.

211
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,061
Your parents were both patrons
to the Children's Hospital,

212
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,772
therefore, it makes you a patron.

213
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,527
Besides, there's gonna be a magician.

214
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:41,572
And you like magicians, don't you?

215
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,949
No, I don't.

216
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:45,993
I hate magicians.

217
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,245
You know what I said about being normal?

218
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,872
Excuse me.

219
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,916
I'm Lee Thompkins.

220
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,084
I work with James Gordon.
He's mentioned you.

221
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,295
- I saw you and thought--
- Of course.

222
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:57,963
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

223
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,882
This is my guardian, Alfred Pennyworth.

224
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,842
- It's an absolute pleasure.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,095
How is Detective Gordon doing
since the attack on the precinct?

226
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,056
<i>I was thinking I should call him.</i>

227
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,432
He'd appreciate that.

228
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,439
Can I get you
something to drink?

229
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,274
Uh, just water. Thank you.

230
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,949
So, I hear there's gonna be a magician.

231
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,463
Hello, Selina.

232
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,549
Hey.

233
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,426
I didn't expect
to see you here.

234
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:48,556
Well, you wanna steal stuff,
it helps to go where the rich people are.

235
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,935
You do know this is a benefit
for Children's Hospital.

236
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,436
So?

237
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,397
So these people are here for a good cause.

238
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,482
Me eating is a good cause.

239
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,069
Besides, didn't I steal something
for you once?

240
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,364
Selina, that was different.

241
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,657
Right.

242
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,410
How'd that go?

243
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,495
You get into that guy's safe?

244
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:15,541
Yes. Though things didn't turn out
quite like I planned.

245
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:18,961
A lot's happened since then.

246
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,846
- Alfred says there's gonna be a magician.
- I'm working, and hate magicians.

247
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,850
See you around, Bruce.

248
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,280
So, you wanna share your plan?

249
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,535
Remember I told you I could divine a thing
a person truly wants?

250
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,121
What Gotham wants is a hero.

251
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,876
And tonight, I'm going to give them one.

252
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:02,546
Shall we? Jerome and Tabby went on ahead.

253
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,381
Great cape.

254
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,761
Thank you for filling in
on such short notice.

255
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,388
But how did you hear
our magician dropped out, Mr...

256
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,848
Rudolpho.

257
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,726
Well, you know, magic.

258
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,229
Oh, I won't be needing that.

259
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,197
- Come on.
- I'm sorry,

260
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:30,699
but really there is no mystery.

261
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,703
Tabitha, have you met Deputy Mayor Kane?

262
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,997
Harrison, this is my Tabith.

263
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,707
Ah, nice to meet you.

264
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,959
Oh, and could you please tell your brother

265
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,170
that when a handsome billionaire
appears out of nowhere,

266
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,588
<i>people get curious?</i>

267
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,174
"Where'd he come from?
How'd he make his money?

268
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,676
"Who's he dating?"

269
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,970
My wife would kill me if I don't
get something. A tidbit.

270
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,599
He's a monster in the sack.

271
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,771
Do you have any news of Mayor James?

272
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:06,276
No, no. It's a real mystery.
We don't know where he is.

273
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,612
How intriguing.

274
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,407
Harrison, would you mind?
A little family business.

275
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,450
Of course. Miss Galavan.

276
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,497
Everything's ready.

277
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,582
See you at home.

278
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:29,133
So how do you go from being
in the Royal Marines to a butler?

279
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,968
Well, it's a bit tedious,
really, after a while.

280
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,804
You know, parachuting into
one global hot spot after another,

281
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,515
warlords putting ridiculous bounties
on your head.

282
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,225
Gets a bit boring, really.

283
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,977
You have amazing stories.

284
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,812
Yeah, well, you know, one or two.

285
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,233
You know, I don't really get nights off,

286
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,651
but if ever you'd like to

287
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,571
pop by Wayne Manor
for dinner one evening, I'd--

288
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,489
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr. Pennyworth.

289
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,993
No. "Alfred." Please, "Alfred."

290
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,620
Alfred, that's very kind of you, but--

291
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,039
Now having said that,
I don't see why I can't take a night off.

292
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,419
And I... I happen to know
the head chef at Chez Parnasse.

293
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,006
Well, I'm afraid, I--
Did you say Chez Parnasse?

294
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,176
I've been trying to eat there
for quite some time.

295
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,221
You have the most beautiful eyes.

296
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,017
Oh, wow. Okay, look--
Thank you, but, uh...

297
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,477
Alfred, I'd like to leave.

298
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,854
Yeah, um...

299
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,773
What about Dr. Thompkins' water?

300
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,941
And, of course,
you're gonna miss the magician.

301
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,486
Sorry, I must have forgotten your water.

302
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,737
Alfred, I still want to leave.

303
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,573
- Are you not feeling well?
- No, no, he's abso-- He's absolutely fine.

304
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,618
He's fine. Why don't you just
pop off to the bar, Master Bruce, and...

305
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,244
Show's about to start, Miss Thompkins.

306
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,038
Is it time?

307
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,665
I've roped myself into emcee duties
for the night.

308
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,501
I hope you'll stay for the show.

309
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,377
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

310
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,512
What?

311
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,518
<i>Good evening.</i>

312
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,896
<i>I am Dr. Lee Thompkins.</i>

313
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,856
<i>For the past five years,</i>

314
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,068
<i>I've had the honor of being part
of the Children's Hospital.</i>

315
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,903
<i>Thank you for your support,</i>

316
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,947
<i>and thank you so much
for coming out tonight.</i>

317
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,573
<i>Over the years,</i>

318
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,201
<i>we've had magicians
come and entertain our children.</i>

319
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,746
<i>And so tonight,
we have one of the magicians here for you.</i>

320
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,832
<i>Without further ado,</i>

321
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,709
<i>please allow me to present to you</i>

322
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,837
<i>the Great Rudolpho.</i>

323
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:51,859
Ha!

324
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,452
Greetings, ladies and germs.

325
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,789
I am indeed the Great Rudolpho.

326
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,836
Please ogle my lovely assistant.

327
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,087
<i>Ooh!</i>

328
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,537
<i>For my first act,</i>

329
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,956
<i>I'll require a volunteer.</i>

330
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,208
<i>Let me see...</i>

331
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,630
<i>Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck,</i>

332
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,214
<i>goose.</i>

333
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,841
<i>Who's the goose?</i>

334
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,725
Go on, Master Bruce. Be a sport.

335
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,521
Don't keep the lady waiting.

336
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,902
Fine.

337
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,537
Hello, young man. Please.

338
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,550
Does this handsome gentleman have a name?

339
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,718
Bruce.

340
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:42,886
Bruce!

341
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,683
Well, Bruce, this won't hurt a bit.

342
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,813
Is there a doctor in the house?

343
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:57,192
No, just, excuse--
Just wait, wait, wait one second.

344
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,324
Go home.

345
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,411
I'm fine.

346
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,912
Been running this since last night,

347
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,081
and you got a face full of that gas.
Go home.

348
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,125
You going home?

349
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,044
I didn't think so.

350
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,261
- Maybe I will go get some sleep.
- Yeah? Good idea.

351
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,013
But we got somewhere, right?

352
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,890
At least now we know
who broke Jerome out of Arkham.

353
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,019
Yeah, crazy old blind man
that lived alone.

354
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,439
A clever crazy old blind man.

355
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,942
If his father broke him out,
why'd Jerome kill him, huh?

356
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,362
He was probably planning this
Maniax shtick since you sent him away.

357
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,947
He was just a kid.

358
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,492
Every evil bastard in the world
was just a kid once.

359
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,912
Yeah.

360
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,957
But I don't think it was his father
that broke him out.

361
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,086
Cool. Back to square one.

362
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,214
You're right, I will go
and get some sleep.

363
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,801
For the record, I knew Essen
a hell of a lot longer than you.

364
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,304
<i>She saved my ass hundreds of times.</i>

365
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,681
You really should go home.

366
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,560
First thing tomorrow,
we'll go see Penguin.

367
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,689
You're right,
he's got his ears on the street.

368
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,234
Jim.

369
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,322
Never mind.

370
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,741
I'll see you tomorrow.

371
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,669
Give them a wave.

372
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,394
<i>Some people say
Bruce has a split personality.</i>

373
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,610
- Very good, Master Bruce.
- Mmm.

374
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,492
<i>For my next illusion,</i>

375
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,702
<i>I'd like to call to the stage</i>

376
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,873
<i>esteemed Deputy Mayor Harrison Kane.</i>

377
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,424
Is there something familiar to you
about those two?

378
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:39,646
Oh, my God.

379
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,993
- Lee, I was just ab--
- Jim, it's Barbara. She's here.

380
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,412
And I think maybe Jerome--

381
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,889
By the way,
nobody here is getting out alive.

382
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,850
<i>Really?</i>

383
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,442
- He's really...
- Oh, my God!

384
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,818
Whoo!

385
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,574
All right, Master Bruce, time to leave.

386
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,950
Ta-da!

387
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,214
Don't shoot!

388
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,353
- Selina!
- Bruce!

389
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,796
You!

390
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,173
- What's going on?
- Hostage situation.

391
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,133
The magician just killed the Deputy Mayor.

392
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,846
It's Jerome Valeska. The same man
that killed Commissioner Essen.

393
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,641
- Who's in charge here?
- I guess you are.

394
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,815
Lee, thank God. I've been--

395
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,067
<i>Sorry, Jimbo,
it's just little old me.</i>

396
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,528
<i>Jerome.</i>

397
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,196
Are you outside?

398
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,116
You are, aren't you?
Oh, goody.

399
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,201
I swear to God, if you've hurt her--

400
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,247
<i>Breathe, James. I haven't touched
a hair on your girlfriend's pretty head.</i>

401
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,707
<i>See for yourself.</i>

402
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,210
<i>This is live television,
after all</i>.

403
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,380
However, the police are here.
They are trying to...

404
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,056
- The feed just came back.
<i>- Ooh!</i>

405
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:24,978
You son of a bitch.

406
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,105
<i>True. But not the point.</i>

407
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,982
<i>Hey, let's talk about what I want.</i>

408
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,817
<i>Excuse me</i>.

409
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,487
<i>$47,000,000,</i>

410
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,114
<i>a helicopter, obviously,</i>

411
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,409
<i>the dry cleaning I left at Mr. Chang's,
be careful, the man is a crook,</i>

412
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,662
<i>and, I don't know,</i> <i>a pony.</i>

413
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,499
<i>Uh, you got 10 minutes
or I start killing people.</i>

414
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:51,254
<i>Remember, this is being broadcast to
every home in Gotham, so,</i>

415
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,966
<i>you know, don't let people die.
Bye</i>.

416
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,433
- I think that went well.
- Enough.

417
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,939
<i>You need to pack up your
pathetic little sideshow and leave.</i>

418
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,691
Is that right?

419
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,612
It may be presumptuous
to speak for all the citizens of Gotham,

420
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,406
<i>but we are sick of you.</i>

421
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:23,661
You're a small, vicious man
with a pathetic need for attention.

422
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,498
Enough, man.

423
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,209
For God sakes, enough.

424
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:34,089
I'm curious what your leverage
is here, Mr...

425
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,258
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

426
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,303
<i>Well, Mr. Theo Galavan,</i>

427
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,225
if you don't sit down, uh,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

428
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,521
I know there is some
human decency left in you.

429
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,565
If you need to take a hostage, take me.

430
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,484
But let these people go home.

431
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,570
To their families, to their children.

432
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,492
<i>- Boring.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

433
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,663
Get your men. We're going in.

434
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,342
I used this to sneak into the party.

435
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,553
We're lucky those dummies
didn't know about it.

436
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,012
- Wait--
- We're almost outside.

437
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,306
Wait! I have to go back.

438
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,225
Are you crazy?
That guy was killing people.

439
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:28,852
Yes. And Alfred's back there.

440
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,354
I'm not going back.

441
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,022
I don't expect you to.

442
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,360
Selina...

443
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,238
I miss you.

444
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,866
I just wanted to say that.

445
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,508
You're refusing a direct order?
I could have your stripes.

446
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,928
That maniac killed the commissioner.
Not my men, we're not equipped for this.

447
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,475
Fine. I'll go it alone.

448
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,354
Oh.

449
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,900
Hold very still.

450
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,118
I can't look.

451
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,953
Someone tell me how it turns out.

452
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,047
Damn. Turn around.

453
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,427
<i>Whoo!</i>

454
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,640
Well, clap!

455
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,439
So, Lee, how's Jim doing?

456
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,693
I hope he's not blaming himself for this
whole "Essen being killed" thing.

457
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,862
You are one crazy bitch.

458
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,405
So rude.

459
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,284
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make a prediction.

460
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,872
Within a year,
Jim and I will be back together.

461
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,291
Wanna know why?

462
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,377
Because we're both the same.

463
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,797
We both have a dark side.

464
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,467
And one day,
we will tell our grandchildren

465
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:29,389
about how this man-eating harpy
almost tore us apart.

466
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:33,643
But in the end,
love conquered all.

467
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,604
- You're...
- I'm sorry, what's that?

468
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,317
Hasn't been 10 minutes.

469
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,194
We need to buy you a watch.

470
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:52,579
<i>Well, I think it's time
for tonight's first official victim.</i>

471
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,164
<i>You all know and love.</i>

472
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,041
<i>Poor rich boy,</i>

473
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:02,255
<i>parents murdered in an alley,
and my favorite volunteer.</i>

474
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:06,926
<i>Where is Bruce Wayne?</i>

475
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,184
<i>You know I'm an orphan too, Bruce?</i>

476
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,854
<i>I killed my parents, though.</i>

477
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,856
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

478
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:24,986
<i>Bruce!</i>

479
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,322
<i>Where are you, buddy?</i>

480
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,991
Kill his butler.

481
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,953
<i>Come on, move it, butler.</i>

482
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,210
<i>All right, last chance, Bruce,</i>

483
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,297
<i>but it's about to get
very butler-brainy out here.</i>

484
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,471
Detective Gordon.

485
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,766
He's gonna kill Alfred. I have to help.

486
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,352
<i>Brucey!</i>

487
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,688
No. It's you he wants.

488
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,317
Bruce, he just wants you.

489
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,614
I will not let him hurt Alfred.

490
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,623
<i>I'm bored. Shoot the butler.</i>

491
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,249
Stop!

492
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,425
What the bloody hell are you doing, Bruce?

493
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,178
There's a gun in my jacket.
Detective Gordon's behind the curtains.

494
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,309
Let's get this started, huh?

495
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,687
You, check behind the curtain.

496
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,939
Make sure no one's playing
silly buggers.

497
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,286
Drop the knife!

498
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,042
I don't have a clean shot.

499
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,963
Stay calm, Bruce.

500
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,298
It seems like
we've got ourselves a pickle.

501
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:13,136
What do you say, Brucey boy?
Wanna boost our ratings, huh?

502
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,431
<i>Smile.</i>

503
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:20,977
<i>I said enough.</i>

504
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,863
I know, I know.

505
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,077
This is not what we rehearsed.

506
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,413
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

507
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,835
You have real talent.
But now you see, the plot thickens.

508
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:49,172
Enter the hero.

509
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,967
You said

510
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:56,471
I was gonna be...

511
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,532
Jim! Stop her!

512
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,430
<i>A pony.</i>
<i>Uh...</i>

513
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,809
See, someone like that
has no interest in building things.

514
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,270
He's not part of a tradition. Hmm.

515
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,273
It's chaos for chaos' sake.

516
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,029
Perhaps I could use a new laugh.

517
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,285
Huh?

518
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,079
Wow!

519
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:04,872
Dude!

520
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,833
<i>Color me impressed.</i>

521
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,125
You know, if I close my eyes,

522
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,586
I can still see you
holding Fish's umbrella.

523
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,965
"Yes, Miss Mooney. No, Miss Mooney.

524
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,925
"Whatever you say, Miss Mooney.

525
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,761
"That wig looks great on you,
Miss Mooney."

526
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:23,224
Seriously, the worm has turned.

527
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,355
Detective Bullock,
I heard you rejoined the force.

528
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,483
I'm so happy.

529
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,654
But aren't you missing
all of the excitement?

530
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:40,199
Yeah, I got the word too late.
Besides, I want to talk to you.

531
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,993
Of course.

532
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:43,786
Always happy to help.

533
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:47,456
See, there's talk on the street
that Jim Gordon did a favor for you.

534
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,293
Collected a debt
and the guy ended up dead.

535
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,881
Rumors.

536
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,507
Rumors.

537
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,804
Well, then again, where there's smoke...

538
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:08,311
Jim shouldn't worry about that.

539
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,271
He and I are good friends.

540
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,440
Well, see, that's the problem, Oswald,
I think he is worried.

541
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:13,774
Because something happened today

542
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,359
and you were
the obvious person to come to,

543
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:18,863
and I sensed Jim was a little reluctant
to come down here.

544
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:22,450
Like I said, he shouldn't worry.

545
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,494
As long as you two remain friends.

546
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,414
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

547
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:36,255
I've got a half a mind to take you outside
and beat you senseless with a garbage can.

548
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,054
Maybe some other time.

549
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,268
Call yourself whatever you want, man.

550
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,604
"The King of Gotham."

551
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:55,358
<i>But to me,
you'll always be that little umbrella boy.</i>

552
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,778
And if you come after Jim Gordon,
you gotta come after me.

553
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,238
And I still owe you for Fish.

554
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,869
But seriously, this place is amazing.

555
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,131
Give me another drink.

556
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,188
You were very brave.

557
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,232
You helped save the lives
of everyone in here.

558
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,651
Your parents...

559
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,194
They would've been proud.

560
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,696
That they would have been.

561
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,908
They also would have given me the sack
for letting you do something so idiotic.

562
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,161
It was all of us. We were a team.

563
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,039
Yeah, I guess we were.

564
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,251
Is he okay?

565
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,254
Fine. Though I'd still like him
to get checked out at the hospital.

566
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,672
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

567
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,049
Any word on her?

568
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,427
I don't know.
She went through a trap door in the stage.

569
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,013
They must have always been planning
to use that as their exit.

570
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,682
Don't worry, we'll find her.

571
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,395
Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir.

572
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,188
Alfred Pennyworth.

573
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,358
I'd just like to thank you for saving
young Master Wayne's life.

574
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,609
Oh.

575
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,404
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, sir.

576
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,780
Or I.

577
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:29,160
I really just did what any citizen
of Gotham would have done.

578
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,745
I wish that were true.

579
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,371
Jim Gordon.

580
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,123
Theo.

581
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,334
Well, if you ever need anything,
please call.

582
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:39,462
We're all in this together, right?

583
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,465
Thank you, sir.

584
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:47,011
Right, well, I suppose I better be
getting this young man home.

585
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:49,972
It's been much more of an
exciting evening than originally planned.

586
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,308
I never did like magicians.

587
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:53,976
Good night.

588
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,145
It was very nice meeting you,
Dr. Thompkins.

589
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,396
And you, Bruce.

590
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,690
Good night's sleep,
you'll be right as roses.

591
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,236
I do hope we get to see you again soon.

592
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:06,864
Thank you.

593
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,118
Alfred.

594
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,001
- You're sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

595
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:22,755
Kiss me?

596
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,258
- Jim...
- Kiss me.

597
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,893
- Oh, bugger.
- Alfred.

598
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,770
- You knew, didn't you?
- I didn't know, Alfred.

599
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:40,272
You did.
You let me make a right mug of meself.

600
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,857
<i>Alfred. No, I didn't.</i>

601
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,776
<i>- You did.</i>
<i>- I didn't know.</i>

602
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,194
<i>Well, I didn't know.</i>

603
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,512
<i>Despite the presence of the G.C.P.D.,</i>

604
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,264
<i>it was billionaire Theo Galavan,</i>

605
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,225
newly arrived in Gotham,
but already making his name,

606
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,352
<i>who stood up to the escaped lunatic.</i>

607
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:21,522
- Am I a hero?
- Hmm.

608
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:22,982
Apparently.

609
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,067
<i>...greeted him with rapturous applause.</i>

610
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,194
<i>I think tonight,
the people of Gotham have said,</i>

611
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,656
<i>"Enough. The reign of tyranny is over."</i>

612
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,075
Now the real fun begins.

613
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,494
Poor Jerome.

614
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,580
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

615
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,498
Such a compelling character, but limited.

616
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,417
No, he was never gonna last long.

617
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,586
I don't know about that.

618
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:45,921
The kid had a way about him.

619
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,842
<i>Oh, poor baby,</i>

620
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,469
did you get a bump?

621
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,930
<i>... G.C.P.D. Commissioner Sarah Essen.</i>

622
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,567
<i>...the killer, Jerome Valeska, is dead,</i>

623
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:10,446
<i>his murderous escapades
left a deep impression on Gotham.</i>

624
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:13,324
<i>Nobody here is getting out alive.</i>

625
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,141
Coming through.

626
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,519
<i>Bang</i>.

627
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:05,501
<i>You will be a curse upon Gotham.</i>

628
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:12,007
<i>Children will wake from sleep,
screaming at the thought of you.</i>

629
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:17,054
<i>Your legacy will be death and madness.</i>

630
