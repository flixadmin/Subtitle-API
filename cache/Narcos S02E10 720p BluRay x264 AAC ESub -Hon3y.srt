160
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,167
That place is too dangerous, my love.

161
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,681
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

162
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Pablo...

163
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,841
<i>I think the time has come.
We don't have</i> a <i>choice.</i>

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,849
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

165
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,206
You can survive prison.

166
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,449
We both know that won't happen.

167

Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

- They're talking.

169
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,964
<i>- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.</i>

170
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,328
<i>You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.</i>

171
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,925
My man.

172

Fix the position, Morales.

176
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,767
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

<i>They put the man in jail,

<i>They gave him the Nobel Prize.</i>

179
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,487
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

<i>Of the same country that imprisoned him.</i>

181

[Hugo Jr.]
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

183
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,165
<i>[Tata] All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.</i>

184
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,169

Alvaro, let's go slowly.

187
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,807
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

188
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,804
<i>Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.</i>

189
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,285
I'll think about it.

190
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,486
All right?

191
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,964
<i>Ilove you very much.</i>

192
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,440
Where are you going?

193
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,326
To Medellin.

194
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,962
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

195
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,843
My son needs me.

196
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,206
How so?

197
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,285
What you want...

198
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,163
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

199
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,040
I don't want them to kill him.

200
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

201
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,930
They won't if he turns himself in.

202
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,890
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

203
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,803
N0! N0, ma'am.

204
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,331
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

205
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,291
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

206
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,123
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

207
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,248
We can't even leave the country.

208
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,243
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

209
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,249
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

210
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,651
My son...

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,207
needs his mother.

212
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,086
Hermilda.

213
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,448
Please be very careful. Please.

214
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,204
Tell the children...

215
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,645
[whispers] I'll tell them.

216
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,570
[in Spanish] We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

217
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,166
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

218
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,764
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

219
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,640
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

220
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,921
Now, if he resists...

221
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,763
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

222
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,409
I want you to take his life. Understood?

He told you that?

you were once associates and friends.

You were saying?

00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,442
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

507
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,084
That you would forgive us.

Sir, do I need a lawyer?

Professional conduct or some bullshit?

We're not the review board.

So who are you?

- [in Spanish] All right, gentlemen!

Gentlemen!

523
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,762
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

524
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,729
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

525
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,007
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

526
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,687
311 metric tons.

527
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,005
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

528
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,005
And when your rival no longer exists.

529
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,491
[laughter]

530
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:38,048
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

531
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,566
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

532
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,682
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

533
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,081
And cocaine production goes up.

534
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,243
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

535
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,687
but how well one has prepared for them.

536
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,084
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

537
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,842

<i>[Gilberto] And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.</i>

We will do it covertly.

540
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,250
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

541
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,651
we'll no longer be there.

542
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,484
- No, sir!
- [laughter]

543
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,927
- Cheers!
- [all] Cheers!

about the Cali cartel?
