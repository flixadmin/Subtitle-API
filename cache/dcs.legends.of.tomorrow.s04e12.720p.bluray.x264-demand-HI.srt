[Nate] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,696
You and I dating would be totally weird.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Totally weird.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,837
Hank is running some secret project.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,956
[Hank] <i>A man came to me.</i>

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,960
<i>Neron.</i>

7
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,920
<i>He offered me a deal.</i>

8
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,673
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,114
I have a new partner now. My son.

10
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>I don't need you anymore.</i>

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,237
[Neron]
<i>I don't need you anymore, either.</i>

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
[Nate] Dad?

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,114
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,440
[Agent Sharpe] Sara, you're asking me
to risk everything.

16
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,915
For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,434
- Ava, don't do this.
- I'm done.

18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,831
[Sara] <i>Ava and I didn'tjust get into
an argument. She asked me to leave.</i>

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,199
[Sara] Come on, Ava. Open up.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,595
Look, I miss you.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,671
I'm sorry things went down
the way they did,

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,958
but please, just open the door.

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,394
You know, technically,

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,392
- this is still our apartment.
- [lock clicking]

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,399
Ava.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
[man] Have a safe return.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,677
Nora, what are you doing here?

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,910
Uh, I can explain.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,152
I can explain. I didn't kill Hank.
It was a demon.

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
[Constantine] Yeah, I know.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,552
His name is Neron, and he's wearing
Desmond as a bleeding suit.

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,791
- [Sara] Ray.
- [Ray] Sara, great news!

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,996
Hank was killed by a demon.

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,276
"Great" was not the word
he was looking for.

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,477
- Poor Nate.
- Look, Ava's missing.

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,029
- Missing?
- I should've checked on her sooner.

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,856
It's Neron. He has his sights set on
the Time Bureau and the creatures.

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,191
And if he got to Hank,
then ding dongs to donuts, Ava was next.

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,555
She is not dead.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,475
Listen, when Neron was at the Bureau,
he and I shared a connection.

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,256
If you can take me to Ava's place, I
might be able to know where he took her.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,600
[Constantine] Demons communicate.

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,797
He'll know your past,
how susceptible you are.

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,030
You're a liability.

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,914
She's not a liability, she's a survivor.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,152
Unlike you, she's turned her dark
experiences into a source of strength.

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,233
Not an excuse
for alcoholism or chain-smoking.

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,640
She also saved your life.

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
- Sorry. Would you like to add anything?
- No. That about covers it.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,955
I don't care if she's a liability.

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,034
If Neron has Ava, then I need all
the magical firepower that we've got.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,589
You two, with me. Woman the ship.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,719
This is from two weeks ago.

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,554
[sniffs] Oh.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,993
She's been gone a tick. That's not good.

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,314
Yeah. Thanks.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,269
[grunts]

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,876
There.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,600
What? What do you see?

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,991
He had her... here.

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,280
[distorted screaming]

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,399
- Ava.
- That doesn't mean she's dead.

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,592
Doesn't mean she's alive, either.

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
[sighs]

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,236
[sighs]

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,760
I know where she is.

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,354
[Gary]
Conspiracies, embezzling, paper trails.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,072
I feel like Julia Roberts
in <i>Erin Brockovich.</i>

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,277
We're more Pacific Gas and Electric,
Gary.

72
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,154
Wait. We're the bad guys?

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,576
I don't know who we are, Gary.
All right?

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,876
We're the guys trying to keep
my dad's cracked-out idea

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,998
of Jur-magic Park
from tanking the Time Bureau.

76
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,074
All right? So, anything that has to do
with Heyworld, get rid of it!

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,096
How am I gonna explain all this
to Director Sharpe?

78
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,634
Actually, Ava's missing.

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
[Gary] I knew it.

80
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,109
I knew it! You know,

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,960
I had a dream about her
where she was driving

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,336
and I was in a car seat in the back.

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
- We were headed to Schul...
- Gary.

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,111
She needs me. [breathing heavily]
I can't... I gotta...

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,637
Sara, Constantine and Nora
are looking for her.

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Nora?

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,752
- Look, she didn't kill Hank.
- Come on, man.

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,035
[Ray] Just listen, okay?

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,000
Your dad made a deal
with a demon named Neron.

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,835
I guess something went wrong,
and the demon killed him.

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,276
I'm sorry, buddy.

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
[sighs deeply]

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,000
My dad made a deal with a demon
to open a theme park.

94
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,713
Oh, Ray. I don't know
how much more of this I can take, man.

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,399
[cell phone buzzing]

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,432
- Is that you?
- No.

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,956
If this is my dad's mistress,
I'm gonna jump out a window.

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,675
- Hello?
- [Mikey] <i>Yo, Mr. H. It's Mikey T.</i>

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,400
<i>Listen. Got a question for you
about the dragon lair.</i>

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,153
<i>I could sure use your eyes down here.</i>

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
[clearing throat]

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,240
- [in deep voice] Down where?
- [Mikey] <i>What? Here, at the site.</i>

103
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,159
- Uh, Buckwood Downs?
- [Mikey] <i>Uh, yeah. Where else?</i>

104
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,356
Talk to you later.

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,476
Who was it?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,576
[in normal voice]
I don't know. He sounded like a Soprano.

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,832
But apparently, my dad started
building this theme park.

108
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,676
[clicks fingers]

109
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,353
The guys who were working with him.

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,514
Maybe they know something about
this Neron, and why he killed my dad.

111
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,116
Come on!

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,837
I'm Steel, you're The Atom.
There's nothing we cannot handle.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,149
[chuckles]

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,310
This one.

115
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,996
Ava!

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,270
Hey. Ava!

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,036
She's alive!

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,639
- What did he do to her?
- He's preparing her.

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,917
Neron must be looking for a new vessel.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
It only makes sense, going after Ava,

121
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,791
especially if he wants control
over the Time Bureau.

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,078
And when a demon possesses someone,
the body has to be willing.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,391
And if it's not,
the demon has to force his way in

124
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,949
by sending the soul to purgatory.

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,713
That's where the real fight begins.

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,990
How do we save her?

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,039
Some souls go up, and some go down.

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,874
But if she's been there
as long as she has,

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,792
then she's not coming back, Sara.

130
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm not giving up on her, John.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,310
You're gonna send me to purgatory
to get her.

132
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,696
If I send you down there with her,

133
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,176
there's nothing that I can do
to protect you.

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll take my chances.

135
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,577
This isn't something that you can just
fight your way through, love.

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,954
John, please!

137
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,590
Fine.

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,839
[grunts]

139
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,389
Lay down.

140
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,552
Our purgatory is designed
to drive the soul to breaking point.

141
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,394
It's tailored to drive the captive mad.

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,679
Now, where you're going,
that's Ava's personal nightmare.

143
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,912
I've died, lost my soul,
and escaped a demon realm.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,959
I'm pretty sure
I can handle Ava's purgatory.

145
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,632
Well, prepare for the worst, Sara Lance.

146
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,836
[sighs]

147
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,238
[Constantine chanting]

148
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
- [clerk] Welcome.
- [gasps]

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,673
Do you need a bag?

150
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,275
[indistinct chatter]

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,071
I gotta get out of here.

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,437
I can't do this anymore.
I just gotta get out of here.

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,473
Ava!

154
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,716
[panting] Hey. Hey.

155
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,877
- Oh, thank God!
- Oh, my God!

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
Sara, is that really you?

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,394
It's me. I got you.

158
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,437
What the hell happened? Am I dead?

159
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,039
You were kidnapped by a demon.

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,473
And he's trying to take over your body,
so he trapped your soul here,

161
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,279
in your own personal purgatory.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,036
But, Ava, if you check out, you die!

163
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,679
That's kind of on the nose, isn't it?

164
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Wait. Does that mean he got you, too?

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,038
No! I'm taking you home.

166
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,629
I've got it! Natari!

167
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,997
I'm gonna regret asking this,
but what's that?

168
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
It's your couple's name!

169
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,156
Nat for "Nate,"
and of course, Ari is for you!

170
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,634
You know I'm a superhero, right?

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,679
With a flick of my wrist,
I can blast you with my wind powers.

172
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,275
Being honest,
wind powers, just not that scary.

173
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,990
Yeah. You're like a magical hairdryer.

174
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,151
What is this,
Legends Eye for the Straight Guy?

175
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,356
You're straight?

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
[Mick] Where's Sara?

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,656
Uh, she's with Constantine and Nora,
trying to find Ava.

178
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,976
[Gideon] Actually, they've just returned

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,276
and Mr. Constantine has called
a team meeting in the lab.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,158
- He can do that?
- No.

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
[sighs] Let's go, dummies.

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
[grunts]

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,275
Ava's in hell?

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,798
She's not in hell.
Her soul is trapped in limbo.

185
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,678
And I am right there with her.

186
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
Oh, Gary.

187
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,038
Emotionally. Poor Director Sharpe.

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,191
I've sent Sara down there
to try and pull her out.

189
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,233
- I thought that they broke up.
- She still loves her.

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,438
- What can we do?
- Sara chose to go in after her, so...

191
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,592
Unless praying is your thing,
then the best thing you can do is wait.

192
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,955
You don't have to worry.

193
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,997
- [Gary panting]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

194
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,316
- He's on it.
- I'll take good care of her.

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,150
Them!

196
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,397
- All right. Charlie, you're with me.
- This should be interesting.

197
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,176
Let's go find out what this demon wants,
shall we?

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,395
- You're up for it?
- Mmm-hmm.

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,515
All right, then. Let's raise some hell.

200
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,270
[indistinct yelling]

201
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,992
Oh, how you doing? Can I help you guys?

202
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,838
Yeah. We're looking for Mr...

203
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,513
- Mr. T.
- Who's asking?

204
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,153
'Cause no one's allowed
on this site, unless...

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,310
Hey, I know you.

206
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,471
I'd recognize
that Heywood jawline anywhere.

207
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,519
[chuckles] You must be "& Son."

208
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,876
Are you kidding me?
Hank is always going on about you.

209
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,914
Where is he?

210
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,516
Hank passed.

211
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,480
What? Jeez. I'm sorry to hear that.

212
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,234
- You mind if we take a look around?
- Hey,

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,596
- it's all yours now, kid. [scoffs]
- [Nate] Question.

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,038
Did my dad ever mention a man
by the name of Neron?

215
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,191
Neron? What is that, Greek?

216
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,000
No, it's demonic.
I mean, Danish, actually.

217
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,072
No. Never heard of the guy.

218
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,800
Actually, to be honest with you,
Hank didn't really tell me a lot.

219
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,793
All he gave me was this.

220
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,155
We're building that right now.

221
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,640
A unicorn rodeo.

222
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,554
Can you imagine? Two unicorns jousting.

223
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,600
[both laughing]

224
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,601
I'd rather not.

225
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,474
Hey. Come here, come here.

226
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,077
This... This is what
I was calling you guys about.

227
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,470
- About the...
- Dragon lair.

228
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,712
Yeah, I know. I drew it.

229
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I drew all of this.

230
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,176
[Mikey]
Great, tell me something. Look at this.

231
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,296
See this here? What is this?

232
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,233
Is this supposed to be real flame
or were you thinking, like, plexi?

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
'Cause I got a guy that can do fire,
like forget about it.

234
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,875
I can't believe he did it.

235
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,439
[Ray]
I know you and your dad struggled.

236
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,911
And even if you got your wires crossed,
you never stopped trying to connect.

237
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,591
- I just hope my dad knew I loved him.
- He knew.

238
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,594
Look at this place.

239
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
You know, I just wish
he would've found a better way

240
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,993
to tell me he loved me.

241
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,992
One that didn't involve
teaming up with a demon

242
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,833
and embezzling money
from the government.

243
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,435
It's a bit much.

244
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,036
Mikey T! Mikey T!

245
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,270
Change of plans.

246
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,110
Tear it down.

247
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
The dragon lair?

248
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,957
The whole thing.

249
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,240
[clears throat]

250
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,959
Waiting sucks.

251
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,235
Ooh! Sexting Nate?

252
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,152
- Boundaries, Mona.
- I need vicarious feels.

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,336
[sighs] There are more important things
to focus on right now.

254
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,319
And Nate's got a lot going on.
It's not the right time.

255
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,909
[Mona] What are you typing?

256
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,515
- "Hey, what's up?"
- [grunts]

257
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,816
Wait, I don't even know
why I'm talking to you two about it.

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
You don't even date humans.

259
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,312
Love is love.

260
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
[Zari sighs]

261
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,114
Whatever you need, I'm here.

262
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
Whatever you need, I'm here.

263
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,190
- Why is Gary in your subconscious?
- [sighs]

264
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,272
I may have some Gary issues
that need working out.

265
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,234
Okay, we just need to find the door
that you came in.

266
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
Does any of this look familiar?

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,673
No. It all looks exactly the same.

268
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,911
Why don't we just try to follow
the arrows back?

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,296
Maybe they'll take us to the entrance.

270
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,234
[woman on PA] <i>Reminder, shoppers,
the store will be closing in one hour.</i>

271
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,976
Constantine didn't say
anything about that.

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What does it mean?

273
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,199
It means we take shortcuts. Come on.

274
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,236
Hello again, ladies.

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,496
- Damn it!
- [Agent Sharpe sighs]

276
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,318
Okay. This way.

277
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,119
No. Or we could just ask Gary.

278
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,554
How do we get to the entrance?

279
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Oh...

280
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,440
We're not really allowed
to give that kind of advice.

281
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,516
Come on.

282
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,238
But the ERGRIK wardrobe might be
just the thing you're looking for.

283
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,632
[Sara] Looks like the wardrobe section.

284
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
[Agent Sharpe] No.

285
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
[Sara scoffs]

286
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,393
Now what?

287
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,399
I think we're supposed
to put it together.

288
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
No sweat.

289
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Here.

290
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Wait, wait, wait.

291
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,915
Step one, insert the dowel.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,514
- Here, babe.
- I got this.

293
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,800
[screws rattling]

294
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
[boy] Shut up, man.

295
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,840
- [grunting]
- [whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel"]

296
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,269
[cars crashing]

297
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,830
[man yelling] You kidding me?
What are you, brain-damaged?

298
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,271
- [Neron as Desmond] Papa's home.
- [door closes]

299
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,270
Miss me? I missed you.

300
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,990
We'll be together soon, my pet.

301
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,240
[Charlie as Agent Sharpe]
Not bloody likely!

302
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,515
[Neron] Oh, Nora.

303
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
[grunts]

304
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
[groaning]

305
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,392
- [gasping for breath]
- [Constantine chanting]

306
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,392
[writing with chalk]

307
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,714
[chanting]

308
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,400
There's nowhere for you to run now,
you bile bladder.

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,473
Me, run? You're the one who ran.

310
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,280
All I had to do was say,
"I'm coming for you, Johnny."

311
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,520
And you left 2018 to me.

312
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,317
It's delicious
how easily humans are corrupted.

313
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,834
Especially here in D.C.

314
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,118
So, that's your game?
You inflict fear and anger on humanity?

315
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,078
I merely fan the flames.

316
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,311
People are primed
to give into what they fear most.

317
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
You know what, man?

318
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,478
I am gonna send your ass
straight back to hell.

319
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,190
- John, this isn't the plan.
- Nora, we finally get to talk.

320
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,358
Hope you've enjoyed
your little dalliances inside my mind.

321
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,776
[Neron, telepathically]
<i>But it's not a one-way street.</i>

322
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,917
<i>- Is it, Nora?</i>
- [groans]

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,276
I knew you were a liability.
We should be off with him.

324
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,936
You're playing right into his hands,
John.

325
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,440
You're the one who can't handle this.

326
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,554
Yes, says Miss Lock-herself-up-because-
she-can't-handle-her-own-demons.

327
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,314
This is me handling mine, all right?
[takes deep breath]

328
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,516
[chanting]

329
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,034
Out!

330
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,230
[laughs]

331
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
He's getting to you.

332
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,097
- What, he's getting to me?
- Yeah.

333
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,554
He's inside your head.

334
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,434
What, you don't think
I haven't seen you struggling?

335
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,359
Humanity hasn't exactly been kind
to you, has it, Nora?

336
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,593
You're addicted to this kind of power,
and believe me, it doesn't go away.

337
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,433
No, it doesn't. And it hasn't been easy.

338
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,874
But if I can trust myself,

339
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,191
I don't think it's too much
to ask for you to try, too.

340
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,352
Oh, it's killing you
to look at his face.

341
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,160
I know how hard it is to watch
someone you love become a demon.

342
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,273
Yeah, too bad there aren't any Beebos
around to hug you to death!

343
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,635
[Neron whistling "Pop Goes the Weasel"]

344
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
[both sigh]

345
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,876
We can't just keep him locked up
in there, driving us all mad.

346
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Yeah. I think between the two of us,
we can figure something out.

347
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,756
[Sara] Ta-da!

348
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Damn it!

349
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,712
What a surprise, you followed none
of the instructions, and it didn't work.

350
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,235
I am sensing
that this isn't about the dresser.

351
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,834
No, this is what you always do.

352
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,136
Just bulldoze your way through.

353
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,600
- I do not always do this.
- Like lying to me about the Kaupe?

354
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
You were defending torturing creatures.

355
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,433
Defending? I wasn't defending it.
I was defending myself.

356
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,749
Of course I don't believe

357
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,936
that we should be intentionally hurting
anything or anyone,

358
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,873
but when we fight, Sara,
I get really scared.

359
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,792
And I just go to my corner.

360
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Look, it's just fight or flight.
That couldn't be any more human.

361
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,155
I just really need to know
that you're on my team.

362
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,752
I am always on your team,
even when we disagree.

363
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,035
Now,

364
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,912
should we give it another go?

365
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Thank you.

366
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,994
- Uh-huh?
- Uh-huh.

367
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,592
See? Following instructions
is not that bad.

368
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,394
- Oh, don't gloat.
- [sighs] Let's get out of here.

369
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,190
[door rattling]

370
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,550
Something's wrong.

371
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,872
- Did we miss a screw, or something?
- No.

372
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,476
[sighs]

373
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,395
We missed this.
How the hell did we possibly miss this?

374
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Damn it.

375
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,594
Hey, look.
It's not perfect, but it's ours.

376
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,794
Can you live with that?

377
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,600
Hey, don't go in your corner.

378
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
- Yeah, I can live with it.
- [door clicking]

379
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,076
Hell, yeah, let's go to Narnia.

380
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Are we out?

381
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,231
[Sara] Out of the closet,
but not the store.

382
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
[Agent Sharpe] Touché.

383
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,910
Welcome to our mattress showroom!
If you'll follow me...

384
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,273
The mattress you choose will be the most
important decision of your life.

385
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,837
Wait,
you're showing them the mattresses?

386
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,833
We need everyone out
before Tabitha gets here.

387
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,195
Who the hell is Tabitha?

388
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,478
You don't want to know Tabitha.
Best of luck in your mattress choice.

389
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,395
- [Sara] Gary, don't...
- [Agent Sharpe] Wait. We need to...

390
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,336
This is starting to feel like
that escape room we did.

391
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,591
Okay, so, subconscious Gary said
that this would be

392
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,176
the most important choice of our life.
What do you think that means?

393
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,635
That even subconscious Gary
needs to get a life.

394
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,836
No, it's a puzzle.

395
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,071
What does it mean?
Do you think we need to...

396
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
It means we need to pick a mattress.

397
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,235
- How about this one?
- What?

398
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,877
Whoa! 600 bucks.

399
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,296
- That is...
- Three-year warranty?

400
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,256
- That's really...
- ...ridiculously expensive, right?

401
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,397
I was thinking, like, $250.

402
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,630
Are you kidding?
It would be saggy in like a year.

403
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,560
So, you just flip it over.

404
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,394
You just flip it over? Is that
what you do when things get saggy?

405
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,834
You just flip them over,

406
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,760
so you don't have to look
at their saggy faces?

407
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,116
Okay.

408
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,230
[exhaling]

409
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,149
How about this one? Fifteen years.

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, that's better.

411
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh.

412
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,993
When did you start going gray?

413
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Whoa!

414
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,879
This place has been really stressful.

415
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah.

416
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
[gasping in horror]

417
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
I think it's the mattress.

418
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,879
Apparently, your purgatory
is your anxieties.

419
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,995
One of which must be getting old.

420
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,157
I'm not worried about getting old, Sara.

421
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,757
I'm worried about getting old with you.

422
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,717
[sighs]
So, we're talking about marriage.

423
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,156
[Agent Sharpe sighs]

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,036
Wow.

425
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,834
You look... still really hot, but...

426
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,636
You, too.

427
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,989
[scoffs softly]

428
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Fifty years is a long time
sleeping on one mattress.

429
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,316
Sure is.

430
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,199
Look, I know it's a lot.

431
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,670
Fifty years with just one person.

432
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,916
It's not the one person thing, I just...

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,438
Look, I've never really thought
that much past tomorrow.

434
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,673
Ava, with my past,
planning anything for the future

435
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,878
is just... Feels like tempting fate.

436
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,272
And I convinced myself
that I like it that way.

437
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,479
Until you came along.

438
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,236
You just freaking came to purgatory
for me.

439
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,192
How's that for giving
a middle finger to fate?

440
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,397
Look, you're allowed to want things
sometimes, Sara.

441
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,072
But what if I can't be
the person that you need?

442
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,070
Let's be honest,
neither of us needs anybody, right?

443
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,917
But you are who I want.

444
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,518
I bet you there's some
good liquor in Ava's office.

445
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,394
I mean, my dad's old office.

446
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,712
Oh, man. Things are bleak.

447
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,357
Hey, Ray.
Thanks for sticking around here.

448
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,999
Yeah, buddy, of course.
That's what friends are for.

449
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,879
I just wish I wasn't such an idiot
at my dad's funeral.

450
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,475
I had a chance to talk to him,
but I blew it.

451
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,320
But now I'll never know what happened.

452
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,216
[Ray] Well, maybe Constantine
can get you some answers.

453
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,256
Looks like they caught Neron.

454
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,634
Son of a bitch!

455
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
Is that the demon who killed my dad?

456
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,030
Whoa, there, squire.
You take it easy, all right?

457
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,216
[Nora] Nate, you don't want to
go in there. Just walk away.

458
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,435
- No, not a chance.
- Nate!

459
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,512
Wait! Wait!

460
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,920
Hello, Nathaniel.
I've heard so much about you.

461
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,909
So predictable. The son who, in life,
could never connect with the father,

462
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,356
here now, seeking the truth.

463
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,159
Well, here it is.

464
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,674
Hank was an unfortunate snag in my plan.
So, I...

465
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,996
- You evil bastard.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Demon.

467
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,680
[grunts] Nate's already angry,
makes him prime pickings for Neron.

468
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,436
He'll be all right, as long as
he doesn't cross that bloody barrier.

469
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,440
[groans]

470
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:20,639
Why? He built your theme park
just like you wanted.

471
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,871
You think I wanted a theme park?

472
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,795
I gave Hank power, and in return,
he was to supply me

473
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,156
with fear-mongering magical creatures

474
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,830
to terrorize people
into giving up their souls.

475
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,835
Instead, he went behind my back
and built some deranged zoo.

476
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,118
He betrayed me. Because of you.

477
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,634
No...

478
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,797
If you'd have just stayed
out of our way,

479
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,999
maybe your old man would still be alive.

Ray, I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry about...
- It's okay, buddy.

[sighs]

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,879
- Uh... There's nothing to build.
- No furniture to choose.

493
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,996
Dishes.

494
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,355
Piece of cake. Go, go, go.

495
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,559
You know, this seems more like
one of your fantasies than your fears,

496
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,796
watching me do dishes.

497
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,793
Please, if it were up to you,
we would only have paper plates. Here.

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000

[Mona] Did you send it?

505
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,753
Honestly, mate, whatever happened
to just talking to someone?

506
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,476
Emojis are way more fun
and if he's not that into it,

507
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
you can pretend like
you were talking about something else.

508
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,271
Right. Nate's going to think I was dying
to tell him about a dancing lady

509
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,437
carrying a burning eggplant.

510
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,517
Here. Use words.
It's erotic, but vulnerable.

511
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,399
Okay, let me see it. [clears throat]

512
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,272
I'm not saying "bulge."

513
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,479
Sula the Wolf Witch talked about
smothering a demon.

514
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,358
Does that make sense to you?

515
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,875
When Mallus was a part of me,
I could feel his fear.

516
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,038
Like he was vulnerable here on Earth.

517
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,276
It made him nervous.

518
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,149
So, if we can separate the demon
from his earthly vessel,

519
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,517
it will suffocate him,
just like a fish out of water.

- Yeah.

I just need some coffee. I'm fine.

You best let her alone, squire.

This is all your mail! You deal with it.

[both sigh]

531
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,800
It's not like you have an address
to even get mail, so...

532
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,912
We both talked about it and agreed

533
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,834
that now wasn't the right time
for me to move in with you.

534
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,912
- But we're making it work.
- Are we?

535
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,710
Because how I see it, we're living
completely separate lives. So...

536
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,713
Ava, I want this.
Just when the time is right.

537
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,634
Timing doesn't just happen, Sara, okay?
You have to make a choice.

538
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,679
So, what?
What, this? This is what you want?

539
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,834
No. Of course, nobody just wants
dirty dishes, but, yes.

540
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,555
Ava, we're time-traveling superheroes.

541
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,791
Okay, fine. But I am not just my job.

542
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,317
I want some hobbies,
I want a life with you.

543
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,110
And sometimes, life is just this.

544
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Okay? It's boring.

545
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,876
What then?
You off to the next adventure?

546

No. But I can't just decide

right this instant.

548

So, please, just tell me what
you want me to say, and I'll say it,

and we can get out of here.

550
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,272
I can't tell you what to say, Sara,
because then it wouldn't mean anything.

551
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,559
Okay. Well...

I've admired your... power
for a long time, Nora.

I don't take compliments from people
who frame me for murder.

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,518
All in the interest
of self-preservation. You understand.

563
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,479
Do they even know
what you're capable of?

They have no idea.

565
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,555
Then why waste your time
with that arrogant bastard

566
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,515
and his pathetic delusion
that the world needs him to save it.

567

[screaming]

John knew what the Order were doing
to me, and he just let them.

who to send to hell. [chuckles]

but the war is mine.

to make a deal with a demon,

that is not your fault.

inspired him, made him happy.

You're right. I shouldn't
be embarrassed, I should be proud.

Yeah, my dad was a little wacky,
but most of the good ones are.

If not her, I'll find someone else.

- You can bring my father...
- Of course.

You know,
you can't just walk out of here.

Constantine will never let you do that.

Maybe as Desmond.

620

But if you let me in,

The monitors were wonky,
are you all right?

624
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,959
Of course, you shut them down.
I should have never trusted you.

I know.
