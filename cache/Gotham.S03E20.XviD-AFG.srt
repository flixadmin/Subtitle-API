1
00:00:00,492 --> 00:00:03,515
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- Welcome home, Bruce.

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:04,875
The Court's readying a weapon

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,015
that could destroy the city.

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:09,339
You've done it.
You've weaponized the virus.

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:10,807
We have to escape.

6
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:12,342
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

7
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,311
- We work together.
- So that we may be free

8
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,646
to murder each other outside.

9
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:19,616
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

10
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,419
I have an army of Hugo Strange's
monsters at my command.

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,154
Selina!

12
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:26,197
- Selina, stop!
- He's not Bruce!

13
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,259
Where is Bruce?

14
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,029
Bruce is serving a greater purpose.

15
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,364
We found another owl.

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,900
We think this map indicates
the secret hideouts of the Court.

17
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,268
James Gordon.

18
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,305
You loved him, and
that love doomed Mario.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,908
- But guess who's really to blame?
- I am.

20
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:48,679
We will destroy the Court of Owls

21
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:52,015
and then you will do whatever I say.

22
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,850
- Won't you?
- Yes.

23
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,253
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange,

24
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,765
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

25
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,157
No, Lee has it, too.

26
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:17,955
The day of judgment has come to Gotham.

27
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,424
And to the Court of Owls.

28
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:26,016
Three years ago,
a great crime was committed.

29
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:29,742
Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered.

30
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:33,490
Their blood is on the Court's hands.

31
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,186
On your hands.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,695
Thomas Wayne stood against the Court.

33
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:40,931
He threatened to expose us.

34
00:01:41,077 --> 00:01:43,014
He paid the price.

35
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:44,668
And my mother?

36
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,694
She had to die as well?

37
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,061
Why is Bruce Wayne here?

38
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,764
He has come to pass judgment.

39
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:58,894
Enough of this.

40
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,526
You are the leader of the Court.

41
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:02,184
No one disputes that.

42
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:05,582
But you absent yourself from
Gotham for years at a time.

43
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:07,848
Decisions had to be made.

44
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,208
The ruling council
stands by its actions.

45
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,267
They were your parents, Bruce.

46
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,570
You knelt in their blood
that night in the alley.

47
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:24,439
Let blood avenge blood.

48
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,270
Give the order.

49
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,362
You hesitated.

50
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,159
Next time, I won't.

51
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,987
I promise.

52
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,556
Mm. Mm.

53
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:15,877
No,

54
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:18,395
I know you won't.

55
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,642
Mm.

56
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:35,868
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

57
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,881
- Keep me informed.
- Bullock, any word from Bruce?

58
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,524
Alvarez said he wasn't at that location,

59
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,759
but they're checking out
the next black site on the map.

60
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,995
All right, everybody knows the score.

61
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,498
The Court of Owls is planning
an attack on the city.

62
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,032
They've kidnapped Bruce Wayne.

63
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,901
And now they know we're coming for them.

64
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,485
So be ready for anything. Let's go.

65
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,098
This is the ruling council.

66
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,394
Who could've done this?

67
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,317
Straight up execution.

68
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,367
Gordon.

69
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:16,720
We got a breather.

70
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,293
Gordon... traitor.

71
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,761
Yeah.

72
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,464
I'm a traitor. Where's Bruce Wayne?
Where's the bomb?

73
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:30,259
We were betrayed.

74
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,454
The leader, Bruce Wayne,

75
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,504
they killed us.

76
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,147
That geezer's lying.

77
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,615
If Master Bruce was in that room,

78
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:47,484
he's being held prisoner or something

79
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,119
I mean, it's absurd to think

80
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,887
he had anything to do with that carnage.

81
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,556
I still don't get
why the leader would whack

82
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,673
his own ruling council.

83
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,159
I mean, does this mean the virus
bomb plan thing's off?

84
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:57,827
Until we have the bomb
in our possession,

85
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,074
we have to assume the plan's still on.

86
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:02,098
Maybe the leader was cleaning house.

87
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,400
So what's the next step?

88
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:06,469
Because we hit every spot
on that crystal owl and all we got

89
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,471
were dead people wearing owl masks.

90
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,473
We run their identities,
we track their holdings,

91
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,842
we see where it leads us.
It worked with Kathryn.

92
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,778
Yeah? And how long's that
gonna take then, mate?

93
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,648
We're all trying to find Bruce, Alfred.
We're doing everything we can.

94
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,265
Well...

95
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:23,032
if only that were enough, eh?

96
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,824
He's worried about the kid.

97
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,536
I don't blame him.

98
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:32,223
I have no idea how Bruce fits
into the Court's plans.

99
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,723
But what we saw today,

100
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:37,200
them executing their own,
they're zealots, capable of anything.

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,936
Gordon, those unis you put on
Thompkins' brownstone,

102
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,471
they called, she's home.

103
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,629
I know what you're thinking, brother,

104
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,840
Lee stealing the virus, that's weird.

105
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,536
But injecting herself? Hmm?

106
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:52,822
This is Lee we're talking about.

107
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:55,564
You didn't hear what she
said to me last night, Harvey.

108
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,492
Okay, fine.

109
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,807
Go.

110
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,778
I'll be back as soon as I can.

111
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,118
Come again?

112
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:14,206
I said, Oswald Cobblepot is alive.

113
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,490
He's lying.

114
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,808
I wish that were true.

115
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,994
He disappeared for days,
and then he shows up

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,994
with some insane story
about him and Penguin

117
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,729
being trapped in bird cages
and escaping together?

118
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,168
- What'd you say you used, pudding?
- Red Jell-O.

119
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,203
How stupid do you think we are?

120
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,372
You really want me to answer that?

121
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,812
It's a setup.

122
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,419
Well, you would know,

123
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,612
being an expert in betrayal.

124
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,847
- Keep pushing me.
- Calm down.

125
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,956
Both of you. In the
interest of cooperation...

126
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,050
...your partner's backstabbing

127
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,901
actually led to an answer
you were seeking.

128
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:53,303
Who... controls... Gotham?

129
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:57,693
It's an organization calling
themselves the Court of Owls.

130
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,639
And?

131
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,737
Who are they? What do they want?

132
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,805
Well, unfortunately,
my interaction was limited

133
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,671
to a woman named Kathryn,

134
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,247
who had a stern updo.

135
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,132
But I can tell you there's
no interest in the underworld.

136
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:13,515
So, at least for now,
you shouldn't worry about them.

137
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,714
You should...

138
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,722
...worry about Penguin.

139
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,389
I'm sorry, how is that
our problem again?

140
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,858
You're the one that shot him
and dumped in the river.

141
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,531
Oh, Butch.

142
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:26,633
I knew that your hand was made of lead,

143
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,297
- forgot that your brain was as well.
- Cute.

144
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,945
Thank you.

145
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:35,006
The three of you conspired
to help me murder him.

146
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:36,793
So in Penguin's eyes,

147
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:38,795
we're all guilty.

148
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,053
He's right.

149
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:45,202
I'll get a team to hit
Penguin's house right away.

150
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,685
Don't bother.

151
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,052
He knows it's the first place we'd stop.

152
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,693
He's probably stowed away
in some safe house.

153
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,826
Good thing I know where they all are.

154
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:55,993
Here we go. Together again.

155
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:57,876
Oh, I should've told you,

156
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,313
Penguin's recruited an army
of Hugo Strange's monsters.

157
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,234
Yeah, we'll see.

158
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:11,742
I'll take it from here.
Head back to the station.

159
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,745
Lee?

160
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:31,948
It's Jim.

161
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:34,985
Lee?

162
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,992
Lee?

163
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,767
Hello, Jim.

164
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:57,393
I knew you'd come.

165
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:03,280
Are you surprised?

166
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,859
You look surprised.

167
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:10,380
There's been a squad car
outside my house all morning.

168
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,450
That tells me you knew
I stole the virus.

169
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,981
Thought you'd assume I'd inject myself.

170
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,699
I'd hoped I was wrong.

171
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,270
Well, that'll teach you.

172
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,723
Can I get you something? I know
how you like your whiskey.

173
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,980
Why'd you do this?

174
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,032
You know why, Jim.

175
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:31,720
You blame yourself over
what happened to Mario?

176
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,054
You didn't shoot him,
you didn't infect him.

177
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,274
Wasn't your fault.

178
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:39,548
I'd have to disagree
with you on that one.

179
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,196
But, honestly, the whole
argument is moot at this point.

180
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,263
No, it isn't, Barnes was infected

181
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,785
for weeks before the
virus fully took hold.

182
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,521
We can get you help.

183
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,531
I'm no virologist, but I'd say

184
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:52,648
we missed the boat on that one.

185
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,749
Come on, we can fight this.

186
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,273
Come with me.

187
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,772
Don't you want to know what the virus
has brought out in me, Jim?

188
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:05,519
What it's shown me?

189
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,662
No.

190
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,295
My love for you.

191
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,597
It's pretty obvious
when you think about it.

192
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:19,479
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.

193
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:23,222
Why would she be drawn to a
man with so much darkness?

194
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,159
Such an appetite for violence?

195
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:30,365
Unless something inside her... liked it.

196
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,669
Craved it.

197
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,247
Needed it.

198
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,563
That's not true.

199
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:44,680
The virus has shown me how
to give in to my deepest desires.

200
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,040
And I will no longer deny myself

201
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,655
what I really want.

202
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,351
There's a problem, though,
Jim, isn't there?

203
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,665
You know what the problem is, don't you?

204
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,846
Yeah, you need help.

205
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:06,736
No, the problem...

206
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,101
is that you are always denying yourself

207
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,866
who you really are.

208
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:13,701
But I can help you with that.

209
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:16,053
You see, Jim, I have a secret.

210
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,614
Harvey, I found something.

211
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,335
Right. This is a mock-up
of the map that Lucius made

212
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,146
of all the Court's black sites, right?

213
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,583
One problem.

214
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,308
The place where Bruce and I found
the original crystal owl

215
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,509
should be here.

216
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,904
Marked.

217
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,512
But it's not.

218
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,749
Well, maybe it's an old owl
that hasn't been updated.

219
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,114
No, mate, no. You're missing
the point. No, look.

220
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,787
The Court hasn't marked all hideouts.

221
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:50,443
So how did you find the house
when you stole the owl?

222
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,943
Well, it was this little, uh,

223
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,896
Ukrainian smuggling firm
called the Whisper Gang.

224
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,193
And you're thinking that maybe
they know of other locations?

225
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,122
Do you know where
we can find these clowns?

226
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:02,872
I do.

227
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,915
If there's any left alive.

228
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,444
What's he so angry about?

229
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,658
Oh, we hunted down these freaks

230
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,064
- to help him destroy Nygma and Barbara.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:21,455
We got this Freeze guy

232
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,857
and your pal Bridgit,
who does the... the fire thing.

233
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,557
Wait, you found Bridgit?

234
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,661
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

235
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,229
Pengy disappeared the other day,

236
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:30,640
and she and Freeze figured
he wasn't coming back,

237
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,132
so they split.

238
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,984
- Can you find her?
- Why?

239
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,230
There is a war coming
between me, Ed Nygma,

240
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,406
and Barbara Kean.

241
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,574
I need my army.

242
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:42,935
What's in it for me?

243
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:45,345
My gratitude.

244
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,691
Hmm.

245
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,015
Fine.

246
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,853
Uh, you guys,

247
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,838
we got company... not the good kind.

248
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,155
Ivy, let's go.

249
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,658
Well, I can't leave Penguin.

250
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, suit yourself.

251
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,205
You do have a way out, right?

252
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,817
Of course. This is a safe house.

253
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,467
Oswald!

254
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,603
Edward.

255
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,667
No army of monsters, huh? Such a shame.

256
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:17,354
- You want to kill him, or can I?
- Wait.

257
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,291
Something's wrong.

258
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,054
Oh, Ed.

259
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,523
So smart.

260
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,730
No!

261
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,599
Damn it!

262
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,348
Bravo, Oswald!

263
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,100
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

264
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,073
Where's your far better half?

265
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,384
Where you going, kitty cat?

266
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,861
Bruce.

267
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,499
What were you thinking about?

268
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:15,547
My parents.

269
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,399
I've wanted justice for them
for so long.

270
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,983
And now that I've achieved it...

271
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,670
What do you feel?

272
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,184
Failure.

273
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,341
I did not give the order.

274
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:36,778
You will get another chance

275
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,775
to prove yourself worthy.

276
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,199
Hello, Bruce.

277
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,442
It is good to see you again.

278
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,482
Hello, Professor.

279
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,020
Fascinating.

280
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,813
He's completely docile.

281
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:03,089
I'd like to hear your techniques,

282
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,185
sensei.

283
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,521
One day, Professor.

284
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,490
Show me the weapon.

285
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,077
I told you, Bruce,
that I did not serve the Court.

286
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:27,003
I... we made use of the Court

287
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,262
for our own ends.

288
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,145
The one I serve believes
you have a great destiny.

289
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,915
My task has been to prepare you for it,

290
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,062
but a final step remains
in your journey.

291
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:49,444
This detonator will trigger the bomb.

292
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:52,420
Thousands will be
infected with the virus,

293
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,668
the city will be torn apart,

294
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,488
and out of the ashes...

295
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,356
a dark hero will rise.

296
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,996
You.

297
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,614
Mm.

298
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:11,404
When the time comes, you
must press this button.

299
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,055
Are you ready to embrace
your destiny, Bruce?

300
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,090
Yes.

301
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,995
Gotham must fall.

302
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,097
Jim, me and Alfred got
a possible location on Bruce

303
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,261
from a bunch of Ukrainian
yucks wearing muzzles,

304
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,502
if you can believe it.

305
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:35,079
Give me a call when you can.

306
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,751
- Where the hell is Gordon, anyway?
- He had to do something.

307
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:45,188
We're gonna have to give you a badge
or something one of these days.

308
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:59,463
Please be very careful with this.

309
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,611
GCPD! Nobody...

310
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,397
Go get Bruce!

311
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,989
Don't move a muscle.

312
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:17,270
Obviously, I surrender.

313
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:22,827
You know where to take it.

314
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,531
Bruce!

315
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,560
Oh, thank God.

316
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,239
So you're the top boy, are you?

317
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,206
The leader?

318
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:37,744
Step away from Bruce, or I swear to God

319
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,700
I will shoot you straight in the face.

320
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:43,848
You had best put down
the weapon, Mr. Pennyworth.

321
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,421
Not bloody likely, mate.

322
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,804
Bruce?

323
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,551
Bruce, get out of the light.

324
00:17:57,747 --> 00:17:59,270
No, Alfred.

325
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,754
I will not let you hurt him.

326
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,912
What's he done to you?

327
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,334
He has lifted the burden of my past.

328
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,076
Revealed my true destiny.

329
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:15,915
Gotham must fall by my hand.

330
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,430
No.

331
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:20,987
Bruce!

332
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,559
- Dwayne.
- Yes, sir.

333
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:36,836
Hey, Steve, put this animal in a cage.

334
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,730
I'll be back
to bust your head in a minute.

335
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,994
Alfred, hey.

336
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:50,750
Are you okay?

337
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,041
Far from it.

338
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,654
I mean, the leader of the Court

339
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:56,122
has turned Bruce into
some kind of, like,

340
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:57,523
weird zombie zealot.

341
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,978
I mean, I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

342
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:03,263
I think he wants Bruce
to detonate the bomb.

343
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,178
- What?!
- Bruce said something about

344
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,233
it being his destiny.

345
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:10,108
How Gotham must fall by his hand.

346
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,710
This is bad.

347
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,975
We got to find that friggin' bomb.

348
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,304
Let's go see baldy-locks
and see what he can tell us.

349
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,610
Harvey.

350
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,112
Heard from the unis at Doc Thompkins'.

351
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:20,788
No sign of her or Gordon or his car.

352
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,384
Put a BOLO out on Jim Gordon.

353
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:27,129
- And put one out on Lee Thompkins, too.
- I'm right here, Harvey.

354
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:36,062
Lee. Hey.

355
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,532
It's good to see you.

356
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,986
You wouldn't happen to know
where Jim is, would you?

357
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:49,493
As a matter of fact,
he's probably waking up

358
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:54,687
right about now.

359
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,479
Lee.

360
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,237
Lee.

361
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,875
Lee...!

362
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,099
Lee...

363
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:01,896
Lee! Lee...!

364
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,544
Lee!

365
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:11,306
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, everybody.

366
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:14,022
Guns down, people. It's all right.

367
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:15,944
Everybody just step back.

368
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,358
You really did it, huh?

369
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,671
You injected yourself with the virus?

370
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,046
You're just like Jim, you seem
to think it's a bad thing.

371
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:26,960
Where is he?

372
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,245
He went to see you at your brownstone,

373
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,582
and now we can't get in touch with him.

374
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,144
Well, look at you,
all worried about your hero.

375
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,539
You put him up on this pedestal,

376
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,802
forced him to deny his true self.

377
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,880
I am going to free Jim
and show everyone who he really is.

378
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,922
Where the hell is he?

379
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,327
He's in a coffin, six feet underground.

380
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,598
Did you kill him?

381
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,079
Who said anything about killing him?

382
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,829
Oh, bloody hell.

383
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,313
I said he was in a coffin.

384
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,142
He's not dead.

385
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,289
Not yet.

386
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,712
Oh, geez.

387
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:14,401
I forgot how jumpy
everybody is around here.

388
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:16,774
Jim, are you there?

389
00:22:18,322 --> 00:22:20,204
<i>Jim, you there?</i>

390
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,641
Lee, what the hell are you doing?

391
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:25,943
<i>Stay calm.</i>

392
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,078
<i>You've got to conserve your air.</i>

393
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,314
Listen to me...

394
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,283
Little late for that.

395
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,318
<i>Why don't you say hi
to Harvey and the gang?</i>

396
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,927
Harvey? You there?

397
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,816
We're here, buddy. Where are you?

398
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,676
<i>Harvey, she's got the virus.</i>

399
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,316
- <i>She's buried me alive...</i>
- Shh.

400
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,465
<i>I do the talking.</i>

401
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:45,919
<i>Now, if you're quiet,</i>

402
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,387
<i>I'll let you listen.</i>

403
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,590
So, here's the deal.

404
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,071
I buried Jim Gordon alive

405
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,264
in a location that you might
find if you looked long enough,

406
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,166
but certainly not
before he runs out of air.

407
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:02,479
<i>Meaning, I'm the only one
who knows where he is.</i>

408
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,937
But...

409
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,010
now here's the kicker...

410
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,420
I left him a way out.

411
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,745
You hear that, Jim?

412
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:16,311
<i>I left you an escape hatch.
Have you found it yet?</i>

413
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,794
<i>You should've found it by now.</i>

414
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:34,868
You left me the virus.

415
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,940
I told you I would help you
find your darkness.

416
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,441
Now,

417
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,285
<i>I can't do it for you.</i>

418
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,379
<i>You've got to do it yourself.</i>

419
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,793
I won't. I won't do it, Lee.

420
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,823
You've got two options.

421
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:53,587
You can take the virus,

422
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,073
<i>and find the strength
and get out of there,</i>

423
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,960
or you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

424
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:01,729
Lee, please. Please.

425
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,198
In the name of all
that is holy and not insane...

426
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:08,987
...tell us where he is.

427
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:11,716
I swear to God, I'll let you
walk right out of here.

428
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:13,503
Tell us where you buried him.

429
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,771
Why would I want to walk
out of here, Harvey?

430
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:19,613
I'm gonna miss the look
on all of your faces

431
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,315
when he takes that virus.

432
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:24,846
And seeing that he's got roughly
an hour left of oxygen,

433
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,409
I'm not gonna have long to wait.

434
00:24:34,388 --> 00:24:36,196
Can I get a cup of coffee?

435
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:39,708
Get the lady a cup of coffee.

436
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,168
Put her in a cell.

437
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:46,440
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.

438
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:51,101
All right, everyone,
Bruce Wayne is still missing.

439
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:52,743
There's still a freaking
terrorist attack

440
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,382
that could go down at any minute,
so get back to your jobs,

441
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:59,019
do what you're supposed to be doing.
Let me worry about Jim Gordon.

442
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:15,919
<i>Jim.</i>

443
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,337
<i>It's me. You there, buddy?</i>

444
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:18,705
Harvey.

445
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,702
These radios run
on a shortwave frequency.

446
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,876
<i>I've got to be close.
Get it over to Lucius.</i>

447
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,979
He should be able to run down
a general fix.

448
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,631
Hang tight, we're on it.

449
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:28,882
Let's go.

450
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:30,657
All right.

451
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,597
Conserve your breath.

452
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,159
Stay calm.

453
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,590
I'm not working for Penguin.

454
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,456
So you were just holed up
together for kicks?

455
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,089
No.

456
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:56,535
- Ivy just asked me to come by.
- Why?

457
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:58,702
None of your business, lunk.

458
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:01,285
Now I got to take lip off a kid?

459
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:05,490
You're friends with
that firebug, aren't you?

460
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,988
Her name's Bridgit.

461
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:15,160
Penguin's army of monsters deserted him.

462
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,335
And he needed your help finding them.

463
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,873
You're gonna tell Penguin
that you know where this Bridgit is

464
00:26:21,908 --> 00:26:23,842
and that you'd like to meet.

465
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,543
And we'll take care of the rest.

466
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,453
Fine.

467
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,446
But I need cash to get out of town.

468
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:36,087
- Fine.
- And nothing happens to Ivy.

469
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:40,558
She's stupid, but not a traitor.

470
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:43,561
Those things aren't mutually exclusive.

471
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,064
Shoo. The grown-ups need to talk.

472
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,233
Oh, and forgive me if I don't
want you knowing the details.

473
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:51,669
That didn't work out so well last time.

474
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:54,772
Bye, now.

475
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,980
How much longer
are we gonna put up with this?

476
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,407
<i>Jim.</i>

477
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,152
Harvey, what'd you find?

478
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:09,687
<i>You were right about the walkie.</i>

479
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:11,274
It's got a one mile radius.

480
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:13,555
Lucius couldn't trace a signal,
but when we looked at a map,

481
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:15,493
we figured there was only
one place she could take you:

482
00:27:15,528 --> 00:27:16,532
Jackson Park.

483
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,391
I should've known.
But that's nothing but dense forest.

484
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:21,971
- <i>You'll never...</i>
- It's a place to start.

485
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:23,942
We're gonna find you, brother,
I promise.

486
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,153
Harvey. Listen, I know he's your mate,

487
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:27,606
but with everything else
that's going on,

488
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:30,020
with Bruce missing, the bomb,

489
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,344
you certain searching for Jim
is the best use of your time?

490
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,152
If the situation were reversed,
he'd do the same for me.

491
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:37,782
Besides, I got you.

492
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:39,980
- What do you mean?
- I want you to squeeze Strange,

493
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,301
find out everything he knows.

494
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,434
I saw how you dealt
with that Kathryn bird.

495
00:27:43,465 --> 00:27:46,017
- You like to get your hands dirty.
- Wait, are you sure about this, mate?

496
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,009
I want you to get your hands
really dirty.

497
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:51,062
I want you to find out where
the leader's taking Bruce.

498
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:52,930
Find the bomb,
and however much or little

499
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:55,466
is left of Strange after that,
even if it's just a pinky,

500
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:57,284
we will throw in jail.

501
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,847
Thanks.

502
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,572
Campos.

503
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:05,443
Call the K-9 unit, have them meet us
in Jackson Park, now!

504
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,500
You can't save him, Harvey.

505
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:09,359
He's gonna take the virus.

506
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:12,347
And we're gonna be together
the way we were meant to be!

507
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,620
It's gonna be beautiful.

508
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:23,666
Get off.

509
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,667
I find this shouting
and screaming deeply upsetting.

510
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,561
It affects my concentration.

511
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,837
And my grip!

512
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:36,037
Please. Don't let me fall.

513
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:39,642
We can discuss this
in a civilized manner!

514
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:41,625
Oh, that's rich, coming
from the likes of you.

515
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,184
Who's about to poison
thousands of people

516
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,579
and turn them into raving lunatics!

517
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,575
Now, where is Bruce Wayne?

518
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,114
And where is the bomb?

519
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:56,106
If I tell you, you drop me.

520
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:59,824
I end up dead, either way.

521
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:02,736
Self-preservation, is it?

522
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:05,590
That's your game?
All right, then, Humpty.

523
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,075
I got a swapsie for you.

524
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:10,710
Down you pop.

525
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:16,756
Your freedom for Bruce Wayne.

526
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,086
You don't have
the authority to let me go.

527
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:21,555
I didn't have the authority
just to hang you

528
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,790
off the side of a bloody building, did I?!

529
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,554
Hey, see that fire escape over there?

530
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:29,062
That leads directly to the street

531
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:30,997
and to your freedom.
Now, I won't stop you.

532
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:37,639
I just want to know where my boy is.

533
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,674
All right.

534
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,948
The leader has taken Bruce
to Wayne Enterprises.

535
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,237
They'll have a view of the street below

536
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,819
as it fills with people
affected by the virus,

537
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:55,096
- but you're too late.
- Why?

538
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,393
What time is the bomb going off?

539
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,800
5:00 p.m., but that's not what I mean.

540
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,764
The Bruce Wayne you know is gone.

541
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:08,030
His mind is no longer his own.

542
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:13,435
Oh, you're so wrong.

543
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,490
You have got no idea
how strong that boy is.

544
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,177
Now, I'm a man of my word.

545
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,668
You can walk.

546
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,581
Just as soon as you wake up.

547
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:26,777
I don't know what you mean...

548
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,465
Slag.

549
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:38,553
You seem troubled.

550
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,934
I hope it was not the encounter
with your manservant.

551
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:47,562
No.

552
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:51,910
If this is my destiny,

553
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:54,495
I do not want to fail.

554
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:58,248
You won't, Bruce.

555
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,287
All this,

556
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,523
everything the Court of Owls
set in motion,

557
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:08,074
everything I have done, has been
to prepare you for this moment,

558
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:09,590
and afterward,

559
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:14,200
I will bring you to the one
whose vision has singled you out.

560
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,181
He is very eager to meet you.

561
00:31:32,214 --> 00:31:33,650
Harvey.

562
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:35,355
- <i>Anything?</i>
- Nothing yet.

563
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,011
Covered about 30 acres.
How you holding up?

564
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:40,324
<i>It's getting hard to breathe.</i>

565
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:43,066
Stay off the walkie;
you got to conserve your air.

566
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,293
<i>That shouldn't be hard.</i>

567
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:48,036
- I'm running low on battery.
- Well, quit your yapping.

568
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,810
<i>Harvey, there's too much
ground to cover.</i>

569
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,955
You've done everything you could.

570
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,010
Okay.

571
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,033
Go to plan B.

572
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:09,637
Take the virus.

573
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:11,513
No.

574
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,672
If you don't, you'll die.

575
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:16,868
<i>Take the virus,
and we'll figure something out.</i>

576
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,307
<i>I'm not gonna take the virus.</i>

577
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:36,433
I won't become a monster.

578
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:39,114
Hold on.

579
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:42,885
Alfred.

580
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,690
<i>Strange said the bomb is due
to detonate at 5:00 p.m.</i>

581
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,401
5:00?! That's in, like,
20 minutes! Where?

582
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:49,692
<i>He never said where, but he did say</i>

583
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:50,899
that the leader and Bruce are heading

584
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:52,928
directly to Wayne Enterprises
to watch the fallout.

585
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:56,365
<i>Now, the rooftop looks
directly onto Union Station.</i>

586
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,535
The bomb's due to go off, slap, bang,
in the middle of rush hour.

587
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,560
Wait, w-whoa, whoa! Stop!

588
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:05,240
I want every available
uni to Union Station!

589
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,489
I want it evacuated now! Go!

590
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:10,041
- K-9s stay with me.
 - <i>Harvey, at 5:00 p.m.,</i>

591
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:11,880
<i>Union Station is gonna be packed.</i>

592
00:33:12,002 --> 00:33:14,550
Even with an evacuation,
thousands will be infected.

593
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,118
<i>Not if we find the bomb first.</i>

594
00:33:16,153 --> 00:33:18,240
But I'm guessing it's not gonna
be sitting out in the open.

595
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:20,693
- No, it'll be hidden.
- Where?

596
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,046
Yesterday, Kathryn said,

597
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,343
"Gotham will fall when the clock stops."

598
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,624
What if she was talking
about a real clock?

599
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:32,901
Clock tower at Union Station.

600
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,405
Harvey?

601
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,197
Harvey, do you hear me?

602
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:40,647
Harvey, Harvey, you copy?

603
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:43,120
Jim, I lost you. Jim?

604
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:44,676
Jim!

605
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:54,679
In the old days,
loyalty meant something.

606
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,939
Don Falcone, Maroni,

607
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,853
even Fish.

608
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:06,814
They had their faults,
but they lived by codes.

609
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:12,150
Ed Nygma, Barbara Kean...

610
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:16,931
they wouldn't even be allowed
to sit at the same table as Don Falcone.

611
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:21,087
And yet, here I am,
forced to demean myself

612
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,861
to do battle with them.

613
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,484
Yeah, people are dumb.

614
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,945
Plants are better.

615
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,461
You can trust them.

616
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:37,714
I have no more safe houses.

617
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:39,307
No monsters.

618
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:43,145
I will not run from Ed Nygma!

619
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,286
Well, actually, you have one monster.

620
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:47,321
What?

621
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,413
Selina called. She found Bridgit.

622
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,021
She's gonna bring her by.

623
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:54,823
You're joking.

624
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:59,071
That's... wait.

625
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,782
Why is Selina suddenly helping me?

626
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,036
I don't know.

627
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:04,595
She was acting kind of weird.

628
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:06,974
Asking where we were, did we have guns.

629
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:09,827
I was like, "We're all alone, duh."

630
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:12,613
You idiot!

631
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:15,484
- It was a setup!
- No. No way.

632
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,176
Selina would never do that.

633
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:21,688
Well, unless they offered her money.

634
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:49,482
Hello again, Oswald.

635
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:53,462
Captain, over here.
I think I found something.

636
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,953
We got to get to Union Station.

637
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:20,747
That was Bullock.

638
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:22,930
Gordon's on his way to Union Station.

639
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:24,922
He's infected with the virus. Come on!

640
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:34,494
Hey...

641
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:44,345
You must be very proud of yourself, Ed,

642
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:46,240
thinking you outsmarted me.

643
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:48,923
Well, frankly, it wasn't
really a challenge.

644
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:52,233
Now, you're gonna do one
thing before you die.

645
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,764
Call me...

646
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:57,719
The Riddler.

647
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:03,374
No.

648
00:38:03,592 --> 00:38:05,187
You have a choice, Oswald.

649
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:09,077
This can happen real quick
or it can take hours.

650
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,967
- Days. It will be...
- I'll take option "B," Ed.

651
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,969
Since saying

652
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:20,132
that ridiculous name
would be torture itself.

653
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:22,741
Very well.

654
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:30,906
Slow and painful it shall be.

655
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,976
Uh, hello? Do I get no say in all this?

656
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:38,886
- See how it feels?
- Guys, you hear something?

657
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:45,527
This is a trap?

658
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,863
No, not exactly.

659
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,353
Fish.

660
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:56,815
Hello, Oswald.

661
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,182
Now, see that there?

662
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,653
That's a look of respect.

663
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:05,557
Or is it fear?

664
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,495
Hi-ya, Fish.

665
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:10,047
- How you been?
- Well, let's see.

666
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,133
I was alive...

667
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:13,812
and then I was dead.

668
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:17,497
And then I was alive.

669
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,368
Things are looking up.

670
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:26,284
My, my, my.

671
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:30,096
Now, this is quite a gathering.
You have to love Gotham.

672
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:32,312
People always
pointing guns at each other.

673
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:33,781
Why are you here?

674
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:35,781
You...

675
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:37,195
shall...

676
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,687
see.

677
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:44,853
And as for you, whoever you may be,

678
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:47,353
please excuse us.

679
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,634
My little penguin and I...

680
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,748
will be leaving.

681
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:01,616
Please, carry on.

682
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,982
Woman always knew how
to make an entrance.

683
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,154
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

684
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:17,380
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

685
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,092
Gordon, there you are.

686
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,315
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

687
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:28,678
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

688
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:33,006
It's time.

689
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,891
Press the button.

690
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,579
Claim your destiny.

691
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:43,407
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

692
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,360
No!

693
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:57,932
Whatever destiny he's sold you,
Bruce, he's lying.

694
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,398
- Press it, Bruce.
- Don't.

695
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:01,150
Bruce, don't.

696
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,545
I won't have him turn you
into a murderer.

697
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:07,443
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

698
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,621
<i>Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

699
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:22,716
Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?

700
00:41:23,156 --> 00:41:25,036
I want to help you.

701
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,745
We'll reverse what he's done to you.

702
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:33,713
Bruce, if you press that detonator,
there's no coming back.

703
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:36,264
He won't shoot you.

704
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,553
He's weak, Bruce, but you are not.

705
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,609
Bruce, please.

706
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,279
Give me the detonator, son.

707
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,545
No. You will press it.

708
00:41:57,612 --> 00:41:59,533
Hello, lover.

709
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,997
I guess we're gonna have company.

710
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,854
Seek out the Yuyan building.

711
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:12,651
Find the demon's head.

712
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:16,077
Fulfill your destiny.

713
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:22,999
Bruce.

714
00:42:34,294 --> 00:42:36,895
When you're ready, come and find me.

715
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,606
It's only a matter of time.

716
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:55,375
It's too late.

717
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:13,916
