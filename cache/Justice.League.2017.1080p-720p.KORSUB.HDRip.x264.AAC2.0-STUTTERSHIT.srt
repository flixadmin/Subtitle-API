1
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,641
There he is!

2
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,523
Superman! Superman! Can
we ask you some questions?

3
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:48,970
- It's for our podcast.
- Well, in that case...

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,006
How many people that you
saved... have you saved?

5
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,571
- I...
- Never mind.

6
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:54,676
Does your thing really
stand for hope?

7
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:55,519
Yes. It does.

8
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,184
But it looks like an "S".

9
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:01,686
Yes, it's meant to. It's
meant to wind, like a river.

10
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,452
It comes and goes.

11
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:04,796
My fa...

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,106
A man I knew, used to say...

13
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,349
that hope is like a car keys.

14
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,425
Easy to lose, but
if you dig around...

15
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:13,090
...it's usually close by.

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,316
Did you ever fight a hippo?

17
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:16,630
That's dumb!

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,225
But hippos are the most deadly!

19
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:22,296
What is... What's the best
thing about planet Earth?

20
00:01:24,362 --> 00:02:49,608
MAKOTO77

21
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,119
What are you doing?

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,388
Wait! No, wait!
Wait! Wait!

23
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,895
Please! Please,
man! Please!

24
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,211
What do you want from me?

25
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,056
Fear.

26
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,272
They could smell it.

27
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,093
What the hell?

28
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,448
- What was that?
- A scout.

29
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,219
From space?
Like an alien army?

30
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,325
Alfred, are you seeing this?

31
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:32,284
I am. Matches the
other sightings.

32
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:35,583
And that pattern is
all over Luthor's notes.

33
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,950
Prep the jet. I'm
going north tonight.

34
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,788
Good. It's
time, then.

35
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,573
It's 'cause they
know he's dead, right?

36
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:50,035
Superman. He's gone.

37
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,943
Where does that leave us?

38
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,357
Drop your guns now!

39
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,449
Excuse me?

40
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:09,672
- Move it. Move!
- Don't shoot!

41
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,435
Get down.

42
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:18,968
Line them up along the
wall. Keep them quiet.

43
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:52,535
Who are you?

44
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,974
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

45
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:58,472
Now, who are you?

46
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:01,592
We're a small group of
reactionary terrorists.

47
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:02,814
We know that sinners brought

48
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:05,392
- on this plague of...
- Why the hostages?

49
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:10,045
You're too late. The
countdown's already begun.

50
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,729
In a few minutes,
4 city blocks...

51
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,815
While the world watches.

52
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:21,950
Shut up!

53
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,146
This is man's best hope.

54
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,543
Down with the modern world.

55
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,789
Back to the Dark Ages.

56
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,227
And the safety of holy fear.

57
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:14,743
This would've been
over quickly, but...

58
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,370
No! Don't!

59
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,507
I don't believe it.

60
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:43,274
- What are you?
- A believer.

61
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,498
I'm asking for your help.

62
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:27,652
I believe there's a stranger, comes
to this village from the sea.

63
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,381
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry...

64
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,955
and brings fish.

65
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,024
He comes on the king tide...

66
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:37,722
That was last night.

67
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:43,850
Icebergs in the harbour.

68
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,217
Four months since the
last ship got through.

69
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,242
Well, this stranger...

70
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:50,679
Doesn't come by ship.

71
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:55,403
There are enemies
coming, from far away.

72
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,552
I need warriors.

73
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,901
I'm building an alliance,
to defend ourselves.

74
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,529
Look, I'll give
you $25,000 to...

75
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,235
talk to this man right now...

76
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,357
outside.

77
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:10,707
Something tells me that of
all he will give them to me.

78
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,721
Tell me what those 3 boxes
are and I'll make it 30.

79
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,264
You should get out.

80
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,941
Can you at least
point me to Atlantis?

81
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,793
Arthur Curry.

82
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,618
Also known as the
Protector of the Oceans.

83
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,413
The Aquaman.

84
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:58,786
I hear you can talk to fish.

85
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,219
So let me get this straight...

86
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,568
You do it dressed like a
bat? Like an actual bat?

87
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,895
It's worked for 20
years in Gotham.

88
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:10,420
Oh, that shithole.

89
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,665
The fight comes, we'll need you.

90
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,782
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

91
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,085
Because I don't like
you coming here...

92
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,012
digging into my business,
getting into my life.

93
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,736
People from Atlantis
tell me, "Do this."

94
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,050
Now, you say,
"Do that."

95
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,374
I want to be left alone.

96
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:24,972
That why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

97
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:26,425
Because you can just leave?

98
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,832
I help them 'cause
no one else does.

99
00:13:28,863 --> 00:13:31,300
You wanna protect them,
you need to work with me.

100
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,305
A strong man is strongest alone.

101
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,830
You ever heard that?

102
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,340
That's not a saying. That's the
opposite of what the saying is.

103
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,690
Yep. Doesn't
mean I'm wrong.

104
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:44,077
You ever hear of Superman?

105
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:47,546
- He died fighting next to me.
- My point exactly.

106
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:51,498
What's in the 3 boxes?

107
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,303
It's ancient history.

108
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:56,101
Mankind's melting
the polar ice caps...

109
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,519
Destroying the ecosystem,
they got it coming?

110
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,627
Hey, I don't mind
if the ocean rise.

111
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,523
How about if they boil?

112
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:06,200
Dressed like a bat.

113
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,938
You're out of your
mind, Bruce Wayne.

114
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,082
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

115
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:28,174
So, you say you have no way
of reconnecting with this...

116
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:29,277
Aquaman.

117
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:31,414
I put a tracking
device in his coat...

118
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:32,847
He left without it.

119
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,418
It may, in fact, not
have been his coat.

120
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,660
Those squares,
from Luthor's notes...

121
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,997
I think they must be
containers of some kind.

122
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:44,912
- Of what?
- I don't know.

123
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:48,382
Money, power. Something
worth starting a war over.

124
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,092
Well, we had luck
with one person...

125
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,687
on the team list.

126
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,817
Barry Allen, of Central City.

127
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,634
He's completely off the grid.

128
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:00,748
Squatting, I think.

129
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:02,914
Moves suddenly and often.

130
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,822
- Disappearing act?
- But he does visit his father...

131
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,069
...in prison.

132
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,627
- For murdering his mother.
- Jesus!

133
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,184
Young Barry always protested
his father's innocence...

134
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,320
But he was 9 and
nobody listened to him.

135
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,895
We have somebody at the prison?

136
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:19,060
Oh, yeah. We'll
find the address.

137
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:24,076
- What about, Diana?
- Well, you have her number.

138
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:26,362
You could've called her.

139
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:29,401
Perhaps I should fly to Paris

140
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:30,655
with a handwritten note?

141
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,660
"Will you be
Bruce' teammate?"

142
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,144
"Check: Yes or No"

143
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:36,441
I'm only interested
in her skill set.

144
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,948
- I'm sure you are.
- Can we?

145
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,090
Well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

146
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:45,055
But it's got a partial match.

147
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,670
A Victor Stone.

148
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,531
Genius I.Q., football
scholarship to GCU...

149
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,136
And deceased.

150
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,055
Figures. Fairy tales
and ghost stories.

151
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,782
One misses the days
when one's biggest

152
00:15:57,812 --> 00:16:00,029
concerns were exploding
wind-up penguins?

153
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,483
The simple life.

154
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,973
I don't recognize this world.

155
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,832
I don't have to recognize it.

156
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,880
I just have to save it.

157
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,385
Here to see Henry Allen.

158
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,548
Sign.

159
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,207
Hurry it up, will you?

160
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:31,981
What, you got a problem?

161
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,458
No. There's
no problem.

162
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,364
Better not be.

163
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,893
You know where to go.

164
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,496
Are those prescription...

165
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,123
Or you just trying
to look brainy?

166
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:04,334
Because you're holding yourself
back. You're going in circles.

167
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,012
You're working 3 dead-
end jobs. Going on four.

168
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,577
Where do you even have the time?

169
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,309
I make the time.

170
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,816
And this is all to pay for a
criminal justice degree, huh?

171
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,053
Okay. I really don't want
to talk about this again...

172
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:15,918
The investigation was botched.

173
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,502
Give me your hand.

174
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,295
I want you to
listen to me, Barry...

175
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,411
Because I mean this.

176
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,399
I want you to
give all of that up.

177
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,617
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

178
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,653
I am a drag on your life.

179
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:46,065
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

180
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:47,871
Please?

181
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,738
You can be whatever you
wanna be. You're a brilliant man.

182
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,232
Absolute best of the best.

183
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,391
I can't sit here...

184
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:01,540
and watch you run
in place in Central City...

185
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,074
for some old dude...

186
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,895
- who's not going anywhere.
- Dad...

187
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,125
- That's not true.
- It's time.

188
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,823
- That's not true.
- Let's go, Allen.

189
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:10,856
Allen!

190
00:18:10,886 --> 00:18:12,291
I want you to make
your own future.

191
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,267
Living in the past...
Make your own future.

192
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,469
Open gate!

193
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,954
Lab's all yours, Howard.

194
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:44,644
11:30. Early night
for you, Silas.

195
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,439
Yes. Early.

196
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,728
I never got to say...

197
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:54,001
I'm very sorry about
what happened.

198
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,548
Victor was a wonderful kid.

199
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:00,089
Thank you.

200
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,455
Victor.

201
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,944
Victor, you're not
stuck up here.

202
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,811
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

203
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:27,047
- If you stay up here brooding...
- I'm processing.

204
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,152
I can access everything.

205
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,081
- But I can't put it all together.
- Not yet.

206
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,798
But if you work with me, if
we had the change engines...

207
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:37,777
So you did to someone else.
What you did to me.

208
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:42,421
No. The box
stays hidden.

209
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,269
If you could see what we're learning
from the Kryptonian ship...

210
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,876
I think the change engine
can integrate with its energy...

211
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:50,193
- get it powered up...
- Does anybody know?

212
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:51,718
What?

213
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,776
At the lab... Does
anybody know I'm alive?

214
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,953
I...
I...

215
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,399
I didn't think you were
ready for them to...

216
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,922
For what?

217
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,027
For them to see the monster?

218
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:05,387
You are not a monster.

219
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:08,215
It's weird that you
thought I meant me.

220
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,979
What I did...

221
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:17,392
I lost your mother
in that accident.

222
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,258
I wasn't about to...

223
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,847
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

224
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:24,302
But you did.

225
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,564
I got a language in my
head that I don't speak.

226
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,295
It's not just
digital... It's alien.

227
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,293
Everyday, I wake
up, different...

228
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,684
Modified.

229
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,260
How do you...?

230
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:49,565
Couldn't do that last night.

231
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,654
Ever since we got
visitors from Krypton,

232
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:55,291
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

233
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,855
Now I got to wonder if I'm it?

234
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:19,404
- Any changes today?
- No, my Queen.

235
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,894
The Mother Box has awoken...

236
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,670
Yet, nothing has happened.

237
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,370
It has slept for thousands
of years, since the first age.

238
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:30,938
Why did it wake at all?

239
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,420
Amazons, on your mark!

240
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,242
Steppenwolf.

241
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:11,855
Mother...

242
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:15,737
Millenia in exile...
Searching.

243
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:19,648
At last, you call me home.

244
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:22,215
You will not like your welcome.

245
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,782
Oh, I think I will.

246
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,188
- Gather the legions.
- Seal the cage!

247
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:52,222
Go!

248
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:54,539
Flank right!

249
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,800
Yes...

250
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,485
Run.

251
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,129
Seal the gates!

252
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:29,289
Keep it moving.

253
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,390
Got it! Go!

254
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:57,744
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

255
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,669
After the Unity, you
will join my Legion...

256
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:06,530
and you will know the
righteousness of power.

257
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,079
You will love me.

258
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,789
You all will.

259
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,469
We have to light the
ancient warning fire.

260
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,729
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

261
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,446
Men won't know what it means.

262
00:26:57,988 --> 00:26:59,462
Men won't...

263
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:02,792
But she will.

264
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,003
Listen to me, Diana.

265
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:39,829
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

266
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,304
Me?

267
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,429
Nothing very interesting.

268
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:46,288
That's all you ever tell us.

269
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:49,085
Whay can I say?
I'm not that exciting.

270
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:51,282
...Shrine of the Amazons...

271
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:55,203
an enormous bonfire
burned right behind me...

272
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,329
baffling absolutely everyone...

273
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,379
from locals, to government
authorities alike.

274
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:04,410
- The fire could be seen for miles on end...
- Invasion.

275
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:07,128
On the local scene...

276
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:09,534
This janitor's wife
had some strong words...

277
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,741
for the aliens she says,

278
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,155
stole her man.

279
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:16,966
My Howard is a good
man. He's a provider.

280
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:20,707
And these aliens are gonna
(beep) probe him?

281
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:23,003
Come down to the Lakeview...

282
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:26,634
And I'll stick a (beep) probe
up your alien (beep) ass, you...

283
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,773
I found a little place.
By the diner.

284
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:31,458
Suits me just fine.

285
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,123
I wish you'd said something.

286
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:35,419
Oh, no. I got behind
in the payments.

287
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:39,150
And you know the banks. Jump
like a cougar if you miss by a dime.

288
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:42,209
Place was too big for me anyway.

289
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,245
Shuffling around
like an old ghost.

290
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:47,654
Well, I might have been
able to, talk to someone, or...

291
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,219
You had enough to deal with.

292
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,055
Don't need to add
mother-in-law to the list.

293
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:54,424
- Not that I was ever...
- Hey, Lane...

294
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:59,860
Who is your source? The
activist in that university...

295
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,835
Look, it's my source.

296
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,032
I got tapped for
the kidnapping story.

297
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:06,891
There were all those
student protests. Anyway...

298
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:09,357
I'm thinking it's political,
so... Who's your guy?

299
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:11,594
Well let's see if
she'll take your call.

300
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,080
So, it's a she.

301
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,303
It's not a she.

302
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:21,452
Sounds like you should
be working that story.

303
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:25,966
I'm... I'm
not ready yet.

304
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:30,408
I'm perfectly happy, doing fluff
pieces about kitten grooming.

305
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:32,645
For a while...

306
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:36,676
It was hard coming
back here at all.

307
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,119
Well. I can hardly read
the news anyway.

308
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,503
So much bitterness.

309
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,432
'Course, I think it's all
because he's gone.

310
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:49,202
But I suppose a mother does.

311
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,946
But it's not like there's any
less that needs reporting.

312
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:57,286
And Clark promised me, you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

313
00:29:57,316 --> 00:29:59,492
- Oh, did he?
- Oh, yes. He did.

314
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:03,012
He said you were the thirstiest
young woman he'd ever met.

315
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,127
- Hungriest.
- Hungry. Yeah.

316
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:11,457
He said you...

317
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,555
could smell a story. Further
away than he could hear.

318
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:20,272
Well stories, made sense.

319
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:24,555
It was more than just a puzzle.
It was about the truth.

320
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:29,318
It was about seeing the
engine of the world...

321
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,876
While it still ran.

322
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:41,894
Victor Stone...

323
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,258
Deceased.

324
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,643
That one...

325
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:29,452
Pretty sure that's what
made the alien go crazy.

326
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,938
I'll see about weaving
something to the suit.

327
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:33,182
Won't be quick.

328
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,436
Anything to give me an edge.

329
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,777
You know, I paid
millions of dollars...

330
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,483
for this building's security.

331
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:52,066
Yeah. It looked
expensive.

332
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,553
Hi.

333
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,301
A new toy?

334
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,096
Prototype troop carrier.

335
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,977
I once knew a man who
would've loved to fly it.

336
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,849
Yeah, well we're gonna
need more than a pilot.

337
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:12,837
I think there's
an attack coming.

338
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:16,327
Not coming, Bruce.
It's already here.

339
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:22,054
They called him Steppenwolf.

340
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:23,729
The End of Worlds.

341
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,576
He lived only to conquer.

342
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:30,508
Millions fell
before his blade...

343
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:33,195
And rose again as
his Parademons.

344
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,238
Nightmare creatures,
who feed on fear.

345
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,901
Yeah, I think I've met one.
We didn't hit it off.

346
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,255
Here in Gotham?

347
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:44,498
They're all over.

348
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:46,935
They're looking for
his... Boxes?

349
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:50,075
- The Mother Boxes.
- Mother Boxes?

350
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,521
I guess Steppenwolf
sent the winged people

351
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:53,865
that leaves two more.

352
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:56,413
- I'm impressed.
- Don't be.

353
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:58,037
I have no idea what's in them.

354
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,612
A weapon? Some
kind of power?

355
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:01,287
They don't contain power.

356
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:04,746
They are power.

357
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,046
Carried from planet to planet...

358
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:11,416
The Mother Boxes combined
to form the Unity.

359
00:33:11,787 --> 00:33:15,518
An apocalyptic power that
not only destroys worlds...

360
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:18,978
...but transforms them into
the primordial hell's gate...

361
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,044
...of Steppenwolf's birthworld.

362
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:23,972
We should have died...

363
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:27,041
But we formed our own Unity.

364
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,840
Amazons, Atlanteans...

365
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,510
All the tribes of man
fought side by side.

366
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:38,083
Warriors of legend.

367
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:43,319
Allies from other worlds.

368
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:48,543
Even the gods themselves
all acted as one.

369
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:52,504
Laying down their lives to
drive Steppenwolf away.

370
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,355
Some say it drove him mad...

371
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,972
.. the disgrace of
his first retreat.

372
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,870
He swore our alliance
would crumble.

373
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:15,311
That darkness would
cover the Earth...

374
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:21,248
And that he would
return when it did.

375
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:26,834
Left behind...

376
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,649
The Mother Boxes
were too dangerous

377
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,173
to be kept together.

378
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,947
One was entrusted
to the Amazons.

379
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,966
One, to the Atlanteans.

380
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:42,399
Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.

381
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:46,962
The Box of Man
was buried in secret.

382
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:51,886
So that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.

383
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,635
Such harmony out of such horror.

384
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:00,932
It was truly an age of heroes.

385
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:04,462
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

386
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,341
The Atlanteans were
a force under sea...

387
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:10,289
And the Amazons, to an
island they can never leave.

388
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,997
I wouldn't count on
the tribes of men.

389
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,276
We tend to act like the doomsday
clock has a snooze button.

390
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,673
- How long until we...
- Days.

391
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:20,890
At most.

392
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:24,781
Steppenwolf's mistake last
time was attacking us.

393
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:27,629
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

394
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,587
This time he'll just
go after the Boxes.

395
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,566
I got a location for
one of our recruits.

396
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,632
- Barry Allen.
- What about the other one?

397
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:36,956
Victor Stone?

398
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,440
I was hoping you
would dig him up.

399
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:44,157
We're asking people we
don't know to risk their lives.

400
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:45,290
I know.

401
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,119
That's how this works.

402
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:21,284
Barry Allen.

403
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,119
Bruce Wayne.

404
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,667
You say that like it explains...

405
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:28,024
why there's a total
stranger in my place...

406
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,541
sitting in the dark, in
my second favorite chair.

407
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:32,717
Tell me about this.

408
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,139
This is a person who
looks exactly like me...

409
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:41,743
but who is definitely not me.

410
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:44,972
Very attractive Jewish boy.

411
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,923
Somebody who, I don't know,
stole your pocketwatch?

412
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:51,020
Or railroads?

413
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,479
I know you have abilities. I just
don't know what they are.

414
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:57,027
My special skills include...

415
00:36:57,057 --> 00:37:00,558
Viola, web design,
fluent in sign language...

416
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,312
gorilla sign language...

417
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:04,609
Silica-based
quartz sand fabric,

418
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:06,956
Abrasion resistant.
Heat resistant.

419
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:07,986
Yeah, I do...

420
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,823
- Competitive ice dancing.
- That's what they use...

421
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,138
on the space shuttle, to

422
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:12,441
prevent it from burning
up on re-entry.

423
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:15,400
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

424
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:19,593
Whoever you're looking
for, it's not me...

425
00:37:43,852 --> 00:37:45,036
You're the Batman?

426
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,851
So you're fast.

427
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,107
That feels like an
oversimplification.

428
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,762
I'm putting together a team.

429
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,648
People with special abilities.

430
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,693
You see, I believe
enemies are coming.

431
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,800
Stop right there. I'm in.

432
00:37:57,131 --> 00:37:58,131
You are?

433
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,032
Yeah. I need... friends.

434
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:06,177
People are difficult. They
require a lot of focus.

435
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:10,178
They have like a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

436
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:11,954
Like, Brunch?

437
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,778
Like... What is Brunch?

438
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,694
You wait in line for an hour...

439
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,560
for, essentially, lunch.

440
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,598
I mean, I don't know.

441
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:24,630
People are...
a little slow.

442
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:27,117
I'll try to keep up.

443
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:28,912
Can I keep this?

444
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:32,423
It's like this layer of
dimensional reality...

445
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:33,853
that seems to
manipulate space-time.

446
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:35,130
I call it the Speed Force.

447
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,206
Causes me to burn tremendous
amount of calories...

448
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,874
So I am just a black
hole of snacks.

449
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:41,689
I am a "snack hole."

450
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:45,691
How many people are
on this special fight team?

451
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,235
Three. Including you.

452
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:49,030
Three? Against what?

453
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,337
I'll tell you on the plane.

454
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,162
Plane?

455
00:38:53,593 --> 00:38:55,790
What are your superpowers again?

456
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:57,605
I'm rich.

457
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,356
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

458
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:34,973
Why are you and Bruce
Wayne looking for me?

459
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,260
You know who we are?

460
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:41,933
And I also know where you are.

461
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,819
Are you Victor Stone?

462
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:47,148
Was.

463
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,939
I need to speak to you.

464
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,794
You are.

465
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,259
No, face to face.

466
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,164
I'm old-fashioned that way.

467
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:59,383
Why would I trust you?

468
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:03,185
If I was going to attack you,
I would've done it by the lake.

469
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:08,580
Looks like you have
a date, Ms. Prince.

470
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:12,381
About time somebody here did.

471
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:46,931
Face to face.

472
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,488
I've been doing some tracking.

473
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,743
What you're looking for is
sticking to the dead zones.

474
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:57,982
It gets in front of a
camera, causes a surge.

475
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,382
- I'll let you know.
- That's not good enough.

476
00:41:01,413 --> 00:41:02,586
Not good enough?

477
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:04,412
For you.

478
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:06,557
Look, I don't know you...

479
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:09,215
And I don't know how
you got these gifts.

480
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:10,168
Gifts?

481
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,133
No one else can do what you do.

482
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:15,544
No, if these are gifts...

483
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,570
then why am I the
one paying for them?

484
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,143
We need you, Victor.

485
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:22,514
And maybe you need us.

486
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:24,358
I'll be fine alone.

487
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:27,207
I told myself the
same for a long time.

488
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:35,080
I lost someone I loved once.

489
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:42,431
I shut myself off
from... From everyone.

490
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,901
But I had to learn to
open back up again.

491
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,704
The truth is I'm
still working on it.

492
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:53,804
And if you agreed to meet me...

493
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,006
...you're working on it, too.

494
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,215
Trust me, Victor.

495
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:11,404
Mayday! Mayday!

496
00:42:12,778 --> 00:42:15,326
Something came
down from the sky.

497
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,933
Please, help me!

498
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,421
Whisky.

499
00:42:42,224 --> 00:42:43,677
And one for Ahab there.

500
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:45,693
...from the sky...

501
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:48,321
I heard a cannon.

502
00:42:48,362 --> 00:42:50,407
- It's ocean's rage.
- Then they came...

503
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,634
Monsters.

504
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:54,930
...from the sky.

505
00:42:56,104 --> 00:42:57,838
Tore right through my boat.

506
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,617
Monsters...

507
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:03,926
It's on him.

508
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,981
You took a hell of a hit.

509
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,485
You all right?

510
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,301
At last...

511
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,188
The firstborn of beloved
Queen Atlanna.

512
00:45:38,924 --> 00:45:40,117
Wait.

513
00:45:42,163 --> 00:45:43,276
Please.

514
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:47,399
I knew her.

515
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:50,667
That makes one of us.

516
00:45:50,698 --> 00:45:52,704
When my parents
fought in the wars...

517
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:56,223
- She took me in.
- What a saint.

518
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,169
You dare speak of Queen
Atlanna that way?

519
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,256
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

520
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:01,477
and never gave
me another thought...

521
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:03,665
Your mother left
you to save your life.

522
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,062
You can't imagine
how it hurt her.

523
00:46:06,403 --> 00:46:08,017
What it cost her.

524
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:12,079
But you're not a
defenseless child now.

525
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,098
It would've been
her responsibility...

526
00:46:15,128 --> 00:46:18,257
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

527
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:23,081
Now, it's yours.

528
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:26,983
Then I'm gonna need
something from you.

529
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,238
Leave that.

530
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:49,216
Leave it. It will never work.

531
00:47:27,747 --> 00:47:30,014
I see, Mother.

532
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:34,056
I see why you
waited to summon me.

533
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:38,439
That Kryptonian's death
plunged this timid world...

534
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,173
into such terror.

535
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:46,552
Amazons. Atlanteans. Each
stands, and falls, alone.

536
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:54,144
I know Mother. You've waited
too long for the Unity.

537
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:57,123
I know. But
you will feed.

538
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,401
And my exile will
come to an end.

539
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:07,643
I will take my place
among the New Gods.

540
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:11,354
Find the last one.

541
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:15,766
Its power will
cleanse this world.

542
00:48:17,632 --> 00:48:19,386
For the Unity!

543
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,566
For Darkseid.

544
00:48:32,304 --> 00:48:33,387
Victor.

545
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:45,011
Asshole!

546
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:48,451
Eight kidnappings. 6
in Metropolis, 2 here.

547
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,617
All the vics worked
for STAR Labs.

548
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:55,561
Attacked by a flying vampire.

549
00:48:55,902 --> 00:48:58,249
Suspect was a giant bat...

550
00:48:58,279 --> 00:48:59,743
with huge fangs.

551
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:02,010
One of them was
a little kid, scared.

552
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,675
Won't say a word but drew this.

553
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:05,720
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like.

554
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,969
Come on. You think he fights
criminals for 20 years here...

555
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,757
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

556
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:14,436
I'll talk to him tonight.

557
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,788
The world's gone crazy,
Jim. Maybe he did, too.

558
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,636
You find the Cyborg?

559
00:49:25,949 --> 00:49:27,142
We spoke.

560
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:29,058
Give him time.

561
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:32,327
You must be
Barry. I'm Diana.

562
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:33,892
Hi Barry, I'm Diana...

563
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,958
That's not right. Great.

564
00:49:35,988 --> 00:49:37,442
So this is us?

565
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:38,625
Yeah. This is us.

566
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:40,631
Oh! Awesome!

567
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:42,527
That's the Bat-signal.
That's your...

568
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,132
Oh. Sorry.

569
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:46,227
That's your signal. That
means we have to go now.

570
00:49:46,257 --> 00:49:49,076
- Yeah. That's what that means.
- That's so cool.

571
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:26,704
How many of you are there?

572
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:28,620
Not enough.

573
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:32,872
Eight people abducted
from or near STAR Labs.

574
00:50:32,902 --> 00:50:34,266
Here's the potential perp.

575
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:36,533
Parademons.

576
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:37,866
Okay...

577
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:40,354
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

578
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:42,831
They carried people away to
find out what they know.

579
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:45,047
- So the eight might still be alive.
- Nine.

580
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:50,583
The head of STAR Labs
was taken as well.

581
00:50:51,776 --> 00:50:52,860
You made it.

582
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:57,463
So then. There must
be a nest nearby.

583
00:50:57,503 --> 00:51:00,823
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham...

584
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,528
No pattern I can see.

585
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:04,292
The lines on the
map don't converge.

586
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:05,386
On land.

587
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:08,355
These lead back to Braxton Island,
between the two cities.

588
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:10,701
Gotham Harbor.
These are air vents...

589
00:51:10,741 --> 00:51:13,158
they all lead down to the
tunnel from Metropolis...

590
00:51:13,188 --> 00:51:14,873
project that was
abandoned in '29.

591
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:18,895
Do you really think that...

592
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,287
Wow. They just... They
really just vanished.

593
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:26,316
That's rude.

594
00:51:53,505 --> 00:51:56,063
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton Island.

595
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:57,095
You should be...

596
00:51:57,466 --> 00:52:00,214
directly under the venting
tower for the tunnel.

597
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:03,644
Now, look to your left,
you should see a staircase.

598
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:05,650
It will give you access
to the machine room.

599
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:13,824
Define access.

600
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,669
One at a time.

601
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:16,852
The bridge may not...

602
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:18,878
...hold.

603
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:28,346
- Just tell me the truth.
- Please, just let us go.

604
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:30,602
- I have a family!
- Wrong answer.

605
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:33,380
Humans...

606
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,291
The stench of your fear is
making my soldiers hungry.

607
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:40,180
Shall I feed them?

608
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:43,449
You've been near the Mother Box.

609
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:45,605
- The scent is on you...
- Please.

610
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:47,160
We have families.

611
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,827
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

612
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,647
Okay. Here's the thing...

613
00:52:56,938 --> 00:52:59,696
See, I'm afraid of bugs, and...

614
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:02,634
Guns. And obnoxiously tall people.

615
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:04,439
And murder.
I can't be here.

616
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,251
It's really cool, you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff, but...

617
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:10,998
Full transparency,
I've never done battle.

618
00:53:11,129 --> 00:53:13,556
I just push some
people and run away.

619
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:15,361
Save one.

620
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,614
One?

621
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:18,049
Save one person.

622
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:20,797
Wait, which one?

623
00:53:20,827 --> 00:53:24,216
Don't talk. Don't fight.
Get in. Get one out.

624
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:25,711
And then?

625
00:53:26,092 --> 00:53:27,135
You go.

626
00:53:29,512 --> 00:53:30,525
Okay.

627
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,534
Useless!

628
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:36,722
You then.

629
00:53:38,769 --> 00:53:42,118
Where is my Mother Box?

630
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:45,368
I'll die before I tell you.

631
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:48,998
At last, one that doesn't whine.

632
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,933
But you will scream.

633
00:53:58,596 --> 00:53:59,599
Dad.

634
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:01,184
Victor.

635
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:05,345
You were born of her.

636
00:54:05,857 --> 00:54:08,323
A creature of chaos.

637
00:54:08,354 --> 00:54:09,748
Not how I see it.

638
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,393
Give it time.

639
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,557
Amazon!

640
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:36,315
Okay.

641
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:39,263
Save one.

642
00:54:49,573 --> 00:54:51,569
This one is mine.

643
00:54:53,174 --> 00:54:55,289
You overestimate yourself.

644
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:56,764
Child...

645
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:01,286
My axe is still slick with
the blood of your sisters.

646
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:17,433
Alfred, I need the Nightcrawler.

647
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:19,028
I thought you'd never ask.

648
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,036
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

649
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:37,137
You good?

650
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,905
At the end of the hall
there should be stairs.

651
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:39,467
Okay.

652
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:40,068
Go!

653
00:55:40,108 --> 00:55:42,135
He's after the change engine.
His Mother Box.

654
00:55:42,165 --> 00:55:44,360
- You have to keep him from it.
- Help people get to safety.

655
00:55:44,361 --> 00:55:45,425
- Promise me.
- Go!

656
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:23,103
Finish her!

657
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:29,010
Sorry guys,

658
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,929
I didn't bring a sword.

659
00:56:45,147 --> 00:56:47,874
Jesus. He is tall.

660
00:57:58,078 --> 00:57:59,140
So...

661
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,319
You have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

662
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,992
The Old Gods died.

663
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:20,702
No!

664
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:40,178
Heads up!

665
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:53,637
Thanks, Alfred. But
I'll take it from here.

666
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,924
Do I know you?

667
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:15,260
Primitive beings.

668
00:59:20,746 --> 00:59:22,110
What are we under right now?

669
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,392
Gotham Harbor.

670
00:59:29,993 --> 00:59:31,195
You all need to move.

671
00:59:31,226 --> 00:59:33,392
- You get him out...
- Diana, there's no time.

672
00:59:33,422 --> 00:59:35,428
Also among my fears is drowning.

673
00:59:35,759 --> 00:59:37,815
You are a distraction.

674
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:40,342
Mother is calling.

675
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:46,099
Diana, come on!

676
01:00:16,657 --> 01:00:18,111
Come on.

677
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:39,473
The change engine.

678
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:46,473
Did he just bail?

679
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:51,277
Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.

680
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,905
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

681
01:00:58,056 --> 01:01:00,975
Dressed like
a bat? I dig it.

682
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,602
It may be temporary.

683
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,127
So...

684
01:01:05,217 --> 01:01:06,872
What made you change your mind?

685
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:08,266
Steppenwolf.

686
01:01:09,158 --> 01:01:10,883
He took the Mother
Box from Atlantis.

687
01:01:10,913 --> 01:01:13,762
All he needs now is
the last box of man.

688
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:15,207
If he doesn't already have it.

689
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,699
He doesn't have it.

690
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:34,081
We need to get away.

691
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:36,297
No. We are
safer here.

692
01:01:36,728 --> 01:01:39,727
What happens when
we run out of food?

693
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:41,743
Someone will come.

694
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:43,337
Who will come for us?

695
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:09,683
Wow. It's
like a cave.

696
01:02:12,431 --> 01:02:14,508
Like a Batcave.

697
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:19,642
Barry!

698
01:02:21,177 --> 01:02:23,453
My father called it
the change engine.

699
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,640
It was found by the British
during World War I.

700
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,673
They studied it...

701
01:02:26,753 --> 01:02:29,540
but they couldn't
even date it. It's so old.

702
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:33,372
It was shelved, until the
night Superman died.

703
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,668
Then she lit up like Christmas.

704
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,223
They brought it to STAR Labs...

705
01:02:37,243 --> 01:02:38,818
where my father recognized it...

706
01:02:38,858 --> 01:02:40,593
as a perpetual energy matrix.

707
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:41,816
That sounds cool.

708
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:43,631
I thought it was
like a nuclear bomb.

709
01:02:43,661 --> 01:02:46,008
A Mother Box destroys
as it creates.

710
01:02:47,132 --> 01:02:49,919
It's a cycle of life, but
a million times faster.

711
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,999
My father thought it was the
key to unlimited energy.

712
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:56,689
New formulas,
cellular regeneration...

713
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,367
But it's too
volatile to control.

714
01:02:59,397 --> 01:03:00,691
He used it on you.

715
01:03:01,683 --> 01:03:03,258
I was in an accident.

716
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:05,053
I should've died.

717
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:08,633
My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box to

718
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:11,843
rebuild the broken parts of me with
a few cybernetic enhancements.

719
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:13,779
Instead, he built
a living machine.

720
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:15,653
I may be stronger than its host.

721
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:19,164
Too much.
Too much life.

722
01:03:20,257 --> 01:03:21,871
What's on your weird mind?

723
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:24,168
Muscles. Coordination.

724
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,696
Basic cellular integrity.

725
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:29,403
A human being can
only absorb so much.

726
01:03:30,296 --> 01:03:33,566
The Mother Box was
designed to reshape a planet.

727
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:34,909
So?

728
01:03:34,939 --> 01:03:35,832
So...

729
01:03:35,872 --> 01:03:37,998
What if you were
stronger than a planet?

730
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:42,631
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

731
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:45,269
If you were in a
conductive field...

732
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:47,174
A boost from the Mother Box...

733
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:49,752
...could bring "him"
back to life.

734
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:54,736
The Kryptonian ship has
an amniotic chamber...

735
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,331
- Which would be a perfect...
- No.

736
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:58,106
- Diana.
- Bruce, no!

737
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:00,764
You have no idea what kind
of power you're dealing with.

738
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:02,489
Even if there was a
fraction of a chance...

739
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:04,495
That what? That we
could raise a monster?

740
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:05,347
Like Luthor did?

741
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:06,550
We have tech Luthor's
never even seen...

742
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,265
Superman is dead.

743
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:10,873
We all wish he weren't.

744
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:12,478
We don't know
what state he's in.

745
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:14,553
We know we can't bring him back.

746
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,121
But this is science
beyond our limits.

747
01:04:17,623 --> 01:04:18,823
And that's what science is for.

748
01:04:18,846 --> 01:04:20,010
To do what's never been done.

749
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:22,206
- To make life better.
- Or to end it.

750
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:24,603
Technology is like
any other power...

751
01:04:24,643 --> 01:04:27,461
Without reason, without
heart... It destroys us.

752
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,731
You're risking lives.

753
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,158
Theirs and maybe countless more.

754
01:04:33,187 --> 01:04:35,384
We don't have time
for a control group.

755
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:37,460
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

756
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,025
Why? Because
of your guilt?

757
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:45,313
Bruce, I was there.
You didn't kill Superman.

758
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,847
At some point, even you...

759
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,464
have to learn to move on.

760
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:51,822
Did Steve Trevor tell you that?

761
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:07,506
Superman, was a
beacon to the world.

762
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,184
Why aren't you?

763
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:13,955
You're an inspiration, Diana.

764
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:15,490
You don't just save people.

765
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:18,479
You make them see
their better selves.

766
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,664
And yet, I never heard of you...

767
01:05:20,694 --> 01:05:23,031
Until Luthor lured you out

768
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:25,369
by stealing a picture of
your dead boyfriend.

769
01:05:27,986 --> 01:05:30,694
You shut yourself
down for a century.

770
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:33,000
So let's not talk
about me moving on.

771
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:35,257
You know...

772
01:05:35,287 --> 01:05:37,524
That if she kills you,
we'll cover for her.

773
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,178
We are not enough.

774
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,735
Each of us in our own
way has held back.

775
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:44,252
And I promise you, Steppenwolf is
not out there talking about ethics.

776
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,128
He's trying to burn
down the world.

777
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:48,756
The way we're gonna stop him...

778
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,591
...is by using
his power.

779
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:51,755
This power,

780
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:52,867
against him.

781
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:55,535
I agree.

782
01:05:57,271 --> 01:06:00,168
I don't like the idea of reintegrating
with the Mother Box...

783
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,937
But I was running the numbers
while you're being an asshole,

784
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:05,333
and there's a high probability
that we can bring him back.

785
01:06:05,363 --> 01:06:07,570
Right, but we mean
bring him back, in like a...

786
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,797
"Yay! He's back!"
way. Not in like a...

787
01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:11,753
Like a Pet Sematary

788
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:13,196
scenario?

789
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:16,666
You lose something when
you die. Even Superman.

790
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,226
Maybe not his mind.
Maybe his soul.

791
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:22,914
I'll have a contingency
plan for that.

792
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:26,534
If he wakes up and you're
the first thing he sees...

793
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:28,450
You'll need one.

794
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:42,300
Well that was fun
while it didn't last.

795
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,577
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

796
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,522
I don't see why
you're pushing her.

797
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,153
We'll have to boost the signal.

798
01:06:50,213 --> 01:06:51,797
Put it through the
Batmobile's speakers.

799
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:53,302
Now you're changing the subject.

800
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:54,485
I have a contingency.

801
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,722
Diana was right about the risk.

802
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:59,399
If the plan goes south, we're
gonna bring in the big guns.

803
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,874
But that's not...

804
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:03,512
Those are very big guns.

805
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,895
You got a team here.

806
01:07:04,925 --> 01:07:07,804
Superman could bring this team
together better than I ever could.

807
01:07:07,844 --> 01:07:10,372
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

808
01:07:10,412 --> 01:07:11,785
Or what abilities
you might have.

809
01:07:11,825 --> 01:07:13,480
He was more human than I am.

810
01:07:18,003 --> 01:07:19,337
He lived in this world.

811
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:22,246
Fell in love, had a job.

812
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,224
In spite of all that power.

813
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:28,534
The world needs Superman.

814
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:33,508
And the team needs Clark.

815
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,056
And what does Clark need?

816
01:07:36,978 --> 01:07:38,833
Maybe he's at peace.

817
01:07:39,646 --> 01:07:41,030
He'll get over it.

818
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:54,569
You know, I can do
this a lot faster. I just...

819
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,217
Is it weird that it
feels disrespectful?

820
01:07:57,256 --> 01:07:58,319
Yep.

821
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:01,760
Do you feel a
sense of confidence

822
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:04,728
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong

823
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:05,951
and macabre here?

824
01:08:06,804 --> 01:08:07,807
Not really.

825
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:11,045
- Okay then why are...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

826
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,872
The stories Diana told us?

827
01:08:13,112 --> 01:08:14,657
And I believe them.

828
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:16,944
But we're gonna stop him.

829
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:18,799
That's the plan.

830
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:20,905
That's the plan!

831
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:28,848
Okay, we're not ready
for... Racially charged...

832
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,348
You got struck
by lightning, huh?

833
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,996
Yeah... That's the
abridged version.

834
01:08:35,898 --> 01:08:37,743
- And you...?
- Explosion.

835
01:08:37,964 --> 01:08:39,569
Woke up in a lab.

836
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:41,254
We're, we're the accidents.

837
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:43,891
Yeah, that's us.

838
01:08:44,964 --> 01:08:46,990
Hey!

839
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:01,332
We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.

840
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:03,327
ETA, 30 seconds.

841
01:09:09,034 --> 01:09:10,758
I'm here for him.

842
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:13,768
- I swear, I would never...
- Save it.

843
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:36,402
- Okay.
- Okay!

844
01:09:37,486 --> 01:09:38,810
Okay.

845
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,656
This is amazing.

846
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:03,761
This is crazy.

847
01:10:03,802 --> 01:10:05,346
What, now it's crazy?

848
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:08,195
You lunatics better
know what you're doing.

849
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:04,286
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

850
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,215
There's not enough charge
to wake the Box.

851
01:11:07,957 --> 01:11:09,451
I might be able to do it.

852
01:11:10,173 --> 01:11:11,506
I might be able to
jumpstart it, I...

853
01:11:11,507 --> 01:11:12,881
If I can get enough distance...

854
01:11:12,922 --> 01:11:14,947
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

855
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:16,211
I might be able to wake the Box,

856
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,170
if that's still what we want?

857
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,704
We have to try.

858
01:11:25,718 --> 01:11:27,554
This must be the
end of the line, so...

859
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,737
I'm in position.

860
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,642
The Mother Box is ready.

861
01:11:33,682 --> 01:11:35,887
You have to charge it the
moment it touches the fluid.

862
01:11:36,218 --> 01:11:37,903
- Five.
- Five...

863
01:11:37,944 --> 01:11:40,722
Diana's right. This
is a bad idea.

864
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:43,299
Four.

865
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:45,242
Three.

866
01:11:45,245 --> 01:11:46,378
Three...

867
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:47,661
Two.

868
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:49,346
Two.

869
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:51,974
One.

870
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:32,906
Give us an ETA on
all additional units...

871
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,131
He's back.

872
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:01,989
He's not all right.

873
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:07,074
He's scanning us.

874
01:14:07,274 --> 01:14:07,886
What?

875
01:14:07,926 --> 01:14:10,253
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

876
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:11,437
Because he's not all right.

877
01:14:11,477 --> 01:14:12,420
Oh, no.

878
01:14:12,459 --> 01:14:15,308
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

879
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:19,028
Victor...

880
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:20,282
Victor, stop.

881
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:22,178
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

882
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:22,870
Victor.

883
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,480
- It's my armor's defense system...
- No.

884
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:25,646
It's stronger since
the interface...

885
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:27,473
- I can't control it.
- Victor, no!

886
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:29,980
- Shut it off!
- Think of happy thoughts, Victor!

887
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:44,693
Kal-El, no!

888
01:14:52,766 --> 01:14:55,173
He's confused, he
doesn't know who he is.

889
01:14:55,414 --> 01:14:56,808
Pet Sematary.

890
01:15:02,314 --> 01:15:04,781
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

891
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,460
I got him.

892
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,370
Kal-El, the last
son of Krypton...

893
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:35,901
Remember who you are.

894
01:15:37,716 --> 01:15:38,859
Tell me who you...

895
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:37,949
Clark...

896
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:43,596
I know you.

897
01:16:50,045 --> 01:16:52,060
Please don't make me do this.

898
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:14,906
Alfred, I need the big gun...

899
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,882
- You did this...
- I had to.

900
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:26,209
You won't let me live.

901
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:29,047
You won't let me die.

902
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,564
The world needs you.

903
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:37,762
But does it need you?

904
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:41,082
Tell me...

905
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,882
Do you bleed?

906
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:47,821
Clark.

907
01:17:56,446 --> 01:17:57,569
Clark.

908
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:00,337
Please...

909
01:18:19,252 --> 01:18:20,797
Please.

910
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,131
Please,

911
01:18:30,013 --> 01:18:31,627
just go.

912
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,453
Yeah?

913
01:18:34,195 --> 01:18:37,083
Let's go. Yeah...

914
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:50,793
Yeah. Something's
definitely bleeding.

915
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,054
The Mother Box.

916
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:15,194
He has the last one.

917
01:19:30,126 --> 01:19:31,671
You brought us here.

918
01:19:33,216 --> 01:19:34,640
You remembered.

919
01:19:37,247 --> 01:19:38,521
This is home.

920
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:42,422
You smell good.

921
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,778
Did I not before?

922
01:20:03,663 --> 01:20:04,716
Don't do that.

923
01:20:04,987 --> 01:20:07,033
We just got our
asses handed to us

924
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:08,748
and Steppenwolf
has got the third Box.

925
01:20:08,778 --> 01:20:10,152
So we find them.

926
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,372
If the Boxes are even
close to each other

927
01:20:13,452 --> 01:20:15,026
there's going to be some kind

928
01:20:15,056 --> 01:20:16,340
of energy surge.

929
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,606
And Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping
them somewhere where they don't read.

930
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,742
No internet, no
satellite coverage.

931
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:22,006
That narrows it down.

932
01:20:22,237 --> 01:20:23,510
Not enough.

933
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:25,115
See, you can't find them...

934
01:20:25,346 --> 01:20:27,091
...or maybe you
don't want to.

935
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:30,922
Arthur.

936
01:20:31,022 --> 01:20:32,887
Yeah, that was a great way
to get rid of Superman.

937
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:35,134
Man, I'm not doing
this on purpose.

938
01:20:35,174 --> 01:20:37,481
Right. Because you can't
control the machine.

939
01:20:38,143 --> 01:20:39,958
Right, so is this a bad time

940
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:41,763
to bring up my blood sugar?

941
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:45,464
Very hungry...

942
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:48,191
Victor...

943
01:20:49,295 --> 01:20:50,890
You can find the Boxes.

944
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,494
You share their energy.

945
01:20:52,826 --> 01:20:55,262
I know it's frightening.
But if you go under...

946
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:58,111
I promise, we will
pull you back out.

947
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,007
Just keep the Little Merman
away from me while I work.

948
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:10,215
Barry, go find Alfred
in the pantry.

949
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,770
Then come back, get online.

950
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,485
Everybody check
everybody else's work.

951
01:21:14,868 --> 01:21:15,872
Listen,

952
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,011
just wanted if you
could, put out a,

953
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,290
if you were, an aquatic...

954
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:23,815
You know...

955
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:26,092
Do you, talk to fish?

956
01:21:27,886 --> 01:21:30,564
The water does the talking.

957
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,370
Of course.

958
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,836
If the current comes in strange,
I'm gonna point the way.

959
01:21:35,839 --> 01:21:37,023
Okay.

960
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,603
Wait.

961
01:22:02,536 --> 01:22:03,700
Let me.

962
01:22:04,663 --> 01:22:06,338
Isn't this a little
out of place.

963
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:12,074
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

964
01:22:12,104 --> 01:22:13,287
He could've killed you.

965
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:15,594
I was willing to make the trade.

966
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:19,565
And bringing in Lois Lane?

967
01:22:19,816 --> 01:22:22,242
Remember what you told me
about heart, in the hangar?

968
01:22:22,243 --> 01:22:23,296
I bet you...

969
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:24,951
...thought I
wasn't listening.

970
01:22:26,005 --> 01:22:27,177
Thank you.

971
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:32,803
You know you can't
do this forever.

972
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,699
I can barely do it now.

973
01:22:35,532 --> 01:22:36,795
Steppenwolf...

974
01:22:37,136 --> 01:22:38,400
This is the job.

975
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,663
It's my job.

976
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,271
And I haven't been doing it.

977
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:43,555
I've been reacting.

978
01:22:44,337 --> 01:22:45,621
Not leading.

979
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,444
You know, what you said
about Steve Trevor...

980
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:52,060
That wasn't my
business. I'm sorry.

981
01:22:54,115 --> 01:22:56,332
You were pushing
me to lead the team.

982
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:59,370
But leaders get people killed.

983
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:01,787
I fought...

984
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:03,111
Always...

985
01:23:03,623 --> 01:23:05,127
When I was needed.

986
01:23:06,059 --> 01:23:08,085
But to lead, to
step into the light...

987
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:09,520
And to say to people:

988
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:12,188
"This is worth your life?"

989
01:23:13,932 --> 01:23:15,718
When it's your fault...

990
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:19,608
They're all Steve Trevor.

991
01:23:22,156 --> 01:23:23,811
We make it through tonight...

992
01:23:23,851 --> 01:23:26,017
You can stay in
the shadows forever.

993
01:23:27,351 --> 01:23:28,685
Dressed up like a bat.

994
01:23:28,725 --> 01:23:29,999
I won't even sue.

995
01:23:31,213 --> 01:23:33,679
If... we get
through the night.

996
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,834
Are you okay?

997
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,078
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

998
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,546
I know... I...

999
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:07,657
Just got out of a wooden box.

1000
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:11,719
What was it like...

1001
01:24:13,524 --> 01:24:14,878
Coming back?

1002
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:19,943
Itchy.

1003
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:23,554
I mean, honestly...

1004
01:24:24,156 --> 01:24:25,077
Weird,

1005
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,053
in so many ways.

1006
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:30,775
- But, mostly just...
- I wasn't strong.

1007
01:24:34,124 --> 01:24:35,408
I didn't...

1008
01:24:36,963 --> 01:24:38,847
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

1009
01:24:38,877 --> 01:24:40,051
I wasn't...

1010
01:24:41,024 --> 01:24:43,361
Lois Lane, dedicated
reporter. I...

1011
01:24:44,013 --> 01:24:45,095
I just...

1012
01:24:45,797 --> 01:24:47,041
It's okay.

1013
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,544
I'm the idiot who left.

1014
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,961
But I'm back now...

1015
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:56,790
And I'm gonna make things right.

1016
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:19,013
You called mom?

1017
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:21,641
Of course.

1018
01:25:22,123 --> 01:25:23,276
Thank you.

1019
01:25:25,863 --> 01:25:27,678
I was hoping it was
gonna take you longer to...

1020
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,364
...recover.

1021
01:25:30,867 --> 01:25:31,870
Why?

1022
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:35,331
Because now, I have
to send you away.

1023
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,232
Bruce.

1024
01:25:39,563 --> 01:25:41,047
He needs you.

1025
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,605
Fate of the world. I think
that's the deal. He was...

1026
01:25:43,634 --> 01:25:44,918
Pretty tense.

1027
01:25:45,078 --> 01:25:47,014
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1028
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:49,572
Right.

1029
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:52,199
But no dying.

1030
01:25:53,012 --> 01:25:54,797
And I get the exclusive.

1031
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:56,882
Yes, ma'am.

1032
01:26:33,418 --> 01:26:35,996
- You're really you?
- I'm really me, ma.

1033
01:26:48,372 --> 01:26:49,715
At last.

1034
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:54,008
Praise to the Unity.

1035
01:26:56,805 --> 01:26:58,280
The three is one.

1036
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:29,740
Praise to the Mother of Horrors.

1037
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:40,733
Is Steppenwolf there?

1038
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:44,644
Sorry.

1039
01:27:45,286 --> 01:27:47,262
It's Porzenov.
In Northern Russia.

1040
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:48,666
The Nuclear Plant.

1041
01:27:48,725 --> 01:27:50,631
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1042
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:52,857
There have been some
attempts to resettle nearby...

1043
01:27:52,858 --> 01:27:54,984
...but it looks like
really rough sledding.

1044
01:27:55,384 --> 01:27:57,762
Who picks this place
to put down roots?

1045
01:27:57,932 --> 01:28:00,109
People that are making
it count everywhere else.

1046
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,335
The Earth starts changing...

1047
01:28:02,455 --> 01:28:03,869
...it'll hit them first.

1048
01:28:03,899 --> 01:28:05,283
How long have we got?

1049
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:06,467
A few hours.

1050
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:08,954
Transport won't fly that fast.

1051
01:28:10,037 --> 01:28:11,602
It will for me.

1052
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,190
The Unity brings all three
boxes together in perfect sync.

1053
01:28:57,404 --> 01:28:58,467
Its power builds

1054
01:28:58,537 --> 01:29:00,132
until it can't be contained.

1055
01:29:00,874 --> 01:29:03,020
But if I can cause a
delay between each box,

1056
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,454
even for a nanosecond...

1057
01:29:04,484 --> 01:29:07,152
Its energy will cascade.
Form a loop.

1058
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:08,374
And they'll feed on each other.

1059
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,321
And that's it? We
just pull them apart?

1060
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,826
No fuss, no muss?

1061
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:14,774
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1062
01:29:14,804 --> 01:29:15,867
I have to be there.

1063
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:17,962
But you guys should
think about getting clear.

1064
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:19,408
We're with you 'till it's done.

1065
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:19,999
Honestly...

1066
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,005
I think we're gonna be
dead way before that.

1067
01:29:22,426 --> 01:29:23,489
And you know what?

1068
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,418
I don't mind. It's
an honorable end.

1069
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,125
But we've gotta shut
Steppenwolf down.

1070
01:29:29,857 --> 01:29:31,352
Superman's
a no-show.

1071
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:32,696
You've got no powers.

1072
01:29:32,726 --> 01:29:33,629
No offense.

1073
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:36,025
This guy might be working
for the enemy. We don't know.

1074
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,453
You're tripping over
your feet, and mine...

1075
01:29:40,779 --> 01:29:42,203
You're gorgeous.

1076
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:43,156
And fierce...

1077
01:29:43,186 --> 01:29:44,339
And strong. And...

1078
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,334
I know we went to war
with the Amazons, but...

1079
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:47,558
but that was before my time.

1080
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:49,715
You know what?
I don't wanna die.

1081
01:29:49,845 --> 01:29:52,022
I'm young. There's
shit that I wanna do.

1082
01:29:52,955 --> 01:29:53,876
I just feel like...

1083
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:56,464
I didn't really embrace
the sea or the land.

1084
01:29:56,785 --> 01:29:58,240
I've been a loner my whole life.

1085
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:59,630
But being part of
something bigger,

1086
01:29:59,784 --> 01:30:01,278
like this...

1087
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,016
Maybe I'm scared because...

1088
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:06,042
I'm meant to...

1089
01:30:17,736 --> 01:30:19,792
I think that was beautiful.

1090
01:30:23,171 --> 01:30:26,171
You say a word about this,
and I'll meet every prawn I know.

1091
01:30:28,998 --> 01:30:32,027
I honestly didn't hear anything
after "We're all gonna die."

1092
01:30:53,799 --> 01:30:55,796
Let them come.

1093
01:31:03,668 --> 01:31:06,506
I'm gonna take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1094
01:31:06,536 --> 01:31:07,940
You get to Steppenwolf.

1095
01:31:07,971 --> 01:31:10,117
Don't wait for me.
Just do the job.

1096
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:16,810
Alright, Alfred. Are we
set to broadcast?

1097
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:19,346
Playing all your favorite hits.

1098
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:32,013
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1099
01:32:43,045 --> 01:32:47,428
They're coming.
They're all coming.

1100
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:54,257
We might not have
thought this through.

1101
01:32:58,009 --> 01:32:59,543
He's clearing the field.

1102
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,769
He won't last three minutes.

1103
01:33:01,799 --> 01:33:03,093
Then let's use them.

1104
01:33:06,834 --> 01:33:07,957
On my lead.

1105
01:33:21,627 --> 01:33:22,870
They're leaving.

1106
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:29,068
Papa.

1107
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,934
Everyone, get out!

1108
01:34:24,678 --> 01:34:26,113
Son of a bitch.

1109
01:34:39,561 --> 01:34:40,855
This isn't the plan.

1110
01:34:40,895 --> 01:34:42,059
No, Master Wayne...

1111
01:34:42,861 --> 01:34:44,395
...this is the team.

1112
01:34:45,468 --> 01:34:46,468
Hey, blame the lady.

1113
01:34:46,491 --> 01:34:47,404
We would've left you

1114
01:34:47,434 --> 01:34:48,674
but she didn't ask for our vote.

1115
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:54,033
So your genius move is dying?

1116
01:34:54,495 --> 01:34:56,140
You really are out of your mind.

1117
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,255
I'm not the one who
brought a pitchfork.

1118
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:23,899
- Ride ain't over yet.
- My man.

1119
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:11,547
Is this what conquering is?

1120
01:36:11,758 --> 01:36:13,352
Hiding from the fight?

1121
01:36:14,065 --> 01:36:15,829
Oh, no...

1122
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,326
You're all mine.

1123
01:36:23,892 --> 01:36:25,668
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1124
01:36:25,688 --> 01:36:26,751
You got this?

1125
01:36:28,836 --> 01:36:30,281
These things are
gonna keep coming.

1126
01:36:30,311 --> 01:36:32,247
You get technical.
I'm on bug duty.

1127
01:36:32,377 --> 01:36:33,541
Let's do it.

1128
01:36:38,364 --> 01:36:40,120
Yes! That's gross.

1129
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:02,373
Thank you.

1130
01:37:07,037 --> 01:37:08,371
This is not...

1131
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:29,311
Now,

1132
01:37:29,341 --> 01:37:30,735
do you see it?

1133
01:37:51,235 --> 01:37:52,639
Whatever you're
in the middle of...

1134
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:54,254
It's spreading for miles.

1135
01:37:54,564 --> 01:37:56,941
Satellites show
civilians moving east.

1136
01:37:57,864 --> 01:37:59,178
They're not gonna make it.

1137
01:37:59,308 --> 01:38:00,382
Barry...

1138
01:38:00,582 --> 01:38:02,166
I need you to take a walk.

1139
01:38:09,146 --> 01:38:10,741
God, I hope this is east.

1140
01:38:22,174 --> 01:38:23,267
Diana.

1141
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,432
You're not worthy, to touch.

1142
01:38:59,462 --> 01:39:00,705
Mother.

1143
01:39:00,835 --> 01:39:02,460
She's power.

1144
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,804
And power,

1145
01:39:03,834 --> 01:39:05,961
is the only law.

1146
01:39:11,908 --> 01:39:15,117
They're all too weak
to see the truth.

1147
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:16,531
Well...

1148
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,570
I believe in truth.

1149
01:39:20,963 --> 01:39:23,030
But I'm also a
big fan of justice.

1150
01:39:31,514 --> 01:39:32,889
All right!

1151
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,565
Kryptonian.

1152
01:39:56,105 --> 01:39:57,399
So. How
do I help?

1153
01:39:57,429 --> 01:39:58,523
We buy him some time,

1154
01:39:58,553 --> 01:40:01,240
he can stop that box from
destroying all life on Earth.

1155
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:03,416
We hope.

1156
01:40:03,457 --> 01:40:06,124
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back 'cause you like me.

1157
01:40:06,465 --> 01:40:08,812
I don't... not...

1158
01:40:14,769 --> 01:40:15,571
Civilians...

1159
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:17,562
- Barry is headed...
- There's too many of them.

1160
01:40:41,496 --> 01:40:44,816
Oh, yeah. This is
definitely east.

1161
01:40:50,914 --> 01:40:51,917
Slowpoke.

1162
01:40:52,508 --> 01:40:53,571
Oh, it's on.

1163
01:40:53,701 --> 01:40:55,296
I'll take the ones on the right.

1164
01:40:58,456 --> 01:40:59,458
It's okay.

1165
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,775
Hold on. Hold on.

1166
01:41:20,358 --> 01:41:21,813
Dostoyevski!

1167
01:41:38,952 --> 01:41:40,657
Is this guy still bothering you?

1168
01:41:54,968 --> 01:41:56,032
Superman!

1169
01:41:56,373 --> 01:41:57,997
We gotta pull
these things apart.

1170
01:41:58,027 --> 01:41:59,250
A couple of more seconds...

1171
01:41:59,341 --> 01:42:00,805
you'll see her opening.

1172
01:42:01,266 --> 01:42:02,470
Any blow-back?

1173
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:03,513
Big-time.

1174
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:05,197
But I think we can take it.

1175
01:42:05,227 --> 01:42:06,321
Good...

1176
01:42:07,143 --> 01:42:08,879
Because I really
like being alive.

1177
01:42:09,751 --> 01:42:11,004
So do I.

1178
01:42:34,543 --> 01:42:35,847
Clark.

1179
01:42:41,804 --> 01:42:43,067
I take it back...

1180
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,163
I wanna die.

1181
01:42:49,285 --> 01:42:51,601
Man, my toes hurt.

1182
01:42:52,253 --> 01:42:55,132
I don't even understand the
physics of how my toes hurt.

1183
01:42:56,687 --> 01:42:58,090
Children.

1184
01:42:58,341 --> 01:42:59,956
I work with children.

1185
01:43:03,035 --> 01:43:05,492
Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1186
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:18,058
I am the end of worlds.

1187
01:43:19,382 --> 01:43:21,007
Who are you,

1188
01:43:21,037 --> 01:43:22,441
to defy me?

1189
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,041
This world...

1190
01:43:26,071 --> 01:43:27,776
...is my right!

1191
01:43:27,907 --> 01:43:29,752
You will never...

1192
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:50,802
No!

1193
01:43:50,842 --> 01:43:52,287
This cannot be...

1194
01:43:52,457 --> 01:43:54,393
Recognize that smell?

1195
01:43:56,138 --> 01:43:57,341
Fear.

1196
01:44:00,882 --> 01:44:02,917
No! Leave me!

1197
01:44:06,147 --> 01:44:07,812
Get off me!

1198
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:09,236
I command you!

1199
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:11,582
No!

1200
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,855
No...

1201
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:18,773
I'll kill you!

1202
01:44:18,843 --> 01:44:20,920
I'll kill you all!

1203
01:44:46,152 --> 01:44:47,517
Booyah!

1204
01:44:50,547 --> 01:44:59,547
P_S_A_G_M_E_N_O.COM

1205
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:14,294
Glad I didn't miss this.

1206
01:45:15,577 --> 01:45:17,031
So am I.

1207
01:45:17,553 --> 01:45:18,616
Yeah.

1208
01:45:18,656 --> 01:45:20,191
Now she's glad.

1209
01:45:50,869 --> 01:45:52,414
Thank you, Bruce.

1210
01:45:52,925 --> 01:45:54,219
Not enough for what you did.

1211
01:45:54,249 --> 01:45:56,194
I did a mistake.

1212
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,478
That's all.

1213
01:46:06,675 --> 01:46:08,435
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1214
01:46:09,643 --> 01:46:11,138
I bought the bank.

1215
01:46:13,726 --> 01:46:14,748
The whole bank?

1216
01:46:14,778 --> 01:46:16,192
Slow your reflex with me.

1217
01:46:16,232 --> 01:46:17,416
I'm old.

1218
01:46:21,276 --> 01:46:22,370
What?

1219
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,460
It's actually the,

1220
01:46:23,473 --> 01:46:25,610
worst job you can
get in a crime lab.

1221
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:26,452
But, uh...

1222
01:46:26,482 --> 01:46:27,886
My foot's in the door.

1223
01:46:28,267 --> 01:46:31,226
Yeah. I got a recommendation
from a friend.

1224
01:46:31,256 --> 01:46:32,911
This is like a "job" job?

1225
01:46:33,543 --> 01:46:34,765
"Job" job.

1226
01:46:38,537 --> 01:46:39,891
Look at you go!

1227
01:46:58,083 --> 01:46:59,197
Darkness.

1228
01:46:59,367 --> 01:47:01,091
The truest darkness...

1229
01:47:01,122 --> 01:47:03,268
...is not the
absence of light.

1230
01:47:05,184 --> 01:47:06,869
It is the conviction
that the light...

1231
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:08,393
...will never return.

1232
01:47:09,275 --> 01:47:11,632
Must be 150 feet.

1233
01:47:11,773 --> 01:47:12,856
Must be.

1234
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,935
Big round table.

1235
01:47:16,276 --> 01:47:17,489
Six chairs.

1236
01:47:17,529 --> 01:47:18,532
Right there.

1237
01:47:19,626 --> 01:47:20,848
With room for more.

1238
01:47:23,507 --> 01:47:25,031
With room for more.

1239
01:47:26,827 --> 01:47:29,273
But the light always returns...

1240
01:47:29,413 --> 01:47:31,359
...to show us
things familiar.

1241
01:47:32,864 --> 01:47:34,016
Home.

1242
01:47:34,468 --> 01:47:35,641
Family.

1243
01:47:37,407 --> 01:47:39,583
And things entirely new.

1244
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:42,130
Or long overlooked.

1245
01:47:47,295 --> 01:47:49,953
It shows us new possibilities...

1246
01:47:49,983 --> 01:47:52,370
And challenges us
to pursue them.

1247
01:47:53,773 --> 01:47:55,930
Yeah. And Johnny Menasco
runs the whole thing.

1248
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,896
I mean, he did the
Bilbao job 2 years ago.

1249
01:47:57,926 --> 01:47:59,671
As are all the
storage in Croydon.

1250
01:47:59,712 --> 01:48:01,436
- The Belgian.
- Right, yeah. The Belgian.

1251
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:04,876
This time, the light
shone on the heroes.

1252
01:48:05,017 --> 01:48:06,180
Coming out of the shadows

1253
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:08,667
to tell us we won't
be alone again.

1254
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:13,089
Our darkness was deep...

1255
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,406
...and seemed to
swallow all hope.

1256
01:48:16,008 --> 01:48:18,887
But these heroes were
here the whole time.

1257
01:48:19,469 --> 01:48:22,186
To remind us that hope is real.

1258
01:48:22,878 --> 01:48:24,663
That you can see it.

1259
01:48:29,387 --> 01:48:31,583
All you have to do is look...

1260
01:48:34,391 --> 01:48:35,916
Up in the sky...

1261
01:49:34,424 --> 01:49:36,822
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate you doing this.

1262
01:49:37,223 --> 01:49:38,847
I don't know, Barry.

1263
01:49:39,278 --> 01:49:40,422
I'm curious myself.

1264
01:49:40,452 --> 01:49:42,518
Yeah. And it's not like a
competition, you know?

1265
01:49:42,558 --> 01:49:43,671
Well, it...

1266
01:49:43,701 --> 01:49:44,701
It is a competition.

1267
01:49:44,705 --> 01:49:48,114
But it's not like a macho-
measuring thing.

1268
01:49:48,144 --> 01:49:49,538
But if I win, you're
off the team.

1269
01:49:55,636 --> 01:49:57,040
No...

1270
01:49:58,493 --> 01:49:59,737
If I win...

1271
01:50:00,209 --> 01:50:03,519
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to "brunch"...?

1272
01:50:03,559 --> 01:50:05,835
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1273
01:50:06,276 --> 01:50:07,771
I feel stung by that.

1274
01:50:09,476 --> 01:50:11,261
Okay.
But if I win, I get to tell everyone.

1275
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:12,374
Deal.

1276
01:50:13,286 --> 01:50:14,530
Which coast?

1277
01:50:15,252 --> 01:50:16,948
You know, I've never
seen the pacific.

1278
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:20,638
Which is that way, because...

1279
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:23,055
The sun, and it's...

1280
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:41,085
