1
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,182
I'll take this.

2
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:41,221
Merci.

3
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,066
Sorry about all the...

4
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,695
Oh, don't be stupid.
You did us a favor.

5
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:07,140
What are we gonna do with him?

6
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:08,674
Ah, we'll take care of it.

7
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,588
The-the, uh, tracking chip.

8
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,880
Already disabled.

9
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:19,143
Sit down and relax,
Petit Hughie.

10
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:33,114
Oi, where you think
you're going?

11
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,209
I'm going home.
I need clothes.

12
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,363
We'll get you clothes.

13
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,531
I want my clothes.

14
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,780
I'll be right back.

15
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:43,332
You are, perhaps...
in a state of shock, mon ami.

16
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,747
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

17
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,906
You can't just piss off.

18
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,633
I need to go home.

19
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,342
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

20
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,474
Wait, what? No.

21
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,221
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

22
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,937
Good lad.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,070
Translucent's skin,
it won't burn off.

24
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,861
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

25
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:24,526
Nowhere.

26
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:26,655
But we can slow the cunt down
a bit.

27
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,133
Come on in.

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,470
Ms. Stillwell. Hello.

29
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:29,774
Please sit.

30
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:41,857
Starlight, that video.

31
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:43,713
- Ms. Stillwell, please.
- No, no. Let me finish.

32
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,737
The date-rape girl? The victim?

33
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:48,492
She saw that video on YouTube

34
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,164
and she came forward
to thank you.

35
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:53,913
She could not have been
more effusive.

36
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:58,916
That's... that's good, right?

37
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,131
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

38
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:05,433
You have a huge boost with men...
for the ass-kicking, of course...

39
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:08,048
but with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

40
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,005
16 points with females 18 to 49,

41
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,925
even in the liberal
retreat jurisdictions

42
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:15,475
like New York and San Francisco.

43
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,269
- I don't know what to say.
- You just have to enjoy this.

44
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:22,404
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

45
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:24,403
because it is
a partnership, after all.

46
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,485
- This is Seth and Evan from marketing.
- Hi.

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,341
They have some brilliant ideas
on how to capitalize

48
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,775
on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

49
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,946
- Okay. So...
- Yeah.

50
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:36,995
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

51
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,081
is chosen for The Seven.

52
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,746
Destiny knocks
on the girl next door's door,

53
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,755
and she answers,
to fight for truth and justice

54
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,718
- side by side with her heroes.
- The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

55
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,931
It's got worms. Muggers
and rapists and thieves, oh, my.

56
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,271
Dorothy is not
in Kansas anymore.

57
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:56,727
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked
around something fierce.

58
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,859
- Kicked while she's down.
- So what does she do? Does she cry in her milk?

59
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:01,727
- Does she quit?
- No way!

60
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:04,154
She adapts! She transforms!

61
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:05,587
Embraces her feminine strengths.

62
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,796
Good-bye, Yellow Brick Road...

63
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,240
And hello, Starlight.

64
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,124
I can't wear that.

65
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:18,834
What?

66
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:20,424
Why not? It's beautiful.

67
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,129
Seriously?

68
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,509
I-It's just...

69
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,718
It's not me.

70
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,338
I designed Homelander's suit.

71
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:32,506
- This isn't my first rodeo.
- You're wrong.

72
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:35,385
It's totally you. It's bold,
it's brave, it's feminist.

73
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,812
- How is that feminist?
- Empowering.

74
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:40,311
It says you're confident
in your own skin,

75
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,734
and you're not afraid
to show it.

76
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:44,442
Most importantly,
it tells the story.

77
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:48,903
Of your transformation, of...
of what you're going through.

78
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:53,486
How exactly do you know what
I'm going through, exactly?

79
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,744
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,156
I-I appreciate the effort,

81
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:02,205
I really do,
but I'm fine with my old outfit.

82
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:04,091
- We're not.
- Excuse me?

83
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:07,298
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

84
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,759
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,760
It's my body.

86
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:14,762
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

87
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,765
That is true. You do.

88
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:20,848
You just won't be doing it
in The Seven,

89
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,904
unless it is wrapped in that.

90
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,105
Tomorrow,
A-Train versus Shockwave.

91
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,906
The race of the century.

92
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,829
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

93
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,449
as the fastest man alive?

94
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,655
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

95
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,916
at the hands of this
fresh-faced young challenger?

96
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,538
Just wait here, okay?

97
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:45,979
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,

98
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,633
the race of the century.

99
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,421
Well, Shockwave...

100
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,799
Hughie?

101
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,433
Oh, hey, Dad.

102
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,719
Wh... look at the,

103
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,075
- you-you've, this is...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about this.

104
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,639
I just, I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

105
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,056
for a while now, so...

106
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,653
What, are you going somewhere?

107
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,992
- Yeah. For a while.
- Where?

108
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:37,157
Uh, I don't know.

109
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:39,987
Well, now,
you're scaring me, Hugh.

110
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,913
All right, now,
I-I spoke to Dr. Feldman...

111
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,334
- My pediatrician?
- He's still your doctor.

112
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,393
And he's given me the name of
someone you can-you can talk to.

113
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,997
Help you, you know,
get back to normal.

114
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,844
There's no normal anymore.

115
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,721
What do you mean,
there's... Look.

116
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,718
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

117
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,891
We-We've always told
each other everything.

118
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,309
- Talk to me.
- Stop it.

119
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,427
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Stop it.

120
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,515
I have never told you
everything.

121
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,901
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

122
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,149
staring at the TV
like we're already dead.

123
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,823
How much I fucking hate
Pizza Rolls.

124
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,662
- No, you love Pizza Rolls.
- When I was seven!

125
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,366
I am not seven.

126
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:37,224
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:57,986 --> 00:09:59,946
My father was bipolar.

128
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,365
One night, when I was ten,

129
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,119
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

130
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,522
- Give him that work!
- Kick his ass!

131
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,067
Yo!

132
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,575
What the hell
is wrong with y'all?

133
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:48,117
This is not
what we do here, gentlemen.

134
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,621
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

135
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:55,094
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

136
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,457
Apologies, Mr. Milk. No, sir.

137
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:59,053
Nuh-uh, me, neither, Mr. Milk.

138
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,400
Which means
that you have cut in line

139
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,384
in front of everybody else
in here.

140
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,256
What else does it mean?
Come on, spit it out.

141
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,155
Means that we're disrespecting
all the other niggas...

142
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,389
Excuse me?

143
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,851
All our fellow brothers
in the unit.

144
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:11,482
Now, you both know how to write

145
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:13,728
in the English language
in a passable fashion.

146
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,748
I know that, 'cause I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

147
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:18,572
- Yes, sir.
- Then please, place your John Hancocks on my board.

148
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,069
Yes sir, Mr. Milk. Thank you.

149
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:23,531
At the bottom of the list.

150
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:32,664
Oh, hell nah.

151
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,876
What the fuck do you want?

152
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,037
What, I can't visit me old mate?

153
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,245
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

154
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,666
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

155
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,045
Bring it in.

156
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:46,195
Look, if it's all the same,
let's just cut the small talk.

157
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,889
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

158
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:51,311
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

159
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,980
Why are you here?

160
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:59,187
All right.

161
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,902
- How'd you like to come back, have another go?
- Mm-mm.

162
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:04,454
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

163
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:08,028
I don't want to know nothing
about nothing.

164
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,575
I'm a happy man now.
Life is good,

165
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,290
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Oh, yeah? How is Monique?

166
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,291
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

167
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,793
I can't do that
to her again, man.

168
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:21,955
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

169
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:23,255
Yeah, so I can see.

170
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,553
Don't make me come out there!

171
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:31,055
Well, this is God's work.

172
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:35,308
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

173
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,942
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

174
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,020
we were into some bad shit, man.

175
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:43,855
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

176
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,989
If I'm gonna make a difference,

177
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,701
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

178
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:52,452
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

179
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:53,914
Whereas you?

180
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,870
You're just a motherfucker.

181
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,090
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

182
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,756
...'cause we just dusted a Supe.

183
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:12,684
Bullshit.

184
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,313
Translucent.

185
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,438
What the f...

186
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,861
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

187
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:23,648
How the hell did you do it?

188
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:27,282
Well...

189
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,280
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

190
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:35,204
Boom. Claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

191
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:39,035
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

192
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,882
Spilled the beans in a big way.

193
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,457
Now, we play this right,

194
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,882
we could shake up
the whole hornets' nest,

195
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:47,881
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

196
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,014
Mm-hmm.

197
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:51,551
You mean do Homelander?

198
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:56,813
This is about Becca, isn't it?

199
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,390
It's always about Becca
with you.

200
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,936
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

201
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,529
It'll be different this go,
all right?

202
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,820
None of that
"secrets and lies" bollocks.

203
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:13,244
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

204
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,333
I swear to God.

205
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,825
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

206
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,285
'Cause I can't work
with that motherfucker.

207
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,796
Frenchie?
No, I ain't seen him in years.

208
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,509
M.M., you're the only bloke
I can trust.

209
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,849
Since when
have you ever trusted anybody?

210
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,059
Oh, fuck.

211
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,162
Senator Calhoun,
you've gone on the record

212
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:42,830
- against superheroes in the military.
- Who's a good boy?

213
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:44,332
- Who's a good boy?
- Why change your tune?

214
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,976
No one's changing their tune.

215
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,864
Uh, it's just I realized that

216
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,651
it's an issue that affects all Americans.

217
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:53,591
- Can't you make it... stop?
- It shouldn't be decided by a few congressmen

218
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:54,967
- hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

219
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:56,331
The bill needs to go
to the floor.

220
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:57,368
Oh, okay.

221
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,700
Aw. Aw.

222
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,365
Oh, no. We can't have that...

223
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,673
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

224
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,458
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

225
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:07,463
How?

226
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,804
He's got diamond skin.

227
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,129
He's gonna be fine.

228
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,423
My guys are on it.

229
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,426
All right,
I forgot to give you these.

230
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:14,638
Here.

231
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,888
What is it?

232
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,719
Those are
your new talking points.

233
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:20,644
Now that the military bill
is out of committee,

234
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,274
corporate wants
to sell the shit out of it.

235
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,231
Yes. They do.

236
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:31,238
Hey. Y-You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

237
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,158
and-and I said,
"No. No, no, no.

238
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:35,486
Make it the flag"?
Remember that?

239
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,492
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don't need these.

240
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,494
Okay?

241
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,656
I can sell my way
into the military.

242
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,745
Thank you.

243
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,380
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

244
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:49,548
Mr. Edgar wrote
those personally.

245
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:53,298
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

246
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:55,341
be my guest.

247
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,806
Oh, yes.

248
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,467
Oh, you're a happy boy now, huh?

249
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:02,425
Are you a happy boy?

250
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,822
A rental, you cheap bastard?

251
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:14,839
Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

252
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:17,993
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

253
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,333
And you don't think
this is conspicuous?

254
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,888
Conspicuous? No, I don't think

255
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,042
it's conspicuous.
I think a big black van

256
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,790
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

257
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,053
This is just another truck
on the street.

258
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,298
Bang on time.

259
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,016
Uh, hi.

260
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,518
Hughie.

261
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,190
Smelly motherfucker.

262
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,003
- Butcher, who is this guy?!
- You'll give the game away!

263
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,647
Not until this frog gets
what's coming.

264
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,155
Only thing that is coming

265
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,757
- is me on your mother's titties!
- Let me through at him, bitch!

266
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,260
- Hey!
- We had an agreement about him.

267
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,678
We agreed to put a pin in it,
all right?

268
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,252
- What agreement?
- There was no pin.

269
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,514
I don't trust this French whore.

270
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,498
I am more American than you,

271
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,289
you racist piece of shit!

272
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,144
- Why are they fighting?!
- Nothing. It is water under the bridge.

273
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,668
You tell that
to Mallory's grandkids.

274
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,171
Tell them it's water
under the bridge.

275
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:16,884
- That wasn't my fault, huh?
- Who is Mallory?

276
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,295
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

277
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,442
Shit!

278
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:38,321
Hey, Monique.

279
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:40,663
How you doing, baby?

280
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:43,409
Ooh, I forgot to marinade
the tilapia.

281
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:45,911
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

282
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,044
Okay, how 'bout this?

283
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,671
How about,
on my way home from work,

284
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:53,169
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

285
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,564
some portobello mushrooms, that
pinot that you love so much.

286
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,298
Yeah, baby.

287
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,300
Okay, I-I got to go.

288
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,722
All right, sweetheart.

289
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,809
Baby, I just...

291
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,558
Uh, you're right, you're right.

292
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,059
I love you, too.

293
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,101
Okay. Bye.

294
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,279
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

295
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,789
All right. All right.

296
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:30,248
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

297
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,080
We got a fucking job to do.

298
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,501
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

299
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,585
Get out of here.

300
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,300
Who's this guy?

301
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:40,721
The new lad. Hughie.

302
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,639
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

303
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,967
That's a... nickname?

304
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,473
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

305
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:49,765
- Did-did she?
- So we got

306
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,537
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

307
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,191
- Great job, Butcher.
- Well, it was

308
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:55,819
Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

309
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,275
Oh.

310
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,279
She's home.

311
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,464
That's Popclaw, right?

312
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,658
A-Train's girlfriend?

313
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,829
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

314
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:09,199
Uh, you know the-the rent?

315
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:12,575
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

316
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:13,976
You think her
and A-Train are, uh...

317
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,750
Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

318
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:17,646
Didn't hear nothing about it.
I'm usually up on these things.

319
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,981
According to Translucent,

320
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,215
A-Train knows this bird
inside out.

321
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,427
I'll drop the check off ASAP.

322
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,087
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,545
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

324
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,483
All right.
Let's get the bugs sorted,

325
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,059
see for ourselves.

326
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,735
Where-Where'd you get this shit,
Circuit City?

327
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,657
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

328
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:49,906
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

329
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:53,083
- Eh?
- Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

330
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:56,383
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

331
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:57,686
They probably have one
in every room.

332
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,880
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

333
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,524
not in the toilet. Look,
I just need five minutes inside.

334
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,718
I mean, home service
is my specialty.

335
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,642
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

336
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,484
We got the new router. I'm...

337
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,900
This is-is Hughie.

338
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,769
I'm Gary.

339
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,710
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Oh, well, your manager did.

340
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,824
- He's upgrading the whole building.
- I just saw

341
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,572
my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

342
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:28,323
I've got a work order
right here, ma'am.

343
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:31,156
Only takes a second.

344
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:33,872
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

345
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,503
That-That's a lot.

346
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,330
Okay. Come on in.

347
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,067
The computer's right over here

348
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:47,471
- if you need it.
- Uh, yeah.

349
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,904
I just need
to sign on to your server

350
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,638
in order to download
the service package.

351
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,850
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

352
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,731
We're really big fans. I mean,

353
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:55,977
Terminal Beauty 3...

354
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,149
Whew. Damn.

355
00:20:58,188 --> 00:21:00,568
Oh. Thanks.

356
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,897
Yeah, that one
really came together.

357
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,113
Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

358
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,164
Thank you.

359
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,722
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

360
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:29,008
Let's go.

361
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,691
Hmm.

362
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,571
What is it?

363
00:21:43,608 --> 00:21:45,148
Nothing.

364
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:09,512
This kid is full of surprises.

365
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,591
Okay, ma'am, all done.

366
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,354
Thank you, guys.

367
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,519
Thank you.

368
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,018
Get your John Hancock?

369
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,639
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

370
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,860
Ooh. Excuse me, bud.

371
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:36,867
What, you want a...
autograph or something?

372
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,469
Haven't we met before?

373
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,177
Maybe.

374
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:58,102
I meet a ton of people.

375
00:22:58,141 --> 00:22:59,931
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

376
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,886
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

377
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:04,266
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

378
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,857
You trying to get us killed?

379
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:47,067
Yeah.

380
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,895
I'll be right there.

381
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,743
Look, Translucent's
probably just lurking

382
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,569
around a gynecologist's office
or something.

383
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:56,008
For two days? Come on.

384
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:57,242
I don't get it.

385
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,953
Why is no one concerned
about this?

386
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:01,253
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

387
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:02,787
they panic.

388
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,790
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

389
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,173
- Give 'em hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

390
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,171
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

391
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,173
then that's a direct attack
on the Seven,

392
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,255
which is a direct attack on me.

393
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,694
You've managed
to make this about you

394
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,098
in less than 20 seconds flat.

395
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,947
Hey, I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

396
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,601
So I think
what you mean to say is,

397
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,270
"Gee, thanks, Homelander,

398
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,768
"for showing up out of the blue

399
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,245
and bringing the extra press
to my collar."

400
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,309
Homelander. Maeve.

401
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,645
Captain, you guys
are the real heroes.

402
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,942
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- That's right.

403
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,065
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

404
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:36,283
All right. Sit tight.

405
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,580
Elevators?

406
00:24:46,374 --> 00:24:48,424
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

407
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,589
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

408
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,089
Mr. Edgar
wants us both at the race

409
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:55,842
to roll out
his new talking points.

410
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:56,973
You know this.

411
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,049
I've X-rayed Edgar, you know.

412
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:01,385
He is this close to a coronary.

413
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:03,391
He's got blood like engine oil.

414
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:06,483
And Stillwell,
with that mewling baby...

415
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,309
it's ridiculous.

416
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:10,154
They're just people.

417
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,149
But they snap their fingers
and we jump.

418
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:13,901
Why? Why do we do that?

419
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:16,453
'Cause they sign our checks.

420
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:17,657
Can we just cut to the part

421
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:20,657
where you show up to the race
anyway?

422
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:24,115
See, that's why I love you.

423
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:27,293
You're the only one

424
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:29,251
who tells me the truth.

425
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:39,221
Mm-mm.

426
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,309
It's all over.

427
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,278
It's all over now.

428
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,239
There you go.

429
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,959
Goddamn it.

430
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,180
That was my collar.

431
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,177
Eh, it still is.

432
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:24,139
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

433
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,890
No, that's true.

434
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,432
I got excited.

435
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:28,805
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,691
I'm sure you are.

437
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:31,688
You know the drill.

438
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,149
He shot at us first.

439
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:37,685
Attagirl.

440
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:49,413
The things I let you do to me.

441
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,665
Yeah.

442
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,206
We're not even dating anymore.

443
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:03,087
Fuck.

444
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:13,649
Want me to do the thing?

445
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:16,108
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

446
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:17,938
Okay.

447
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:23,361
That's a good boy.

448
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,204
Mmm.

449
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:39,843
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

450
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,261
Tickles. Tickling.

451
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,217
What's the problem?

452
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:49,313
Shockwave's the problem.

453
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:50,768
What if I lose?

454
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,558
You're not gonna lose.

455
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,732
You're the fastest man alive.

456
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,560
Until I'm not.

457
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,606
You know what Stillwell told me?

458
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:00,149
If I don't win, I'm out.

459
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,912
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in The Seven.

460
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,199
Babe.

461
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:16,711
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

462
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:20,501
Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

463
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:22,966
amps you up something fierce.

464
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,337
Remember last time?

465
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,263
Last time's not gonna
happen again.

466
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:29,432
I'm under control. Uh...

467
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:32,182
You ran through a girl, baby.

468
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:35,444
That's not what
I would call "control."

469
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:38,188
That shit's a slippery slope.

470
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,020
Take it from me.

471
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,026
No, I... I need it.

472
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,898
Honey, I'll still
love you even if you lose.

473
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:47,406
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

474
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:51,118
- Uh...
- I have to win this thing.

475
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,660
I don't want to be
some washed up B-squader.

476
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:56,084
Like me?

477
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,633
No, not like... That's...

478
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,629
I got to go.

479
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:08,715
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

480
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,471
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

481
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,675
What are you talking about?

482
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:18,516
I've been meaning to tell you.

483
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:21,022
Are you kidding me?

484
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:24,315
I have been getting my hair
done, threading my eyebrows,

485
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,240
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

486
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,239
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

487
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,332
in front of the world
as a couple.

488
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:35,118
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

489
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,330
Um...

490
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,383
You did clear it with Stillwell.

491
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,709
Look, our time is gonna come,
I promise,

492
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:47,165
but I got to get
my leverage back first.

493
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,720
Where's the V?

494
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,559
- What the hell is Compound V?
- Sounds like

495
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,273
some kind
of performance enhancer.

496
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,613
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

497
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,899
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

498
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,880
What are you grinning at?

499
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,633
Oh, I don't know, mate.

500
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:32,175
Maybe it's 'cause
The Seven might just be a squad

501
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:34,809
of manky 'roid heads.

502
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,267
Now this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

503
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:38,808
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

504
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,441
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

505
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,519
If we get a bit,
can you work it out?

506
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,333
Oh, I can run
some tests, of course.

507
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,687
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

508
00:30:47,735 --> 00:30:49,275
Amazing idea.

509
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,881
We'll cross that
bridge when we burn it.

510
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:54,115
First of all...

511
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,658
we got to get some.

512
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:23,352
Here's your cover.

513
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:25,975
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

514
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,653
So, uh...

515
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:32,071
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

516
00:31:33,322 --> 00:31:35,572
Yeah.

517
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:37,406
Yeah, that sounds right.

518
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:40,081
I don't know.
I've kind of lost track of time.

519
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:41,751
Talk about a baptism of fire.

520
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:44,329
I'll mic you up here.

521
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,708
So, Translucent, huh?

522
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:52,424
How the fuck
did you pull that off?

523
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,506
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

524
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:59,144
Still. Must have been scary.

525
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,104
You want to know
what's really messed up?

526
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:07,395
Is, uh...

527
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,729
in some ways...

528
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,395
just right in that moment, it...

529
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,864
felt kind of good.

530
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,156
It's written all over your face,
Hughie.

531
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:21,411
What? How can you tell?

532
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:24,423
'Cause I know
how this job makes me feel.

533
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:27,126
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

534
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:28,538
I felt, like, a rush.

535
00:32:28,586 --> 00:32:30,586
I get it.

536
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,509
- Like I felt alive.
- But that rush, Hughie,

537
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,089
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

538
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,345
Everything comes with a price.

539
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:50,565
The last thing
I ever said to Robin...

540
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:55,448
was "Don't you ever
besmirch Billy Joel."

541
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:59,739
That was the last thing
that she heard

542
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:02,083
before she burst into pieces.

543
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,039
And-and I got to live with that
shit for the rest of my life.

544
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:15,631
The price?

545
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:19,136
Whatever it is...

546
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:21,258
I'll pay it.

547
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:31,941
This...
is the Race of the Century.

548
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:36,822
This... is our legacy
and our future.

549
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:39,872
Athletes achieving
at the highest level.

550
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:45,701
This is what we've waited for...
the showdown.

551
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:49,166
These men are extremely
powerful and very, very quick.

552
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,998
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

553
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:54,843
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

554
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

555
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,094
Who will come out on top?
There he stands...

556
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:01,804
six foot one,
but a stature that's such

557
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:03,715
that he's a colossus
for the whole world.

558
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,987
- All right, champ.
- Mmm.

559
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:20,409
You got this?

560
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,197
Yeah.

561
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:24,241
Hey...

562
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:28,365
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

563
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,254
Putting that wind at your back.

564
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,382
Now, you got this?

565
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,299
- I got this.
- That's what

566
00:34:35,337 --> 00:34:36,815
- I'm talking about!
- I got this. Yeah.

567
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,969
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right.

568
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:46,061
Introducing
the newest member of The Seven...

569
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:49,228
Starlight,
accompanied by Black Noir.

570
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,904
I'm tired of

571
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,150
the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

572
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,613
If the people want us
in the armed forces,

573
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:03,164
the people can order Congress
to do it.

574
00:35:03,198 --> 00:35:06,908
Am I right? Yes!

575
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,250
Sorry I'm late.

576
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:20,006
You got room for one more?

577
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:22,089
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

578
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:24,474
Hey, who's ready to see a race?

579
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:27,011
Huh?

580
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:29,016
Let's hear it for my boy
A-Train.

581
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:30,728
All right.

582
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,488
You fucking cocksuckers.

583
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,479
Please remain
standing for the singing

584
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:35,981
of our national anthem.

585
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,359
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

586
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:46,575
Aren't you cute?

587
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:50,247
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

588
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,577
Of course, honey. Take this.

589
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:58,337
Look at you!

590
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:00,419
You really dress the part.

591
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:03,094
It's your old uniform, but
I'm saving up for the new one.

592
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:10,023
Hey, Starlight!

593
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:11,637
Show us your tits!

594
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:13,063
Come on!

595
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:14,652
- Come on!
- Baby!

596
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,020
Damn, baby, you look fine AF!

597
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:20,185
Lean down a little bit more!

598
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:22,074
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

599
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:24,861
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

600
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,365
Kick my ass, Starlight!

601
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,487
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

602
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,615
I like that one much better.

603
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:37,417
- Starlight?
- I need a minute.

604
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,629
- Where's she going?
- Starlight!

605
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,022
Starlight, come here, honey.

606
00:36:41,046 --> 00:36:43,216
Let's make some noise!

607
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,643
Glad you made it.

608
00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:53,272
I had a feeling you might.

609
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:56,978
Remember when used to just
fly off to Paris, like,

610
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,150
- on a whim?
- Yeah, I remember

611
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:00,749
freezing my ass off
across the Atlantic.

612
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:02,534
Yeah, those were good times.

613
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:05,068
Why did we ever break up?

614
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:08,202
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

615
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,290
Oh, come on.

616
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,250
You know...

617
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:19,672
Yeah, kiss her!

618
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:24,166
If I ever really thought

619
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:27,724
- that you'd fallen for someone else...
- Mm.

620
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,049
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

621
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:32,255
- Is that so?
- Yeah, you and me?

622
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:33,596
- Mm.
- We're different.

623
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,270
We're better.

624
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,850
- Together forever.
- Okay, well...

625
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:48,323
Here comes the A-Train.

626
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:51,655
All aboard!

627
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,120
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

628
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:26,145
Ooh!

629
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:28,533
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

630
00:38:31,406 --> 00:38:32,866
Starlight! Starlight!

631
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:34,278
Starlight!

632
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:35,786
Starlight, over here!

633
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:39,705
Annie?

634
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:41,878
I love your new outfit!

635
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,337
Annie? Annie!

636
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:45,668
Annie? Hi!

637
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:48,092
Hughie?

638
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,511
From the bench the other day?

639
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,800
You're, uh...
you're Starlight.

640
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:55,104
That's...
How did I not realize that?

641
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,428
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

642
00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:59,160
Fuckin' hell, Hughie.

643
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:00,703
You know Starlight?

644
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:03,687
Well, Hughie, it was...

645
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,500
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

646
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:08,154
- No, Hughie, we need more time.
- Can I, uh,

647
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,823
buy you an overpriced beer?

648
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,321
You know, if you've-you've...
if you got time.

649
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:17,743
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

650
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:21,156
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

651
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,848
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

652
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:36,596
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

653
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,808
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day....

654
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,559
- Was it three days ago?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:44,151
You just seemed, like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

656
00:39:44,187 --> 00:39:47,017
- And now, it's just...
- Now, I'm a freak.

657
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,475
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

658
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:53,566
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

659
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:55,204
but... not that
you don't have that...

660
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,700
- I'm messing with you.
- Okay.

661
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:04,247
Bad news.

662
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,671
- No V.
- Great. We're fucked.

663
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,420
No, it...

664
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:10,302
It was really nice
to talk to someone

665
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:13,339
who didn't know who I was.

666
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:18,183
Once you're behind the scenes,
it's...

667
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:21,561
- it's different.
- Like how?

668
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,310
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

669
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:28,937
I think they just want you
to look like one.

670
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:39,491
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

671
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:42,334
about how much
you hated your job, you meant...

672
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,001
you meant this job?

673
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,377
Then, um...

674
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:54,087
...just quit.

675
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:55,762
Just walk away.

676
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,891
I mean,
you got nothing to prove.

677
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:05,517
I should probably get back,

678
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,730
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

679
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,321
- So...
- Yeah, totally. Um...

680
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:13,437
listen, Annie... Starlight.

681
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,985
- What do you, uh...?
- Annie.

682
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:18,778
Um, this is insane, but, uh...

683
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:20,164
I know you're you
and everything,

684
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,450
but if you ever
just wanted to...

685
00:41:22,494 --> 00:41:24,334
you know, get...

686
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:26,371
Would you like my number?

687
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,671
Yeah. Yeah, that's-that's, uh...

688
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,673
that's what I was asking.

689
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:36,925
- Okay.
- Do I call you,

690
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,028
- or do I just commit a crime?
- Probably committing a crime

691
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:40,972
would get me
to you quicker, so...

692
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:43,852
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

693
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,690
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,937
here comes Shockwave.

695
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,285
You all right?

696
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:06,827
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

697
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:09,212
I'm fast, baby.
Like, how I roll, you know?

698
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:11,209
You look wired as hell.

699
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:13,551
Well, it's just Mom's, uh...
Her spirit

700
00:42:13,587 --> 00:42:15,565
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

701
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:17,839
I've got eyes on A-Train.

702
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:19,183
He's totally jacked.

703
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,717
He must've shot up the V.

704
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:23,261
We missed it, boys.

705
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,576
I'm out of here.
I'll check in later.

706
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:47,748
Where the hell you going?

707
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:49,208
Just gonna see about a girl.

708
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:50,537
Ladies and gentlemen,

709
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:54,042
please turn your attention
to the track.

710
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:29,407
Please, clear the track.

711
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:34,129
Set.

712
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:50,182
Yes!

713
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,935
He's done it again!

714
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:54,517
A-Train wins!

715
00:43:54,563 --> 00:43:56,063
A new world record for A-Train.

716
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:58,476
They say lightning
doesn't strike twice.

717
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:02,529
The world belongs to A-Train.

718
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:06,071
A-Train wins.

719
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:07,486
A-Train wins!

720
00:44:07,534 --> 00:44:11,004
Stunning!
Absolutely stunning.

721
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,710
So, how the hell
do you know Starlight?

722
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:20,883
I don't really know her
know her.

723
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:23,012
Just, uh...

724
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:25,549
we met on a park bench.

725
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:28,054
Huh. You get her number?

726
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,976
Yeah.

727
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:35,938
Hughie?

728
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:39,189
Uh, yeah. Got it.

729
00:44:39,232 --> 00:44:40,442
Good.

730
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:47,532
M.M.

731
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:50,704
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

732
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:52,513
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

733
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,265
That's exactly what I'm saying.

734
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:55,709
Get over here now.

735
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:59,499
Well,
you know what? Shockwave ran

736
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:01,424
a good, clean race,
but, uh, there can only be

737
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:03,423
one fastest man in the world,

738
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:05,215
and that's the A-Train, baby!

739
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:07,088
- Yes, baby.
- A-Train,

740
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:09,965
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

741
00:45:10,013 --> 00:45:12,023
Uh... well, you know me.

742
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:14,728
I'm always in the game,

743
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:17,058
but I'm too fast to catch.

744
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:20,193
I'm open to offers,
though, ladies.

745
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:21,781
There's plenty to go around.

746
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:23,002
A-Train, how have you managed

747
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:24,526
to stay on top all this time?

748
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:26,529
What's your secret?

749
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:29,531
Secret? There's no secret.

750
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:32,294
It's just about discipline
and training

751
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,657
and keeping your head
in the game, staying focused.

752
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,810
Fucking hell.

753
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:56,058
You said it.

754
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:57,691
She's been at it for an hour.

755
00:45:57,727 --> 00:45:59,597
Come and get me!

756
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:02,186
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

757
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:04,112
Okay.

758
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,440
You see that red case
over there?

759
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,145
I've been around long enough
to know

760
00:46:07,195 --> 00:46:08,855
a fix kit when I see one.

761
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:12,325
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

762
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,037
So she's got experience.

763
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:15,596
I figured if you wait around
long enough,

764
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,330
two plus two equals nasty.

765
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:19,252
Sherlock fucking Homie.

766
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,040
Now admit it.

767
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:24,464
This beats babysitting
delinquents any day, don't it?

768
00:46:24,504 --> 00:46:27,514
Fuck...

769
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,280
Oh.

770
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:52,655
- Hey, Popclaw.
- Mr. Lutz. Um...

771
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:55,199
- house call?
- I'm just here for the rent.

772
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:57,203
The rent you said you would pay?

773
00:46:57,245 --> 00:46:59,075
You should come in.

774
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:01,542
You can wait there if you want,

775
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,728
but it's gonna take me a few
minutes to write the check.

776
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:05,712
I don't bite.

777
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:06,924
Unless you want me to.

778
00:47:06,963 --> 00:47:08,843
That was a joke, Alek.

779
00:47:08,882 --> 00:47:11,012
- Oh.
- Alek, right?

780
00:47:11,051 --> 00:47:12,721
Okay, let's get that check.

781
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:15,681
You want a drink, Alek,
while you wait?

782
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:18,682
- You prefer Alek or Alexander?
- Alek.

783
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,845
It's actually short
for, uh, Aleksy.

784
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:22,564
I like that.

785
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:24,314
Sounds more exotic.

786
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:25,815
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

787
00:47:32,822 --> 00:47:34,822
Like what you see?

788
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:36,736
Huh? No.

789
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:37,825
Yes.

790
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:40,619
I mean, it's... lovely.

791
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:42,083
It's okay.

792
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:44,753
A lot of guys
have a superhero fantasy.

793
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:47,303
Uh...

794
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:48,877
I-I'm sorry?

795
00:47:48,922 --> 00:47:52,092
I mean, I... I mean...

796
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,059
- You know...
- Hmm.

797
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
...there is a world

798
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:04,153
where we could come...

799
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:09,566
...to an understanding.

800
00:48:13,488 --> 00:48:17,118
Stop! In the name of the law.

801
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:18,538
Oh, no. Popclaw has caught me.

802
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:25,083
I am gonna sit right here

803
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,625
until the cops come.

804
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:29,549
You're not a cat burglar.

805
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:32,547
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

806
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:36,890
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

807
00:48:36,928 --> 00:48:38,388
Say it!

808
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:39,657
I'm a filthy pig

809
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,021
who likes to eat ass.

810
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:43,137
Stay still.

811
00:48:43,184 --> 00:48:45,314
You like to eat ass?

812
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:55,464
- He can't breathe.
- No, no, wait. Wait, wait.

813
00:48:55,488 --> 00:48:58,128
Hold on. Hey, there.
Hey, there. Not so fast.

814
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:30,105
Oh, my...

815
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:36,526
You let that guy die.

816
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:38,281
And he didn't do anything wrong.

817
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:39,413
He was dead already.

818
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:40,739
That's bullshit.

819
00:49:40,783 --> 00:49:42,543
So you can cross a street,

820
00:49:42,577 --> 00:49:44,747
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

821
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:46,787
like some Supe, can you?

822
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:49,502
And even if
you had've got there,

823
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:51,922
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

824
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:55,551
Now we got her
right where we want her.

825
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,470
What? What?
What are you talking about?

826
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:59,508
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

827
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:02,602
the one weakness they all got.

828
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,059
Their reputations.

829
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:10,102
Come on, Frenchie.

830
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:19,572
Like you said.

831
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:22,584
Whatever the price,
you'll pay it.

832
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:24,617
Right?

833
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:34,127
Easy. Easy.

834
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,840
We ain't here to hurt you.

835
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,600
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

836
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,142
And all you got to do

837
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:54,266
is tell us everything you know
about this.

838
00:50:55,316 --> 00:50:57,526
Who are you?

839
00:51:00,029 --> 00:51:03,829
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

840
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:07,446
No, no, not fire. Water.

841
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:09,995
Just ask my little guppy here.

842
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,541
You can show her.

843
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,717
Well, a very good friend of mine

844
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:21,217
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

845
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:23,799
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom

846
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:25,175
of the harbor.

847
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,233
Go ahead, don't be shy.

848
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:40,242
Oh! Jesus Christ.

849
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:41,608
Is that Translucent?

850
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:43,824
Still think we got nothing
to worry about?

851
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:46,155
How did they even get through
his skin?

852
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,160
What kind of maniac...

853
00:51:48,202 --> 00:51:51,002
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

854
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,039
Smart, actually.

855
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:57,173
Very smart.

856
00:51:57,211 --> 00:52:01,511
Hey, Deep,
what can't I see through?

857
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:04,049
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

858
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:06,103
And what's the box made of,
Deep?

859
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:12,265
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

860
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,020
They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

861
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,863
what's left of him...
eventually.

862
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:20,069
So they were just buying time.

863
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:21,899
Why do you say that?

864
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:24,074
I'm so glad you asked.

865
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:38,632
Whoever it was...

866
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:41,089
they just declared war.
