of the steroid use,

6
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,344

I've been good for the past
two months--good--

10

but instead of giving
me back the hood,

11
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,652
you've had Cisco make
me a new suit.

pushing Vertigo.

13

About midway down,
there's an alley.

Now, that's where Anatoly Kknyazev
has been making his drop.

20
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:44,163
He is not
a physical threat,

21
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,574
but the two men who
will be with him are.

22
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:47,942
I've been to this market,
a lot of civilians there.

23
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,744
Hopefully not
in the alley.

24
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:52,013
We're gonna pin them in,
take them out clean and fast.

25
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:54,148
- Any questions?
- This group's a little light

26

to take on 3 Bratvas.

27
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:58,152
Well, Diaz has God knows
how much of the force under his control,

28
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:00,087
including Captain Hill.

29
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,456
The only cops I'm sure I can trust
are here in this van.

30
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,759
Still, be nice to
have some backup.

31

We're covered.
Trust me.

32

All right.
Two minutes out.

Aha. Tricky, tricky,

41

Ok. Good. Now that
we are alone,

42
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,900
I know this might not
exactly be the right time--

you understand that I'm gonna be
punching people

44

- Yes, but it's been about a week

45
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,772
since you decided that you're not giving
John the hood back,

46
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:54,075
and I was just wondering when you were
planning on talking to him about that.

the right moment.

00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:19,206
You helped build it.
I don't understand

156
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,644
why it matters what
somebody's wearing.

157
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,646
I guess it doesn't.

158
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,984
Uh...

159
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:32,586
That's the moment
you were waiting for, that one?

160
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,989
At least now
he knows.

161
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:38,926
<font color="#FF5500">[Sighs]</font>

162
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:42,062
John's an adult, Felicity.
He'll be fine.

163
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,797
Hope so.

164
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:50,938
Hey, pal. Get your
butt off my car.

165
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,241
You eat like crap,
officer.

166
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,442
Freeze!

167
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:57,411
I heard about you.

168
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:59,146
You're real brash.

169
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:02,249
You got to show everybody
how tough you are, huh?

170
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:05,419
Poking around where you
don't belong.

171
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,854
Get your hands up.

172
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:09,790
Funny thing about
that, though.

173
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,526
You always end up
pissing off the wrong guy.

174
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,527
<font color="#FF5500">[Muted gunshots]</font>

175
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,496
<font color="#FF5500">[Thud]</font>

176
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,898
You didn't want to
torture him a bit,

177
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
you know, maybe slit
his throat?

178
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:23,304
What happened to all that Russian
vengeance I heard so much about?

179
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:25,372
Is new suit.

180
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:30,511
His dead body
send good message to other police.

181
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:34,715
That's right. They're
all on borrowed time.

182
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,130
Still no suspects in the death
of Officer Hurst,

183
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,503
a 6-year veteran
with the SCPD

184
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,140
found dead last night under
mysterious circumstances...

185
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,242
Not so mysterious if
you're Ricardo Diaz.

186
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,144
Need to contact Dinah
and have her sequester

187
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:53,979
the other officers involved
in arresting Anatoly.

188
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,580
What about your
D.A. friend?

189
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,215
Any idea how Diaz
flipped him?

190
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,351
<b><font color="#FF0080">Felicity:</font></b> I'm guessing
cold, hard cash.

191
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,420
- Cash he took from the city?
- Should all be dried up by now.

192
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,355
- So he has another source.
- Well, according to Curtis,

193
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,824
Diaz is involved in an extensive
Vertigo operation,

194
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,993
and if my math is right--and it
definitely is--

195
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,128
he'll be pulling in at least
a million a day.

196
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,498
So we take out his Vertigo stash,
we kill his cash supply.

197
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,867
Unless he's got a rich aunt somewhere,
yeah, that'll work.

198
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,036
Right. So I'll check in
with Lyla,

199
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,738
see if A.R.G.U.S. can
give us any information

200
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,741
on this Vertigo operation that
can help us.

201
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:26,945
Yeah, that'd be great!
Thanks, John!

202
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,348
- That was unbearable.
- He was fine.

203
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,083
The fuming, the standing
in the corner--

204
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,617
that was--
that was fine?

205
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,219
John is not gonna
get bent out of shape

206
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,787
over a uniform.

207
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,057
He's a soldier, Oliver.

208
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,359
Look. I get what
you're saying,

209
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,727
that this is
not like John,

210
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,961
but you have to see
what he's not saying.

211
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,396
He's upset.

212
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,031
Then he's gonna
have to get over it.

213
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,632
This is not
our first fight.

214
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,368
Well, if you don't want
it to be your last,

215
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,902
you should probably
say something.

216
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,338
- Like what?
- Something to ease the pain.

217
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,407
<font color="#FF5500">[Sighs]</font>

218
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,510
We need to know more
about Diaz's Vertigo operation.

219
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,612
I need to get to city hall
and talk some sense

220
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,648
into Hill and Armand
before somebody else gets killed.

221
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:06,985
Yeah.

222
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,893
Think I found
a secure location.

223
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,428
To sequester the clean cops?
I'll come with.

224
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,096
Oh, no, Curtis.
I'm the one who brought

225
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,664
these guys
into the fight against Diaz.

226
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,166
I'm the reason he's
retaliating against them.

227
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,667
This is all on me.

228
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,537
Don't be all
Oliver Queen on me now.

229
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,006
If we have to take out Diaz, there's
gonna be casualties,

230
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,242
and they're not gonna
be your fault, Dinah.

231
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,344
No, they're not because
I'm going to make sure

232
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,678
there are no more
casualties.

233
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,447
We're gonna
make sure.

234
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,149
I'm gonna bring cops
to a secure location

235
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,684
nobody knows about except
my good friend Curtis?

236
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,420
I'll be
your tech guy.

237
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,955
Look. I don't like
the idea of you doing this

238
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,624
without backup.

239
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,792
That, or you want to
spend some quality time

240
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,660
with your new boyfriend?

241
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,629
We've only been on 3 dates,
but, yeah, he's cute,

242
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,130
and I don't want him
to get murdered, so sue me.

243
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:57,102
- Fine. Let's go, lover boy.
- Yes!

244
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,037
This is everything
A.R.G.U.S. could find

245
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,239
on the Vertigo trade
in Star City.

246
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:05,644
Yeah, thanks.

247
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,714
Ah-ah-ah.
It's not free.

248
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:13,185
- I need Intel in return.
- What kind of Intel?

249
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:15,654
The kind where you tell me what's
going on with you.

250
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,696
Lyla, you know
what's going on.

251
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:28,099
I'm frustrated that
Oliver strung me along for so long.

252
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,871
Being
the Green Arrow...

253
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,340
You know what
that meant to me.

254
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:39,578
But you save the city
every night as Spartan.

255
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,313
It's not like you
to care this much

256
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,315
about a title
or a hood.

257
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,083
Oliver made
a similar point.

258
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,252
- But?
- But I don't know.

259
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,858
I just don't know.

260
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,428
This is bothering me way more
than I expected.

261
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,764
I think you owe it
to yourself

262
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,133
and to your partnership
with Oliver

263
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,302
to figure out why.

264
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,210
Thank you both
for coming.

265
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,712
I have to say, Mr. Mayor,
I'm more than

266
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,113
a little uncomfortable
meeting with you

267
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,781
without your attorney
present.

268
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,717
Well, it's not
about the case, Sam.

269
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,919
It's about the two
of you working for Ricardo Diaz.

270
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,421
Who? I'm not sure I've
ever heard that name--

271
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:26,825
You're smarter
than this.

272
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:29,027
You're better than this.

273
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,764
Both of you are
better than this.

274
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,766
Talk to me.

275
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:41,206
Less than 24 hours
after you promoted me

276
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,174
to take over
Pike's command,

277
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,943
I got an e-mail--

278
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,811
surveillance photos
of my niece,

279
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,446
my father,
and my sister.

280
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,915
So he found a way
to apply pressure.

281
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,885
- Yeah.
- Ok.

282
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:58,757
My boy has cancer,
leukemia, stage IV.

283
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,258
Even with
the city's insurance,

284
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,928
we couldn't afford
the treatments.

285
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,263
- I needed Diaz's money.
- All right.

286
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,499
We can protect
your family.

287
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,501
We can pay for your
son's treatments.

288
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,603
- The city--
- Is bankrupt,

289
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,773
and the idea of you
protecting anyone is a joke.

290
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,943
The whole force is
under Diaz's thumb,

291
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,880
or were you offering
your protection as the Green Arrow?

292
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:23,982
If I was the Green Arrow...

293
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,987
I don't think you'd want to
be in this room right now.

294
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:32,824
I don't think
either of you would.

295
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,826
Are we done here?

296
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,268
You are.

297
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,537
You're both fired
effective immediately.

298
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,038
You can't do that.

299
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,140
If you work for him,

300
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,076
then you don't work for me.

301
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,980
Get out.

302
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:03,822
I know you're
the Green Arrow,

303
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,292
but this is unlike anything you've
ever gone up against.

304
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:08,827
Diaz has already
beat you,

305
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,029
and you don't
even know it.

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,608
I wouldn't call the death of a respected
SCPD officer exciting.

310
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,378
It is when you've been sitting
on the couch all day.

311
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,846
Well, no one's
holding you prisoner.

312
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,247
Why don't you get out?
Go get some sun maybe.

313
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,449
No. Sounds boring.
Helping you

314
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:35,654
with your Diaz situation,
now, that sounds interesting to me.

315
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,956
I'm guessing the death
of that cop wasn't exactly

316
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,025
random, though, was it?

317
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,861
You know something
about that?

318
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,529
I know Diaz,
and he's not gonna stop

319
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,131
at one officer.

320
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,932
Yeah. We figured that.

321
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:49,968
We sequestered the rest.
They're safe.

322
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,436
Safe where, though?

323
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,605
Heh.

324
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,707
How do you expect me
to be like Laurel

325
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,242
when you won't let me
act like her?

326
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:58,743
You want to act
like Laurel?

327
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:00,245
Why don't you do
something good, huh?

328
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:01,913
Get a job.
Help this city.

329
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:04,382
Never had a real job
in my whole life.

330
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,217
I don't even think
I know how to write a resume.

331
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:07,886
You don't need to
write a resume.

332
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,055
You're Laurel Lance,
remember?

333
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,757
How well did I do
in law school?

334
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,559
Wait here.

335

Maybe you could start right here.

338
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,309
You want to
home law-school me?

339
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,944
Beats sitting around
on the couch, doesn't it?

340
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,846
I mean, who knows?
You could give it a shot.

341
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:38,450
You might just enjoy
doing something good for a change.

342

Hey. How did it--oh.
I can tell by the look on your face.

344
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:53,431
Won't even ask.

345

Would you please give
me some good news?

346
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:58,136
Well, Lyla clued us in on one of Diaz's
suppliers--Marshall Katz.

347
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,771
I'm running a location
on him now.

348
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,173

- Yeah.

- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,618
Thanks for grabbing
that Intel from Lyla.

352
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,353
Oh, no problem.

353
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:19,958
About the hood.
I'd like to apologize.

354
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,196
Oliver...It's just
a piece of cloth

355
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:27,632
just like you said.

356
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,400
- You were right.
- I was wrong

357
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,202
about a few things.

358
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:32,904
It's very important
that you know this.

359
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:36,274
When I asked you
to take over for me, I meant it.

360
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,376
When I put the hood
back on and said,

361
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:40,011
"it's just until you get
back on your feet,"

362
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:43,047
I meant it, but I
did put the hood back on,

363
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:46,384
and it's a part of me.

364
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,988
And it makes me
feel like I'm being

365
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,190
the best version
of myself,

366
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:56,828
and I feel whole,
and I feel complete,

367
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,200
and I really, really
hope that this is making sense.

368
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:06,204
Yeah. The hood is
part of you now.

369
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,339
I should have been
up-front with you,

370
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:11,075
and I avoided having
what I thought

371
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,778
might be
a tough conversation.

372
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,850
Well, um, I appreciate
you telling me this, Oliver.

373
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,319

No. He still would
have gotten shot

because you picked
a fight.

421
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:37,986
You pulled our focus,
and you allowed

our target
to get killed.

423
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,489

436
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:11,086
that is way out of character
for you, my friend,

437
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:15,724
but I explained myself,
I apologized,

438
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:18,393
you accepted,

439
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:21,363
and now you're gonna
take a shot at me like that?

440
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,732
I was getting
someplace with Katz,

441
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:26,935
and you didn't
back my play.

442
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:29,270
- Because it wasn't working.
- No, Oliver!

443
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:31,840
Because it wasn't
your play!

444
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,751
Let me know when you
find the Vertigo.

445
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:45,020
I need some air!

446
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,506
Unh!

447
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:05,974
I already told you

448
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,809
I don't know where they
sequestered the cops,

449
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:11,513
and if you're here
to put pressure on Lance, don't,

450
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,648
because I'm all
healed up now.

451
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,718
You want to calm down.

452
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,853
I brought you dinner.

453
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,290
I'm not hungry.

454
00:20:23,527 --> 00:20:25,527
What are you
doing here?

on things.

456

Don't waste your time.

People like us don't
learn the law.

460

People like us,

461
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,676
we are the law.

462
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,014
You trying to make
your daddy proud?

463
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:49,317
Why would I ever
want to do that?

464
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,589
Because I used to be
like that with my old man

465
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,524
before he died.

466
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,596
It's exhausting trying
to be something you're not.

467
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:03,531
Oh, so what?

468
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:08,670
You're gonna tell me
what I'm supposed to be, is that it?

469
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,672
No.

470
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:14,576
I see what I like.

471
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:18,580
I know you're pretending
to be the real Laurel,

472
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:22,517
but the one standing
in front of me right now...

473
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:26,287
She don't need changing.

474
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:32,627
Your fries are
getting cold.

475
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:33,795
<font color="#FF5500">[Knocks]</font>

476
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:35,964
Hey.

477
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:38,032
Hey.

478
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,169
Everything all right?

479
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:43,004
Fine. I've been
out of town for so long,

480
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,939
I just found the gift
you left for me back in December.

481
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:46,808
I wanted to say
thank you.

482
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,510
You're welcome.

483
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:50,478
Funny, though, the same
day you delivered it,

484
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,549
I also found a security breach
on my computer.

485
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,885
I guess I now know
how Cayden James got ahold

486
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:58,720
of our nanoaluminum
amplifier.

487
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:02,590
I was gonna tell you
about that, Lyla, but, um...

488
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:04,192
The city was at stake.

489
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,261
Oh, yeah. Well, the city
is always at stake.

490
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:09,264
You don't have to lie
to your wife in order to save it.

491
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:12,066
You're
absolutely right.

492
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:15,737
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

493
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,605
What brings you by?

494
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:22,644
Well, Oliver apologized
for stringing me along about the hood.

495
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:24,712
It was actually
a good apology.

496
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:27,982
Wow. That's not exactly
Oliver's strong suit.

497
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:29,784
No, it's not.

498
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:33,521
But?

499
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:36,357
<font color="#FF5500">[Sighs]</font>

500
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,760
I don't know.
I thought we cleared the air.

501
00:22:38,762 --> 00:22:40,829
We go out into the field,
we come back,

502
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:44,432
and then I--I...

503
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:47,669
I just take a piece
right out of him

504
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,305
over nothing!

505
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,607
It was--it was
over nothing.

506
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:58,646
You're right.
There's something wrong,

507
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:00,381
and I'm worried that
when I find out what it is,

508
00:23:00,383 --> 00:23:02,116
I'm not gonna like it.

509
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:04,018
Well, from everything
you've told me,

510
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,287
there's not a lot
to like these days.

511
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:08,823
The team breaking up,
Rene's in the hospital,

512
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:11,626
Diaz is running rampant.

513
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:14,829
Maybe the reason Oliver
holding on to the hood

514
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,031
bothered you so much
is because you think

515
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:19,033
none of these things
would have happened

516
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,836
if you had been the one
still wearing it.

517
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,008
<b><font color="#D09090">Nick:</font></b> Seriously, thanks
for helping us out here.

518
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,710
I mean, anything
for Dinah,

519
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,778
and maybe I was a little
worried about you, too.

520
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,480
I'll be fine.
Just hate leaving

521
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,048
the city to be
overrun by a bunch

522
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,218
of corrupt cops
and vigilantes.

523
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,053
Don't you think there's
a little bit of a difference

524
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,055
between bent cops
and vigilantes?

525
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:42,657
None that I can see.

526
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,760
They're both
criminals, right?

527
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:47,829
Yeah.

528
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,303
Hey. Felicity, you think,
uh, we can have the room?

529
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:59,540
Uh...Yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

530
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,114
<b><font color="#FF0080">Oliver:</font></b> Get some air?

531
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,683
Yeah, I did

532
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,919
and with it
some clarity.

533
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:23,798
Well, Oliver, it's totally
within your rights to keep the hood.

534
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
It's yours,

535
00:24:25,802 --> 00:24:27,201
and you're right.

536
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,404
My frustration was never
with the uniform.

537
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,908
It was with the man
underneath it.

538
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:41,549
- I don't understand.
- I didn't either, not at first.

539
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:42,784
<font color="#FF5500">[Sighs]</font>

540
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:46,387
I so appreciated
your apology,

541
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,756
but something about it
gnawed at me...

542
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:55,663
That you needed
to be the Green Arrow,

543
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:58,399
that it completed you.

544
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:03,104
This was supposed to be
about saving the city,

545
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:06,641
helping the people,
not ourselves.

546
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:08,576
I know that.

547
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:13,081
It's a little
too dangerous,

548
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,383
and I've lost just
a little too much

549
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:17,785
along the way for it
to be about that.

550
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:20,455
But yet here you are.

551
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:22,457
You've gotten married,
raising a son.

552
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:24,459
- You've become the mayor.
- So what?

553
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:28,329
So, Oliver, you were never
supposed to stretch yourself so thin

554
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,798
and in so many
different directions

555
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,167
that the people suffer.

556
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,170
We have been
in tough spots before.

557
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:38,539
We have, with a team.

558
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,109
Even before Curtis,
Rene, and Dinah,

559
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,944
there was Roy,
there was Thea.

560
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:46,147
But, Oliver, the way
you lead alienates

561
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:48,850
everyone and everything
around you.

562
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,551
Look!

563
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:55,857
Putting the team
under surveillance was a mistake.

564
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:59,160
We had an opportunity
to save the vigilante.

565
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,862
You made
a different call.

566
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:02,830
The same with Laurel
and the money.

567
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:06,801
When did all of these
just magically become my decisions?

568
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:11,506
I seem to remember
you right there next to me.

569
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:15,510
Begging you to exercise
restraint, caution, Oliver,

570
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:17,145
but that's not you.

571
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:19,113
You have changed,
and you've grown so much,

572
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:22,150
and it's been my honor,
it's been my privilege to watch you,

573
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:24,018
but, Oliver,
you're still you,

574
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,754
and if you're just doing this for you,
like you just admitted--

575
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,689
I didn't say I was
doing it just for myself!

576
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:31,893
If this isn't 100%
for our city,

577
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:37,932
then you are not
the hero that it deserves,

578
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:40,234
and you never will be.

579
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:48,309
Ricardo Diaz has
God knows how much

580
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:51,512
of our city
in his grip,

581
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:54,015
and you're picking
now to lecture me

582
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:57,885
or to whine about not
getting a promotion?

583
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:00,321
Promotion? This isn't
about a promotion, man.

584
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:02,090
This is about you.
And Diaz?

585
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:03,858
You still can't see it.

586
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,926
See what?

587
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,260
He's already won,
Oliver.

588
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:07,829
He has the city wired,

589
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,497
and it happened
under your watch.

590
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,233
He showed up while you
were the Green Arrow!

591
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:14,235
You bought drugs
from him, John!

592
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:17,338
You funded what
he is doing right now!

593
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,074
The entire time
I put you in that hood,

594
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,677
and you hid having
a drug problem!

595
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,947
And I was putting
my body through hell

596
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,448
for the sake
of our city.

597
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,252
No. You put the team
at risk by lying!

598
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:34,088
I had to dive off a bridge to
save Rene's life

599
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,890
because you were
in the field,

600
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:38,259
you weren't 100%,
and nobody knew it!

601
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,428
You really want to
bring up Rene right now

602
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,096
when he is still
hospitalized

603
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:43,931
for the beating
that you put on him?

604
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,734
We were in the field
against Dinah, Curtis, and Rene.

605
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,436
He pulls a gun
on me!

606
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:50,271
You think he
gave me a choice?

607
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:53,040
I think that you leave
a trail of bodies

608
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,776
every damn place
that you go!

609
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:01,115
Sure you've changed,

610
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:03,784
but what comfort's that
to William,

611
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:08,789
whose mother's dead because
of the bad decisions that you've made?

612
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:23,337
My trail of bodies...

613
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:27,441
Doesn't include
my own brother.

614
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:34,649
Unh!

615
00:28:40,657 --> 00:28:42,190
Agh!

00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:13,841
Diaz is running
through the city like a cancer,

621
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:19,313
and you two are in here
doing...What exactly?

622
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:25,886
Ok. This is
what's going to happen.

623
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,621
I am gonna go back
to work,

624
00:29:27,623 --> 00:29:29,690
looking for the needle
that is Diaz's

625
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:32,126
Vertigo operation
in the city's haystack,

626
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,861
and the two of you
are going to pull

627
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:35,663
your heads out
of your asses!

628
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:47,107
She's right.

629
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,942
She usually is.

630
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:59,086
I'm sorry I punched
you, Oliver.

631
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:03,123
I'm sorry
I punched you back.

632
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,725
For what it's worth,

633
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:07,761
I know you've done
a lot of good.

634
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:09,430
I know lately it
seems like everyone's

635
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,032
been questioning
your leadership,

636
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:14,802
me included.

637
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:16,970
<b><font color="#FF0080">Felicity:</font></b> Found the location
of Diaz's Vertigo operation.

638
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:20,674
Have you two found
any shred of sanity, perhaps?

639
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:25,979
Let's go.

640
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,924
So he just drops
it casually--

641
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:39,126
"I hate vigilantes,"
not hate but "hate,"

642
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,396
like capital letters,
hates vigilantes.

643
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:44,398
This is Paul
all over again.

644
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,899
Well, that's
kind of a leap.

645
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:48,702
Paul divorced me
because I was a vigilante.

646
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:50,471
Curtis, you're getting
ahead of yourself.

647
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,372
Yeah, you're right.
He's not gonna break up with me.

648
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:54,641
- That's the spirit.
- He's going to arrest me.

649
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,044
I know I'm the last person
who should be giving you relationship advice--

650
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,612
yet you're about
to give me some.

651
00:30:58,614 --> 00:31:00,280
It's more
of a life philosophy.

652
00:31:00,282 --> 00:31:02,649
Just live in the moment
because you can only see

653
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,384
the step that's
ahead of you.

654

at the end of the road.

<font color="#0CEC0C">[Cell phone beeps]</font>

656
00:31:08,824 --> 00:31:11,425
Someone just set off
one of my proximity alerts.

657
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:14,394
Make that some-many.
All headed toward the front door!

658
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:16,130
- How did they find us?
- Who?

659
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,531
Diaz's men. They're
about to hit us

660
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:19,199
from the west,
the north, the sou--

661
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:20,434
they're about to hit us
from every angle.

662
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:22,402
I know.

663
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,638
I'm sorry, but we
can't defeat Diaz.

664
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,408
We tried,
and we failed.

665
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,978
No!

666
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,448
You stay
with Curtis.

667
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,283
Curtis.

668
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,202
Count 13 bogies
in this den alone, heavily armed.

He's gonna miss it.

The only way that we
make it out of here

is if we trust
each other.

We've been
through worse, Oliver.

we have, John.

about what I said.

720
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:14,035
You apologized
already, John. So did I.

721
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:16,471
I know.

722
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:18,673
I know...

723
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:24,546
But what I said
about the calls you made,

724
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:30,151
where you brought us,
the team, the city I--I just can't shake.

725
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:31,953
You can't shake
that you said it?

726
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:35,190
I can't shake
that it's true.

727
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:38,093
Oliver, for 6 years,
I have followed

728
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,095
the chain of command
without question,

729
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,363
even when my heart
told me there was a better way.

730
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:46,101
I trusted it,
I trusted you,

731
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,670
but the inescapable truth
is, is that people

732
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:51,339
have lost faith
in your leadership.

733
00:35:56,379 --> 00:36:00,582
Truth is, Oliver,
you have become a better man

734
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:03,418
but, with your focus split,

735
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,386
a worse leader.

736
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,790
The Green Arrow allows
you to become

737
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,192
the best version of yourself,
and I respect that.

738
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:14,095
I respect you,

739
00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:16,731
but if I'm gonna be
the best version of myself...

740
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,935
Oliver...

741
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,240
It can't be with you.

742
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,181
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

743
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:40,455
John...

744
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,126
Don't do this.

745
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:57,038
Thank you so much
for helping me get Zoe off to school.

746
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,741
Oh, yeah, sure.
Just don't understand

747
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:03,178
how a girl so small generates
this much mess.

748
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,980
You know, I actually
don't mind tidying up.

749
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:07,448
Kind of like it. Heh!

750
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,450
Keeps my mind
off of things

751
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,519
like the fact that my boyfriend's
gonna break up with me

752
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,424
because he found out I'm a vigilante
and he hates vigilantes.

753
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:18,860
So he is
your boyfriend.

754
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,429
My mind works
in hyperbole.

755
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:26,234
Ignoring for a second
the operational risk

756
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:29,804
of having a cop
know your identity,

757
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:32,907
do you regret
him knowing the truth?

<font color="#FF5500">[Knock on door]</font>

759
00:37:35,111 --> 00:37:38,279
Besides the fact that it means the end
of our relationship,

760
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,480
I don't.

761
00:37:39,482 --> 00:37:43,017
Well, then it was
worth it.

762
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:50,291
Speak of the devil.

763
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:51,960
Wait. What?

00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:55,830
Lieutenant Drake.

765
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:58,099
Not looking for me,
I assume.

766
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,568
No, but I'm glad
you're here.

767
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,938

canned me and you

768

of us,

wasn't dirty.

before clearing out her desk.

771
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:10,545
We're gonna fight
this, Nick, ok?

772
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:12,113
Don't worry.

773
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:13,715
Come in.

774
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,388
I should probably find
a reason to leave.

775
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,056
See you later, all right?

776
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:27,528
- Hey.
- Hey.

777
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,797
- You go first.
- Ok.

778
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:33,501
Heh. Listen.

779
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:37,505
I know you're not
a fan of vigilantes,

780
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:42,310
and so I get it if--if you want to
step away from this.

781
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:45,380
Curtis, I just lost
my job for being a clean cop.

782
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:46,547
I know.

783
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:48,049
With the department
compromised,

784
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:49,651
maybe vigilantism
is the only way

785
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,019
to take back
this city.

786
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:52,587
I don't know.

787
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:54,322
To be honest,

788
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,557
I don't know how I feel
about vigilantes...

789
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:02,764
But I do know how
I feel about you.

790
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:11,606
You ok?

791
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,346
I know it had
to be done.

792
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,250
<font color="#FF5500">[Sighs]</font>

793
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:24,352
But...

794
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,257
You had to do this
your way.

795
00:39:31,594 --> 00:39:35,964
I wish I knew
what this was, Lyla.

796
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,069
I know I want to keep
fighting for this city.

797
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:46,240
I just don't know
what that looks like on my own.

798
00:39:50,046 --> 00:39:52,580
Maybe you don't
do it alone.

799
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:57,218
Maybe you do it
with me.

800
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,454
Here.

801
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:05,426
A.R.G.U.S.?

802
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:08,629
I've got people breaking
into my office,

803
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:10,398
stealing stuff.

804
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,771
And, really, I could use an extra
pair of hands.

805
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:31,085
Hey.

806
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:36,424
I know it's rough,

807
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:38,826
but you'll always
have me.

808
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:40,995
I'm not going
anywhere.

809
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,133
<font color="#0CEC0C">[Cell phone vibrating]</font>

810
00:40:47,137 --> 00:40:48,669
What's up, Quentin?

811
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,272
<b><font color="#FF0080">Quentin:</font></b> Turn
on the TV. Any channel.

812
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,612
Obviously the mayor
terminated us

813
00:40:57,614 --> 00:40:59,981
to impede the prosecution
of his activities

814
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:01,649
as the Green Arrow.

815
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:04,352
What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.

816
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:06,754
It was a gross
overstep of power.

817
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,657
Our mayor should be
held accountable for his actions.

818
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:10,825
Thank you.

819
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,061
Armand said
that was your idea.

820
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:17,965
Looks like reading
those law books really paid off.

821
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,337
Guess I was wrong.

822
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,707
You were right
about something else, though.

823
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,043
I'm not changing
who I really am.

824
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,482
I have one last surprise
for you.

825
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:41,889
There's one left.

826
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:44,659
And I know just
how to use it.

827
