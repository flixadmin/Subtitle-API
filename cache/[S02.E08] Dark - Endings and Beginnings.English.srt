1
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,541
The beginning is the end.

2
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,041
And the end is the beginning.

3
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,708
Everything is interconnected.

4
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,875
Future,

5
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,833
past

6
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,208
and present.

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,333
I couldn't tell her who her mother is.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,875
Just as I can't tell you...

9
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,875
what your provision is.

10
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,750
And what I have to do today.

11
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,375
I've reflected on this moment
for many years.

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,666
My older me

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,416
wanted to tell me something,

14
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,541
but he couldn't.

15
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,416
If you knew what I now know,

16
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:58,416
then you would no longer do what you must
so I can get to this moment.

17
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:03,458
Me, as I stand here now, cannot exist

18
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,166
if you don't take the same path as I did.

19
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,416
We're not free

20
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,541
in what we do,

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
because we're not free in what we desire.

22
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,583
Everything is ready.

23
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,000
You must go now.

24
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,000
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

25
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,125
JUNE 27, 2020

26
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:40,083
THE DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

27
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,458
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
PASSPORT

28
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,416
My future me tried to shut the hole.

29
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,916
To reverse it all.

30
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,833
He shut the passage,
but hadn't broken the loop.

31
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,708
But you said we can change
a small part of the equation, so he...

32
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,416
So I will be successful next time.

33
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,583
Then none of this sick shit
will ever happen.

34
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,833
Mikkel won't disappear.

35
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,875
Michael won't die.

36
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,291
Your father won't die.

37
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,333
Big and small things
don't abide by the same laws.

38
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,000
Maybe nothing big can be altered...

39
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,333
but small things can.

40
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,458
We're changing a grain of sand.

41
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,333
And with it, the whole world.

42
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,291
What was Grandma like?

43
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,500
I mean, as a mother.

44
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,500
Why does it suddenly interest you?

45
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,166
She isn't dead, you know?

46
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,791
What do you mean?

47
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
She was here.

48
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,000
Last fall.

49
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,500
After Mikkel disappeared.

50
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,208
She...

51
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,875
She left something here.

52
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,750
For you.

53
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,041
She said she was sorry.

54
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,916
And that if she could turn back time

55
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,458
she'd do lots of things differently.

56
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,208
I'll be back.

57
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,500
I promise.

58
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,125
Where are you going?

59
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
Do you know what this is?

60
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,208
A search warrant for the power plant.

61
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,125
Special conditions apply to the plant.

62
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,541
The judge issued the warrant immediately.

63
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,166
I think,

64
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,375
given the ongoing legal proceedings
against you,

65
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,916
he may be interested in
what's to be found there.

66
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,333
WARRANT

67
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,625
Maybe I can't prove you killed my brother,

68
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,958
but I'll get you for what's going on here.

69
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,458
You have to let me out of here.

70
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,833
That's impossible.

71
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,208
I can't do that.

72
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,125
You can't let him onto the site!

73
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,791
Maybe this is better.

74
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,916
Maybe it's good
it's all finally coming out.

75
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,250
Martha,
I didn't want any of this, believe me.

76
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,166
-Please listen...
-What are you doing here?

77
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,041
Come on!

78
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,916
Why are you here?

79
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,791
What do you want?

80
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,000
You have to come with me. Please.

81
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,916
It's my fault everyone dies.

82
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,250
-What?
-It's all going to blow in a few hours.

83
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,916
Everything starts all over again.
The future starts. A new cycle.

84
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,375
What are you talking about?

85
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,500
Please believe me, please.

86
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,791
You have to trust me, please.

87
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,916
This is wrong.

88
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,333
We're wrong.

89
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,958
Please leave now.

90
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,250
No.

91
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,083
I can't let you go.

92
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,500
You're hurting me.

93
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,541
I saw you die once.
I won't let it happen again.

94
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,750
Let me go.

95
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,833
I can't.

96
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,833
I promised you I'd make it right.

97
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,375
I'm making it right.

98
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,791
SIX HOURS TO THE APOCALYPSE

99
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,750
Where's the device?

100
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,958
Where's the fucking device?

101
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,375
My mom has it.

102
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,916
That's not right.

103
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,833
It shouldn't happen this way.

104
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,291
It's all my fault.

105
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,291
Why didn't Noah tell me what to do?

106
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,750
Why did he tell me it all?

107
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,750
Explains the thing to me
and doesn't tell me what to do with it.

108
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,000
Maybe you did
exactly what you were supposed to do.

109
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,041
You showed us how it works.

110
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
Maybe that was your sole task.

111
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,291
Fuck!

112
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,458
Fuck!

113
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,291
Where are you going?

114
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,708
To find the fucking device!

115
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,083
Hello?

116
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,625
Jonas?

117
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,250
Jonas?

118
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,416
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

119
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,250
What's that?

120
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,875
The passage.

121
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,583
We're opening it again.

122
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,541
You said you wanted to shut it.

123
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,833
In the future.

124
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,250
Or the past. Your future!

125
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,166
It took me ages to accept having to be
part of the disaster I wanted to prevent.

126
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,083
How do you know all this?

127
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,291
In the last 12 months.

128
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,916
You taught me everything,

129
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,666
about the future and past.

130
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,208
Everything that happened.

131
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,583
Everything that will happen.

132
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,875
There are two sides out there.

133
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,666
Adam and Sic Mundus
want to create a new world.

134
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,000
You and I want to save this one.

135
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,250
Who's Adam?

136
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,541
What is this?

137
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
The only safe place.

138
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,375
Please don't.

139
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,333
Please.

140
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,833
Why are you doing this?

141
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,333
Because I know what happens today.

142
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,916
The Mikkel story...

143
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,541
is it true?

144
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,666
Then I...

145
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,500
I didn't want all this, Martha.

146
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,875
You kept me alive.

147
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,583
I'm still here because of you.

148
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,416
Jonas will come back.
It'll all happen as it always has.

149
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,916
But I can't stop hoping
I can change something.

150
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,875
I have to.

151
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
Jonas will come back?

152
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,250
Promise me you won't leave this bunker.

153
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,125
No matter what happens.

154
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,375
I'm sorry.

155
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,250
POLICE

156
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,125
MISSING

157
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,750
Charlotte?

158
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,791
-I thought you were still sick.
-Is Clausen here?

159
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,500
No. Clausen arrested Aleksander.

160
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,166
He got a search warrant
for the power plant.

161
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,708
He's headed there.

162
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,083
Charlotte!

163
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,500
I... I have to tell you something.

164
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,833
On the nuclear power plant grounds,

165
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,833
Aleksander buried something
in concrete there.

166
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,166
Radioactive waste.

167
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,916
I helped him do it.

168
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,375
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,916
That triggers it.

170
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,250
-What?
-It's all connected.

171
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,333
He said it all has to do
with the power plant.

172
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,500
-Jonas knew it.
-You found Jonas?

173
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,583
No, he traveled back from the future.

174
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,416
We have to go.

175
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,125
Wöller!

176
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,333
Come on.

177
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,250
FOR CHARLOTTE

178
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,208
Charlotte, where are you?
Is Franziska with you?

179
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
Call me once you get this.

180
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,333
We're going now.

181
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,250
Where?

182
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,500
I no longer know

183
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,708
what I should believe.

184
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,833
But Noah said

185
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:56,291
only the people in the bunker

186
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,625
survive.

187
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,166
What about Mom and Franziska?

188
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,833
It'll all be okay.

189
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,666
FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

190
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't quite get
what you hope to achieve here.

191
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,583
The site is huge.
Controlled shutdown takes place tomorrow.

192
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,166
My mother always said,
"Just because a task seems too big

193
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,041
doesn't mean it's unsolvable."

194
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,041
What's behind this door?

195
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
The...

196
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,583
The spent fuel pool for the old reactor.

197
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,916
It's been out of use since the 90s.

198
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,666
I'd like to see it.

199
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,166
You can't just go see it.
There's residual radiation.

200
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,833
Anyway,
I don't think you'll find anything there.

201
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,791
PHOTO ALBUM
MICHAEL

202
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,791
JUST AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

203
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,125
Katharina?

204
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,541
How does this machine work?

205
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,416
Where did you get it?

206
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,750
How can I bring Mikkel back?

207
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,500
Even if I explain it to you,
it's impossible.

208
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,583
You don't want him to return.

209
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,083
-Because then you'd no longer exist.
-I wish it were so simple.

210
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,291
Things in the past can't be changed.

211
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,333
Mikkel can't return
because I already exist.

212
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,083
Mikkel belongs here, and not you!

213
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,416
You shouldn't exist at all.

214
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes.

215
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,625
I'd trade my life for his anytime.

216
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,250
But I can't die,
because my future already exists.

217
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,875
You'd be just as incapable
of bringing Mikkel back.

218
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,791
Then why did you return?

219
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,166
I tried to prevent the origin.

220
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,583
But it's impossible. I can't.

221
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,916
Adam is the endpoint.

222
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,750
Maybe I can't prevent myself
from becoming what he is.

223
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,583
But I can stop what has become of me.

224
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,583
I know you lied to me.

225
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,375
You never meant to save them.

226
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,416
None of them.

227
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,083
We can't escape our fate.

228
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,833
Neither you nor I.

229
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,916
You're not waging war against God.

230
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,125
You're waging it against humanity.

231
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,541
Here are the last pages.

232
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,458
You used me.

233
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,833
You had me do all these things,

234
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,208
but I know now what I must do.

235
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,875
Claudia was right.

236
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:02,708
You still don't understand
how this game is played.

237
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,833
What are you waiting for?

238
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,916
Time plays its cruel game with us.

239
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,041
You believe your destiny is to kill me.

240
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:25,333
But that is as little your fate
as it is mine to die here and now.

241
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,541
Only when we're free of all emotion
are we truly free.

242
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:41,666
Only when one is ready to sacrifice
what one holds dearest.

243
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,250
Charlotte is your daughter.

244
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,083
She is Elisabeth's daughter.

245
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
And her mother.

246
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,791
No human is without guilt.

247
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,250
None of them have earned
a place in your paradise.

248
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,250
Agnes?

249
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,958
This knot

250
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,041
can only be undone

251
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,250
by destroying it entirely.

252
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:33,833
We cannot escape our destiny.

253
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,833
What is happening?

254
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,583
This is time.

255
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,083
We connect past and future.

256
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,208
What's that?

257
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,583
It's Jonas. He opened the passage again.

258
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,416
The thing Mikkel went through?

259
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,791
Yes.

260
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,208
Martha.

261
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,916
Is everything okay?
Who locked you in here?

262
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:28,291
Hey, wait!
Martha, you can't go out there!

263
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,500
Martha!

264
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,625
-What was that?
-Fuck.

265
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,375
It was the same noise
as the one from in the cave.

266
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,375
-Fuck.
-You got it?

267
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,875
The device isn't up there.

268
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,291
And Mom isn't here. Neither is Martha.

269
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,291
Do you think she's with him?

270
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,458
With Jonas?

271
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,500
Noah was right.
He was right about everything.

272
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,416
I told you guys.

273
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,000
Jonas is to blame for all this shit.

274
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,625
Where are we going?

275
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,875
You have to take it to the bunker.
Near Helge's cabin.

276
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,500
You don't have much time.

277
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,083
And you?

278
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,333
I have to find my mother.

279
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,375
And Martha.

280
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,041
Jonas!

281
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:08,416
TWO HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

282
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,458
Hey, Martha! Call me back.

283
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,625
Neither is answering.

284
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,000
My father is with Elisabeth in the bunker.

285
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,500
-He says I should join him.
-In the bunker?

286
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,750
Shit.

287
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,458
Something's happening.

288
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,000
I have to go there.

289
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:47,333
If they're not here in 30 minutes
we'll go join your father.

290
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,916
Where are Mom and Franziska?

291
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,791
I don't know.

292
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,916
So Noah says he's your father
and comes from the future.

293
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,958
No, from the past.

294
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,250
And he said the apocalypse
will begin here in Winden.

295
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,416
Today!

296
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,791
And you think it all has to do
with the barrels.

297
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,541
-What is that?
-The cooling pool for the old reactor.

298
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,458
It has already been sealed
to become part of the greenfield.

299
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:57,666
When?

300
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,583
I, um...

301
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,666
don't know exactly.

302
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,250
But it's nothing unusual.

303
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,083
Sealing off the old reactor

304
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,750
is a step in the dismantling process.

305
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,583
I want it broken open.

306
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,541
Now?

307
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,291
Now.

308
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:21,375
You can't keep him there another night.
He's done nothing wrong.

309
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,583
This is all nonsense.

310
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,125
When can I visit Aleksander?

311
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,416
I understand.

312
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,500
Regina?

313
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,375
Please don't be afraid.

314
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,833
It's really me.

315
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm so sorry.

316
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,083
I didn't want to just leave that way.

317
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,458
I'll explain it to you.

318
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,708
But you have to come with me now.

319
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,166
Regina.

320
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,875
I'm so sorry.

321
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,125
Noah?

322
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,208
You look different.

323
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,541
Different to when I saw you last.

324
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,416
He sent you.

325
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,625
Adam.

326
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,416
I always wondered when you became him.

327
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,208
I won't do that.

328
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,625
I'll never do what he did.

329
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,416
He said you'd say something like that.

330
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,916
He also said we'd become friends.

331
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,625
Before you betray me.

332
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,791
Why do you follow him?

333
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:01,166
Why did you follow her?

334
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,666
Claudia.

335
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,500
Because we want to believe.

336
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,833
Because we cling to the salvation
promised to us.

337
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,708
If you kill him...

338
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,625
you kill all hope of salvation.

339
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,041
He's the savior.

340
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,625
You're the savior.

341
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,750
-What is that?
-Read it.

342
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,666
It's from Martha.

343
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,333
This is impossible.

344
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,000
You must save them.

345
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,708
Bartosz, Magnus and Franziska.

346
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,583
And later me and Agnes.

347
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,083
The loop has to be closed
so the next cycle begins.

348
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,708
As the prophesy dictates.

349
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,291
And so Martha can live.

350
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,583
No, this can't be.

351
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,458
Martha!

352
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,041
Regina.

353
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:49,833
You're her.

354
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,583
You're Claudia.

355
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,125
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

356
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,750
Your colleague is in the old reactor.

357
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,291
Mom?

358
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,916
Jonas?

359
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,541
You're back.

360
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,583
You really came back.

361
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,333
I've been looking for you.

362
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,166
-I have to tell you something.
-I know.

363
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,125
Everything.

364
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,333
I know why you said that
back then in the rain.

365
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,416
Mikkel...

366
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,000
I know everything.

367
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,458
It was you at the lake.

368
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,041
We're a perfect match.

369
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,708
Don't ever believe anything else.

370
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:19,000
And so the circle closes.

371
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,625
Jonas, who is that?

372
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,833
Go on, tell her who I am.

373
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,750
I told you that all the pieces
are in their places.

374
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,666
All that's needed is a little push.

375
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,250
You lied to me!

376
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,875
You wanted it all to happen again.

377
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,791
You're the trigger.

378
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,250
We're all the trigger.

379
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,083
Each and every one of us.

380
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,458
Why do you want that?

381
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,000
Why do you want the future to be repeated?

382
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,666
Because what is created today
is the beginning of the end.

383
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,375
The dark matter,

384
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:12,500
it has to be created so that in the future
I can lead it to its new purpose.

385
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,375
The end of this world.

386
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,916
I am the trigger.

387
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:24,083
Only not of what you think.

388
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,708
I am the trigger

389
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:35,208
that will make you become what I am today.

390
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:55,708
It's okay.

391
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,500
It will all be okay.

392
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,958
Some pain is unforgettable.

393
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,250
You will carry this pain
with you all your life.

394
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,916
Look at me.

395
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,958
Until you're finally ready

396
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,125
to let go.

397
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,375
Of her, too.

398
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,083
You can stop me.

399
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,750
Or try to save her.

400
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,416
You'll know what to do.

401
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:56,416
Please don't go.

402
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,750
Martha!

403
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,500
Please don't go.

404
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:05,208
Please don't.

405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,375
Don't open it!

406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,250
Stop! Don't open it! It's a mistake.

407
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,000
No, Mrs. Doppler. It's our elephant.

408
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,125
You have no idea
what this is really about.

409
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,375
-What is it this really about?
-Not about the missing people.

410
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,375
It's about the future,

411
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,000
the past

412
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,916
and how it's all interconnected.

413
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,416
-Open it.
-Please don't!

414
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,625
-Open it.
-No, it's a mistake!

415
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,000
Magnus! Open up!

416
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,166
Magnus!

417
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,583
Open the door!

418
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,708
Hurry!

419
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,666
Magnus!

420
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:07,583
What the hell? Who are you? Hey!

421
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,458
It's him. It's you.

422
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,291
You're Jonas.

423
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,625
It's all your fault.

424
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,625
Yes, it is my fault, all of it.

425
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:22,000
-But I'm here to save you.
-Save us from what?

426
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:25,166
-From the apocalypse.
-What apocalypse?

427
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,791
What about Martha?

428
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,041
What about Martha?

429
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,500
FOR CHARLOTTE

430
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:33,750
Mom.

431
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,333
Elisabeth.

432
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,333
It's beginning.

433
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,958
Where are we going?

434
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,833
I promise you.

435
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,625
I'll make it right.

436
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,250
I'm not who you think I am.

437
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:28,291
-Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...
-We don't have time.

438
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,041
I'll explain it to you later.
We have to go now.

439
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,000
What time are you from?

440
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:55,500
The question isn't from what time,

441
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,875
but from what world.

442
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,625
