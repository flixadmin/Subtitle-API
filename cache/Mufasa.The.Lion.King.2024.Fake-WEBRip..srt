4
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:13,582
Look at the stars, whenever you feel
alone, the great kings of the past will

5
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,383
always be

6
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:22,328
up there to guide you, and so am I.

7
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:41,570
My friends, the time of my family's
growth is upon us.

8
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,875
This home we share is the fulfillment of
my father's vision.

9
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,813
How wonderful is it that Nala and I get
to continue his dream and make even

10
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,682
greater the

11
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:57,056
in the circle of life.

12
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:06,365
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

13
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:48,554
Simba, I'm here, I'm here.

14
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,051
Security detail has arrived!

15
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,620
One gentle reminder, we are not food.

16
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,454
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,382
We are just two guys walking to work
through a pride of hungry lions.

18
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,760
Which is perfectly normal.

19
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,762
I'm not terrified.

20
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,931
Security detail reporting for duty, Your
Grace.

21
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,866
Your Highness.

22
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,368
Ruler of all four-legged creatures.

23
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,704
And that one three-legged zebra.

24
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,905
Oh, right, Ron.

25
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,006
That was tragic.

26
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,007
It was an Aiden Ron.

27
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,341
Yeah.

28
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,308
Ron has three legs.

29
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,610
That's still one more than me.

30
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,844
Well, are those arms really?

31
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,412
I don't know.

32
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,680
I think they're paws.

33
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,214
I consider all those legs.

34
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,716
Guys, this is serious.

35
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,785
I need you to stay with Kiara until I
get back.

36
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,445
Are you saying that your security detail

37
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,624
has been called on to do babysitting?

38
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,116
Pumbaa, we should really discuss this

39
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,751
because I don't really love Chew.

40
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,229
Guys, I promised her everything would be
okay.

41
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,631
Well, that's one way to parent.

42
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,732
You're gonna have to grow up sometime.

43
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,800
What else did you tell her?

44
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,568
That she could be whatever she wants to
be?

45
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,326
That life is fair?

46
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,839
I need you two to try and act like
adults, okay?

47
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,274
Don't scare Kiara.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,408
And most of all, no stories.

49
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,142
No stories?

50
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:00,943
Wait a second.

51
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,877
I know where your head goes.

52
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,636
I grew up with you two, promise me.

53
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,981
Okay, you know what, you know what, you
know what?

54
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,749
Fine, no stories.

55
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,184
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

56
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:08,517
No.

57
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,419
Shh, we'll tell a story anyway.

58
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,045
Okay, we'll tell them that we're not
gonna tell a story

59
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:12,912
and that we're gonna tell a story.

60
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,123
Are you guys serious?

61
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,491
I'm clearly within earshot.

62
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,392
Dad.

63
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,915
Hey, little one.

64
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,542
Dad, the storm's coming and I'm scared.

65
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,043
I want to go with you and Mom.

66
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,618
Oh, don't be scared, my love.

67
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,119
Timon and Pumbaa will watch you while
I'm gone.

68
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:32,420
Be brave now, Kiara.

69
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:33,521
Be brave.

70
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,675
Okay, we've prepared a story!

71
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,076
Scar looked at us!

72
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,890
He knew it was the end of the line.

73
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,925
I could smell the fear.

74
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,561
That was actually me, but yes.

75
00:05:55,885 --> 00:06:08,662
(Roar)

76
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,249
So you two defeated Scar, and then you
ate him?

77
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,251
Honestly, one of the best meals I ever
had.

78
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,453
My dad told me he defeated Scar.

79
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,622
Well, OK, but your dad, as we all know,

80
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,956
is a pathological liar.

81
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,291
He's always lying.

82
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,092
Get it?

83
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,293
Ooh!

84
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,362
Ah!

85
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,463
I'm scared.

86
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,931
I want Mom and Dad.

87
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,932
Oh, look, look, look, look, look.

88
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,567
Don't be scared, Kiara.

89
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,904
How about we sing you a song?

90
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,838
And a what?

91
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,940
No, it is way too early for the song.

92
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:38,974
It worked on Simba.

93
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,843
He thought he had murdered his own
father.

94
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,578
He was singing and dancing around in
seconds.

95
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,779
I can't just turn it on like that.

96
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,414
I have to be in the moment.

97
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,249
He sang that song for six years
straight.

98
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,384
Well, who didn't?

99
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,185
What?

100
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:49,719
Aah!

101
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,386
No!

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,188
It's Ron, the three-legged zebra!

103
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,022
Run for your lives!

104
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,590
He heard what we've been saying about
him!

105
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,524
We're sorry, Ron!

106
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,325
They were jokes!

107
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,960
They were just jokes!

108
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,362
It's Rafiki!

109
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,396
Rafiki!

110
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,263
Rafiki!

111
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,299
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

112
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,302
Little one, there's no reason to cry.

113
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,904
My parents, they're gone.

114
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,741
Hey, look out there, m'doggo.

115
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,844
You see those baobab trees blowing in
the wind?

116
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:19,215
The roots of those trees are very
strong, like your family.

117
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,986
And just as they did for you, your
parents have gone to the ceremony of

118
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,087
birth in grounds.

119
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,326
And when they've returned, the circle of
life will bring a blessing to you,

120
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,763
Kiara, that you will never forget.

121
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,830
Man, he's good.

122
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:39,969
He's such a visual storyteller, yet it
makes sense that he lives alone.

123
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:44,040
I just want the storm to pass, and then
I promise to be brave!

124
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,741
Ha ha ha ha ha!

125
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,909
I'll tell you a secret.

126
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:51,814
When your father, Simba, was your age,
he was afraid of the thunder and would

127
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,482
hide behind the king.

128
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,884
When did he stop hiding?

129
00:07:54,908 --> 00:08:00,122
One day, during a big storm, your
grandfather, Mufasa, took your father to

130
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,458
the very top of Pride Rock,

131
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,262
told him to stand with him and howl into
the wind,

132
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,098
and Simba slowly stepped out with the
king,

133
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:14,103
and together, they roared into the
night.

134
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,872
But I'm not brave like my dad.

135
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,742
And I could never be like Mufasa.

136
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,411
Is that so?

137
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,848
Then maybe it's time I tell you a story.

138
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,851
A story of a cub, not much bigger than
you,

139
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:34,724
A lion born without a drop of nobility
in his blood, a lion who would change

140
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,392
our lives forever.

141
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,526
A story!

142
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,095
So glad I brought some crickets.

143
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,097
But go easy, we're in a cave.

144
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:46,268
This story begins far beyond the
mountains and the shadows, on the other

145
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,837
side of the light.

146
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:54,143
In this place, everything was dying of
thirst, as twenty full moons have passed

147
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,846
without a single drop of water.

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:04,870
But when the skies finally opened,
destiny would reign.

149
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:32,449
Mufasa!

150
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,451
Mufasa!

151
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:40,459
Come see!

152
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,359
Mom!

153
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,094
What is that light way out there?

154
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,930
Oh, that's very special.

155
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:53,035
Beyond the horizon, beyond the last
cloud in the sky,

156
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,871
that's a place we call Milele.

157
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,740
Maléle?

158
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,343
It means forever.

159
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,612
Imagine a kingdom full of life,

160
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,681
water and food,

161
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,249
grass and sky,

162
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,585
as far as the eye can see.

163
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,853
Will we ever go there?

164
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,421
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

165
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,790
That's exactly where we're headed.

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,771
Listen to your father, Mufasa!

734
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:39,043
Listen to us!

735
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:43,530
Kapila, he's there!

736
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,451
Mom!

737
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,363
He's there!

738
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:46,303
Mother!

739
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:50,023
Mufasa!

740
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,359
Find your footing, one step at a time.

741
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,028
I can't!

742
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,502
You can do this, I'm right here.

743
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,397
Mom?

744
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,859
Dad?

745
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:08,853
Can you hear me?

746
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,862
Is anyone out there?

747
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,524
Mom?

748
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,015
Please.

749
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,895
I'm scared

750
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:35,751
The floodwaters joined a distant river,
carried Mufasa far from his mother and father

751
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:36,327
beyond..

752
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,336
All that he knew.

753
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:06,590
Hello!

754
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,942
I'm Taka, son of a Barsi.

755
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,336
What's your name?

756
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,013
Mufasa

757
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,957
I'm not allowed to talk to outsiders,
but I have a secret and I really want to

758
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:17,325
tell you.

759
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:18,724
What's the secret?

760
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:19,793
I'll get in trouble.

761
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:21,095
Please, just tell me.

762
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,832
Uh, I don't know.

763
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:23,867
Just tell me!

764
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:24,884
Okay.

765
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,429
You're about to be eaten!

766
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,522
I hate secrets!

767
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:32,638
Swim!

768
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,406
But I can't!

769
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:34,375
You have to swim!

770
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,334
I don't know how!

771
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,436
All right, chin up!

772
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,940
Then walk underwater, really fast!

773
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,034
I can't!

774
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,802
Come on, you bastard!

775
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,071
Faster!

776
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,605
Help me, Taka!

777
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,470
Help me!

778
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,379
I told you to wait for me!

779
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,823
It's not my fault mum.

780
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,392
I came down for a drink and saw him
floating by.

781
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,994
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

782
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:10,698
Oh, you're lucky those crocs were young
and afraid to fight.

783
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,365
Let's go.

784
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,267
We can't just leave him here.

785
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,969
Rules are rules, Taka.

786
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,271
Obasi will never accept a stray.

787
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,906
I'm not a stray.

788
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,641
I'm just...

789
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:21,375
lost.

790
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,759
See?

791
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,246
He's just lost.

792
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,115
There was a flood.

793
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,686
My parents, they tried to save me.

794
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,457
Do you know which way is home?

795
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,126
Home, to be lost,

796
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,562
is to learn the way.

797
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,763
Call me, Ashe.

798
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,431
I'm tired, Ashe.

799
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:48,940
Come on, it's this way.

800
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:04,638
Come on, Mufasa

801
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,817
Is this..

802
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:16,364
Milele

803
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,074
No, my love

804
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:29,710
I was trying to nap, Aeshae, the
all-important nap of kings, only to be

805
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,336
awoken by the disgusting

806
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,215
hideous, revolting stench of a stray.

807
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,018
Will we come upon an outsider, tell me,
what do we do?

808
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,221
Obasi, I know.

809
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,188
Eat it!

810
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,756
But I found him, Dad.

811
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,991
I saved his life.

812
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:47,761
Taka, we do not associate with
outsiders.

813
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,798
The only true bond is blood.

814
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,901
I've heard stories of lions twice our
size.

815
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:58,239
These outsiders will devour everything
in their path.

816
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,642
Does he look like he's going to devour
you?

817
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,945
Oh, that smell is disgusting.

818
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,147
I'm not even sure I could eat this
quepete.

819
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,148
I'm not a quepete.

820
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:09,283
I'm a Mufasa.

821
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,452
Do you even know what Mufasa means?

822
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:11,886
No.

823
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,488
It means king, and that's me.

824
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:18,259
You better start running, little Mufasa,
for your life.

825
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,461
If I run, you'll never catch me.

826
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,129
I'm the fastest cub that ever lived.

827
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,197
My father taught me so.

828
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:26,033
Ooh, Taka, you have a challenge.

829
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,869
They will race to the dead tree and
back.

830
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:33,607
And when the prince defeats him, I will
finish him in one bite.

831
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:35,743
What if Mufasa wins?

832
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,979
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

833
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,881
He stays with me.

834
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:44,084
You have my word.

835
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:47,555
Let the race begin!

836
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,823
Oh, clumsy little stray.

837
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,625
Run, Mufasa!

838
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,093
You did not have to do that.

839
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,062
Taka is the future king.

840
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,164
He has to win his first challenge.

841
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:58,513
No, Obasi.

842
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,516
To be a true king, he must earn it.

843
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,129
Don't take that away from him.

844
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,774
Better hurry.

845
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,207
I have one more secret, Mufasa.

846
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,683
I always wanted a brother!

847
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,008
Caesar!

848
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:48,876
Obasi!

849
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,147
You will keep him with the females,
Tucker.

850
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:58,123
How could you lose to a stray?

851
00:22:58,348 --> 00:22:59,463
Well done, Taka.

852
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,296
Well done.

853
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,504
I thought you said you were fast.

854
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,739
I had to let you win.

855
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:07,876
Well, I did just go days with no sleep
or...

856
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,478
Anyway, come on, you fusser.

857
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:10,721

1496
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:43,471
ELEPHANT STAMPEDE!

1497
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:55,421
Chigaru jerk like 20 feet

1498
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:56,957
Oh, that's a new record!

1499
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,026
Obasi, they did it again!

1500
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,061
Your sons are nothing but trouble!

1501
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:03,397
That one is not my son!

1502
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,498
They're heathens!

1503
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,399
The both of them!

1504
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,836
This stray is forbidden to be near the
Shade Tree!

1505
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,404
Mufasa and I were just playing.

1506
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,007
You two will never be brothers!

1507
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:18,405
Go back to the females and stay away
from my son

1508
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:19,432
Oh.. your mother

1509
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:24,104
She adopts every lizard speaks to
passing grasshoppers

1510
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:28,455
- I want to go with him
- you want to be with the females.. you belong with the male

1511
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,324
he gets to hunt

1512
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,252
..with mother

1513
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,459
One day..

1514
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,662
He will betray you

1515
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:39,633
- That is what strays do
- Mufasa would never betray me
- hey hey

1516
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,703
This will all be yours my son.

1517
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:47,408
You will be king so pay attention

1518
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,578
Study every move I make

1519
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:59,420
Sleeping again, that is what males do we
protect the pride as we nap that's

1520
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:04,695
Well, that's power

1521
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,746
Power

1522
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,477
Why are we stopping?

1523
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:31,501
close your eyes and tell me what you
hear, what you feel.

1524
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:42,620
There's a herd of antelope heading
across the dry lake bed, about half a

1525
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,564
day from here.

1526
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,067
And how do you know they're not
gazelles?

1527
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:50,637
Their steps are too heavy, moving way
too slow.

1528
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:52,006
What else?

1529
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,609
Come on, you can do it.

1530
00:28:55,633 --> 00:29:03,150
When the wind hits their horns, it moves
up instead of across, so definitely

1531
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,685
antelope horns.

1532
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,160
Very good.

1533
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,761
What is it, Mufasa?

1534
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,995
What's wrong?

1535
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,064
Sometimes I get a scent.

1536
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,667
It's barely a trace on the wind.

1537
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,293
And it smells like home.

1538
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,307
Then it's gone.

1539
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:30,511
Mufasa, your parents are still out
there.

1540
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,369
We can keep looking.

1541
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,780
I lost them, Eshe.

1542
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,115
You're wasting your time training me
like this.

1543
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:38,452
But these skills you have, no other male
has them.

1544
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,621
Obasi will never accept me.

1545
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,090
I'll never be his blood, his family.

1546
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,692
But you are my family.

1547
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,086
And if Obasi could see how gifted you
are...

1548
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,597
Well, maybe I like being a stray.

1549
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,901
You know, no rules, no responsibility.

1550
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,569
I'm the lucky one, Eshe.

1551
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,137
What do you mean, Mufasa?

1552
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,840
I never have to be like Taka.

1553
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,940
I never have to be king.

1554
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,758
Did he say no rules and no
responsibilities?

1555
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,227
An outcast afraid of water never takes a
bath.

1556
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:21,495
Which means he smells like me!

1557
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,629
Which is not good!

1558
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:26,667
Well, either way, I think that means
that he's one of us!

1559
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,501
This is it?

1560
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,202
It's our time!

1561
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,370
This is our moment!

1562
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,339
And a one, and a two, and a one, two...

1563
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,453
Hakuna Mufasa, what a wonderful name.

1564
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:40,358
Hakuna Mufasa, he ain't no passing
craze.

1565
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,952
It means no prob--!

1566
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:43,353
What?!

1567
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:44,856
Don't go there.

1568
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:46,473
All right, all right, Rafiki's right.

1569
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:47,642
We'll get letters from legal.

1570
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,478
Those vultures will take everything we
have.

1571
00:30:49,503 --> 00:30:51,414
Which technically is nothing.

1572
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,883
Look at us, we're naked animals.

1573
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,352
No wonder I'm always freezing.

1574
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:55,221
They want this!

1575
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:57,791
Come on, Pumbaa, let's bring it home!

1576
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,260
Hakuna Mufasa!

1577
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,730
Quiet!

1578
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:02,933
Kiara's a music snob.

1579
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,502
Rafiki, keep going.

1580
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:12,938
Later that day, Eshe was teaching Mufasa
how to hunt in pairs.

1581
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:20,963
But, as Taka was secretly watching,
something terrible was hunting them.

1582
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:17,224
Mufasa, run!

1583
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:19,924
Eshe!

1584
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:28,113
Eshe!

1585
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:44,926
Keep moving, Mufasa!

1586
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,568
They go for the neck!

1587
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,036
It's okay, Mufasa..

1588
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,408
 it's okay..

1589
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:11,688
it's okay..

1590
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:14,353
That was very brave of you Mufasa..

1591
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:16,273
 Thank you.

1592
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,991
Eshe?

1593
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:27,140
What has happened?

1594
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:30,500
A-are you...hurt?

1595
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:32,646
They were huge.

1596
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,141
White as ghosts.

1597
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:37,236
Like nothing I've seen before.

1598
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,159
Oh.. Obasi.

1599
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:46,198
Had Mufasa not been there, I...

1600
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:52,714
Taka...

1601
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:05,057
I owe you a great debt, Mufasa.

1602
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:06,892
We need to prepare.

1603
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:10,730
They're downwind, less than a day away.

1604
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,232
No.

1605
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,111
You couldn't possibly know this.

1606
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,507
Send a scout and you'll see.

1607
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,598
They'll be coming for us.

1608
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:25,931
Father, please, let me explain.

1609
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:28,272
Not now.

1610
00:34:29,552 --> 00:34:31,530
Taka, come.

1611
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,960
Where is my son?

1612
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:56,163
There was a young lion, Majesty.

1613
00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:58,166
He fought Shaju.

1614
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,612
And yet, you came back.

1615
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:04,664
You survived.

1616
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:05,866
I was badly hurt.

1617
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:08,069
I promise, Majesty, this is the truth.

1618
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:08,971
The truth?

1619
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,593
Yes, the truth.

1620
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:14,283
The truth is standing behind you.

1621
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,620
There were others, Majesty.

1622
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:22,956
But only one left blood on his mane.

1623
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,825
Which means he left Shaju to die.

1624
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:26,984
Saved himself.

1625
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:30,163
These young lions will see their king.

1626
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,065
His blood is common, ordinary.

1627
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:36,169
And was he their king?

1628
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:37,670
No, Kiros.

1629
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:41,908
You are the only king.

1630
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:47,480
An ordinary lion, and you left my son to
die?

1631
00:35:47,504 --> 00:35:48,414
I was injured.

1632
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,549
There was no choice.

1633
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,751
Please, Majesty, you have to believe me.

1634
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,887
There's no reason to fear me.

1635
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:57,223
I would never harm one of my own.

1636
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,692
Thank you, Majesty.

1637
00:35:59,716 --> 00:36:04,464
I'll leave that pleasure to them.

1638
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:05,665
Majesty!

1639
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:05,965
No!

1640
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:09,440
no!

1641
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:23,450
No one can ever know you ran, but you
ran for your mother.

1642
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:24,951
It never happened, Taka.

1643
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:25,952
Do you understand?

1644
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:26,886
But I didn't know.

1645
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,578
I was just...

1646
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:28,655
I was just scared.

1647
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,490
It doesn't matter.

1648
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:32,525
We must protect the bloodline.

1649
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,627
Protect them with a lie?

1650
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,929
Father, that's deceitful.

1651
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:41,441
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

1652
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:46,939
Taka, it's what kings must do.

1653
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:48,608
But I'm not a king.

1654
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm just your son.

1655
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:52,978
Obasi

1656
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,069
Chigaru.

1657
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,366
Obasi

1658
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,050
Chigaru!

1659
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:58,284
I'm here!

1660
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,886
What did you see?

1661
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,521
They're coming this way, Obasi!

1662
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,723
Two lions for every one of ours!

1663
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:05,558
Each one bigger than the next!

1664
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:07,727
But none as mighty as Kiros!

1665
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:10,363
Their terrifying king!

1666
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:12,065
Outsiders.

1667
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:15,001
The stories were all true.

1668
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,470
I must protect the bloodline, Eshe.

1669
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,873
The future of this pride.

1670
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:23,009
Taka, you are that future.

1671
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:23,610
Futu--re...

1672
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,445
Dad-- what do you mean?

1673
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:27,747
I'm sending you away.

1674
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:29,649
Far from here.

1675
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:34,187
You will leave and start a new life, a
new beginning.

1676
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:39,125
I need you to go with him, Mufasa, to
pledge your loyalty.

1677
00:37:39,149 --> 00:37:42,501
They'll arrive with the sunrise.

1678
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:51,070
Where will we go, Eshe?

1679
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,996
Without you, I have no home.

1680
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:56,843
Mufasa, you and Taka together, that...

1681
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:57,844
that is home.

1682
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:58,411
Eshe.

1683
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:02,148
Mufasa, look out there, beyond the
light.

1684
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,516
You know what I see?

1685
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,186
I see the place your mother told you
about.

1686
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,215
A place beyond the river's end, across
the deepest canyon on the other side of

1687
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:11,925
the mountains.

1688
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:15,195
A place beyond the horizon itself.

1689
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:18,735
A bright land so green, so...

1690
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,737
perfect.

1691
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:23,436
That to see it, is to see...

1692
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,637
Milele.

1693
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,206
Yes.

1694
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,407
Forever.

1695
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,542
My parents spoke of Milele often.

1696
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,811
My mother told me it was where we were
going.

1697
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,446
And don't you see, Mufasa?

1698
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,848
You must keep going.

1699
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:37,383
You must continue your journey toward
the light.

1700
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:38,618
Please, Eshe.

1701
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:40,453
I can't lose you.

1702
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:43,123
You have my love always, Mufasa.

1703
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:46,292
But your family is still out there,
waiting for you.

1704
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,061
I can feel their presence.

1705
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:50,497
And I know you can too.

1706
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:51,965
Go.

1707
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:53,733
Go, Mufasa.

1708
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:58,006
Find your way home.

1709
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:05,979
Mother, please forgive me.

1710
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,647
I beg you.

1711
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:10,016
There's no need, my love.

1712
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,576
Taka, your moment of courage will come.

1713
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:29,251
Now both of you go, go and find your
place in the circle of life.

1714
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:49,689
They left their family never to see them
again.

1715
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,224
This story is killing me.

1716
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,193
It's toying with my emotion.

1717
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:54,928
And here is the worst part.

1718
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:55,595
What's that?

1719
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,629
I'm out of crickets.

1720
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:58,064
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

1721
00:39:58,088 --> 00:39:59,933
I need a bathroom break before the
second act.

1722
00:39:59,957 --> 00:40:01,134
Everyone wait for me.

1723
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:01,935
Ah!

1724
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:02,769
Ah!

1725
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:03,603
Ah!

1726
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:04,370
Ah!

1727
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:05,605
Ah!

1728
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:06,973
Ah!

1729
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:08,108
I am back.

1730
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:09,609
Thumba, did you wash your hooves?

1731
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:10,310
Mm-hmm.

1732
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:10,944
Thumba?

1733
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,078
I did, I did.

1734
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:12,846
Pumba?

1735
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,614
I'm just going to walk on them again
right after.

1736
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:15,248
Pumba.

1737
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:16,649
Ugh.

1738
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:19,185
Rafiki, did the outsiders come?

1739
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,286
Yes.

1740
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,490
And as the hunters led Kiros into the
Valley of Kings,

1741
00:40:23,514 --> 00:40:30,466
Obasi and Eshe stood their ground.

1742
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:42,809
Which one of you is king?

1743
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,479
You have no reason to challenge me.

1744
00:40:46,503 --> 00:40:50,650
Does this look like a challenge, King?

1745
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:53,453
There are rules among lions.

1746
00:40:53,477 --> 00:40:55,221
Not anymore.

1747
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:59,125
While you rule this pride, I've built my
army.

1748
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:02,729
Yours is the last pride in the Valley of
Kings.

1749
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:07,767
Which means everything the light touches
belongs to me.

1750
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,803
There will be one ruler.

1751
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:16,379
One Lion King.

2038
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:16,260
Hunters!

2039

00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,174

2051

I did.

2060
00:45:18,328 --> 00:45:20,673

stray.

2061

Let him go.

2062
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:21,874
Kyros...

2063
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:23,199
The other is no stray.

2064
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,111

2065

2066

Blood for blood.

2067
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:51,503
They're coming!

2068
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:53,072
What do we do?

2069
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:54,607
Find the advantage?

2070
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:55,541
What advantage?

2071
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:58,844
We're on a rock in the middle of the
water!

2072
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:00,112
Doc, this is it!

2073
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:05,354
We go for the king!

2074
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:12,224
Mufasa!

2075
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:13,325
I'm ready!

2076
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:14,893
Just one last thing!

2077
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:15,794
with what!

2078
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:16,954
Shut up!

2079
00:46:16,978 --> 00:46:18,364
Taka!

2080
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:24,183
This was a bad idea!

2081
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:31,910
Mufasa!

2082
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:35,842
Mufasa!

2083
00:46:41,177 --> 00:46:41,987
Mufasa!

2084
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:43,255
We're alive!

2085
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:44,356
I did it!

2086
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,407
I saved us!

2087
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:51,340
You were saying?

2088
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:19,391
Okay!

2089
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:20,559
Okay!

2090
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,160
No!

2091
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:22,528
No more water!

2092
00:47:22,528 --> 00:47:24,606
Tell me you can track them downriver.

2093
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,808
We can track them anywhere.

2094
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:30,712
They can run, but they can't hide.

2095
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:33,415
So just to be clear, we're not in this
story?

2096
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:36,785
It feels a little bit like Heroes is
stealing my thunder here.

2097
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:38,720
Yeah, you know, I don't feel seen.

2098
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:40,856
No, there's a lot of stories with all of
us.

2099
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,723
Tell one of those!

2100
00:47:41,747 --> 00:47:43,625
Can I make one small suggestion?

2101
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:46,228
Less childhood drama, more meerkat?

2102
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:50,766
Rafiki, I don't think Taka scaring me

2103
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,770
Me too. It's so obvious, but maybe just so we're
on the same page, dummy, is it, Simba?

2104
00:47:54,794 --> 00:47:56,571
Is it me?

2105
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:57,739
Am I Obasi?

2106
00:47:57,763 --> 00:47:59,041
That makes no sense.

2107
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:01,810
But seriously, I have one question.

2108
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:03,645
Am I Taka?

2109
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:05,580
I did it again!

2110
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:07,382
I did it again!

2111
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:12,020
Not that I'm counting, but I saved your hide.
Again!

2112
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:15,722
As much as it kills you to say it,
let's hear it a little
"Thank you".

2113
00:48:15,347 --> 00:48:16,124
What are you talking about?!!

2114
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:19,728
You want me to thank you for pushing me
off a waterfall?

2115
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:21,964
Yes, and you're welcome.

2116
00:48:21,988 --> 00:48:25,100
Look, it's not my fault crocodiles are
simply attracted to you.

2117
00:48:25,124 --> 00:48:30,005
Don't say that.
Ha ha ha

2118
00:48:30,029 --> 00:48:32,207
I did it again.

2119
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:34,643
I did it again.

2120
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:37,412
Mufasa, is it him?

2121
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:38,313
Is it the outsiders?

2122
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:40,912
No, she's right there.

2123
00:48:40,937 --> 00:48:42,620
She?

2124
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,887
There's no place to run.

2125
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,789
We have your scent.

2126
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:48,924
My scent?

2127
00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:52,227
I've been stalking you two all night.

2128
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:53,562
That's not possible.

2129
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:57,666
Then why did I circle you three times in
this wood while you two were chasing

2130
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,402
each other's tails?

2131
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,270
Ah!

2132
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:20,288
That's a mess.

2133
00:49:20,313 --> 00:49:24,359
Yeah, well, I, uh, meant to do that,
so...

2134
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:28,697
Still think I'm afraid?

2135
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:30,132
Why are you following us?

2136
00:49:30,156 --> 00:49:31,900
I was hoping to find my pride.

2137
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:32,591
What happened to it?

2138
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:34,111
The outsiders happened.

2139
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:39,408
A few of us got away, but you're the
only other lions I've seen.

2140
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:40,409
You two better keep moving.

2141
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:42,611
Wait, please.

2142
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:47,149
Um, my name is Taka, son of Obasi.

2143
00:49:47,173 --> 00:49:49,017
I know what it's like to lose
everything.

2144
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:49,718
Come with us.

2145
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:50,419
We can help you.

2146
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:52,087
I don't need any help.

2147
00:49:52,111 --> 00:49:54,556
But you don't have anyone.

2148
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,425
She does indeed have someone.

2149
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:57,359
Thank you very much.

2150
00:49:57,383 --> 00:49:58,527
That's Zazu.

2151
00:49:58,551 --> 00:49:59,494
Don't eat him.

2152
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:00,228
You heard her.

2153
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:01,330
Do not eat me.

2154
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:06,368
As a recent addition to the King's Royal
Guard, I must kindly ask you both to

2155
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:07,536
move on.

2156
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,037
Thank you for stopping by.

2157
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:11,740
Your king hired a bird to protect you.

2158
00:50:11,764 --> 00:50:14,309
How high can you fly?

2159
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,378
Look, I needed a scout.

2160
00:50:16,402 --> 00:50:17,913
Zazu was the last option.

2161
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:19,781
Well, next to last.

2162
00:50:19,805 --> 00:50:21,783
Between Albert the iguana and I,

2163
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:25,554
His Majesty decided on the underling
with wings,

2164
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:28,557
and thus, I became the lead scout for
the princess.

2165
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:30,225
It's my third day going swimmingly,

2166
00:50:30,249 --> 00:50:31,493
if I may say so myself.

2167
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:33,109
Sarabi, you can say so as well.

2168
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:34,830
How far do you think you'll get with a
bird?

2169
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:37,099
How far do you two geniuses think you'll
get

2170
00:50:37,123 --> 00:50:38,904
stumbling around running into each
other?

2171
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:43,029
All the way to Milele
Milele is nothing but a myth

2172
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:43,638
It's not a myth

2173
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:45,489
Circle of life and fairytale herds

2174
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:47,629
you're chasing something that doesn't exist

2175
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:49,542
I don't know that Milele exists but

2176
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:51,957
right now it's the
only hope we have

2177
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,207
we don't need hope

2178
00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:54,741
We need food.

2179
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:58,053
Oh, good job, brother.

2180
00:50:58,077 --> 00:50:59,588
Real nice.

2181
00:50:59,612 --> 00:51:01,223
There's trouble in the trees.

2182
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,026
My first tree of trouble, and I am going
to cast, not going.

2183
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,127
I am staying right here.

2184
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:05,861
Thank you.

2185
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:06,595
Come on, Sarabi

2186
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:09,331
Looks like there's dinner headed our
way.

2187
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,433
Sarabi, if I may.

2188
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:14,770
He makes a valid point, Your Highness.

2189
00:51:14,794 --> 00:51:17,663
But, on the other hand, he's a starving
lion who wants to eat me, so I am

2190
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:19,698
slightly torn.

2191
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:24,820
I think that went quite well, all things
considered.

2192
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:39,133
And now, Kiara, this is where I come in.

2193
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:47,843
Rafiki

2194
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:52,908
We will have order in the Congress of
baboon. Tonight a cheetah came into our

2195
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:53,775
..trees for..

2196
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:57,019
-..the third night in a row
- Almost took one of our own

2197
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:58,447
- It was figured for he summoned

2198
00:51:58,471 --> 00:52:03,578
-..the beast with his dreams
-Rafiki and his visions must be banished once and for all

2199
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:04,987
Rafiki tried to warn you.

2200
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:06,722
His dreams conjure our enemies.

2201
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:08,857
He talks to the spirits, summons the devil.

2202
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:09,858
What are you talking about?

2203
00:52:09,882 --> 00:52:11,059
He's done it before.

2204
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,160
His brother was chased

2205
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:14,630
from these very trees, never to be seen
again.

2206
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:16,031
Rafiki was just a child.

2207
00:52:16,055 --> 00:52:19,701
A child, born with a leg that does not
work, yet somehow he survived?

2208
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:24,306
It was Rafiki who found water in the dry
season, who healed you, Inaki, when you

2209
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:24,773
were sick.

2210
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:28,343
He speaks to the insects, converses with
the moon.

2211
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:31,337
Zala, you know what will happen if you
send him down from the trees.

2212
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:34,483
He is Amalaniwa, a curse to us all.

2213
00:52:34,507 --> 00:52:35,384
That's not true.

2214
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:36,752
He doesn't belong here.

2215
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:41,826
All in favor of banishment, cover one
eye.

2216
00:52:47,953 --> 00:52:50,299
And so, it is time.

2217
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,267
No, wait.

2218
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,835
Where will you go?

2219
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:59,241
Where I should have gone long ago, to
find all that was lost.

2220
00:52:59,265 --> 00:53:00,309
My family.

2221
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,811
You can't survive on your own.

2222
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:04,279
Nobody can.

2223
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:08,684
And yet, here we are.

2224
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,118
Oh, Rafiki.

2225
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:15,963
The eye never forgets what the heart has
seen.

2226
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:03,129
Hmm.

2227
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:05,240
Jamaa.

2228
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:08,307
Hmph.

2229
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:13,949
You can try to run, but I'm afraid you
won't get very far.

2230
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:16,685
And why would I run from you?

2231
00:54:16,709 --> 00:54:18,820
Because we're lions.

2232
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:21,923
As in, lion!

2233
00:54:21,947 --> 00:54:26,328
A flea can trouble a lion more than a
lion can trouble a flea.

2234
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:29,031
I don't think you understand what's
about to happen.

2235
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:30,899
There's no place for you to go.

2236
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:32,801
I am going forward.

2237
00:54:32,825 --> 00:54:34,469
I seriously doubt that.

2238
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:38,307
It is easy to doubt everything when you
know nothing.

2239
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,642
Can we get on with this, please?

2240
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:44,179
If you take my life, you will never find
Milele.

2241
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:44,746
Wait.

2242
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,048
Did you say Milele?

2243
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:49,184
That is where I am going, toward the
light.

2244
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,687
I have been there many times.

2245
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:54,990
In my dreams, my brother waits for me there.

2246
00:54:55,014 --> 00:54:57,759
I have seen the tree, can picture it..

2247
00:54:57,783 --> 00:55:03,332
-..The two of us together again
-And why would anyone trust a baboon's dream

2248
00:55:03,356 --> 00:55:08,560
Sometimes the dream is all you have.
The only truth that lives in you

2249
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:11,000
Like the memory of a great king

2250
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,881
how did you know..

2251
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:14,900
okay help us get to Milele.
And we will..

2252
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,833
-..let you live do we have a deal
-no
-what?!

2253
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:22,307
- why?!
-Rafiki will let you live

2254
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:26,321
- Had enough of this!
-Taka, do not eat.

2255
00:55:26,345 --> 00:55:29,558
Wonderful, another misfit stray
we're not supposed to eat.

2256
00:55:29,582 --> 00:55:32,260
So you expect us to follow this baboon

2257
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:35,163
to a place nobody has ever seen.

2258
00:55:35,187 --> 00:55:36,598
I'll be better off alone.

2259
00:55:36,622 --> 00:55:40,769
Hey, Tombazan, a single stick may smoke,

2260
00:55:40,793 --> 00:55:43,931
but it will never burn.

2261
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:47,676
Okay, now that there's five of us,

2262
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,644
why don't we all go around

2263
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,545
and say a fun fact about ourselves?

2264
00:55:50,569 --> 00:55:51,580
I'll go first.

2265
00:55:51,604 --> 00:55:54,716
I once had a crush on a flamingo.

2266
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,152
I've never said that out loud.

2267
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:58,620
And they're walking away.

2268
00:55:58,644 --> 00:56:00,555
Yep, places to go, kingdoms to see.

2269
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:02,972
We're busy, let's hustle.

2270
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:12,968
Wait, wait, wait.

2271
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:15,037
Now you're the star of this thing?

2272
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:17,572
Someone's a little tired of being second
banana, huh?

2273
00:56:17,596 --> 00:56:19,841
All of a sudden there's a lot of Rafiki
in the story.

2274
00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:22,344
You even gave yourself a long-lost
brother.

2275
00:56:22,368 --> 00:56:24,079
What's next, a funny catchphrase?

2276
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,314
You gonna be farting next?

2277
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,014
That's my thing.

2278
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:31,119
You cannot tell the story of Mufasa
without the story of Rafiki.

2279
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:33,989
Oh, now he's even talking about himself
in the third person.

2280
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:35,424
Pretty soon he'll have his own
fragrance.

2281
00:56:35,448 --> 00:56:37,993
And I'm the only one with a fragrance
around here.

2282
00:56:38,017 --> 00:56:42,731
It's called Pumba by Pumba, and from
what I hear, it's pretty gross.

2283
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:43,899
Mom?

2284
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:44,700
Dad?

2285
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:47,669
If you can hear me, come home.

2286
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:53,713
Please, come home.

2287
00:56:58,704 --> 00:57:01,984
Mother.

2288
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:06,725
Mother.

2289
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:09,424
Milele.

2290
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:13,799
Mother!

2291
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:30,242
Rafiki

2292
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:31,064
Hi, Suga.

2293
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:32,370
What are you doing?

2294
00:57:32,395 --> 00:57:33,064
I am fishing.

2295
00:57:33,089 --> 00:57:35,399
You're sitting on a
rock with your eyes closed.

2296
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:36,974
My eyes are open.

2297
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:38,289
It is my lids that are closed.

2298
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:41,295
Why am I talking to a baboon?

2299
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,260
I am not a baboon, I am a mandrill.

2300
00:57:45,284 --> 00:57:48,163
No offense, but a monkey is a monkey.

2301
00:57:48,187 --> 00:57:49,765
And a stray is a stray.

2302
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:50,732
What's that supposed to mean?

2303
00:57:50,756 --> 00:57:54,002
It means we are very much the same.

2304
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:54,770
Siafana.

2305
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:56,638
We are nothing alike.

2306
00:57:56,662 --> 00:57:58,006
Take a good look.

2307
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,942
I am a lion.

2308
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:03,578
A lion who fears water, fears his own
reflection.

2309
00:58:03,602 --> 00:58:07,649
Who can't sleep because of what he sees
when he closes his eyes.

2310
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:08,684
Huh?

2311
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,853
You are afraid of your dreams, Mufasa.

2312
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:14,056
Afraid of what you see in them.

2313
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,925
I see my parents.

2314
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:19,394
I feel them everywhere.

2315
00:58:19,418 --> 00:58:21,596
Of course you do, Mufasa.

2316
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,833
You will feel them forever.

2317
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:25,968
My mother.

2318
00:58:25,992 --> 00:58:28,403
I hear her voice.

2319
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:35,711
She tells me that we are on a journey to
Milele, but I feel so lost without her.

2320
00:58:35,735 --> 00:58:39,314
Your journey is not a dream, Mufasa.

2321
00:58:39,338 --> 00:58:41,350
Your mother is guiding you.

2322
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:46,610
And where you are going, a family
awaits.

2323
00:58:57,523 --> 00:58:59,167
What are you doing?

2324
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:00,602
We're starving.

2325
00:59:00,626 --> 00:59:02,404
It was not its time.

2326
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:09,915
Instead, the fish has agreed to let us
share the water.

2327
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:18,287
I have a report!

2328
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:19,988
It's morning.

2329
00:59:20,012 --> 00:59:22,089
End of report.

2330
00:59:29,588 --> 00:59:34,202
The Earth Divided is now a choice,
around or down.

2331
00:59:34,226 --> 00:59:37,355
The decision is yours.

2332
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:48,649
Look out there, beyond the light, across
the deepest canyon.

2333
00:59:48,674 --> 00:59:51,520
Across the deepest canyon?

2334
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:52,421
We should go down.

2335
00:59:52,445 --> 00:59:52,988
Why?

2336
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:55,057
Because of some fairy tale?

2337
00:59:55,081 --> 00:59:56,591
The rocks will hide our tracks.

2338
00:59:56,615 --> 00:59:58,226
It's safer to go around.

2339
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,685
I picked up their scent.

2340
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:02,531
The only thing you picked up is a
hallucinating baboon.

2341
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:03,699
I'm a mandrill.

2342
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:05,634
This is a waste of time.

2343
01:00:05,658 --> 01:00:07,102
close your eyes.

2344
01:00:07,126 --> 01:00:07,903
What?

2345
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:11,440
Tell me what you see, what you feel.

2346
01:00:11,464 --> 01:00:12,708
There's nothing on the wind.

2347
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:14,843
No, they're moving through the
bushwallow.

2348
01:00:14,867 --> 01:00:15,477
They who?

2349
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:17,746
The females, out front.

2350
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:18,547
Come on.

2351
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:20,048
Clear thoughts.

2352
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:20,749
Concentrate.

2353
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:24,347
I am concentrating.

2354
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:39,134
He's right, we have to go down.

2355
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:42,904
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, you're born on
fire.

2356
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:46,642
Now the many sticks will make fire as
one.

2357
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,411
Come on, we have places to go.

2358
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:51,847
And kingdoms to save.

2359
01:00:51,871 --> 01:00:53,849
And kingdoms to save.

2360
01:00:53,873 --> 01:00:57,085
What's up, baby?

As we headed across the great valley,
the hunters tracked our every move.

2738
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:43,752
Kiros, they are not alone.

2739
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:45,621
They've connected a lioness.

2740
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:51,563
And a monkey.

2741
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,268
Mufasa!

2742
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,303
Mufasa, you have to help me.

2743
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:02,337
Help you how?

2744
01:04:02,361 --> 01:04:03,705
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

2745
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:06,041
She is the light my mother spoke of.

2746
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:06,575
What?

2747
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:07,743
She's special.

2748
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:10,646
The most amazing female I've ever met in
my life.

2749
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,780
I don't know what to say to her.

2750
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:13,682
You've spent your life with females.

2751
01:04:13,706 --> 01:04:15,684
Please, tell me what to say.

2752
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,185
Just talk to her.

2753
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:18,220
Be yourself.

2754
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:20,389
Oh, Mufasa, you don't understand.

2755
01:04:20,413 --> 01:04:23,225
Myself isn't good enough.

2756
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:26,528
You just know things.

2757
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:28,630
Fine, fine.

2758
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:29,865
Keep it simple.

2759
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,533
Ask her a question.

2760
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,001
Right, a question.

2761
01:04:33,025 --> 01:04:34,369
This is good.

2762
01:04:34,393 --> 01:04:36,004
Yeah, try to be...

2763
01:04:36,028 --> 01:04:37,172
confident.

2764
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:38,006
Disinterested.

2765
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,641
But I'm very interested.

2766
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:42,344
Tell her about the flowers.

2767
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:43,178
What flowers?

2768
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:44,880
The valley she comes from.

2769
01:04:44,904 --> 01:04:47,049
There's flowers everywhere.

2770
01:04:47,073 --> 01:04:48,984
They're called duck flowers.

2771
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:50,686
Long stems.

2772
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,455
It's absolutely beautiful.

2773
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:54,523
How do you know that?

2774
01:04:54,547 --> 01:04:58,193
When she passes, I can smell them on her
fur.

2775
01:04:58,217 --> 01:04:59,962
Okay.

2776
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:00,929
Flowers.

2777
01:05:00,953 --> 01:05:01,964
Disinterested.

2778
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:05,500
And here's the most important thing,
okay?

2779
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:08,303
Listen when she speaks.

2780
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:10,405
 Male has trouble with that one.

2781
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:11,907
Sorry.

2782
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:14,309
What did you say?

2783
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,278
Really.

2784
01:05:16,302 --> 01:05:18,580
I heard you, brother.

2785
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:21,195
I'm gonna make you proud.

2786
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:34,763
It's very hot, isn't it?

2787
01:05:34,787 --> 01:05:35,163
Yep.

2788
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:38,166
Oh

2789
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,067
I

2790
01:05:39,091 --> 01:05:40,435
Love listening.

2791
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:41,169
Okay.

2792
01:05:41,193 --> 01:05:44,640
I'm listening right now to what what you
just said.

2793
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:47,676
- You're the one that's talking
-I am

2794
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,199
-You smell like a duck
-what

2795
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:55,700
-flower. A duckflower
-how do you know about those flowers?

2796
01:05:56,509 --> 01:06:02,190
Well, I inhaled you with my nose I can
smell them

2797
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:03,225
Amazing.

2798
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:07,353
Our valley was full of those flowers,
thousands of them, as far as the eye

2799
01:06:07,353 --> 01:06:07,929
could see.

2800
01:06:07,953 --> 01:06:08,997
It was...

2801
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:12,067
it was the most beautiful place, Taka.

2802
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:14,503
Did he just say she smells like a duck?

2803
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:20,412
And you called me a baboon.

2804
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:36,083
We shouldn't be here
-the migration patterns are broken.

2805
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:37,709
I-I-don't.. understand

2806
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:40,774
This is not a drill
Just to be clear

2807
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:43,415
I never signed up for this.

2808
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,233
It's okay.
It's safe.

2809
01:06:46,258 --> 01:06:49,058
They're on the other side

2810
01:06:49,082 --> 01:06:49,804
No!

2811
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:51,538
They can just jump across.

2812
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:52,881
We're trapped.

2813
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,304
What do we do?

2814
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:58,946
-The elephants will fight with us
-and why would they do that
-because I'm going to ask them

2815
01:06:59,011 --> 01:07:01,357
Got a better idea?

2816
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:02,600
Yes,

2817
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:06,622
Mr. Ask-Questions-First, get ready to run.

2818
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:08,256
Where is she going?

2819
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,924
Hello?

2820
01:07:08,948 --> 01:07:10,359
Listen to me, please.

2821
01:07:10,383 --> 01:07:11,259
We need your help.

2822
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:12,327
Can you talk to me?

2823
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:15,497
We need your help, please.

2824
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:18,467
They're coming!

2825
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:18,867
Sarabi!

2826
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:20,168
Sarabi, wait!

2827
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:20,802
Sarabi, wait!

2828
01:07:20,826 --> 01:07:21,703
Sarabi, wait!

2829
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,506
Wait, where is she going?

2830
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,608
She's going for the hive!

2831
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:32,408
Like I said, get ready to run!

2832
01:07:42,514 --> 01:07:43,981
Run!

2833
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:45,847
Get to the trees!

2834
01:07:45,872 --> 01:07:50,222
Why am I running?

2835
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,987
Your Highness!

2836
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:19,038
Hold on!

2837
01:08:19,063 --> 01:08:20,013
Zazu!

2838
01:08:26,592 --> 01:08:31,143
Sarabi!

2839
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:43,952


2840
01:08:44,577 --> 01:08:46,843
Back your throat!

2841
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:47,956
Do not retreat!

2842
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:08,691
I got you.

2843
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:09,511
I got you.

2844
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:13,267
Sarabi, I got you.

2845
01:09:19,412 --> 01:09:20,589
That's right.

2846
01:09:20,613 --> 01:09:24,960
Run along, little kitty-cats.

2847
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:28,836
Thank you, my friend.

2848
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,194
Over here.

2849
01:09:58,692 --> 01:10:05,012
(speaking foreign language)

2850
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:12,512
Alive, she's alive.

2851
01:10:17,603 --> 01:10:19,648
Why are you all looking at me?

2852
01:10:19,672 --> 01:10:21,984
You were thrown from the tree.

2853
01:10:22,008 --> 01:10:25,487
He saved your life.

2854
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:26,521
Who?

2855
01:10:26,545 --> 01:10:28,090
Taka.

2856
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:29,758
Taka saved you.

2857
01:10:29,782 --> 01:10:35,063
Isn't that right, brother?

2858
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:37,666
You saved me?

2859
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:38,424
Well, I...

2860
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:40,335
I had to do something.

2861
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:42,671
Thank you.

2862
01:10:42,695 --> 01:10:43,872
We're lucky.

2863
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,708
Those bees almost killed us all.

2864
01:10:46,732 --> 01:10:48,510
Those bees saved our lives.

2865
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:50,138
huh... Mufasa...

2866
01:10:49,363 --> 01:10:49,860
Uh, really?

2867
01:10:50,464 --> 01:10:52,660
Because, uh, it felt like an elephant
stampede.

2868
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:53,982
We're alive, aren't we?

2869
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:55,350
The elephants would have fought with us.

2870
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:56,485
We're lions.

2871
01:10:56,509 --> 01:10:57,986
Nobody will fight with us.

2872
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:02,694
Not out here.

2873
01:11:08,045 --> 01:11:09,731
Where is he going?

2874
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:13,913
Beyond the horizon itself.

2875
01:11:15,461 --> 01:11:16,638
Mufasa..

2876
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:19,509
Thank you.

2877
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:32,854
Rafiki, who...

2878
01:11:32,878 --> 01:11:35,390
who are the Outsiders?

2879
01:11:35,414 --> 01:11:40,853
Well, the Outsiders come from many
tribes, but when they are born, they are

2880
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:41,754
hated because

2881
01:11:41,754 --> 01:11:44,199
they are different from their tribe.

2882
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:45,867
Like you and your tribe?

2883
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:47,803
Yes, just like me.

2884
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:52,207
But Rafiki, why do they want to hurt
everybody?

2885
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:56,211
Sometimes when the people most like you
don't love you,

2886
01:11:56,235 --> 01:11:59,648
it is the hurt that can cause the
greatest pain.

2887
01:11:59,672 --> 01:12:04,686
And this pain can lead you to hate
everything.

2888
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:07,489
I'm glad that didn't happen to you,
Rafiki.

2889
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:11,193
Yes, my child, I'm glad too.

2890
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:12,551
Um, hi, we're here too.

2891
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:14,830
Yeah, why are you leaving us outside
this story

2892
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:17,866
And I'm pretty sure we are the ultimate
outsiders!

2893
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,868
Yeah, we've always been misunderstood.

2894
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:22,581
I contain multitudes.

2895
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:29,845
There are many ways to Milele.

2896
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:33,462
But this, were ours.

2897
01:12:40,846 --> 01:12:42,057
Go.

2898
01:12:42,081 --> 01:12:43,792
Go, Mufasa.

2899
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:46,662
Find your forever.

2900
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:49,974
I got you, Sarabi.

2901
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,382
I got you.

2902
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:12,854
Hey, Rafiki.

2903
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:14,523
What are you doing?

2904
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:21,063
I am confirming my vision, Mufasa.

2905
01:13:21,087 --> 01:13:23,298
Can I ask you something, Rafiki?

2906
01:13:23,322 --> 01:13:24,166
Hmm?

2907
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:26,935
How many of your visions have come true?

2908
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,971
So far, none.

2909
01:13:28,995 --> 01:13:29,605
None?

2910
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:31,340
But it's not what I see.

2911
01:13:31,364 --> 01:13:32,941
It's what I feel.

2912
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:34,843
But how do you...

2913
01:13:34,867 --> 01:13:37,813
how do you know when you should follow a
feeling?

2914
01:13:37,837 --> 01:13:40,248
Milele exists.

2915
01:13:40,272 --> 01:13:43,251
I feel it in here.

2916
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:48,290
The question is, what do you feel,
Mufasa?

2917
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:51,098
In there.

2918
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:12,413
The whether shifted. There's not enough for a smell.

2919
01:14:12,438 --> 01:14:17,486
Hey, if the outsiders find our tracks,
they'll follow them to Milele.

2920
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,421
Zazu, only you can help us.

2921
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:21,657
Um, are you quite sure about that?

2922
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:24,583
No, I was actually thinking that Rafiki
looks pretty handy, and with the stick...

2923
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,896
Zazu, you can use your wings to cover
our tracks as we head up the mountain

2924
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,464
without leaving a trace.

2925
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:31,390
Hey, you can do this.

2926
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,635
Oh, hmm, yeah.

2927
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:34,870
Yes, sir, you're right.

2928
01:14:34,894 --> 01:14:37,342
I've got this.

2929
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:43,278
Okay, it's just me, get to the frozen
mountain, and a one-horned bill

2930
01:14:43,302 --> 01:14:44,579
charged with saving the future.

2931
01:14:44,603 --> 01:14:45,314
Whoa!

2932
01:14:45,338 --> 01:14:47,482
Mummy!

2933
01:14:47,506 --> 01:14:48,417
Ah!

2934
01:14:48,441 --> 01:14:51,340
Oh, I'm out of life, that's cold!

2935
01:15:04,924 --> 01:15:06,702
What's happening?

2936
01:15:06,726 --> 01:15:13,108
We can't keep stopping somehow they have
come out their tracks in the snow

2937
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:15,210
It's not possible

2938
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:17,375
It could be anywhere on this mountain

2939
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:20,557
Then find them! Now.

2940
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,777
Zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu.

2941
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:33,152
I have a report the outsiders are
completely lost

2942
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:35,887
-well played, Mufasa
-Great jobs, zazu

2943
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:38,235
-As per usual
-I knew you could do it

2944
01:15:38,259 --> 01:15:42,982
-We did it
-We did it
-No, you did it

2945
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:45,031
-Great thinking Mufasa

2946
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:47,142
-Now we're all rubbing off on each other probably normal thing

2947
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:55,166
to do who wants to rub against us? no one.
I'm leaving now. Scout ahead

2948
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,031
I got you, Rafiki..

2949
01:16:09,055 --> 01:16:11,400
I got you.

2950
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:16,308
Yeah, I got you.

2951
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:22,504
Mufasa, I got you.

2952
01:16:34,647 --> 01:16:39,227
Hidden in the shadows, downwind, right
afoot.

2953
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:41,463
Interesting hunting style, Mufasa.

2954
01:16:41,487 --> 01:16:45,067
We have to eat something before we take
on that descent.

2955
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:47,369
Unfortunately, there's nothing to hunt
up here.

2956
01:16:47,393 --> 01:16:48,670
See under that rock?

2957
01:16:48,694 --> 01:16:51,239
There's a civet about to leave his den.

2958
01:16:51,263 --> 01:16:54,509
Of course you can smell a civet hidden
in the snow.

2959
01:16:54,533 --> 01:16:57,946
You, the lion who can do anything.

2960
01:16:57,970 --> 01:16:59,348
What's that supposed to mean?

2961
01:16:59,372 --> 01:17:02,451
It means, I see you, Mufasa.

2962
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:04,286
I don't know what you're talking about.

2963
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:08,490
Now, that part I believe, because, smart
as you are,

2964
01:17:08,514 --> 01:17:11,126
you have a way of seeing everything but
yourself.

2965
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,861
What is this?

2966
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:14,730
What is this, Sarabi?

2967
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:17,799
There's a civet in the snow, right where
you said it would be.

2968
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:20,202
And you smelled the outsiders on the
wind,

2969
01:17:20,226 --> 01:17:22,738
which means you're the one who smelled
the flowers on my fur.

2970
01:17:22,762 --> 01:17:23,739
It was a lucky guess.

2971
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:26,408
You can smell the exact flower from my
belly.

2972
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:27,109
No!

2973
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:28,143
That's not possible.

2974
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:32,514
You saved me, held me, covered me in the
stampede, comforted me.

2975
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:33,482
No, it was Taka.

2976
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:34,449
I got you.

2977
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:36,033
I got you, Sarabi

2978
01:17:36,058 --> 01:17:37,119
I'm here to protect him.

2979
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:37,919
That was you.

2980
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:40,222
I was lost in the water and he found me.

2981
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:41,323
My brother saved me.

2982
01:17:41,347 --> 01:17:42,924

3649
01:21:48,716 --> 01:21:49,214
♪ Out--! ♪

3650
01:22:33,204 --> 01:22:37,251
This is a tool of a great king.

3651
01:22:55,528 --> 01:23:01,510
There wasn't much to eat on this
mountain, until now.

3652
01:23:01,534 --> 01:23:04,913
Tell me, how did you cut me a traction
of snow?

3653
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:06,748
A bird helped us.

3654
01:23:06,772 --> 01:23:09,484
Lion, get in help for me, pet.

3655
01:23:09,508 --> 01:23:12,321
Just as I will help you.

3656
01:23:12,345 --> 01:23:14,022
You will help us?

3657
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:17,092
You think we need help from a wounded
coward?

3658
01:23:17,116 --> 01:23:25,992
I may hold the blood of a king, but it
was Mufasa who killed your son.

3659
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:34,076
It was Mufasa who trapped you up here,
outspotted you at every turn.

3660
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:39,681
Now I will lead you to him, and to
Milele.

3661
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:40,339
Milele?

3662
01:23:40,339 --> 01:23:45,087
Milele is nothing but a dream, a vision
sold to cops.

3663
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:46,021
Ah.

3664
01:23:46,045 --> 01:23:48,023
Well, tell that to the monkey.

3665
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:49,925
He leads them to it.

3666
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:51,426
Look at you.

3667
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:56,598
A pack of starving wolves, clinging to
the side of a mountain.

3668
01:23:56,622 --> 01:23:58,634
No tracks to follow.

3669
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:04,106
Only one chance at revenge.

3670
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:06,575
Me?

3671
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:09,611
Revenge.

3672
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:12,681
What about your father?

3673
01:24:12,705 --> 01:24:15,083
Because of Mufasa.

3674
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:18,253
I have no father.

3675
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:21,623
He did this?

3676
01:24:21,647 --> 01:24:23,025
Yes.

3677
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:27,462
You lost a father, and I, a son.

3678
01:24:27,486 --> 01:24:31,566
Taka, will you join us?

3679
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:37,205
Together, we can both have our revenge.

3680
01:24:37,229 --> 01:24:44,701
It will be my pleasure, King.

3681
01:25:06,697 --> 01:25:07,392
Taka?

3682
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:10,114
Taka, where've you been?

3683
01:25:11,327 --> 01:25:12,410
Hunting.

3684
01:25:12,435 --> 01:25:16,677
I couldn't find anything but I was never as good as you

3685
01:25:16,702 --> 01:25:24,686
..or my mother. there's something I need to tell you.
There's something I need to

3686
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:30,959
tell you I need to thank you. You kept
your word to Eshe and Obasi

3687
01:25:30,983 --> 01:25:40,740
You saved me, Mufasa, and I will never
forget what you've done, my brother.

3688
01:25:42,228 --> 01:25:48,543
Oh, guys, I have found a way down, just
beyond those near peaks.

3689
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:53,785
Is it something I said?

3690
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:02,624
Hey Rafiki.

3691
01:26:02,648 --> 01:26:10,328
Yes, we are nearing destiny Mufasa, and
so the earth must shake.

3692
01:26:27,673 --> 01:26:31,820
Okay, now I am a hundred million percent
sure who Taka is.

3693
01:26:31,844 --> 01:26:32,854
Just be honest, is it me?

3694
01:26:32,878 --> 01:26:35,290
In case you missed it, we're not
featured in this.

3695
01:26:35,314 --> 01:26:37,025
I think the sit-it has more screen
time.

3696
01:26:37,049 --> 01:26:38,489
Hey, maybe they'll put us in the play.

3697
01:26:38,514 --> 01:26:40,295
No, no, please don't mention the play
again.

3698
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:42,798
I-I-I went to see it on nothing but a
giant sock puppet.

3699
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:43,589
You went to see it?

3700
01:26:43,589 --> 01:26:44,499
You didn't bring me?

3701
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:48,070
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi are in love?

3702
01:26:48,094 --> 01:26:48,804
Ew, love?

3703
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:52,441
That sounds gross and not something like
I constantly think about and really want.

3704
01:26:52,465 --> 01:26:53,875
What is Taka gonna do to them?

3705
01:26:53,899 --> 01:27:01,437
Little one, Taka's heart was broken and
now his trap was set.

3706
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:18,166
Mufasa, do you see?

3707
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,102
I don't believe it.

3708
01:27:20,126 --> 01:27:22,874
The other side of the light.

3709
01:27:22,898 --> 01:27:25,021
(sighs)

3710
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:27,483
Milele..

3711
01:28:15,781 --> 01:28:21,390
I can't believe it we found it
We found Milele

3712
01:28:21,444 --> 01:28:22,191
Yes

3713
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:27,669
You found it brother
You always do

3714
01:29:06,658 --> 01:29:07,591
Rafiki

3715
01:29:09,647 --> 01:29:10,647
This is the tree

3716
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:12,515
From your vision

3717
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:22,301
I've seen this tree many times, and in
each vision there was always a brother, standing

3718
01:29:22,326 --> 01:29:24,159
But there's no one here, Rafiki.

3719
01:29:24,183 --> 01:29:26,928
You came here to find your twin.

3720
01:29:26,952 --> 01:29:29,564
He was taken from me long ago.

3721
01:29:29,588 --> 01:29:34,770
What I saw in my dreams was a brother,
standing right here.

3722
01:29:34,794 --> 01:29:36,138
A friend?

3723
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,506
Family.

3724
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,574
What I saw was you.

3725
01:29:39,598 --> 01:29:41,009
The unseeable.

3726
01:29:41,033 --> 01:29:43,845
I saw Mufasa.

3727
01:29:43,869 --> 01:29:44,713
Me?

3728
01:29:44,737 --> 01:29:46,615
Yes, you.

3729
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,459
My brother.

3730
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:55,259
Mufasa

3731
01:29:55,284 --> 01:29:56,925
How do you know who I am?

3732
01:29:56,949 --> 01:30:00,896
We know the outsiders are hunting you,
and we fear you'll bring danger.

3733
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,298
No, no, we covered our tracks.

3734
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:07,002
I promise you, Milele is a safe place,
and I would never do anything to

3735
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:11,340
jeopardize that.

3736
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,909
Do not run!

3737
01:30:13,933 --> 01:30:16,011
You have nothing to fear.

3738
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,413
We are not here to move.

3739
01:30:18,437 --> 01:30:19,982
We have come...

3740
01:30:20,006 --> 01:30:22,150
for Mufasa!

3741
01:30:22,174 --> 01:30:24,620
How did they get here?

3742
01:30:24,644 --> 01:30:30,595
Do not let him divide us!

3743
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,062
Esmeralda knows Mufasa.

3744
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:36,765
The Circle...

3745
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:39,368
The Circle is broken.

3746
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,269
No!

3747
01:30:40,293 --> 01:30:42,004
Mufasa, what are you doing?

3748
01:30:42,028 --> 01:30:45,574
I'm going to fight, and I'm going to
show them that they can fight too.

3749
01:30:45,598 --> 01:30:48,977
Rafiki, when you hear my signal, help me
call them together.

3750
01:30:49,001 --> 01:30:51,947
Yes, my brother.

3751
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:54,416
There are other lions here.

3752
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,350
Find them.

3753
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:58,720
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

3754
01:30:58,744 --> 01:31:00,589
Mufasa, you're not alone.

3755
01:31:00,613 --> 01:31:05,891
It's my turn to go ask questions first.

3756
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:20,742
This is where the hunt ends, Mufasa.

3757
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:25,147
Thanks to your brother, he left a trail
of scars for us to follow.

3758
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:28,784
He made a deal to save himself, and gave
us this kingdom.

3759
01:31:28,808 --> 01:31:30,052
Tell me he's lying.

3760
01:31:30,076 --> 01:31:31,820
He asked us to kill the Stray.

3761
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:33,121
Taka, please!

3762
01:31:33,145 --> 01:31:41,145
I am the son of a king, but Sarabi chose
you, just like mother, just like my own father.

3763
01:31:41,554 --> 01:31:44,499
I saved you, and you betrayed me.

3764
01:31:44,523 --> 01:31:46,535
What have you done?

3765
01:31:46,559 --> 01:31:47,469
I'm your brother!

3766
01:31:47,493 --> 01:31:48,337
Fight with me!

3767
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:50,939
You stole my destiny.

3768
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:54,242
Now this is yours.

3769
01:31:54,266 --> 01:31:56,678
He's one of us now.

3770
01:31:56,702 --> 01:31:59,815
My son's name...

3771
01:31:59,839 --> 01:32:01,850
Shaju.

3772
01:32:01,874 --> 01:32:03,685
Shaju!

3773
01:32:03,709 --> 01:32:06,088
All of this should have been his.

3774
01:32:06,112 --> 01:32:12,656
And now, I will rule it without mercy.

3775
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:16,771
Oh

3776
01:32:16,796 --> 01:32:20,492
This one is mine.

3777
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:07,382
Please, we can't waste this battle
alone.

3778
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:08,951
There's nothing we can do.

3779
01:33:08,975 --> 01:33:11,737
They chased us from our pride lands
before.

3780
01:33:11,762 --> 01:33:12,739
They're too strong.

3781
01:33:12,764 --> 01:33:13,741
Fight with us.

3782
01:33:13,766 --> 01:33:15,455
Fight for your young.

3783
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,542
For your future!

3784
01:33:16,567 --> 01:33:17,475
What future?

3785
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,069
They've taken all we have!

3786
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,145
And they will always take more.

3787
01:33:44,844 --> 01:33:51,093
I am Mufasa, a stray with no pride, and
yet I stand before you, head unbound.

3788
01:33:51,117 --> 01:33:55,364
I know you're afraid, but trust me,
nothing will change if we remain

3789
01:33:55,388 --> 01:33:56,932
isolated to our own

3790
01:33:56,956 --> 01:34:00,102
tribes without concern for the fate of
others.

3791
01:34:00,126 --> 01:34:02,170
But why should we stand with you?

3792
01:34:02,194 --> 01:34:03,939
This is your fight.

3793
01:34:03,963 --> 01:34:08,243
Today they are here for us lions, but I
assure you, as you let them walk among

3794
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,001
you in search

3795
01:34:09,001 --> 01:34:09,911
of us now.

3796
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:12,547
They are plotting to come for you
tomorrow.

3797
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:14,549
One lion's hope cannot change the

3798
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:15,784
fate of Milele.

3799
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:20,289
There is no lion as large as an
elephant, as strong as an oxen, fast

3800
01:34:20,313 --> 01:34:25,160
as a cheetah, or tall as a giraffe, who
can soar and scout as wide and far as

3801
01:34:25,184 --> 01:34:25,727
the cranes

3802
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:27,162
and hawks in the sky.

3803
01:34:27,186 --> 01:34:29,464
So, can't you see?

3804
01:34:29,488 --> 01:34:32,367
Every being has a place in the circle of
life.

3805
01:34:32,391 --> 01:34:34,269
My breath is your breath.

3806
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:36,171
Your fight is my fight.

3807
01:34:36,195 --> 01:34:39,868
I will not bend to evil, and neither
should you

3808
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:53,088
Mufasa is right, Milele is home.

3809
01:34:53,112 --> 01:35:00,095
We must stand with Mufasa!

3810
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:02,264
Together we shall stand strong!

3811
01:35:02,288 --> 01:35:07,272
For Milele!

3812
01:35:10,963 --> 01:35:14,517
It's the Lion!

3813
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:29,140
From this moment on, everything the
Light touches belongs to me.

3814
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:31,527
You'll have to take it.

3815
01:35:55,474 --> 01:35:57,270
Bye-bye.

3816
01:36:02,906 --> 01:36:07,175
You messed with the wrong hornbill!

3817
01:36:07,203 --> 01:36:08,462
Ha-ha-ha-ha

3818
01:36:08,487 --> 01:36:10,799
The launch is soon.

3819
01:36:10,823 --> 01:36:11,800
Stand down!

3820
01:36:11,824 --> 01:36:16,071
I am highly trained and occasionally
effective!

3821
01:36:16,095 --> 01:36:19,441
This is so embarrassing!

3822
01:36:19,465 --> 01:36:24,503
I do have wings, you know!

3823
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:47,753
Taka.
Taka, please, please!

3824
01:37:49,355 --> 01:37:55,070
You did challenge me.

3825
01:37:55,094 --> 01:38:00,842
You took my son, my future.

3826
01:38:00,866 --> 01:38:05,534
Taka.. Taka, your moment of courage
will come.

3827
01:38:07,406 --> 01:38:09,685
Blood!

3828
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:14,659
Blood!

3829
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,098
Please, don't kill him.

3830
01:38:23,122 --> 01:38:23,988
I didn't kill him.

3831
01:38:24,013 --> 01:38:25,963
You did.

3832
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:55,324
They're coming!

3833
01:38:58,221 --> 01:39:00,002
The last lions.

3834
01:39:00,615 --> 01:39:01,812
Time for their extinction.

3835
01:39:01,837 --> 01:39:04,693
And we'll start with the youngest.

3836
01:39:14,395 --> 01:39:17,789
The earth will shake.

3837
01:39:20,635 --> 01:39:25,585
Attack!

3838
01:39:55,903 --> 01:39:57,387
Mufasa..

3839
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:32,441
close your eyes, and tell me what you
hear.

3840
01:40:32,981 --> 01:40:36,516
 what you feel.

3841
01:42:58,552 --> 01:43:01,398
The king of Milele!

3842
01:43:01,422 --> 01:43:03,422
The king of Milele!

3843
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:06,725
The king!
Mufasa!

3844
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:12,926
Rise, your majesty.

3845
01:43:16,562 --> 01:43:18,327
My king.

3846
01:43:18,351 --> 01:43:20,853
No, no, I'm not...

3847
01:43:20,853 --> 01:43:22,631
King, raise your heads.

3848
01:43:22,655 --> 01:43:23,789
I'm just...

3849
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:25,267
No, no more kings.

3850
01:43:25,291 --> 01:43:26,602
We are all one.

3851
01:43:26,626 --> 01:43:30,005
Please, please, raise your heads.

3852
01:43:30,029 --> 01:43:34,509
But Mufasa, you have brought them
together.

3853
01:43:34,533 --> 01:43:39,348
You held them see in themselves what
they considered unseeable.

3854
01:43:39,372 --> 01:43:41,717
Nothing is more kingly.

3855
01:43:41,741 --> 01:43:43,585
No, Rafiki.

3856
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:45,354
I'm not king.

3857
01:43:45,378 --> 01:43:47,122
I'm not royal blood.

3858
01:43:47,146 --> 01:43:49,057
Don't you see, my brother?

3859
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:52,027
It is not what you were.

3860
01:43:52,051 --> 01:43:56,765
It is what you have become.

3861
01:43:56,789 --> 01:44:02,008
The King of Milele.

3862
01:44:06,465 --> 01:44:14,465
My brother, something beautiful awaits
you.

3863
01:44:27,486 --> 01:44:35,486
But it can't be, it can't be.

3864
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:57,459
Mufasa!

3865
01:44:57,483 --> 01:44:59,895
But how can it be?

3866
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:06,301
I had a son named Mufasa, taken from me
by a great flood.

3867
01:45:06,325 --> 01:45:08,904
Father?

3868
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:14,610
I never stopped hoping, believing, my
son.

3869
01:45:14,634 --> 01:45:17,546
Ah.

3870
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:21,984
I've dreamt of this moment.

3871
01:45:22,008 --> 01:45:24,353
And now it's come true.

3872
01:45:24,378 --> 01:45:26,251
Oh, Mufasa.

3873
01:45:30,816 --> 01:45:34,062
But Father?

3874
01:45:34,086 --> 01:45:38,870
Where's Father?

3875
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,040
He lives in you now...he

3876
01:45:45,064 --> 01:45:47,142
lives...in

3877
01:45:47,166 --> 01:45:51,113
you...I

3878
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:58,244
always dreamed we'd be together
again...and

3879
01:45:58,244 --> 01:46:00,522
I knew it would be...

3880
01:46:00,546 --> 01:46:03,725
in Milelle.

3881
01:46:03,749 --> 01:46:06,228
My son.

3882
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:09,929
 Mufasa.

3883
01:46:15,294 --> 01:46:18,040
Mufasa, please forgive me.

3884
01:46:18,064 --> 01:46:22,377
You must banish him, sire.

3885
01:46:22,401 --> 01:46:28,483
As long as I'm king, my brother will
have a place here.

3886
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:32,930
Brother, I'm so sorry.

3887
01:46:32,955 --> 01:46:36,525
But I won't ever say your name again.

3888
01:46:36,549 --> 01:46:38,727
I can't.

3889
01:46:38,751 --> 01:46:41,096
I won't.

3890
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:47,803
Then call me Scar, so I will never
forget what I have done.

3891
01:46:47,827 --> 01:46:49,938
Scar.

3892
01:46:49,962 --> 01:46:53,343
Your Majesty.

3893
01:47:00,773 --> 01:47:05,088
Welcome home..

3894
01:47:10,073 --> 01:47:11,700
Your Majesty.

3895
01:47:19,191 --> 01:47:27,191
So, Mufasa, I see your family has been
awaiting you in Milele after all.

3896
01:47:27,533 --> 01:47:30,112
Yes, Rafiki.

3897
01:47:30,136 --> 01:47:31,913
 Yes, they were.

3898
01:47:37,877 --> 01:47:41,790
It is your time, Mufasa.

3899
01:47:41,814 --> 01:47:45,027
Rafiki, I wish I could see him.

3900
01:47:45,051 --> 01:47:47,329
I wish I could meet my grandfather.

3901
01:47:47,353 --> 01:47:52,153
As Mufasa once told your father, look
into the heavens, Kiara.

3902
01:47:52,486 --> 01:47:56,176
The great king of the past will always be there

3903
01:47:56,857 --> 01:47:58,117
waiting for you..

3904
01:49:44,503 --> 01:49:48,350
I don't want him to go, Rafiki, I
don't want it to end.

3905
01:49:48,374 --> 01:49:50,619
Don't you see Kiara?

3906
01:49:50,643 --> 01:49:54,323
Mufasa lives in you.

3907
01:49:54,347 --> 01:49:59,030
He lives in you.

3908
01:50:00,486 --> 01:50:02,264
Dad!

3909
01:50:02,288 --> 01:50:04,366
Rafiki, it was unbelievable.

3910
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,300
It was perfect.

3911
01:50:05,324 --> 01:50:06,602
You could not improve on it.

3912
01:50:06,626 --> 01:50:08,370
That said, I do have notes.

3913
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,471
Some suggestions.

3914
01:50:09,495 --> 01:50:12,407
Take them or leave them, but take them.

3915
01:50:12,431 --> 01:50:13,342
Dad!

3916
01:50:13,366 --> 01:50:16,578
Kiara!

3917
01:50:16,602 --> 01:50:18,947
Kiara.

3918
01:50:18,971 --> 01:50:21,350
Dad, where's Mom?

3919
01:50:21,374 --> 01:50:24,086
Well, love, there's something you need
to know.

3920
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:24,720
What?

3921
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:26,221
Did something happen to Mom?

3922
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:29,157
Baby, I'm right here, and I'm fine.

3923
01:50:29,181 --> 01:50:30,826
Where were you?

3924
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:33,996
Kiara, this is your new brother.

3925
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:34,930
Brother?

3926
01:50:34,954 --> 01:50:37,366
I have a brother?

3927
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,333
Hi there.

3928
01:50:38,357 --> 01:50:39,468
I'm Kiara.

3929
01:50:39,492 --> 01:50:41,270
I will take care of you.

3930
01:50:41,294 --> 01:50:44,154
Forever.

3931
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:47,158
Little one, let me tell you a story.

3932
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:51,533
A story of a great king.
