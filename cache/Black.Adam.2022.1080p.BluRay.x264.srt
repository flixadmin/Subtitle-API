00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:44,988
<i>Before Rome, before Babylon,
before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.</i>

3
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:49,155
KAHNDAQ, 2600 BC

4
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,635
<i>The first self-governing people on Earth,</i>

5
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:57,598
<i>Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.</i>

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,146
<i>For centuries, they thrived.</i>

7
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:07,089
<i>But then...</i>

8
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,008
<i>came King Ahk-Ton.</i>

9
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,674
<i>Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.</i>

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,324
<i>But he had even darker ambitions.</i>

11
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,350
<i>Obsessed with dark magic,</i>

12
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:33,798
<i>Ahk-Ton's real goal
was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.</i>

13
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:42,133
<i>If infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world,</i>

14
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,278
<i>it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.</i>

15
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,116
<i>To make the crown, he needed Eternium.</i>

16
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:51,099
<i>A rare mineral of magic properties,
found only in Kahndaq.</i>

17
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:53,770
<i>So he enslaved his own people...</i>

18
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,621
<i>and forced them to dig.</i>

19
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:11,237
Eternium.

20
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,084
Eternium.

21
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,691
Eternium.

22
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,633
<i>Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.</i>

23
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:32,887
<i>What they needed...</i>

24
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,985
Get off him.

25
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:37,601
Get off him.

26
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,733
<i>...was a hero.</i>

27
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,205
Why are we fighting each other?

28
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,986
Remember who our real enemy is.

29
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,726
Come with me.

30
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,050
Look. Eternium.

31
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,044
Let me see that.

32
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,381
The king thanks you.

33
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,400
He's supposed to reward him.

34
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,760
Is that right?

35
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,505
I want what I'm owed.

36
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,560
You want a reward?

37
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,487
The king thanks you for your service.

38
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,445
You want the king's reward too?

39
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:33,815
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

40
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,808
I won't always be here to protect you.

41
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,667
I don't need protection.

42
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,162
I want to be free.

43
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:47,787
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

44
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:49,569
Let someone else be the hero,...

45
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,809
the graveyards are full of them.

46
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:55,121
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

47
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,964
<i>Someone to hold the hopes of the people.</i>

48
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,934
<i>Even when all hope seems lost.</i>

49
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,997
If we had more heroes,...

50
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:14,106
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

51
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,951
Freedom.

52
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:45,083
<i>King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark
could quickly ignite a fire.</i>

53
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:48,102
<i>And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.</i>

54
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:53,935
<i>They thought they were getting a martyr.</i>

55
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,181
<i>Instead,...</i>

56
00:04:58,053 --> 00:04:59,668
<i>they got a miracle.</i>

57
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,986
<i>The Council of Wizards,
the magical guardians of the earth...</i>

58
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,755
You have been chosen.

59
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,784
<i>...sought to restore the balance.</i>

60
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,560
<i>They empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient Gods.</i>

61
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,411
<i>And turned a boy...</i>

62
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,567
<i>into a champion.</i>

63
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,020
S-H-A-Z-A-M.

64
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,303
Hurry.

65
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,249
Give it to me.

66
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,109
<i>But the crown had already been completed.</i>

67
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,977
Give it to me.

68
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,526
<i>And when the Champion arrived
at the palace to challenge him,...</i>

69
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,949
<i>King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.</i>

70
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,571
<i>In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,</i>

71
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:52,337
<i>but the Champion was victorious.</i>

72
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,160
<i>The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac,...</i>

73
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,223
<i>so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.</i>

74
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,561
<i>And the Champion
was never heard from again.</i>

75
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:05,084
KHANDAQ, PRESENT DAY

76
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,616
<i>Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,</i>

77
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:12,557
<i>the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.</i>

78
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,393
<i>But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,</i>

79
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,272
<i>the Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.</i>

80
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,717
<i>It has been a long, long wait.</i>

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,056
Show me your papers.

82
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:44,011
INTERGANG CHECKPOINT
Sector 5 - North Shiruta

83
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,480
Have your documentation ready.

84
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,512
It's all our three documents, yeah?

85
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,051
Don't judge the picture,
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

86
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,010
Open the back. Need a look inside.

87
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,066
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

88
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,777
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

89
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,433
Watch where you're going.
You know the drill, back of the line.

90
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,498
Come on, man, you see me every day.

91
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,964
And every day I tell ya,
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

92
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,504
Back of the line, mate.

93
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,523
You're not my mate.

94
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:35,831
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

95
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,038
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

96
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:40,933
from halfway around the world,

97
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,600
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

98
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:46,148
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

99
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:50,141
oppress our heritage,
and make us wait in lines all day.

100
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:55,022
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,529
Go on, get out of here.

102
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,143
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,858
DETAIN

104
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,885
Adrianna, we're clear.

105
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,102
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

106
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,912
Let's just move the crown first,
and then we can worry about safe.

107
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,744
I got Intergang watching my house.

108
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,630
I gave up my job at the university
and moved four times.

109
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:33,195
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna abandon my country.

110
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:36,172
I'm just saying,
no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

111
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,372
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

112
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:41,527
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

113
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,546
- What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

114
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,385
You know it's too dangerous.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

115
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,363
Come on,
I want to help you beat those bastards.

116
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,143
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

117
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,976
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

118
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,176
Go home, do your homework.

119
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:04,216
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

120
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:05,539
Go.

121
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,347
Go, little man. You did good.

122
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:40,554
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

123
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,444
Is that real Eternium?

124
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,350
Show us a little magic.

125
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:47,530
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

126
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:48,956
You guys should get some rest.

127
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,327
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

128
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:52,473
Hey, come on. Stop it.

129
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,123
I'm just curious how she got it.

130
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,793
My grandmother gave it to me.

131
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,529
- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

132
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,420
It's a family heirloom,

133
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,721
going all the way back to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

134
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,605
You happy now?

135
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,160
Cool story.

136
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:12,745
And all I inherited was a sweater.

137
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,484
That's not true.
Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

138
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,443
You know, some women like a bald spot.

139
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,111
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

140
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,440
Are you sure about this?

141
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:48,514
The inscriptions we found are clear.

142
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,301
And I'm positive about that translation.
There is something inside that mountain.

143
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,154
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

144
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:01,342
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

145
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:04,466
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

146
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:08,699
Get it out of the country if we have to.
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

147
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,241
This is it?

148
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,531
Not yet.

149
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,435
- Are you coming?
- Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

150
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,999
This way. Almost there.

151
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,658
"Men were given the gift of magic,

152
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:53,699
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

153
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,390
Keep reading.

154
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:03,770
"The ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden... here."

155
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,842
Until now.

156
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:10,217
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

157
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:15,883
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs
certain that we want to move it?

158
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:18,021
We don't have a choice.

159
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,714
What happened to Ishmael?

160
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,456
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

161
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,139
Samir?

162
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,399
Samir, what happened?

163
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,394
What?

164
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,547
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

165
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:02,653
Don't move.
Unless you want to join your mate.

166
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,260
Stay where you are.

167
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

168
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,228
"Turn back."

169
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,126
That's what it says, no?

170
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes.

171
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,200
Where is Samir?

172
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:25,080
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

173
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:27,764
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

174
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,840
It's a tomb.

175
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,095
"Speak not his power,

176
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,895
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity." Teth Adam.

177
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:59,100
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

178
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,482
The legend was true.

179
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:04,571
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

180
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:08,230
If he was such a hero,
why'd they bury him down here?

181
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,892
The crown.

182
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,696
It's over.

183
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,988
Now, give me the crown.

184
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,213
Run, Addy. Run.

185
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,495
Hold fire.

186
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,488
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

187
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:35,753
- Go. Move.
- Circle around.

188
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,784
Get down.

189
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,957
Say goodbye to your brother.

190
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,405
In five,...

191
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,509
four,...

192
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,027
three,...

193
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,842
two,...

194
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,184
one!

195
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,645
I'm over here.

196
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:59,387
One? You let them get to one?

197
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,873
Any last words?

198
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,535
Please tell my son...

199
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,843
"Mightiest of mortals,...

200
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,270
God of Gods,

201
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,227
Six Immortal Elders by name,..."

202
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:33,096
What?

203
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:34,203
"Shazam."

204
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,385
Who the hell is that?

205
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:51,037
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

206
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,062
Check him out.

207
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,607
Boss say you go.

208
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,679
Chief say your turn.

209
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,822
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

210
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,652
Open fire.

211
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,549
Your magic is weak.

212
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:10,465
Go. Go.

213
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,437
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

214
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:54,027
Ishmael.

215
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,557
Ishmael.

216
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:32,775
- Let's go.
- This is as fast as I can go.

217
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,996
Samir. What happened?

218
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:05,666
What didn't happen.

219
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,872
Samir fell off of a cliff.

220
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,848
I had a gun to my head.

221
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,781
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

222
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,210
And you summoned some flying magic man.
All for what?

223
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:18,880
Nothing.

224
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:21,977
Not for nothing.

225
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:40,926
Light him up.

226
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:55,463
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

227
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,522
Rotor out. Go. Go.

228
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:00,678
I can't maintain altitude.

229
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,355
Oh, shit.

230
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:38,418
Stop. Stop the van.

231
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,108
Behind you.

232
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,655
Did he just catch a rocket?

233
00:23:22,937 --> 00:23:24,673
ETERNIUM

234
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,653
God willing, we won't see him again.

235
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:13,672
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

236
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:15,600
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

237
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,683
Good point.

238
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:19,758
You get him, you're the electrician.

239
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:28,903
Raptor team, come in.

240
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:30,578
<i>What's your status?</i>

241
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:34,701
Help me.

242
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:39,203
I told you to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

243
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,591
<i>Raptor team, come in.
What is your status?</i>

244
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,630
Status is that everyone is dead.

245
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:49,029
<i>Ishmael, is that you?
What happened?</i>

246
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:53,520
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

247
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:56,760
- <i>Do you have it?</i>
- No. But I know who does.

248
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:59,238
<i>Copy that.
We're en route to your location.</i>

249
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,966
<i>We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.</i>

250
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:07,049
<i>This rare, magical mineral
has been mined for centuries...</i>

251
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:10,194
<i>...reports of an Eternium blast.
It is unknown who or why...</i>

252
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:12,525
<i>...has decimated a number of troops.
We are waiting on...</i>

253
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:15,335
<i>...an unidentified male.
This being is somehow able to harness...</i>

254
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:16,885
<i>What do you think?</i>

255
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:19,916
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down...

256
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:22,037
before innocent people start getting hurt.

257
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:23,896
Oh, and good morning to you, too.

258
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,262
<i>Shove it up your ass, Carter.</i>

259
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:28,091
<i>He's been asleep for 5,000 years.</i>

260
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,114
<i>He'll be disoriented at first.</i>

261
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:34,471
<i>The longer he has to adapt,
the harder it will be to take him down.</i>

262
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:36,701
Wheels up in 30.

263
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,051
<i>Who's on the team?</i>

264
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:51,499
<i>Welcome.
Please state your name for identification.</i>

265
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:55,074
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

266
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,803
<i>Confirmed.
Welcome, Maxine.</i>

267
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:57,782
Thanks.

268
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,277
<i>Maxine Hunkel, a.k.a Cyclone.</i>

269
00:26:00,403 --> 00:26:04,118
<i>Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.</i>

270
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:07,794
<i>Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.</i>

271
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,691
<i>Sounds delightful.</i>

272
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>But please tell me you found someone
who can pack a punch.</i>

273
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:15,542
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

274
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:18,626
Al Rothstein,
nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

275
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,687
He inherited his uncle's powers.

276
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,060
Uncle Al

277
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,409
<i>How's my suit? Does it fit?</i>

278
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:26,117
No, yeah. It's perfect.
Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

279
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:28,161
You know,
I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

280
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,700
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

281
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,797
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.</i>

282
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,017
<i>It's vintage.</i>

283
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:35,420
<i>And don't let anything
happen to you, either.</i>

284
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:37,533
<i>Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.</i>

285
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,279
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al.
I promise.

286
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,847
<i>They seem green.</i>

287
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:45,503
That's why I called in Kent.

288
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:49,906
<i>Кent's been out of action
for a little while,</i>

289
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,666
<i>but I can't do this without him.</i>

290
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:56,591
<i>Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got nearly God-level powers.</i>

291
00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:05,891
<i>It might take a lot than that.
Are you sure they can take him?</i>

292
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:08,577
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him,...

293
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,752
we'll take care of the rest.

294
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,095
<i>Good luck.</i>

295
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,783
This is gonna be fun.

296
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:37,238
We're here, sir.

297
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,773
Oh, right.

298
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,350
Was I staring again?

299
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:46,636
Only half an hour or so, sir.

300
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,928
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

301
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:50,638
Of course, sir.

302
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:02,176
HAWKMAN'S ESTATE
SAINT ROCH, LOUISIANA

303
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:06,840
So what's the op?

304
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,334
We're headed to Kahndaq
to apprehend and contain...

305
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,063
a Class-A rogue meta human.

306
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,403
I didn't bring passport.

307
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:17,373
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

308
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,647
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

309
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:31,286
Everything down to the screws.
Completely indestructible.

310
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:33,970
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

311
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,185
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

312
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,777
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

313
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,034
Here.

314
00:28:57,782 --> 00:28:59,230
Oh. Thanks.

315
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:02,571
I'm Al, by the way.

316
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,482
Мaxine.

317
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:10,988
What do you do?

318
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:12,591
Wind. You?

319
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:13,945
I grow.

320
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:16,008
Сool.

321
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,614
Whoa.

322
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,430
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

323
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,369
My mom's not much of a doctor,
but you should probably leave th...

324
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,302
Or do that.

325
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,096
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

326
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,287
But, I was thinking
we could help each other.

327
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,478
- Мove.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

328
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,164
I didn't ask for your name.

329
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:28,077
You're Teth Adam, right?
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

330
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,207
I said move.

331
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,804
My mom said you took out a bunch
of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

332
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,367
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

333
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:36,306
So you can really fly and stop bullets,
'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

334
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,307
And is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit?

335
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:39,359
Wait, what's your top speed?

336
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:42,066
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast?
Like Flash fast?

337
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,810
Wait, did you not have
mirrors back then?

338
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:54,829
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

339
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,269
Five thousand years?

340
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:00,639
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

341
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,368
Until my mom woke you up.

342
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,294
So you've got stopping bullets, check;
flying, check;

343
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,843
and lighting thing, that's a big check.

344
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,360
I don't know this place.

345
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,037
This is your home.

346
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,674
Then my home is gone.

347
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:38,340
What happened to the crown?

348
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:39,964
Too much?

349
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,526
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

350
00:31:56,607 --> 00:32:01,934
"Life is the... only path to death."

351
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,954
No shit.

352
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:10,621
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi Demi-God."

353
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:14,627
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

354
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:16,606
There. That's you. See?

355
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:18,914
That's the statue they built of you.
And now you're back.

356
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,581
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader...

357
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,105
after another over since you left.

358
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:26,299
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

359
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,822
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

360
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,011
I'm no hero.

361
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,349
What?

362
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:35,705
Superman, Batman, Aquaman,
you're way more stacked than any of them.

363
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,195
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

364
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,336
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

365
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:41,716
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

366
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,282
You're our only hope.

367
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:08,888
Wizards.

368
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:11,459
I can fix it. Don't worry.

369
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,111
I'm not a wizard.

370
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,399
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

371
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,597
I told you not to go in your room.

372
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:23,900
It was you who spoke.

373
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,215
You woke me.

374
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:30,398
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

375
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:32,467
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

376
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,326
Then your enemies are vanquished,

377
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,466
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

378
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:39,041
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

379
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,033
Then destroy them.

380
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,133
Intergang have guns and fly bikes
and Eternium rockets.

381
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,701
We have my mom.

382
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,947
Prove your strength.
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

383
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:52,377
Make him beg for mercy,
but deny it until his final breath.

384
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:54,146
Interesting, okay?

385
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,815
I appreciate what you did to for me,

386
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,075
but I do not
want you teaching my son violence.

387
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:04,059
I understand.
You want his father to teach him violence.

388
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:06,003
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

389
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,240
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

390
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:11,360
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

391
00:34:11,486 --> 00:34:14,067
Yeah, Mom.
Who do you want to teach me violence?

392
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:14,904
No one.

393
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,285
I want a champion
to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

394
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:22,586
Please, help us.

395
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,435
Wait. Wait.

396
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:45,580
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

397
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,262
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

398
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:49,497
Not really, no.

399
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,514
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

400
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,981
I don't know what is was like
in ancient times,

401
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:55,648
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

402
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:58,538
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,
get a cape, change your name.

403
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,495
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

404
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,224
It's a little outdated.
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

405
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,864
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

406
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,010
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

407
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,652
I don't waste words on the dead.

408
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,498
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

409
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:14,133
I was thinking, like,
"Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

410
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,738
- Them?
- You know, Gods, demons...

411
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,172
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

412
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,526
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

413
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:22,002
My point is, you could be famous.

414
00:35:22,128 --> 00:35:24,410
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

415
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:27,174
And the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

416
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:29,300
I don't need a box for my lunch.

417
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,284
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

418
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,063
What else are you gonna do?

419
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,108
Wait. Where are you going?

420
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,832
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

421
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,684
Most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon.

422
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,574
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

423
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,114
When you've seen
as many different futures as I have,

424
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:12,184
you cease to believe in absolutes.

425
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,512
What are you laughing at?

426
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:18,731
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

427
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:21,160
I know. That's how you laugh.

428
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:25,724
I've missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

429
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,291
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around to ignore all my advice.

430
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,639
Carter,...

431
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:33,845
this is not a very good plan.

432
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:39,433
Yeah, well,...

433
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,716
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

434
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:46,356
If only there were a third option.

435
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:51,819
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

436
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,218
Why not?

437
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,609
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

438
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:57,022
It's millions of years old.

439
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,718
It chooses who it lets touch it.

440
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:01,347
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

441
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:04,973
Like, Kent is literally possessed
when he puts it on.

442
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:06,647
What happens if I touch it anyway?

443
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:10,125
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

444
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:12,687
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

445
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,376
Coming up on it.

446
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:16,461
Ready stations in five.

447
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:19,091
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

448
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:20,516
He's not some dude.

449
00:37:20,642 --> 00:37:23,396
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

450
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:25,101
You don't have to raise your hand.

451
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:28,194
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

452
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,067
If we can get him to say the word,
"Shazam,"...

453
00:37:31,194 --> 00:37:33,502
Teth Adam will lose his power.

454
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:37,322
And we're hoping since he's had
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

455
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:40,670
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

456
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:41,981
From the footage you showed us,

457
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:44,822
he doesn't really seem
like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

458
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,152
Correct.

459
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:47,796
Look alive.

460
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:51,074
We're here.

461
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,332
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

462
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:34,562
Forgive me.

463
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:50,542
This is a message
for all Intergang soldiers.

464
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:53,405
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

465
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,634
Тeth Adam.

466
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,069
Please.

467
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:25,181
There he is. Move.

468
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:27,540
- Тeth Adam.
- Move.

469
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:29,670
Тeth Adam...

470
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,686
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

471
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:37,811
The statue?

472
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:41,022
That's my son.

473
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:43,720
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

474
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,123
What are you doing?

475
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:49,351
Hang on. I recognize you.

476
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,138
Where is the crown?

477
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:54,040
Let's go.

478
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:11,078
You could've showed up a bit sooner.
But that was dope.

479
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,064
We need backup down here.

480
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,033
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

481
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,463
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

482
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:05,664
But before you zap them.

483
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,489
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

484
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,321
He's here.

485
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,520
You sense his presence?

486
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,145
No.

487
00:41:34,766 --> 00:41:38,151
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

488
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,662
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

489
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:53,727
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

490
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:56,474
We're the anvil, you're the hammer.
You're ready.

491
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:59,600
He just dropped the...

492
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,381
Shit.

493
00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:08,342
Be prepared.

494
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,252
Behind you.

495
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,391
Let us be.

496
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,880
I don't know their crimes,

497
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:51,354
but whatever they are,
these men should face due process.

498
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:56,754
Then let the Gods make their judgment.

499
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

500
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:00,226
You don't look like an Intergang.

501
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:02,896
We're the Justice Society.

502
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:06,066
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

503
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:09,405
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

504
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:13,645
And we will use force if necessary.

505
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,900
Force is always necessary.

506
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:18,348
Teth Adam.

507
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:21,901
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

508
00:43:22,027 --> 00:43:25,534
There's no place for you
in the World of Man.

509
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:30,433
You have two choices, kneel or die.

510
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,004
I was a slave until I died.

511
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:36,799
Then I was reborn a God.

512
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:40,175
I kneel before no one.

513
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,210
Fate, give me a distraction.

514
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:45,669
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

515
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:49,006
I don't have a home.

516
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:24,292
Look at that suit. It's cool.

517
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:25,329
Thanks. You, too.

518
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:28,257
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

519
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:37,350
- Hawkman just does not give up, does he?
- Nope.

520
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:52,924
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

521
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,611
To help him.

522
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,689
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

523
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:19,174
Let's roll.

524
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,319
What are you doing? Hey.

525
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,669
No.

526
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:10,629
I'll be right there.

527
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,030
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

528
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:07,267
I can't hold him much longer.

529
00:48:12,526 --> 00:48:13,752
Move.

530
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:37,816
I'm coming.
I'm zeroing in on your location.

531
00:49:09,117 --> 00:49:11,745
I got him. Guys, I got him.

532
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:15,642
It's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

533
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:18,591
There's something different about you.
Can't quite put my finger on it.

534
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:20,758
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

535
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:22,168
But you... You're like a tornado.

536
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:24,553
I thought the two of you did great work.

537
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,889
First time out... Bravo.

538
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:29,338
Thanks. I mean,
I got a little turned around back there,

539
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:30,693
but, it all worked out, right?

540
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,213
You're damn right it did.

541
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,934
Let's hope Waller
has that cell ready for him.

542
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,717
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

543
00:49:42,843 --> 00:49:44,862
You'd better not let him up.

544
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,402
What do I do? Guys?

545
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:10,300
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

546
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:12,444
Long live the Champion.

547
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,765
Long live the Champion.

548
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:25,631
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

549
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:29,920
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

550
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,667
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

551
00:50:34,957 --> 00:50:38,787
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

552
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,437
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

553
00:50:50,563 --> 00:50:51,862
We're not strong enough.

554
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:54,602
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction...

555
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:56,987
to figure that out
before we got our asses kicked.

556
00:50:57,113 --> 00:50:58,454
I'm working on it.

557
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,827
Miss?

558
00:50:59,953 --> 00:51:01,775
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

559
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:03,231
Yes, I do mind.

560
00:51:03,357 --> 00:51:04,688
Where are you going with this, Kent?

561
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:06,120
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

562
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:09,565
One catastrophe at a time.
We can't give him a chance to regroup.

563
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,365
He's been spotted entering the palace.

564
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:13,427
It safe to say
he's not going there to surrender.

565
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:15,257
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

566
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:17,443
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

567
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:18,872
The Justice Society?

568
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:23,132
We have been living under
military occupation for 27 years,

569
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:24,489
and never seen you before.

570
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:27,151
You didn't come when Intergang
invaded our country,

571
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:29,884
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

572
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,356
But now, we finally have our own hero...

573
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:35,435
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

574
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:38,203
Thank you, but... we're covered.

575
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,871
Go and protect international stability
someplace else.

576
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:44,562
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

577
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,309
Let me spell it out for you.

578
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:50,178
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion
because he is not a hero.

579
00:51:50,304 --> 00:51:52,005
Tell that...

580
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:55,983
to all the people he just liberated.

581
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:58,664
I know what this looks like. I do.

582
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,320
But I can assure you that my t...

583
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,237
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

584
00:52:07,603 --> 00:52:10,156
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

585
00:52:10,282 --> 00:52:12,178
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

586
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:13,829
I...

587
00:52:14,327 --> 00:52:16,223
Can we please just see the crown?

588
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,177
I don't have it.

589
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:38,185
We don't have time for this.

590
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:40,244
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

591
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,947
You don't have any authority here.
Teth Adam has done nothing...

592
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:46,790
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

593
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:48,279
And how would you know?

594
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:51,941
We have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries.

595
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,614
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

596
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,839
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

597
00:52:58,735 --> 00:53:02,743
And we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again.

598
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,208
You want to go in there alone?
Are you sure?

599
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:11,377
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

600
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:14,023
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

601
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:18,087
without destroying the rest of my city,
I'm your only shot.

602
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:41,994
You brought the invaders with you.

603
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,025
They only want to talk.

604
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,089
They can talk. I won't listen.

605
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:52,332
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story...

606
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,410
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot...

607
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:59,430
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq
by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

608
00:53:59,556 --> 00:54:02,903
But according to the Justice Society,
that's not really what happened.

609
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:06,074
They say that you didn't come here
to seek justice.

610
00:54:08,565 --> 00:54:10,110
Hurry.

611
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:11,692
Give it to me.

612
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:17,810
<i>That you came to exact revenge.</i>

613
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,988
<i>And in your anger,...</i>

614
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,304
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

615
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,492
This is what I want.

616
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:46,764
<i>...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.</i>

617
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:57,104
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy...

618
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:59,127
of the gifts that you were granted.

619
00:54:59,477 --> 00:55:01,480
We have chosen recklessly...

620
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:03,362
and humanity has paid the price.

621
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:05,398
And now, Teth Adam,...

622
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:08,008
you must pay.

623
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:29,861
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

624
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:34,596
It was your prison.

625
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,790
And now there's a statue of you.

626
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:41,751
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

627
00:55:41,877 --> 00:55:43,647
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

628
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,848
I never said I was a hero.

629
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:47,692
I never claimed to be anything.

630
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,242
You may not have been a hero.

631
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:53,277
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

632
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:02,133
I will hear them out.

633
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,273
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

634
00:56:10,178 --> 00:56:11,399
Uncle Karim.

635
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:13,321
I can't believe you're sitting around
watching TV...

636
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:14,935
when the most epic day ever is...

637
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:16,734
In here, little man.

638
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,722
Ishmael. My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

639
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:23,387
Funny story, he didn't.

640
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,151
Where's Adrianna?

641
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:27,609
- She's back at the square...
- We should go bail her out right now.

642
00:56:27,735 --> 00:56:29,859
But she's the one who sent me home
to make sure the crown's safe.

643
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:31,670
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

644
00:56:31,796 --> 00:56:34,210
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

645
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:35,726
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

646
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:38,365
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

647
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,257
Give him the bag. Give him the bag.

648
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,651
Very good. Back away.

649
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:50,190
- Back away.
- Oké. I'm...

650
00:56:59,238 --> 00:57:01,386
It's all going to be okay, little man.

651
00:57:01,512 --> 00:57:03,635
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned...

652
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:05,037
in one of your mother's classes.

653
00:57:05,164 --> 00:57:06,686
When we had a powerful king,

654
00:57:06,812 --> 00:57:10,276
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

655
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:11,805
It used to be great.

656
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:13,446
Run, Amon, run.

657
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:35,154
Crash the building.
I lost the kid. He has the crown.

658
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:55,187
We're here to negotiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender.

659
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:59,249
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

660
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,870
What have your powers ever given to you?
Nothing but heartache.

661
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,554
You have no idea.

662
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,614
Then why are you making this hard on us?

663
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,870
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

664
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:11,404
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

665
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,920
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

666
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:17,651
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

667
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,460
How 'bout I rip
you little wings off instead?

668
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:24,104
- I'd like to see you try.
- Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

669
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,492
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

670
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:27,045
Looks like we found common ground.

671
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,270
This can only end one way.

672
00:58:30,484 --> 00:58:31,852
- <i>Мom?</i>
- Amon.

673
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:33,829
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

674
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:35,172
Ishmael's dead.

675
00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:37,951
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

676
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:39,936
Ground forces...

677
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,357
I'm hiding in our building,
and Inter gang’s here.

678
00:58:42,483 --> 00:58:44,092
They're coming.

679
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:45,952
Intergang are after my son.

680
00:58:46,078 --> 00:58:49,099
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

681
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,806
I know you're not a hero.

682
00:58:50,932 --> 00:58:53,354
But you're not a monster, either.
I don't care what anyone says.

683
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,563
You saved me in that cave.

684
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:58,674
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

685
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,247
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

686
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,260
Check the whole place clean.

687
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:09,009
Cover all access points.

688
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,140
Keep looking.

689
00:59:19,731 --> 00:59:21,627
Area's clear.

690
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:23,405
There. Take him.

691
00:59:23,531 --> 00:59:24,842
Right there, right there.

692
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,542
Shit...

693
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:28,950
Move, move.

694
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:30,548
Don't shoot him, I need him.

695
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,763
End of the road, kid.

696
00:59:58,385 --> 00:59:59,680
Release the child.

697
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:01,426
Whatever you say.

698
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:05,637
Yes.

699
01:00:05,763 --> 01:00:06,392
Thank you.

700
01:00:06,518 --> 01:00:09,238
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

701
01:00:12,303 --> 01:00:15,063
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

702
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:21,332
Time to go, Amon.

703
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:29,963
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

704
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,491
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

705
01:00:32,617 --> 01:00:36,101
That's the plan, little man.
We’re gonna go for a ride. Come one.

706
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:52,578
Put me down. Put me down.

707
01:00:52,704 --> 01:00:55,241
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

708
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:57,415
And tell them that the Man in Black...

709
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:05,484
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

710
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:16,921
Mom?

711
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,285
Amon, where are you?

712
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:20,090
No, no, no, what?

713
01:01:20,216 --> 01:01:21,517
I'm on one of their bikes.

714
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:23,030
What bikes?

715
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:43,240
Amon.

716
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,290
Can you hear me?

717
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:45,668
<i>Mom, I'm okay.</i>

718
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:53,716
Shit!

719
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,079
Activate infrared.

720
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:08,218
What are you doing?

721
01:02:08,344 --> 01:02:09,631
Searching for the child.

722
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:11,060
No, you're murdering people.

723
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:12,437
How else do I find the child?

724
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:15,019
I can help you,
but no more extrajudicial killings.

725
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:16,505
I don't need any help.

726
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,846
<i>Smasher, Cyclone.
What are you waiting for?</i>

727
01:02:21,972 --> 01:02:23,629
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

728
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:26,248
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

729
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:29,938
One, two...
This feels a lot higher than last time.

730
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,788
That was not cool.

731
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:45,836
Whoa, slow down.

732
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:51,642
I got you. I got you.

733
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:03,737
ENGINE FAILURE

734
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,863
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

735
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,098
I am so sorry.

736
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:22,287
I don't really have peripheral vision
in the mask. It's my uncle's.

737
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:23,832
I'll get it tailored.

738
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:25,228
Me and you.

739
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:26,572
Roger that.

740
01:04:11,228 --> 01:04:13,415
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

741
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:16,306
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

742
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,606
I'm not that kind of doctor.

743
01:04:18,732 --> 01:04:20,490
But don't worry, I can see the future.

744
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:22,449
This isn't how you're going to die.

745
01:04:22,575 --> 01:04:23,835
How do I die, then?

746
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,594
Just stay away from electricity.

747
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,570
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

748
01:04:28,696 --> 01:04:30,877
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

749
01:04:41,522 --> 01:04:43,123
OVER SPEED
ETERNIUM LEVELS CRITICAL

750
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,455
Oh, God.

751
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:42,463
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

752
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:44,208
I'm counting on it.

753
01:05:55,004 --> 01:05:56,534
Please don't.

754
01:05:57,008 --> 01:05:58,752
<i>Teth Adam. Where are you?</i>

755
01:05:58,878 --> 01:05:59,751
You followed me?

756
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:03,702
<i>My mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time.</i>

757
01:06:03,828 --> 01:06:04,824
<i>Did you find the boy?</i>

758
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,935
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

759
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:09,226
<i>Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.</i>

760
01:06:09,727 --> 01:06:11,771
Uh...

761
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:14,106
<i>You killed him, didn't you?</i>

762
01:06:21,007 --> 01:06:22,733
He didn't make it.

763
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,213
The bullet's extracted.
The tissue damage has been repaired.

764
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:32,276
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

765
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:35,017
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

766
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:38,419
That is insane.

767
01:06:38,977 --> 01:06:40,975
The nanobots did most of the work.

768
01:06:41,102 --> 01:06:43,204
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

769
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,985
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

770
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:48,171
What? I say something stupid?

771
01:06:48,297 --> 01:06:51,367
No, it's just that you can transform
your molecular structure,

772
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:53,242
grow a hundred times your own size.

773
01:06:53,368 --> 01:06:56,041
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

774
01:06:56,168 --> 01:06:59,383
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

775
01:07:00,378 --> 01:07:01,798
Thank you.

776
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:04,497
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

777
01:07:05,975 --> 01:07:08,043
That's how you do your wind thing.

778
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:10,825
Well, the wind thing
is called aerokinesis.

779
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:13,043
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream...

780
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:16,676
by this really messed-up scientist
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

781
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:22,197
I'm... so sorry.

782
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,173
No, you're good.

783
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,217
It seems like you really turned it around.

784
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:27,886
Found your calling.

785
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:30,492
Hoping this is mine.

786
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:39,075
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

787
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:43,524
It's already moved on from you.

788
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,406
Why did you say that?

789
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:51,057
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

790
01:07:51,184 --> 01:07:54,238
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

791
01:07:54,364 --> 01:07:56,192
not those you can't.

792
01:07:56,712 --> 01:07:58,527
You see the future?

793
01:07:58,653 --> 01:08:01,175
Tell me how I get my son back.

794
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:03,312
By trusting us.

795
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:06,439
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

796
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:08,256
It's what we do.

797
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:15,275
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

798
01:08:15,401 --> 01:08:17,833
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

799
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:20,782
What I did there is called sarcasm.

800
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:23,184
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

801
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,377
Not yet, but I will.
The men who took him will suffer.

802
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:29,403
Maybe these guys can help.

803
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:34,875
There's an upside to keeping prisoners.
They can answer our questions.

804
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:37,328
What did you do with my son?

805
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:47,386
Adrianna. Adrianna.

806
01:08:47,512 --> 01:08:50,757
I've learned that in this modern world,
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

807
01:08:50,883 --> 01:08:52,612
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

808
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:55,305
No.

809
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,655
Let's start with just one simple question.
Can either of you fly?

810
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,378
Shit.

811
01:09:04,316 --> 01:09:06,335
I think I'll sit this one out.

812
01:09:12,842 --> 01:09:14,554
Tell me what you did with Amon.

813
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,957
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

814
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:20,158
I'm not going to drop them.

815
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:22,883
I'm going to drop one of them.

816
01:09:23,009 --> 01:09:25,458
Whoever answers first lives. Where is he?

817
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:26,825
I don't know.

818
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,217
He's at our mine in the desert.

819
01:09:35,343 --> 01:09:36,906
I can show...

820
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:44,653
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

821
01:09:46,118 --> 01:09:48,013
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

822
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,827
That was sarcasm.

823
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:51,636
No, technically, it was just a lie.

824
01:09:52,178 --> 01:09:53,698
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

825
01:09:53,824 --> 01:09:55,075
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

826
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:57,293
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

827
01:09:57,419 --> 01:09:58,913
Let's go.

828
01:09:59,883 --> 01:10:02,028
I told you, stop killing people.

829
01:10:02,155 --> 01:10:03,419
They look alive to me.

830
01:10:03,545 --> 01:10:05,138
Because I saved them.

831
01:10:05,264 --> 01:10:06,879
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

832
01:10:07,005 --> 01:10:09,822
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

833
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:11,142
I did it your way.

834
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:12,992
He does have a point.

835
01:10:13,786 --> 01:10:15,843
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

836
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:18,117
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

837
01:10:18,243 --> 01:10:20,273
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

838
01:10:20,373 --> 01:10:21,930
There's no "we" here.

839
01:10:22,057 --> 01:10:25,991
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

840
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:29,556
You think yourself a hero,
but you would let these criminals go free,

841
01:10:29,682 --> 01:10:32,790
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now.

842
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,540
Heroes don't kill people.

843
01:10:39,059 --> 01:10:40,340
Well, I do.

844
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:43,299
Here we go.

845
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:45,989
Is that what I think it is?

846
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:49,352
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

847
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:52,006
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period.

848
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,664
King must have had a really strong neck.

849
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,231
No, it snapped when I killed him.

850
01:11:57,551 --> 01:11:58,898
What's that?

851
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:00,838
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

852
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:03,672
"Life is the only path to death."

853
01:12:03,798 --> 01:12:05,116
That's what it says.

854
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:08,255
Life is the only path to death.

855
01:12:08,381 --> 01:12:13,236
Well, that's surprisingly obvious.
Could it have another meaning?

856
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,321
What if it means, like...

857
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:18,930
"Life is short.
You gotta hold on to what you love."

858
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:22,194
Stop.

859
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,540
Deep.

860
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,179
It doesn't matter what it means.

861
01:12:25,305 --> 01:12:27,308
It should be buried under the ocean
for eternity.

862
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:30,441
That's not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over.

863
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:32,091
Or I could bury you with it.

864
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:37,300
We can't get rid of it now.
It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

865
01:12:37,426 --> 01:12:41,284
Believe me, I know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of.

866
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,291
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

867
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:48,057
Adrianna...
Trust me, we will get your son back.

868
01:12:48,183 --> 01:12:50,264
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

869
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,033
Hand it over.

870
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:57,713
We can't risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands.

871
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,857
We will find another way.

872
01:13:01,528 --> 01:13:03,152
No.

873
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:06,249
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

874
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,543
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

875
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:11,628
All I care about is Amon.

876
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:15,750
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

877
01:13:15,876 --> 01:13:19,992
And you... you will work together.

878
01:13:26,245 --> 01:13:28,753
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

879
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:31,323
We'll go in at dawn.

880
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:34,007
I hope you can be a team player.

881
01:13:34,134 --> 01:13:35,674
I love teams.

882
01:13:35,963 --> 01:13:37,766
That was sarcasm again, yes?

883
01:13:37,892 --> 01:13:39,006
Very much so.

884
01:13:39,133 --> 01:13:41,336
Good. Just checking.

885
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:55,585
A wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

886
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,902
That was before we had a very bad plan.

887
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:00,659
Let it go.

888
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:03,632
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

889
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:05,392
He's a murderer, Kent.

890
01:14:05,518 --> 01:14:08,624
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

891
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,048
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

892
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,215
That's... up to Fate.

893
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,659
What's the helmet telling you?

894
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:19,948
Somebody's gonna die.

895
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:23,190
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

896
01:14:23,316 --> 01:14:25,224
Surprisingly, no.

897
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:27,320
Is it me?

898
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:37,028
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

899
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,378
All I can tell you is...

900
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:46,002
There is still time to change the future.

901
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,267
Let's use it.

902
01:14:53,165 --> 01:14:57,091
Well, I guess we're sticking
with a very bad plan.

903
01:15:05,526 --> 01:15:08,484
AL HADIDIYAH MINE
INTERGANG CONTROLLED OPERATION

904
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:12,611
<i>The Al Hadidiyah mine
is Intergang's most valued asset.</i>

905
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:17,101
I'm gonna land us right here,
cut off their access to reinforcements.

906
01:15:17,227 --> 01:15:20,159
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

907
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:22,417
There is only one way in, one way out.

908
01:15:22,543 --> 01:15:24,776
We'll be an easy target
for their fly bike patrol.

909
01:15:24,902 --> 01:15:28,817
Communication is key.
We keep in step or we get outflanked.

910
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:32,204
We move through the mine, inch by inch,
until we find Amon.

911
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,985
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

912
01:15:52,078 --> 01:15:53,461
Or we could just do that.

913
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:12,177
Pure Eternium Shield.
Unbreakable, even with your powers.

914
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:20,743
Amon.

915
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:22,921
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

916
01:16:23,048 --> 01:16:25,836
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

917
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:27,623
We don't have it.

918
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:32,184
Believe me,
nothing good will come from that crown.

919
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:36,902
No crown, no negotiation.

920
01:16:37,612 --> 01:16:39,218
I have it.

921
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:42,408
It's right here.

922
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:46,304
Release my son, you can have it.

923
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:50,464
What do you think you're doing?

924
01:16:51,471 --> 01:16:56,726
Intergang killed my husband.
I'm not letting them take my son, too.

925
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:04,264
Not your son. Not your country.

926
01:17:05,769 --> 01:17:07,101
Not your decision to make.

927
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,447
Stop there.

928
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:12,810
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

929
01:17:12,936 --> 01:17:14,229
Hand it over, now.

930
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:17,616
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- No.

931
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:24,857
Now, let Amon go.

932
01:17:31,173 --> 01:17:31,800
I thank you.

933
01:17:31,926 --> 01:17:35,159
And I thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner.

934
01:17:36,983 --> 01:17:40,594
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

935
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,958
You have what you want.

936
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:44,056
Let him go.

937
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:45,802
Ishmael, what are you doing?

938
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:47,528
Taking back what's mine.

939
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:51,558
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

940
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:55,446
And you have just given me
everything I need to become the next...

941
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:57,853
king of Kahndaq.

942
01:17:59,264 --> 01:18:02,776
My family passed the knowledge on,
you know, one to the next.

943
01:18:02,902 --> 01:18:09,304
This crown, crafted by our ancestors,
stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

944
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:13,835
But still a source of great power,
if only we can wield it.

945
01:18:18,744 --> 01:18:23,523
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

946
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:26,466
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

947
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:27,660
Please, Ishmael.

948
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:28,850
Sorry, Amon.

949
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:32,800
Fate, get ready.

950
01:18:32,926 --> 01:18:37,139
Death is the only path to life.

951
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:43,202
Amon.

952
01:19:48,306 --> 01:19:49,626
Amon.

953
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,211
He's alive.
But we need to get him to the medical bay.

954
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:58,228
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

955
01:19:58,354 --> 01:19:59,900
It was me.

956
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:09,881
Come.

957
01:20:19,084 --> 01:20:20,722
We're going with you.

958
01:20:20,848 --> 01:20:23,493
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

959
01:20:36,142 --> 01:20:39,817
I found the crown.
But, um, it's not alone.

960
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,167
How long we gonna keep doing this?

961
01:20:55,895 --> 01:21:00,498
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

962
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:02,456
You're right.

963
01:21:03,299 --> 01:21:05,060
Only you can.

964
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:09,258
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

965
01:21:13,277 --> 01:21:14,741
Who's Hurut?

966
01:21:19,938 --> 01:21:22,166
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

967
01:21:27,913 --> 01:21:30,407
<i>And he was also... my son.</i>

968
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,946
I won't always be here to protect you.

969
01:21:35,222 --> 01:21:36,666
I don't need protection.

970
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,278
I want to be free.

971
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,245
Freedom is for the birds.

972
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:43,393
Let someone else be the hero,...

973
01:21:44,114 --> 01:21:46,699
the graveyards are full of them.

974
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:53,510
<i>I tried to protect him.</i>

975
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:03,387
<i>But I wasn't strong enough.</i>

976
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:09,183
Shazam.

977
01:22:10,905 --> 01:22:14,428
<i>The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.</i>

978
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,071
<i>But after the Champion's many victories,</i>

979
01:22:17,197 --> 01:22:20,380
<i>the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.</i>

980
01:22:22,064 --> 01:22:23,654
<i>Our family.</i>

981
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:42,983
Hold on, Father.

982
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:45,207
Stay with me.

983
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,188
With my powers...

984
01:22:54,497 --> 01:22:56,347
you'll be safe.

985
01:22:56,953 --> 01:22:59,190
I couldn't protect your mother.

986
01:22:59,914 --> 01:23:02,549
Repeat what I say.

987
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:04,718
- Shazam.
- Shazam.

988
01:23:17,768 --> 01:23:20,230
<i>Instead of battling the king,...</i>

989
01:23:20,677 --> 01:23:23,214
<i>instead of saving Kahndaq,...</i>

990
01:23:24,009 --> 01:23:26,457
<i>Hurut chose to save...</i>

991
01:23:27,123 --> 01:23:28,672
<i>me.</i>

992
01:23:45,134 --> 01:23:49,816
<i>But he couldn't save himself
from the king's assassins.</i>

993
01:23:52,246 --> 01:23:55,234
<i>The powers were not a gift
from the wizards,...</i>

994
01:23:55,995 --> 01:23:57,443
<i>but a curse.</i>

995
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,909
<i>Born out of rage.</i>

996
01:24:12,586 --> 01:24:14,835
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

997
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,264
It's Hurut.

998
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:24,793
My son dreamt of a better world.

999
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:27,621
That's why he saved me.

1000
01:24:31,723 --> 01:24:34,763
But the world was only a better place
with him in it.

1001
01:24:50,143 --> 01:24:51,814
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1002
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:55,206
Instead, it got me.

1003
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,541
All this power...

1004
01:25:00,772 --> 01:25:03,664
and the only thing I can do with it
is hurt people.

1005
01:25:04,352 --> 01:25:09,068
I will speak the word my son gave me,
and I will give up my power.

1006
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:15,027
And when I do,
you must ensure I never speak it again.

1007
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:22,210
Shazam.

1008
01:25:29,806 --> 01:25:32,667
Some men are not meant...

1009
01:25:32,793 --> 01:25:34,379
to be heroes.

1010
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:44,894
TASK FORCE X BLACK SITE
SECRET LOCATION

1011
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:20,153
Hey.

1012
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,859
So beautiful.

1013
01:27:06,358 --> 01:27:08,114
Surprised to see us?

1014
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,139
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1015
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:13,698
Are you sure you can handle him?

1016
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:17,255
You're the one who can see the future,
you'll tell me if we can't.

1017
01:27:17,381 --> 01:27:18,802
Just be careful with this one.

1018
01:27:19,624 --> 01:27:22,214
You know, they say the Gods created us,

1019
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,468
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1020
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:28,561
Waller sends her regards.

1021
01:27:34,965 --> 01:27:36,814
<i>They'll know how to deal with him.</i>

1022
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:42,236
<i>To keep him from regaining his powers,
they'll keep him in suspended animation.</i>

1023
01:27:49,354 --> 01:27:53,586
<i>As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.</i>

1024
01:27:57,498 --> 01:28:00,121
<i>He'll never say another word again.</i>

1025
01:28:18,685 --> 01:28:21,106
Hey. There he is.

1026
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:25,121
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1027
01:28:25,247 --> 01:28:27,573
Well, statistically,
most heroes don't wear capes.

1028
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:29,592
But yeah, try it on.

1029
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:34,404
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1030
01:28:37,504 --> 01:28:39,402
That's a nice touch.

1031
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,743
Kent.

1032
01:29:21,828 --> 01:29:23,441
Kent.

1033
01:29:26,332 --> 01:29:27,817
Mission accomplished?

1034
01:29:27,943 --> 01:29:29,537
My vision hasn't changed.

1035
01:29:29,942 --> 01:29:32,105
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1036
01:29:32,231 --> 01:29:35,203
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1037
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:37,438
What is the helmet telling you?

1038
01:29:38,255 --> 01:29:41,488
My vision has always shown me
great calamity.

1039
01:29:41,614 --> 01:29:43,668
The world in flames.

1040
01:29:43,794 --> 01:29:45,337
We can stop it...

1041
01:29:46,872 --> 01:29:48,812
but you die.

1042
01:29:50,369 --> 01:29:52,475
You should've told me sooner.

1043
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,919
I have no fear of death.

1044
01:29:57,046 --> 01:29:59,210
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1045
01:29:59,336 --> 01:30:01,549
The world needs the Justice Society.

1046
01:30:01,675 --> 01:30:03,263
The world needs you.

1047
01:30:03,389 --> 01:30:06,128
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1048
01:30:06,254 --> 01:30:08,141
That's Fate, right?

1049
01:30:08,844 --> 01:30:12,725
Well, that sounds familiar.

1050
01:30:14,982 --> 01:30:17,939
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1051
01:30:18,733 --> 01:30:23,124
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1052
01:30:23,797 --> 01:30:26,838
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1053
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:30,378
But I didn't cheer.

1054
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:33,734
Even though I was only a boy.

1055
01:30:34,265 --> 01:30:38,615
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1056
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:42,490
Thanks to this, I've lived longer
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1057
01:30:42,616 --> 01:30:47,113
I have seen the world change
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1058
01:30:49,804 --> 01:30:51,655
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1059
01:30:53,206 --> 01:30:55,446
And I don't want my friend to die.

1060
01:31:02,914 --> 01:31:07,523
Ishmael said,
"Death is the only path to life."

1061
01:31:07,649 --> 01:31:10,322
But that's not what the inscription says.

1062
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:13,371
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1063
01:31:13,822 --> 01:31:17,551
Maybe he got it backwards,
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1064
01:31:17,677 --> 01:31:20,064
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1065
01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:23,302
the souls of the damned
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1066
01:31:23,428 --> 01:31:28,344
The underworld is a mirror to our own.
Here, turn the crown around.

1067
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,307
Now mirror the letters.

1068
01:31:30,433 --> 01:31:32,739
See? That's what I missed.

1069
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:37,875
"Death is the only path to life."

1070
01:31:41,422 --> 01:31:44,098
<i>He kidnapped Amon on purpose,</i>

1071
01:31:44,224 --> 01:31:46,579
<i>because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.</i>

1072
01:31:46,705 --> 01:31:50,563
<i>And he believed the Champion's magic
would send him to the Rock of Finality.</i>

1073
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:54,286
As life is the path to death.

1074
01:31:54,412 --> 01:31:58,062
Now your death is a path to life.

1075
01:31:58,188 --> 01:32:02,454
The wizards have their champion,
now we have ours.

1076
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:05,355
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1077
01:32:05,481 --> 01:32:09,144
and unleash hell on Earth.

1078
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:12,052
Speak our name.

1079
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:14,034
"Sabbac."

1080
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,797
What the bloody hell is that?

1081
01:32:36,923 --> 01:32:38,713
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1082
01:32:38,839 --> 01:32:40,646
Get me closer.
Now, right now!

1083
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:42,808
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1084
01:32:50,306 --> 01:32:53,230
The king has returned.

1085
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,079
The throne will be mine.

1086
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,894
Brace yourselves.

1087
01:33:05,384 --> 01:33:06,884
Hold on.

1088
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:44,801
Now prepare to die.

1089
01:33:50,843 --> 01:33:52,322
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1090
01:34:09,264 --> 01:34:12,261
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1091
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:17,359
- Copy that.
- We're on it.

1092
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:18,819
Heads up.

1093
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:04,403
Activate infrared.

1094
01:35:07,878 --> 01:35:09,764
Sabbac, show yourself.

1095
01:35:12,286 --> 01:35:14,022
Adrianna.

1096
01:35:14,307 --> 01:35:16,035
Amon.

1097
01:35:19,087 --> 01:35:20,865
That's for my cruiser.

1098
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:00,863
This is it.

1099
01:36:01,784 --> 01:36:03,437
We can't win, Carter.

1100
01:36:03,563 --> 01:36:06,688
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't.
Right?

1101
01:36:09,065 --> 01:36:11,253
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1102
01:36:38,015 --> 01:36:40,276
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1103
01:36:40,402 --> 01:36:42,047
Giving us a third option.

1104
01:36:42,173 --> 01:36:43,507
It's supposed to be me.

1105
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:45,931
I didn't tell you my whole vision,
old friend.

1106
01:36:46,602 --> 01:36:48,205
I did see your death.

1107
01:36:48,331 --> 01:36:50,585
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1108
01:36:50,711 --> 01:36:55,315
It has been an extraordinary life,
but always with one foot in the future.

1109
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:58,601
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1110
01:36:58,727 --> 01:37:00,541
when I look ahead,...

1111
01:37:02,615 --> 01:37:03,806
I see nothing.

1112
01:37:03,932 --> 01:37:04,887
No, Kent.

1113
01:37:05,014 --> 01:37:06,417
And...

1114
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,287
it's...

1115
01:37:08,755 --> 01:37:09,836
beautiful.

1116
01:37:09,963 --> 01:37:10,972
Wait, Kent.

1117
01:37:11,057 --> 01:37:12,024
Goodbye,...

1118
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:13,350
Kent.

1119
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:14,904
...my dear friend.

1120
01:37:15,031 --> 01:37:16,251
Kent.

1121
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,779
Hit it from every side.

1122
01:37:22,785 --> 01:37:24,804
Kent.

1123
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:28,948
No.

1124
01:37:47,822 --> 01:37:52,616
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1125
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,939
defender against darkness and chaos,

1126
01:37:56,066 --> 01:37:59,686
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1127
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,360
There's no one that can defeat me.

1128
01:38:15,483 --> 01:38:19,918
There is one... There is one...

1129
01:38:20,045 --> 01:38:21,675
Teth Adam.

1130
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:24,666
I know you can hear me.

1131
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:30,144
<i>The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.</i>

1132
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:35,273
<i>Now you are the only one
who can defeat the Demon Champion.</i>

1133
01:39:00,927 --> 01:39:04,871
<i>You have the power
to be the destroyer of this world.</i>

1134
01:39:07,429 --> 01:39:10,382
But you can also be its savior.

1135
01:39:27,222 --> 01:39:32,696
<i>You believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you.</i>

1136
01:39:32,822 --> 01:39:36,576
<i>But Fate does not make mistakes.
Neither did your son.</i>

1137
01:39:40,636 --> 01:39:42,316
<i>We were wrong about you.</i>

1138
01:39:42,442 --> 01:39:45,539
<i>The world doesn't always
need a white knight.</i>

1139
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,972
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1140
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,661
<i>Don't you dare give up on us now.</i>

1141
01:40:06,662 --> 01:40:08,199
The world needs you.

1142
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:16,708
Kent.

1143
01:41:25,817 --> 01:41:27,048
No.

1144
01:42:31,233 --> 01:42:32,571
Mom?

1145
01:42:33,176 --> 01:42:34,925
What's happening?

1146
01:42:36,051 --> 01:42:37,843
It's Sabbac.

1147
01:42:38,195 --> 01:42:39,830
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1148
01:42:40,174 --> 01:42:41,869
Whatever happens,...

1149
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:44,633
you stay behind me.

1150
01:42:58,782 --> 01:43:01,506
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1151
01:43:03,073 --> 01:43:05,778
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1152
01:43:05,904 --> 01:43:07,294
Come and get it.

1153
01:43:07,834 --> 01:43:08,830
No, no. No.

1154
01:43:08,957 --> 01:43:11,386
- Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1155
01:43:11,512 --> 01:43:14,393
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1156
01:43:52,348 --> 01:43:55,460
The Gods have brought us together again.

1157
01:43:57,187 --> 01:44:00,113
It's not your time, Father.

1158
01:44:03,425 --> 01:44:04,881
Hey.

1159
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,970
What are you all standing around for?

1160
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:10,008
This is our chance.

1161
01:44:12,667 --> 01:44:15,739
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1162
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:18,089
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1163
01:44:24,153 --> 01:44:26,062
The people need a hero.

1164
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:29,395
No, Father.

1165
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:32,121
They need to be free.

1166
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,022
What are we waiting for?

1167
01:45:00,241 --> 01:45:02,673
Say the word.

1168
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:05,065
Shazam.

1169
01:45:15,474 --> 01:45:18,594
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1170
01:45:47,042 --> 01:45:48,659
Yes.

1171
01:45:52,819 --> 01:45:54,308
I got this.

1172
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,863
Go get him.

1173
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,878
You know what I have to do.

1174
01:46:17,402 --> 01:46:19,058
Beat his ass.

1175
01:46:19,184 --> 01:46:24,382
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions.

1176
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,671
Let's end this.

1177
01:46:52,837 --> 01:46:54,091
It's a lot of them.

1178
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:58,100
- It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1179
01:46:58,226 --> 01:46:59,429
Just a bit.

1180
01:47:07,007 --> 01:47:08,849
Hey, mom.

1181
01:47:15,685 --> 01:47:19,352
These are our streets. Our city.

1182
01:47:20,823 --> 01:47:22,991
Free Kahndaq.

1183
01:47:30,626 --> 01:47:33,243
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1184
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:35,761
You are not a hero.

1185
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:40,911
No. I'm not.

1186
01:47:42,593 --> 01:47:44,064
But he is.

1187
01:47:55,268 --> 01:47:57,609
You cannot stand against me.

1188
01:47:57,735 --> 01:48:00,528
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1189
01:48:09,843 --> 01:48:12,876
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1190
01:48:51,517 --> 01:48:53,146
You can control it.

1191
01:48:57,243 --> 01:48:58,762
You have to.

1192
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:12,380
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1193
01:49:35,455 --> 01:49:38,823
- Yes!
- Yes!

1194
01:50:01,932 --> 01:50:04,659
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

1195
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,739
I'm only here because of him.

1196
01:50:12,578 --> 01:50:14,895
That makes two of us.

1197
01:50:31,429 --> 01:50:33,524
See you around, old friend.

1198
01:50:48,591 --> 01:50:50,323
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1199
01:50:50,449 --> 01:50:52,099
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1200
01:50:52,225 --> 01:50:53,809
Fair enough.

1201
01:50:55,208 --> 01:50:56,812
Just be careful.

1202
01:50:56,939 --> 01:51:00,088
The kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul.

1203
01:51:00,214 --> 01:51:05,669
It's his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot.

1204
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:09,622
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1205
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:19,612
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1206
01:51:19,738 --> 01:51:21,270
Just saying.

1207
01:51:22,554 --> 01:51:24,468
We made a great team.

1208
01:51:29,999 --> 01:51:31,507
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1209
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:34,170
Smasher, let's go.

1210
01:51:45,286 --> 01:51:48,019
Long live the Champion.

1211
01:51:48,145 --> 01:51:53,834
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

1212
01:51:55,444 --> 01:51:57,342
You could lead them.

1213
01:52:30,658 --> 01:52:32,311
How does it feel?

1214
01:52:33,839 --> 01:52:35,102
Wrong.

1215
01:52:46,402 --> 01:52:47,848
So... what now?

1216
01:52:48,659 --> 01:52:51,079
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1217
01:52:51,205 --> 01:52:53,478
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1218
01:52:53,973 --> 01:52:55,551
And it still does.

1219
01:52:56,397 --> 01:52:59,304
What is needs now is a protector.

1220
01:52:59,397 --> 01:53:00,898
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1221
01:53:01,024 --> 01:53:03,680
Perhaps that name is a little...

1222
01:53:03,805 --> 01:53:05,260
old-fashioned.

1223
01:53:06,247 --> 01:53:08,095
So what should we call you?

1224
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:49,799
BLACK ADAM

1225
01:56:03,309 --> 01:56:05,917
<i>Okay, "Black Adam."</i>

1226
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:11,113
<i>My name is Amanda Waller.
Congratulations, you have my attention.</i>

1227
01:56:11,239 --> 01:56:14,473
<i>This is gonna be your only warning.</i>

1228
01:56:15,171 --> 01:56:18,079
<i>You don't want to stay in my prison,
that's fine.</i>

1229
01:56:18,205 --> 01:56:20,512
<i>Kahndaq is your prison now.</i>

1230
01:56:20,804 --> 01:56:24,765
<i>You step one foot outside of it,
you will not live to regret it.</i>

1231
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:28,970
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1232
01:56:29,096 --> 01:56:32,748
<i>I can call in a favor and send people
who aren't from this planet.</i>

1233
01:56:34,631 --> 01:56:36,587
Send them all.

1234
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:39,121
<i>As you wish.</i>

1235
01:56:54,102 --> 01:56:58,286
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1236
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:05,057
Black Adam.

1237
01:57:06,103 --> 01:57:07,738
We should talk.

1238
01:57:11,079 --> 02:05:00,000
