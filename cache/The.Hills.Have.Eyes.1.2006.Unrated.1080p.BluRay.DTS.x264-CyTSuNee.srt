1
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,960
Help me! Help me. Help me.

2
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,080
My cake is ready.

3
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,880
Time for the show. Everybody on stage.

4
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,729
Ruby?

5
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,190
Is that you?

6
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,440
Goddamn it.

7
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,580
Ruby?

8
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,010
Ruby?

9
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,890
Ruby?

10
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,500
Ruby?

11
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,549
If that's you, Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

12
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,970
Ya hear me?

13
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,479
I told you, it's over!

14
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm out! Ya hear me?

15
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,699
You're on your own now!

16
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,619
I...

17
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

18
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,110
Oh.

19
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,100
Huh?

20
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,270
Hello!

21
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,239
Hey!

22
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,319
- Ah! It's hot out here.
- Honey, you ought to stay in the car out of the wind.

23
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,119
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

24
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,329
- Hello?
- Hey.

25
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,250
- Get up, jackass.
- Bobby!

26
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,589
Oh. Hey.

27
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,129
- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

28
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,099
Hey!

29
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,890
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

30
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,099
You okay?

31
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,359
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

32
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,859
- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
- Doug, relax, please.

33
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,779
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

34
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,739
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

35
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,789
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

36
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,040
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

37
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,339
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

38
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,210
Huh?

39
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,049
Aw, it's okay.

40
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,849
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

41
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,769
Don't see too many travelers around here.
Where y'all headed?

42
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,019
- San Diego.
- California?

43
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,939
- Uh-huh.
- Sure didn't take the fastest road.

44
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,149
Oh, no. We absolutely
had to see the desert.

45
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,649
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

46
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,489
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

47
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,489
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

48
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,159
Yeah.

49
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,209
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

50
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,039
Yeah.

51
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,499
- Come here. Come on.
He's a good little piggy.

52
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,419
Little baby piggy.
Little baby piggy.

53
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,509
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

54
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,259
Oh, my God.
That's so random.

55
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,559
You two make a perfect pair.

56
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,769
- Hey.

57
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,059
You're sweet.

58
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,230
Yeah.

59
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,779
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

60
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,739
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

61
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,080
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

62
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,949
Geez.

63
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,289
She's so uncomfortable in this heat.
I told you to use cloth diapers.

64
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,419
- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.
- Look at those little cheeks.

65
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,629
- I know, sweetheart.
- Yes, she is. It's okay.

66
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,140
I think she's getting hungry again.

67
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,229
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can
use? I can't get a signal out here.

68
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,649
No, I don't.

69
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,569
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

70
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,609
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

71
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,199
Honey, you've been on the phone
since we left, really.

72
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,699
Well, sweetheart,
I've been gone two days.

73
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,489
I have to make sure that
my store's not burning to the ground.

74
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,290
Oh, God.

75
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,469
What the hell, Brenda?

76
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,930
Damn it!

77
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,019
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

78
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,019
How far are we from I-88?

79
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,019
- Freaking perv.
- What?

80
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,269
- You're at least five or six hours.
- You hungry, sweetie?

81
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,979
- Why couldn't we have gone through Santa Fe?
- It's nasty out here.

82
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,529
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

83
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,619
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

84
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,079
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88. From there...

85
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,709
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

86
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,669
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

87
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,169
I used to work the night patrol
for 15 years.

88
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,209
Is that right? You a cop?

89
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,089
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

90
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,969
- I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,929
You a cop too, mister?

92
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,059
No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.

93
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,599
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

94
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,599
Everything's fine. Oil's okay.

95
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,609
Beauty, come back here!

96
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,319
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

97
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,649
Uh, $46 even.

98
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,119
Oh, hey, Bob, here.
Let me take care of that.

99
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,949
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

100
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,909
That's not what I meant.

101
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,619
Beauty?

102
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,170
Beauty?

103
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,840
Beauty?

104
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,380
Beauty? Come on, girl.

105
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,100
Beauty?

106
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,930
Beauty? Come on, girl.

107
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,110
Hello?

108
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,360
Is anyone there?

109
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,200
Beauty!

110
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,589
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,719
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

112
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,090
- Lynn, we're leaving!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

113
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,019
Bobby, she keeps getting out.

114
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,650
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

115
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,109
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

116
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,699
- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!

117
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,739
Do you need something?

118
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,369
No, thanks.

119
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,579
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

120
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,000
Honey, we're on vacation.

121
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,879
Yeah?

122
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,509
You know, uh...

123
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,009
it's not on the map,
but if you...

124
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,389
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

125
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,389
- Uh-huh.
- It'll lead you through the hills.

126
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,609
Probably save you
a couple of hours.

127
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,319
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

128
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,779
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

129
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,989
Old fence, dirt road, two miles.

130
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,119
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

131
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,580
Thank you.

132
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,640
Dad, I hate your singing.

133
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,640
Guys, no.

134
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,689
- Stop!
- Imagine the first people to cross this desert.

135
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,689
They didn't know
where they were.

136
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,939
- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.

137
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,609
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

138
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,989
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

139
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,989
It's gorgeous.

140
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,709
- This is so fucked!
- Excuse me?

141
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,919
Watch your language, young lady.

142
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,039
I would like
a little backup here.

143
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,049
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

144
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,759
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

145
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,719
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

146
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,429
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

147
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,889
- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.

148
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,399
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

149
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,320
- Dad.
- Stop that.

150
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,869
Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...

151
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,659
with a broken air conditioner.

152
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,659
Great vacation.

153
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,789
I'm glad you came because I would
have been so fucking bored otherwise.

154
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,170
Yeah. So bored.

155
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,879
Oh. Give up on that, man.

156
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,009
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

157
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,009
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

158
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,849
There.

159
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,059
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

160
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,059
It's disconnected.

161
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,730
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

162
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,279
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

163
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,699
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

164
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,370
Fuck your sister.

165
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,959
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

166
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,209
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

167
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,209
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,339
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

169
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,260
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

170
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,219
Uh-uh.

171
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,809
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

172
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,479
I think she did that
a long time ago.

173
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,940
I think you're right.

174
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,529
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

175
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,449
Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

176
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,659
The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?

177
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,030
Oh, my God!

178
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,710
Jesus! Hang on!

179
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,750
Watch the baby!

180
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,769
Honey? Where's the baby?

181
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,809
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

182
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,889
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

183
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,609
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?

184
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,529
Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm just a little scared.

185
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,609
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

186
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,659
He's all right.

187
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,989
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

188
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,489
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

189
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,959
Son of a bitch!

190
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,419
- Okay, okay, we're all right.
- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.

191
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,589
Come here, guys.
Come here.

192
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,379
Beauty!

193
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,840
Beast!

194
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,350
We are so fucked.

195
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,479
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

196
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,489
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage, and
we find ourselves in that three percent.

197
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,069
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

198
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,159
I hope he's enjoying himself.

199
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,699
Doug, don't start.

200
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,499
- Maybe somebody will need a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

201
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,419
- What?
- Come on.

202
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,299
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

203
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,009
- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
- It's my fault?

204
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,879
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

205
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,349
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

206
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,139
General, what's the damage?

207
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,189
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

208
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,689
Can we fix it?

209
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,980
What?

210
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,029
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

211
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,699
- With what? I mean-
- There she is.

212
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,199
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

213
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,369
No signal. I tried.

214
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,409
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt you're gonna get anybody.

215
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,539
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

216
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,130
So, what are we gonna do?

217
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,260
Excuse me.

218
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,850
Bob? What are we doing?

219
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,399
We walk.

220
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,650
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

221
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,819
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

222
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,789
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

223
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,579
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

224
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,619
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

225
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,419
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

226
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,920
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

227
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,470
There you go. Ah, good boy.

228
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,309
I'm sure this desert is full of
rattlesnakes. Is that locked?

229
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,439
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

230
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,109
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,450
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

232
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,279
- You know, I saw-Mom?
- What?

233
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,159
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,209
- I saw a documentary on desert snakes-
- Uh-huh.

235
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,959
On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...

236
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,839
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

237
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,259
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

238
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,839
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

239
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,179
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

240
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,139
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

241
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,559
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

242
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,519
Well, some things never change.

243
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,149
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

244
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,190
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

245
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,909
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

246
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,779
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

247
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,119
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

248
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,539
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

249
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,999
Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here. Just one shot.

250
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,589
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

251
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,669
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

252
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,009
You know, he's right.

253
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,930
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

254
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,359
- Hey, "B." '
- Hey.

255
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,149
How you holding up?

256
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,609
I am thrilled.

257
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,699
Yeah. This is a total drag.

258
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,079
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

259
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,539
Next year, I am going
to Cancun with my friends.

260
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,079
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

261
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,459
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

262
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,049
And if you want to go to Cancun,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

263
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,970
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

264
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,219
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

265
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,809
Oh, yeah.

266
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,730
Honey? Can you bring me my jacket?

267
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,480
I'll be right there, honey.

268
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,339
Bobby!

269
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,219
Fucker!

270
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,509
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

271
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,220
Aw.

272
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,409
- Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

273
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,579
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

274
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,249
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

275
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,079
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

276
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,579
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

277
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,749
I don't need a gun to find help.

278
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,379
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

279
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,839
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

280
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,299
- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.

281
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,599
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles, just come back.

282
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,019
All right?

283
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,809
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

284
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,189
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

285
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,609
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

286
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,939
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be
back with a tow truck before nightfall.

287
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,029
- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Nope.

288
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,739
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

289
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,289
Listen up. Your brother is
in charge, all right?

290
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,829
- So don't tease him.
- I think we should pray before you go.

291
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,879
- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?

292
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,169
- Yes.
- Come on.

293
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,169
Damn it.

294
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,219
We're waiting.

295
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,800
Thank God no one's watching us.

296
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,639
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

297
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,269
- Stop.
- Thanks.

298
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,519
Please bless us at this time...

299
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,979
and send your guardian angels...

300
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,269
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

301
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,649
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

302
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,699
- Amen.
- Amen.

303
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,279
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

304
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,489
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

305
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,539
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

306
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,159
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

307
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,499
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

308
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,210
I love you too. Bye.

309
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,929
Hi.

310
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,849
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

311
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,139
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

312
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,189
Are you hungry?

313
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,149
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

314
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,899
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

315
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,449
You know, honey, really...

316
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,239
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

317
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,199
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

318
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,580
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

319
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,959
I can't believe that we're stranded in the
middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

320
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,049
- Hmm.
- You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

321
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,219
we'd be in California right now.

322
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,179
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

323
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,639
- The beach.
- A massage.

324
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,139
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

325
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,479
- The chronic.
- The what?

326
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,859
Brenda!

327
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,439
What?

328
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,439
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

329
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,359
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly.

330
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,869
- Who smokes pot?
- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?

331
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,699
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

332
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,129
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

333
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,629
Why are the dogs so excited?

334
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,839
- There's probably some rattlesnakes somewhere around.
- Eww.

335
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,509
You know how Freud would have interpreted
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?

336
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,759
Bobby!

337
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,929
So bad.

338
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,519
- Bobby Carter! Stop that!
- That's gross!

339
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,229
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

340
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,099
- I apologize to the entire table.
- Well, thank you.

341
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,359
I'm really glad that
we all came on this trip together.

342
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,320
Ah, well, that makes one of us.

343
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,909
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

344
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,829
No.

345
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,619
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

346
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,829
- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
- Bobby.

347
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,829
- Bobby?
- Sorry.

348
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,919
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

349
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,049
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

350
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,470
Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

351
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,800
Beauty!

352
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,150
Beauty!

353
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,960
Beauty!

354
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,540
Beauty!

355
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,180
Fuck!

356
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,610
What the hell?

357
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,950
Look at that. Huh.

358
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,490
Hello?

359
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,290
Hello?

360
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,670
Hey, buddy.

361
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,720
Hello?

362
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,190
Hello!

363
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,620
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

364
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,380
Yo!

365
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,629
I grabbed some water, all right?

366
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,640
Uh-

367
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,019
It's dead. Damn it.

368
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,309
Yo, my friend! Hey!

369
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,809
You here?

370
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,400
You home?

371
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,720
Hello?

372
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,520
Hello?

373
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,960
Weird son of a bitch.

374
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,350
Yeah.

375
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,020
Jupiter!

376
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,239
I got buckshot, ya hear?

377
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,280
Hey, mister.

378
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,199
You don't understand
what's going on here.

379
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,710
Hey!

380
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,629
The kids...

381
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:03,049
grew up in the mines
like wild animals.

382
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,510
Open the door, slowly!

383
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,100
What kind of place
is that for children?

384
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,809
What kind of a place is that?

385
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:21,190
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

386
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,739
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

387
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,990
Hey!

388
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,160
Daddy.

389
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,200
Daddy.

390
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,460
Daddy.

391
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,669
Daddy. Daddy.

392
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,089
Daddy. Oh, Daddy.

393
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,589
Daddy. Daddy.

394
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,219
Daddy. Daddy.

395
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,720
Daddy. Daddy.

396
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,400
Daddy.

397
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,749
Would you give me that gun, Pluto!

398
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,879
- Give me the gosh darn gun!
- Get on over here!

399
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,420
That's right. Come on.
You oughtn't have a gun.

400
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,860
Brenda?

401
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,079
Brenda!

402
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,950
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

403
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,959
Bobby!

404
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,710
Bobby!

405
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,050
Bobby!

406
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,430
Bobby!

407
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,120
Bobby!

408
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,209
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

409
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,419
It's just-

410
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,379
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

411
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,510
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

412
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,050
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

413
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,729
- Did you-Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

414
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,189
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

415
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,109
What breathing?

416
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,439
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

417
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,819
I'm sure it was just static.

418
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,909
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

419
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,869
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

420
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,879
Bobby! What-

421
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,130
- Honey?
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.

422
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:56,300
What is wrong with him?

423
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,890
What's he doing?

424
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,240
Shit.

425
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,119
Beast! Beast!

426
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,169
- Hey, Bobby.
- Jesus Christ!

427
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,539
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

428
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,089
- Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

429
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,679
It's me! You okay?

430
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,389
- Yeah.
- God!

431
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,719
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

432
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,979
Look, I found this place out here. You wouldn't
believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

433
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,019
- Hey.
- Is that Bob?

434
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,979
- It's Doug. It's okay.
- Ta-da!

435
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,489
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

436
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,069
- No, I'm fine. Just exhausted. Look.
- Yeah.

437
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,069
Look at all this stuff I found.

438
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:07,529
There's a huge crater out there.

439
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:11,499
People must use it as a dump site. I've
never seen anything like it in my life.

440
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,499
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

441
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,749
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

442
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,589
- I thought you went to go find somebody.
- Road dead-ends in five miles.

443
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,209
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

444
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,259
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

445
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,179
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

446
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,179
Maybe we just missed a turn.

447
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,269
- Honey, did you guys cook any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

448
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:35,389
- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
- Yeah?

449
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,439
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

450
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,649
Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.

451
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,980
Do you use it
without telling me?

452
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,379
Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.

453
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,509
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

454
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,509
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

455
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:16,509
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

456
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,559
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

457
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,439
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

458
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,899
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

459
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,649
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

460
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:33,069
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

461
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,740
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.

462
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,699
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

463
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,999
- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.

464
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,499
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

465
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,709
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

466
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,129
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

467
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,969
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

468
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,719
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

469
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,889
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

470
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,349
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

471
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,100
- Sorry.
- Did you get pillows?

472
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,650
They're in the S.U.V.

473
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,069
Hey, hey, listen.

474
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,569
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

475
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,909
- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.

476
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,289
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

477
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,079
Good night.

478
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,289
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

479
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,880
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

480
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,010
Hi.

481
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,240
Beast.

482
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,280
Beast?

483
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,720
Beast?

484
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:20,969
Beast?

485
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,390
Beast?

486
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,190
Beast?

487
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,500
Beast?

488
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,879
Beast?

489
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,180
Beast? Come here, boy.

490
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,560
Beast?

491
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,669
Hey. Guys! Guys!

492
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,169
- Oh, good God. What-
- Jesus!

493
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,089
- Bobby.
- What is it, Bobby?

494
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,219
- Guys, something-something is going on around here, okay?
- What is it?

495
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,969
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

496
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,429
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

497
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,269
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

498
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,479
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

499
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,819
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

500
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,109
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

501
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,699
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

502
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,659
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

503
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,669
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

504
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:23,129
But I'm telling you, there is something going
on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

505
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,670
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

506
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,799
- We're not alone.
- All right, Lynn.

507
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,309
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

508
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,139
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

509
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,560
Now!

510
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:50,239
It's Bob.

511
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,989
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

512
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,449
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

513
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,789
Dad? Dad!

514
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,450
Brenda. Watch the baby!

515
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,190
No!

516
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,590
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

517
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,370
Get off! Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

518
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,000
Doug! Do something!

519
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:45,010
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

520
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,560
I told you to move!
So, move!

521
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,730
Now, get! Get!

522
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,240
Whoo!

523
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:16,039
What you got under there?
That's it. Give it to me. Whoo! Whoo!

524
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,159
Fuck off!

525
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,080
Come on. Yeah!

526
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,039
Whoo!

527
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,550
Whoo.

528
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,799
It's not my Bob!
It's not my Bob!

529
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,349
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No, just come on.

530
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,479
It's not my Bob.

531
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,229
What was that?

532
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,860
Mom, just stay here, okay?

533
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,160
Help! Help! Help!

534
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,909
Oh, you fat.

535
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,669
Oh. Big, fat...

536
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,540
and juicy.

537
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,270
No. No, please!

538
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,249
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

539
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,329
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

540
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:39,380
Get back here! Don't do something stupid!

541
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,300
No. No.

542
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,350
Get back to the trailer!

543
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,909
Come on!
Get out the door!

544
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,249
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

545
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,039
- Brenda!
- Bobby!

546
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,249
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

547
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,589
That's it. Look at me.

548
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:20,719
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

549
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,640
Brenda!

550
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,890
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

551
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:45,070
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

552
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:06,010
No.

553
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,059
Oh, God!

554
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,689
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

555
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,229
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

556
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:21,859
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

557
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,279
Okay.

558
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,110
Honey? Sweetheart?

559
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,579
Lynn, come on!

560
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,870
Lynn!

561
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,920
Come on!

562
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,720
Oh!

563
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,710
Hmm.

564
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,599
Okay.

565
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,269
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

566
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,399
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

567
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,570
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

568
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,869
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

569
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,869
- It's still a mess.
- Shh.

570
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,410
It's a mess.

571
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,800
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

572
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,629
Every-Everybody went to bed?

573
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,639
- Yes?
- Yeah.

574
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,350
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

575
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,310
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

576
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,979
You need anything?

577
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,239
- A blanket.
- Okay.

578
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,239
- It's cold.
- Okay.

579
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:46,280
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

580
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,920
You're so sweet, Doug.

581
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,879
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

582
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,470
So-

583
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,609
I'm not gonna take this shit.

584
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:24,319
- Hey, we're not going anywhere! You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

585
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,399
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

586
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,109
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

587
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:33,329
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

588
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,539
We need a plan.
We need to think.

589
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,619
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

590
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,619
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

591
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:43,589
They have your daughter. And you're
just gonna sit here and do nothing?

592
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,959
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

593
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,760
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

594
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,309
No! Turn the lights on.

595
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,849
Turn the lights on.
Turn the lights on.

596
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:03,099
- He said he's coming back!
- Shh! Quiet!

597
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,270
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

598
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,570
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

599
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:22,450
Goggle? Goggle?

600
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:12,170
Goggle? You copy, Goggle?

601
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,709
Where's Goggle?

602
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:20,379
He stayed back there.
He's keeping an eye on them.

603
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,929
- I told you.
- What?

604
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:30,640
I told you,
you've gotta kill them all!

605
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,869
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

606
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,999
Oh, good boy.
Good boy. Good boy.

607
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,079
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

608
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,839
Jupiter's going to finish them off.

609
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,009
Why are you doing this to us?

610
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:09,259
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

611
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,680
Give me back my baby!

612
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:17,269
What the fuck
do you want from us?

613
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,849
What do you want?

614
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,570
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

615
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:42,619
- Bobby?
- Hmm?

616
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,629
How many bullets
do you have left?

617
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,500
A clip and a half.

618
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,920
What are we doing?

619
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,270
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

620
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:55,819
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

621
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,480
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

622
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,810
Where are they, boy?

623
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,380
Which way, Beast?

624
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,850
Good boy.

625
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,719
Bobby?

626
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,469
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

627
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:52,100
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

628
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,159
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

629
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,999
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

630
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,499
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

631
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,999
We're in the middle of freakin'...
Ah, shit!

632
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,840
God!

633
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,680
I'm sorry.

634
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,229
I'm so scared.

635
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,860
Who are these people?

636
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,300
Good dog. Stay.

637
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,939
- Did you push her?
- Yes.

638
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,069
- Did you destroy the furniture?
- No.

639
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,570
Did you call her
trailer park trash?

640
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:17,749
- So, now, you're saying you still-
- I'm still in love with her.

641
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,249
Okay, but-So, you said
you treasured the marriage...

642
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,589
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

643
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,629
I wanted to end it
because I have-

644
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:28,259
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

645
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,929
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

646
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:34,099
- What were you doing coaching her?
- Well, I tried to show-

647
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,679
- Is she your child?
- No, she's not my child, but she-

648
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,600
Shh, shh, shh.

649
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:43,439
She wanted me
to eat dinner-spaghetti-

650
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,230
and I wanted to do it
before it got cold.

651
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,000
Watch her head, Bobby.

652
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,510
Come on.

653
01:23:40,670 --> 01:23:43,919
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

654
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,219
Answer me!

655
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:50,719
I don't know where she is.

656
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:55,470
I never leave this place.

657
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:02,359
Your people asked our families...

658
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,519
to leave their town...

659
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,319
and you destroyed our homes.

660
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:14,199
We went into the mines.

661
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:18,789
You set off your bombs...

662
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:22,040
and turned everything to ashes.

663
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:28,630
You made us what we've become.

664
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,009
Boom. Boom. Boom!

665
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:36,549
Where's my baby?

666
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:40,020
What's so funny?

667
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,810
It's breakfast time!

668
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,869
Please don't kill me.

669
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:55,329
"Please don't kill me."

670
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,880
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me."

671
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:33,839
Lizard.

672
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,300
Kill the baby.

673
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:36,650
Baby. Baby.

674
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,709
Get out of the way, Ruby.

675
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:03,090
I said get. Now, get!

676
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:18,940
Mister, would you play with us?

677
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,170
Ruby!

678
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:55,590
Catherine!

679
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,680
It's okay.

680
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:13,190
It's okay.
We'll be all right.

681
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,410
It's okay.

682
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,369
No. No.

683
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:29,579
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

684
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,789
- Come on, Brenda.
- Bobby!

685
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:34,299
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

686
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:39,219
Come on. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

687
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,050
It'll be all right.

688
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:47,730
Careful. Please? Please?

689
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:59,900
Oh, shit.

690
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:09,700
Come on out, you motherfucker.

691
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:18,299
Look. Look. It's just a tumbleweed.
Come on.

692
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:22,379
Come on. Let's go back
to the trailer. Come on.

693
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:26,300
Come on. Come on.

694
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:37,149
Oh, my God!

695
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:39,269
- Oh, my God!
- She's gone.

696
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,779
She's fucking gone! She's gone!
Brenda! Brenda! Go get the trailer ready.

697
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,779
- Brenda, go get the-
- Where's Mom?

698
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:48,239
- Go get the trailer ready. Okay?
- Where's Mom?

699
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:51,699
- Where's Mom?
- Listen to me. I need you to go get the trailer.

700
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:54,410
Just go in,
do what we talked about.

701
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:16,820
Let's go! Get the window!
Get the window!

702
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:22,579
It's stuck!

703
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:26,410
Bob! Help me! Bob!

704
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,140
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

705
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,060
Here.

706
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,939
Ruby!

707
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,610
Ruby!

708
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,950
Ruby!

709
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,789
Ruby! Come back here!

710
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:32,210
You little bitch!

711
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:48,510
Give me that baby!

712
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:55,190
Fuck!

713
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:11,740
Come on. Let's get out of here.

714
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,040
Oh, my God.
Look! Bobby!
