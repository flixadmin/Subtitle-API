1
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,478
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,016
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,617
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,520
My only companion
is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:06,161
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,632
<i>It seems I've become a featured
player in the theater of the absurd.</i>

7
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,803
<i>Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.</i>

8
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:16,671
<i>But it's all good,</i>

9
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,308
<i>thanks to a breathable atmosphere
and my supreme intellect,</i>

10
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,777
<i>sharpened against the only
competitor savvy enough to bring it.</i>

11
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,247
Chanterelle to d4. Mmm.

12
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,649
<i>I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...</i>

13
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:30,252
Mushroom coffee.

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,689
<i>With limited...</i>

15
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,025
<i>limited...</i>

16
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,494
<i>limited...</i>

17
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:42,530
<i>success.</i>

18
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,270
<i>But today, day 243,</i>

19
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:51,706
<i>has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...</i>

20
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,845
<i>Planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.</i>

21
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,220
If my calculations are correct,

22
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:09,191
and there's no reason to say
"if" because they always are...

23
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:13,594
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

24
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,099
Let's light this candle...

25
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,669
and see who comes
a-knockin'.

26
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:28,602
Greetings!

27
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,777
<i>Klaatu barada nikto.</i>

28
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,990
Agent Stone? Now!

29
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,168
Thank you, Stone.

30
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:06,908
It's time to say goodbye to
this piece-of-shiitake planet!

31
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,086
Huh?

32
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,869
Where did you get that?

33
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,275
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.

34
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,113
I'd be happy
to show you the way.

35
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,670
Oh.

36
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,082
They're still on us.

37
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,552
This'll slow 'em down.

00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:51,712
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

44
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,450
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mind if I drive?

45
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,454
Better buckle up.

46
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:09,064
How we doing back there?

47
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,399
And now this way.

48
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:17,038
Whoo-hoo!

49
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,410
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't speak duct tape.

50
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,947
What the heck are you?
Fear not, citizen.

51
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:30,018
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

52
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,654
The blue dawn
that banishes the darkest...

53
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,389
Holy crap!

54
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,927
Don't worry.

55
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,962
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

56
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,569
Huh. What are
those? Bombs. Bombs.

57
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:48,942
They're bombs! Those are bombs!

58
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,139
Relax. They're not even lit.

59
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:55,043
So I'll say again,
nobody's gonna get...

60
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,046
I was wrong! We're
all gonna die!

61
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,716
Why aren't you slowing down?

62
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,885
That would require brakes.

63
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,189
Oh, it's hot. Hot, hot, hot!

64
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,123
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

65
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,361
Because that's not
what heroes do.

66
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:19,334
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

67
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:26,374
Do you hear that?
There's one bomb left.

68
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,643
Uh... Uh-oh.

69
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:29,944
Did you check under the seat?

70
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,880
Of course I checked
under the seat!

71
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:34,749
You are terrible at this!

72
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:37,886
You know what? Your negative
attitude is not helping anyone.

73
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,221
It's in your spiky things!

74
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:44,559
Ha! I can never find
anything in here.

75
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,730
Drained it from downtown!

76
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,466
See? I told you
nobody would get hurt.

77
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,970
Holy sherbet!

78
00:08:57,807 --> 00:08:58,907
Oh, hello.

79
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,010
Don't panic.
This is only a drill.

80
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:44,986
Come here!

81
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,823
No need to thank me, citizens.

82
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,792
All in a night's work for...

83
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,528
Blue Justice!

84
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,430
You're a terrible hero!

Morning, Sonic!

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Uh-oh. Uh...

Oh, Sonic.

96
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,100
I miss you, Longclaw.

97
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:08,670
I'm trying to make you proud.

98
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:21,749
And now
for a little shut-eye.

99
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,720
Oh! Blech!

100
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,355
Ozzy, morning breath!

101
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,357
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

102
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,993
You're supposed
to meet Tom, remember?

103
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:37,532
All right, all right,
I'm up! I'm up.

104
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,335
What a day.

105
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,637
Whoo!

106
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,807
Thanks for coming out, bud.

107
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,341
You know,
I feel like you and me,

108
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,643
we haven't had
much time together lately.

109
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,081
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

110
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,490
I can't swim! Help!

111
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,759
If I die,
don't look in my closet!

112
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:07,128
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

113
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:08,463
It's freezing.

114
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,900
All right, okay. Take it easy.

115
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:15,036
All right. You're good. Okay.

116
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,109
But now that you've had
a nap and a bath...

117
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:25,713
<i>I went up to your room last night to
bring you some new comics and, um...</i>

118
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,919
<i>Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Stop right there.</i>

119
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,388
<i>I wouldn't come any closer,</i>

120
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,958
<i>because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.</i>

121
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,725
<i>Oh, no. Oh, no.</i>

122
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,128
<i>I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!</i>

123
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,597
<i>Oh, no, here comes another one!</i>

124
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,499
<i>Go. Now. Save yourself.</i>

125
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:47,211
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop
right there. I wouldn't come any closer,</i>

126
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:50,438
<i>because this little
hedgehog had way too many chili dogs.</i>

127
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,373
<i>Oh, no. Oh, no.</i>

128
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,242
<i>I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...</i>

129
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,744
Ugh! I knew I should've
used real farts.

130
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,215
How many times
are we gonna do this?

131
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:03,862
What? Cast your line and not
catch anything? Seems like a billion.

132
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,321
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

133
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,857
The lying. The sneaking out.

134
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,258
The pretending to be Batman.

135
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,994
Blue Justice, trademark pending.

136
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,337
Whatever. You're being reckless.

137
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,463
Ugh!
Not this conversation again.

138
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:17,265
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

139
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:18,776
But if you keep
being irresponsible,

140
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,440
we're gonna keep
having this conversation.

141
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,303
How is it irresponsible
to use my powers?

142
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,406
Sonic, you destroyed
an entire city block!

143
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,141
That block
was already messed up.

144
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,409
Who cares?

145
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:31,914
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.

146
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:35,416
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

147
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:40,722
You're supposed
to be my friend.

148
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,390
Stop trying to be my dad.

149
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:49,031
I can take care of myself.

150
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,466
Sonic, taking care of yourself

151
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,568
is not what being
a hero's all about.

152
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:56,371
It's about taking
responsibility for other people.

153
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,941
And right now,
whether you want to hear this or not,

154
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,241
you are still just a kid.

155
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,543
You got some more
growing up to do

156
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,880
before you're ready
to be the big hero.

157
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,049
But trust me when I tell you,

158
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,852
there will come a time when
your powers will be needed.

159
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,389
But you don't choose
that moment.

160
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,224
That moment chooses you.

161
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:19,227
Whoa. Look at you.

162
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,097
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.

163
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,875
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

164
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,069
No, sir. That is
a Wachowski family special.

165
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,636
Came from my dad,

166
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,106
in this very boat,
on this very lake.

167
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,276
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

168
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,946
And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.

169
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:42,985
So, until your moment arrives,

170
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:45,888
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

171
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,523
<i>Comprende?</i>

172
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:50,558
<i>Comprende.</i>

173
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,895
High five on it.

174
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:56,698
Yeah! Donut Lord and the
Blue Blur are back at it again!

175
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,266
Hang on.

176
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,434
Speedboat!

177
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,536
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

178
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,338
Sonic!

179
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,741
Whoo-hoo!

180
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,813
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me? Oh, Hawaii.

181
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,981
Oh, yeah!

182
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:15,483
Wow.

183
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:18,653
Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.

184
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,221
Now boarding groups one and two.

185
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,790
Oh!

186
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:25,094
Sonic, this is so fun!

187
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,586
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you're group three. Please wait your turn.

188
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,397
Anyone from groups one and two?

189
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,330
Just let him get it out
of his system. Nobody?

190
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,701
Okay, then everybody else
right this way.

191
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:34,702
Thank you.

192
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,945
And you, sir?

193
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,345
Terrible shirt detected.

194
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,680
There we go.

195
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,816
Okay, you're free to go.
Enjoy your trip.

196
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,283
Bye-bye now.

197
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,352
Okay.

198
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,188
Bring it in.

199
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,058
Tom, I'm about to be hedgehog
of the house for the first time.

200
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,459
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

201
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:01,429
Okay,
what about a power bump? Power bump?

202
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,965
Yes, power bump.

203
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,166
That's more like it.

204
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,400
Wachowski!

205
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:08,669
Okay, use this one
to get back home.

206
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:10,438
Oh!

207
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,108
All right, we're off. Be good.

208
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:15,177
Yes. You have our number.

209
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,056
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!

210
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,347
Miss you already! Okay?

211
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,382
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

212
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:24,820
Okay, it's 48 hours
until they come back.

213
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,687
We've got TV channels,
streaming channels,

00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,756

If these readings
are accurate, he's here.

243
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,417
I found him!

244
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,888
I just hope I'm not too late.

245
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,140
Hmm. He's close.

246
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,809
I just need a way to reach
him without being spotted.

247
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:32,381

Perfect.

<i>- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.</i>

255
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:57,806
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

256
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,074
<i>And you? What's up with you?</i>

257
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,943
I was just calling
to say we're here.

258
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:03,879
<i>But now every word out of your
mouth is making me suspicious.</i>

259
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:08,649
What? You got to relax,
buddy. You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

260
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,053
Have a Mai Tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

261
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,188
Get sunburned
somewhere embarrassing.

262
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:15,589
<i>This weekend is about you.</i>

263
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:18,327
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

264
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,895
So whatever it is you're doing,

265
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,197
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

266
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:26,969
<i>Exactly! I mean,
I am deeply offended by such accusations!</i>

267
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:28,904
<i>So, how's Rachel's fiancé?</i>

268
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,406
<i>Is he as good-looking in
person as he is in pictures?</i>

269
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,474
Hey, baby.

270
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,509
Somehow better-looking.

271
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,563
<i>Wow! You're about to be the
third best-looking dude in the family.</i>

272
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,315
<i>But, hey, still on the podium.</i>

273
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,716
Ha-ha-ha.

274
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,618
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

275
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,154
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

276
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,755
Trouble? Don't worry.

277
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:50,591
Everything here
is completely normal.

278
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,961
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

279
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,896
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

280
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,731
You've got a lot
of nerve coming up in here

281
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:59,267
after what you did
to my fiancée.

282
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,169
Wait. What? Totaling her car?

283
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:02,670
Leaving her tied to a chair?

284
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,306
I should rip you limb from limb.

285
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:10,045
Oh, my God, look at your face!

286
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:12,047
Tommy, breathe, baby.
Breathe. I was kidding.

287
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,548
Hey, man,
I was totally kidding. Okay.

288
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:17,718
You were kidding. Yeah.

289
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,287
I'm sorry.
Rachel put me up to it.

290
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,223
It was totally her idea.

291
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:22,590
That rascal.

292
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,493
Listen, I don't know
if you're aware.

293
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:27,528
Rachel does not care
for you at all.

294
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,796
Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

295
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,565
Seriously, bro,
you got work to do.

296
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,035
Hey! Hey.

297
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:35,536
Good to see you!
Thanks for coming, Tom.

298
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,939
Really glad you came. Really?

299
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:39,573
Uh...

300
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,642
Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

301
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,079
I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.

302
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,014
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

303
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,148
Ah.

304
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,682
Can we Bury the hatchet?

305
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:50,252
I'd love that.

306
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,719
Yeah? Yeah.

307
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:54,189
All right,
bring it in! All right! Great.

308
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:57,959
Oh. And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

309
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,632
All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

310
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,001
and it's your turn to pick.

311
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,602
<i>But I am not watching
Snow Dogs again.</i>

312
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:11,406
That movie is the worst!

313
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,877
Blackout!

314
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:19,214
Ozzy!

315
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,917
Oh, sorry, buddy.
Everything's okay.

316
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,086
Whoa!

317
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:32,494
Uh, excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

318
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:45,739
Um, if this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

319
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,559
Eggman?

320
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,199
Hello, hedgehog.

321
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,869
Did you miss me?

322
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,538
I don't know how you got back,

323
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,341
but you made
a big mistake coming here.

324
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:22,676
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

325
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,113
The mistake
was thinking you'd won.

326
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:27,748
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

327
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:30,152
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

328
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:31,453
I get it.

329
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,523
I don't think you do.

330
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,358
But you're about to.

331
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,361
And so will that idiot
sheriff and his wife.

332
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:43,664
And your little dog too!

333
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:03,652
Pitiful.

334
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:06,720
What? Who are you?

335
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:10,859
Where are my manners?

336
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:14,629
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

337
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:16,865
My new BFFAE.

338
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:20,235
Bestest friend forever and ever!

339
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:23,605
Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

340
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,540
You're never going
to get my power.

341
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:28,276
Do I look like
I need your power?

342
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:42,290
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

343
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:47,162
Where is it?

344
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:50,465
Oh, you want it? Here it comes.

345
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:53,767
I was expecting more of you.

346
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:55,337
You're unskilled.

347
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,439
Untrained.

348
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,343
And unworthy!

349
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:06,348
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

350
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:35,677
It is my destiny to do
what my ancestors could not...

351
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,382
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

352
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,250
Ultimate power?

353
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:44,719
I don't know
what you're talking about.

354
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:45,954
You've got the wrong guy.

355
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:48,156
Ultimate power?

356
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,393
Now you're speaking my language.

357
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:54,729
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.

358
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,531
You knew Longclaw?

359
00:24:56,665 --> 00:25:00,602
Longclaw and her people were the
sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

360
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,871
We fought and died
at their hands,

361
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:05,674
and now you will die at mine.

362
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:18,553
Come on. Get in!
I'm on your side.

363
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:20,555
I'm sorry. Who are you?

364
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:23,525
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

365
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,962
Get us out of here!
Go, go, go!

366
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,168
Ah! He's gone rabid!

367
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:37,205
Gross! Is he licking it?

368
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,341
See ya!

369
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:42,110
Make sure
to get your shots, Eggman!

370
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:49,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

371
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,019
Whoa!

372
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,192
Wow. Okay. Let me just say

373
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,260
it is an honor to finally meet you,
Sonic.

374
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,796
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?
Everyone calls me Tails.

375
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,665
You're probably wondering why.

376
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:07,135
Let me guess. Because of
the extra tail? That's right!

377
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:08,970
I should've known
you'd get that. Cool.

378
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,040
Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

379
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:14,476
And who is Clifford
the Big Red Rage Monster?

380
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,245
That's Knuckles,
the last of the Echidnas

381
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:19,581
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

382
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:21,916
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

383
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,252
Are you serious?
The Master Emerald?

384
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:26,020
That's just a bedtime story.

385
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:27,555
Well, he believes it's real.

386
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,225
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

387
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,962
Red light! Give me the wheel!

388
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:36,197
Hey, what are you...
Move your foot.

389
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:45,240
I think we lost him.

390
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,948
We did not lose him.

391
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:55,650
We definitely did not lose him!

392
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:02,892
I've got an idea.
Do you trust me?

393
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:05,126
Of course not!
I literally just met you!

394
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,462
Just let me... Come on!
What are you doing?

395
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,549
We're flying.

396
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:30,251
Uh, did your butt just
turn into a helicopter?

397
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:33,054
A butt-copter!

398
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:37,525
Oh, only Sonic the Hedgehog could
come up with something like that.

399
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:54,576
Foxy move.

400
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:57,779
You want something done right...

401
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:02,417
You have to hire someone
you can push around.

402
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,253
All caps.

403
00:28:15,363 --> 00:28:21,536
<i>♪ I waited till I saw the sun ♪</i>

404
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,571
<i>♪ I don't know why
I didn't come ♪</i>

405
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,173
Doctor,

406
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,175
where are you?

407
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,083
Freak.

408
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,894
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry, folks.

409
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:47,595
Uh, I have to close early.
Everybody out!

410
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:50,933
Everybody out. Thank you
for visiting the Mean Bean.

411
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,334
All right, good night.
Good night.

412
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:13,521
He's back.

413
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,625
He's back!

414
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,282
That's more like it.

415
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,152
I've been re-hatched!

416
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:33,936
So, my massively
metacarpaled friend,

417
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:37,106
you mentioned...

418
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:39,173
Ultimate power.

419
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:40,307
Back at the house?

420
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,011
The Master Emerald?

421
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:43,678
It does not concern you.

422
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:46,447
I got you off that planet and
you brought me to the hedgehog.

423
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:48,583
We have no more use
for each other.

424
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,919
Well, I hate to be
a contrarian, but...

425
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,454
I think we might.

426
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:56,925
You think these machines
are a match for me?

427
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,762
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

428
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,865
Oh, they are stairs.

429
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:12,808
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

430
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:15,677
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

431
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:18,379
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

432
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:23,251
I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to...

433
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:29,290
destroy the hedgehog!

434
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,526
You're suggesting an alliance.

435
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:35,998
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

436
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:39,634
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

437
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:44,706
You truculent space bumpkin!

438
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,109
You've crushed my favorite hand!

439
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,777
Really? My hand is uninjured.

440
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:50,946
Ugh.

441
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,148
But I'm now convinced
of your commitment.

442
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:54,950
"Oh, goody,"

443
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:58,821
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

444
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:01,156
I'm...

445
00:32:01,322 --> 00:32:06,461
delighted to be
on the same team.

446
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,737
Road trip!

447
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:18,706
I'll let you stick your
nose out the window.

448
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,010
Uh, Sonic, where are we?

449
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:24,378
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

450
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,482
Which is something I hope
to someday say to a woman.

451
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,283
A woman who's not my mom.

452
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,319
Wade, focus.

453
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,052
We need to figure out
why Knuckles thinks

454
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:35,157
I'm the key to finding
the Master Emerald.

455
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,558
And why did he mention Longclaw?

456
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:40,028
There must be a connection.

457
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:42,164
Wait a minute. There is.

458
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:46,400
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.

459
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:49,071
I never knew
what it meant before.

460
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:50,671
Something's happening.

461
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:53,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

462
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:05,286
Longclaw?

463
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,022
Hello, Sonic.

464
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:10,358
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

465
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,628
And I pray you've made it
to Earth unharmed.

466
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:17,933
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

467
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:22,237
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.

468
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,839
Whoa.

469
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:27,843
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

470
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,711
<i>Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow
Man from Ghostbusters.</i>

471
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:31,847
Shh!

472
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,981
In the wrong hands,

473
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:35,383
it could threaten
all life in the universe.

474
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,386
Protecting the Emerald
was my sacred duty.

475
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,490
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

476
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,828
This is my moment.

477
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:49,730
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.

478
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:51,632
My dear Sonic,

479
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:55,270
you have a heart like no
creature I've ever known.

480
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,371
I love you so much.

481
00:33:58,874 --> 00:34:00,075
Goodbye.

482
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:04,046
No, no, wait.

483
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:12,420
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

484
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:17,192
So is that y-your dad?

485
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:18,827
What?

486
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:19,961
No?

487
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,529
According to this map,

488
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,165
the first clue is in Siberia.

489
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:25,666
It's a compass that
will lead to the Emerald.

490
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,871
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.

491
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,471
Knuckles?

492
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:32,373
I knew a kid in middle
school named Knuckles.

493
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:34,309
Could fit his whole fist
in his mouth.

494
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,311
If this is the same Knuckles...

495
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:38,280
...we are screwed.

496
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:41,083
This Knuckles,
that Knuckles. It doesn't matter.

497
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:42,985
We're gonna get there first.

498
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,488
What do you mean, "we"?

499
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:48,991
You're coming with me.

500
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,491
Oh, no, no, no.

501
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,561
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

502
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,396
Don't worry. I got your back.

503
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,765
I won't let anything
happen to you.

504
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:00,101
It's a power bump.

505
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:02,838
On Earth, it means
an unbreakable promise.

506
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:05,773
Okay, I'm in.

507
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,981
<i>♪ Me and you
Maybe sunshine, maybe rain ♪</i>

508
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:23,859
Doctor. It's really you.

509
00:35:24,558 --> 00:35:26,560
You look different.

510
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,664
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

511
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:31,599
Ha!

512
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,169
I knew it. I knew it!

513
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:35,971
I knew you'd come back, sir.

514
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:39,540
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

515
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,081
Could use some mushroom.

516
00:35:47,748 --> 00:35:48,817
You brought something.

517
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:52,787
Some kind of, uh,
space porcupine.

518
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:55,891
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

519
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,592
Trained since birth in
all forms of lethal combat,

520
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,829
destined to restore honor
to my tribe,

521
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:05,033
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

522
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,734
Welcome to the team.

523
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:15,476
That means he trusts you, Stone.

524
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:18,313
Now let's renovate this dump!

525
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:21,615
Latte with steamed
Austrian goat milk!

526
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,071
Good one. Solid.

527
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,213
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

528
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,216
Ha! That's how we do!
That's how we do!

529
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:55,450
But are they good at math?

530
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,651
Teamwork makes the dream work!

531
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:59,587
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

532
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,490
Are you good? All good. Fine.

533
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:04,792
Thanks for inviting me out to
hang with you and your groomsmen.

534
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:06,995
Good quality bonding.

535
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,529
You know, bro,

536
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,842
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

537
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,267
That's my squad.

538
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,281
Never would've made it
through life without 'em.

539
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,470
Get over here!

540
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:17,172
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

541
00:37:17,305 --> 00:37:18,507
I'll catch you later.

542
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,208
Hey. Yeah!

543
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:22,710
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga, huh?

544
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,814
You bet. Come on,
Tommy boy. Let's go.

545
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,116
Don't make me.

546
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,251
What am I doing?

547
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:30,551
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

548
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,220
Hey, girls!

549
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:33,488
How you do... Oh!

550
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,157
Are those the
wedding rings? Uh-huh.

551
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,892
May I?

552
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:39,660
This little ring bearer has been
taking her job very seriously.

553
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,363
She's been practicing
all morning.

554
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:42,596
I can see that.

555
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,966
How very responsible of you.

556
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,402
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

557
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:49,438
Uh-oh.

558
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,604
Uncle Tommy?

559
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:53,607
Hang on. What's going on here?

560
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,012
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

561
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:58,145
Bye.

562
00:37:58,246 --> 00:37:59,747
Hey, baby. Hi.

563
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:04,585
That's right!
Groom in the building!

564
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,221
Look at those guys.

565
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,622
I wish Sonic had that.

566
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,892
Muscles? Control yourself.

567
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:11,827
Mm-hmm.

568
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,397
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

569
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,367
Sonic doesn't have anything
like that. He's flying solo.

570
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,937
Baby, you got to relax.

571
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,172
You're at the Four Seasons.

572
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,175
Have a Mai Tai. Spend
some time with your wife.

573
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:30,512
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

574
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,646
See? He's a
smart kid. All right.

575
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,416
Hmm. He'll find his way.

576
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:38,153
I absolutely cannot find
my way.

577
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:41,722
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

578
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:44,692
Sonic, in this weather,

579
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,529
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

580
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:48,830
Should we go back?

581
00:38:48,964 --> 00:38:50,798
No, no, no.
There's a light up ahead.

582
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:53,135
Maybe we can take shelter
in there.

583
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:59,341
Ah. Perfect.

584
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:02,544
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

585
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:06,014
Don't worry. On Earth,
people are very welcoming,

586
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,518
and love taking complete
strangers into their homes.

587
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,016
Run.

588
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:45,187
Table for two, please!

589
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:50,992
Two beef stews, please.

590
00:39:56,431 --> 00:39:58,233
Where'd you get
all these cool gadgets?

591
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,668
I invented 'em.

592
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,702
That's kinda my thing.

593
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,940
In fact, my inventions
are how I discovered you.

594
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:07,275
<i>Remember that night
at the baseball field?</i>

595
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:11,112
<i>Your energy blast reached
all the way to my home planet.</i>

596
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:15,884
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

597
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:19,321
Wait, so you've been
watching me this whole time?

598
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:20,855
Even in the shower?

599
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,891
That's a trick question.

600
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:25,293
Sonic the Hedgehog
prefers bubble baths.

601
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:26,628
Man, you're good!

602
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,064
When I learned Knuckles
was on your trail,

603
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:32,000
I knew I couldn't just sit
back and watch anymore.

604
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,635
I had to come warn you.

605
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,571
Oh, what? Hang on one sec.

606
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:38,406
Donut Lord is checking in.

607
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:44,346
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

608
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,715
Dot, dot, dot.

609
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,618
Dot, dot, dot.

610
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,453
Dot, dot, dot.

611
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:53,754
Dot, dot, dot.

612
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:57,025
Dot, dot, dot.

613
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:58,827
Doctor,

614
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,364
why are we working
with this imbecile?

615
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:07,969
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

616
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:11,006
Something to help you
get revenge on the hedgehog.

617
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,841
Think bigger, Stone.

618
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:16,144
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

619
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:18,513
My genius wouldn't
just be recognized on Earth.

620
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:21,583
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

621
00:41:21,716 --> 00:41:25,820
allowing me to harness all the
negative forces of the universe

622
00:41:25,954 --> 00:41:28,089
and commune
with Darkness itself.

623
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:30,925
Wow. That sounds big.

624
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:34,329
It's been on my vision board for
years. It's the Law of Attraction.

625
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:37,265
<i>Didn't you see The Secret?</i>

626
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:39,367
Kaplooey!

627
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:40,302
Kaplooey.

628
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:43,705
"Another boring night at home."

629
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,774
The hedgehog has returned home!

630
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:49,010
<i>Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."</i>

631
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:54,849
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

632
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:56,985
all the way

633
00:41:57,118 --> 00:42:01,790
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.

634
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:05,327
He's a long-distance liar!

635
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:09,464
Kuh! Kuh! Kuh!
Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!

636
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,933
Yeah, there's more
where that came from.

637
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:16,571
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

638
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,108
Now let's begin our quest.

639
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:23,912
Wait.

640
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:26,915
What about your Minion?
The goat milker.

641
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,250
There's no room
on the ship for Stone.

642
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:32,320
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

643
00:42:32,454 --> 00:42:33,488
Dishonor!

644
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,492
"Dis" is how I roll.

645
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,166
Ugh!

646
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,570
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I asked for the beef stew.

647
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,977
Uh...

648
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,148
Uh, what's going on?

649
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:03,284
Maybe they think
it's my birthday?

650
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,920
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this.

651
00:43:06,054 --> 00:43:07,756
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

652
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,891
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

653
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:13,461
for whatever my friend said
or did.

654
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:22,070
Uh... meow?

655
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:29,511
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.

656
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:31,579
Take it easy.
Let's talk this through.

657
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:33,381
Let's talk this through!

658
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:37,118
Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.

659
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,686
There's got to be
something in here.

660
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:40,989
Tails,
whatever you're doing, do it fast.

661
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,122
Ooh! I think I got it!

662
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:44,526
<i>Pivonka! Pivonka!</i>

663
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:46,995
<i>Pivonka!</i>

664
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:51,834
<i>Oh? Pivonka?</i>

665
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:55,003
<i>Pivonka.</i>

666
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,790
<i>Da.</i>

667
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:16,926
<i>Pivonka!</i>

668
00:44:18,226 --> 00:44:20,695
<i>Tails, what's a "pivonka"?</i>

669
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,598
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

670
00:44:23,731 --> 00:44:26,601
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...

671
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,276
Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?

672
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:38,379
Oh, no. I left it
on the table! Look!

673
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:47,355
What?

674
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:13,248
Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.

675
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:16,651
Sonic, what do we do?

676
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:19,254
We dance and get that map.

677
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:21,924
Here we go.

678
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:23,725
Ow!

679
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:27,762
Okay, now let's do... No,
we're gonna go...

680
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:35,236
Ah, okay.

681
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,413
Okay, this is not going well.

682
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,950
Channing Tatum
makes it look so easy.

683
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,751
Wait, Sonic. Look!

684
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:54,455
<i>Opa! Opa! Opa!</i>

685
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:56,591
The map! Come on, let's grab it!

686
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:01,596
You want?

687
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:03,832
Come get.

688
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:05,968
Freaks!

689
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,201
Freaks!

690
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:09,771
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

691
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:11,974
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

692
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,142
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

693
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,710
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

694
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:18,379
What's wrong,
Tails? Come on. I need you!

695
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:21,382
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

696
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:24,185
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

697
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,588
and we're gonna get
tossed into a fire!

698
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,592
Ah...

699
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,028
New deejay coming in.

700
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:38,199
Come on, pal. I got an idea.

701
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,667
They called us freaks,

702
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:42,637
so let's get freaky.

703
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,406
Just follow my moves.
You'll be fine.

00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,529
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

734
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:18,232
That was amazing!
Way to go, Tails.

735
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,742
Wow.

736
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,180
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

737
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:32,613
Well, stick with me, pal.

738
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:34,282
Earth can be a scary place,

739
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:36,852
but I know everything
about this old pale blue dot.

740
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:38,653
Do you really mean that?

741
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:42,223
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and...

742
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:45,493
I meant about me being your pal.

743
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:48,529
Of course, buddy.

744
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:53,301
Comin' in hot.

745
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:55,938
Growing up,
I didn't have any friends.

746
00:48:56,071 --> 00:48:59,141
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

747
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,809
Hey, I know that feeling.

748
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:04,913
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

749
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:09,218
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.

750
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,321
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

751
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:16,357
You inspired me
to leave my village,

752
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:19,360
to find you and help you
in your mission.

753
00:49:19,494 --> 00:49:21,662
I'm really glad
you're here, Tails.

754
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:24,332
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

755
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:32,573
Well, might as well
get some sleep.

756
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:35,010
This feels like a good
place to spend the night.

757
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:37,321
You'll be able to get clear
readings on your gizmo thing

758
00:49:37,345 --> 00:49:39,747
once the storm is over,
so I...

759
00:49:51,459 --> 00:49:52,928
Night, Tails.

760
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:09,978
Tails. Tails. We have
a situation.

761
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:16,484
Hoo-hoo!

762
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:19,420
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

763
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:22,224
and a 100% chance of
adventure.

764
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:25,760
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

765
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:29,597
Wow.

766
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,109
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

767
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:44,046
Whoa.

768
00:50:46,614 --> 00:50:50,953
Okay,
we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.

769
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:02,763
Whoa.

770
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,200
Check this out.

771
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:06,667
Can you translate that?

772
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:08,136
Uh, yeah.

773
00:51:09,338 --> 00:51:12,506
<i>Ages ago,
a fearsome group of warriors,</i>

774
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,276
<i>known as the Echidnas,</i>

775
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,377
<i>forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds</i>

776
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,748
<i>into the most unstoppable
weapon ever created.</i>

777
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,386
The Master Emerald.

778
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,755
<i>With it, a single warrior</i>

779
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,458
<i>could defeat entire armies.</i>

780
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,831
<i>Believing no one should
have such power,</i>

781
00:51:35,964 --> 00:51:38,867
<i>an order of heroes
recovered the Emerald</i>

782
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:42,037
<i>and swore to protect it
from evil.</i>

783
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,639
Sounds like
the Owls and the Echidnas

784
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:47,276
have been fighting
each other for centuries.

785
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,610
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

786
00:51:50,379 --> 00:51:52,480
Whoa! Wait for me.

787
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:03,091
Okay, giant owl door,
giant owl. Makes sense.

788
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,626
Whoa.

789
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:17,538
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

790
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:22,844
Here we go.

791
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,955
Well, that did something.

792
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,406
Whoa! The compass!

793
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,607
This will lead us
to the Emerald!

794
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:01,582
Hey, you got
a little something on your...

795
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:04,652
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

796
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:10,959
Run!

797
00:53:17,232 --> 00:53:18,266
That guy again?

798
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,435
Heads up, my little stalagmites.

799
00:53:20,568 --> 00:53:21,970
Someone call an Uber?

800
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:25,539
Hey, thanks for doing
all the hard stuff.

801
00:53:28,877 --> 00:53:30,912
But we'll take it from here.

802
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:33,581
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

803
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:36,251
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.

804
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:39,855
And what kind of genius shows
up to Siberia in a convertible?

805
00:53:39,988 --> 00:53:43,225
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

806
00:53:44,993 --> 00:53:46,962
with a flick of a switch.

807
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:57,472
Oh! Whoo!

808
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,143
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.

809
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:05,881
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

810
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:20,661
Uh-huh. Let's split up.

811
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:22,364
You go high, I go low.

812
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:23,564
Right.

813
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:26,068
Quick little stretch
and here we go.

814
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:39,114
Oh, so you want to play?

815
00:54:44,152 --> 00:54:45,653
That's new.

816
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:48,023
Whoa.

817
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:58,333
Sonic!

818
00:55:11,413 --> 00:55:13,014
Snowball fight!

819
00:55:18,186 --> 00:55:22,424
It's too easy.
Come on, challenge me!

820
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:36,037
<i>♪ There's a summer place ♪</i>

821
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:39,074
We are talking style
and pizzazz.

822
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:41,977
<i>♪ Where it may rain or storm ♪</i>

823
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,979
Pew-pew-pew!
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

824
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,847
<i>♪ Yet I'm safe and warm ♪</i>

825
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:49,351
Yeah! I make this look good.

826
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,055
Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.

827
00:56:00,562 --> 00:56:03,398
For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

828
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:06,902
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

829
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:09,437
I've been training for this
my entire life.

830
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:13,041
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

831
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:15,676
That's gotta be embarrassing.

832
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,984
My rings!

833
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:29,824
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

834
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,993
You mock me
with your weak jokes,

835
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,029
but you know nothing
about me, hedgehog.

836
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:38,500
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

837
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,903
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.

838
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:44,639
I lost everything
because of you.

839
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:48,143
<i>My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.</i>

840
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:51,112
<i>The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.</i>

841
00:56:51,246 --> 00:56:54,983
<i>Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.</i>

842
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:58,220
<i>But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.</i>

843
00:56:58,353 --> 00:57:01,923
<i>He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,</i>

844
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:04,092
<i>but it was not this moment.</i>

845
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:06,861
<i>Those were the last words
he spoke to me.</i>

846
00:57:06,995 --> 00:57:09,497
I never saw him again.

847
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:13,767
We both lost everything
that day.

848
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,439
Goodbye, Sonic. No!

849
00:57:17,572 --> 00:57:19,507
<i>Longclaw!</i>

850
00:57:23,712 --> 00:57:25,547
Sonic! Are you okay?

851
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,382
Deceiver!

852
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:29,918
No, it wasn't a trick.

853
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:33,121
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

854
00:57:36,258 --> 00:57:37,292
Yeah!

855
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,528
Later, haters!

856
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,100
Tails!

857
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,408
Tails, come on. Wake up.

858
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,411
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

859
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,879
Of course he did.

860
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,615
New friend,
same pathetic weakness.

861
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:03,151
Hmm.

862
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:13,395
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

863
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:16,965
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly
us out of here. Time to wake up.

864
00:58:24,272 --> 00:58:27,809
See ya, kids.
Enjoy the fresh powder.

865
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:54,302
Did you...

866
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:02,344
These rings signify the...

867
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,751
Sorry.

868
00:59:09,884 --> 00:59:11,553
Thought it was on silent.

869
00:59:18,026 --> 00:59:20,462
These rings...

870
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:22,997
So help me, Thomas!

871
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:28,937
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

872
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,939
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

873
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:34,175
Sorry.

874
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,616
What? This better
be important. I just...

875
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,184
<i>Are you skiing?</i>

876
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,253
<i>Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.</i>

877
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:47,589
Life or death situation
this very second.

878
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:50,592
I need you to use the ring I gave
you to save me. Like right now.

879
00:59:50,725 --> 00:59:53,061
<i>Okay,
slow down. I don't even know where you are.</i>

880
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:55,497
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

881
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,965
So picture this.

882
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:02,237
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

883
01:00:09,978 --> 01:00:11,613
What?

884
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,083
<i>Did you throw it?</i>

885
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:17,519
<i>Oh, God. What? Tell me what "Oh,
God."</i>

886
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,330
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.

887
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,122
<i>What? Where is it then?</i>

888
01:00:25,326 --> 01:00:26,494
You don't want to know.

889
01:00:26,628 --> 01:00:27,830
<i>But I do, Tom.</i>

890
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,242
<i>I very much want to know,</i>

891
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,800
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

892
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:33,935
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

893
01:00:34,068 --> 01:00:35,838
With this ring, Rachel...

894
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,705
Hey! Hi.

895
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,707
Uh... Everything okay, bud?

896
01:00:39,842 --> 01:00:41,509
Not really. What are you doing?

897
01:00:41,643 --> 01:00:43,945
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I need to see that ring

898
01:00:44,078 --> 01:00:46,281
for just one second.
Have you lost your mind?

899
01:00:46,414 --> 01:00:48,049
I'm gonna give it
right back, I promise.

900
01:00:48,183 --> 01:00:50,853
Please, Randall, it's really important. No,
bro. Go sit down.

901
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:54,088
Give me the ring, please? Randall,
don't look at him, look at me.

902
01:00:54,222 --> 01:00:55,825
One second.
Put the ring on my finger.

903
01:00:55,957 --> 01:00:57,325
No, Randall, listen to me.

904
01:00:57,459 --> 01:00:59,160
Randall! Look at me.
Ring on my finger.

905
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:02,063
Give me the ring! Just
one second. Put a ring on it!

906
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:03,899
Please, love? Okay?

907
01:01:04,032 --> 01:01:05,075
With this ring... Yes, baby.

908
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,836
I'm so sorry about this.

909
01:01:17,045 --> 01:01:19,380
Snow, my God. Oh, boy.

910
01:01:19,981 --> 01:01:21,449
Incoming!

911
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:27,522
Oh.

912
01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:34,429
Anybody hurt?

913
01:01:34,562 --> 01:01:36,531
Sonic! Hawaii.

914
01:01:36,664 --> 01:01:37,765
Are you okay?

915
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,767
What's happening?
Are you hurt?

916
01:01:39,902 --> 01:01:41,603
No, no, I'm fine. Okay, good.

917
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:43,238
Because you're in
so much trouble!

918
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:45,507
Okay, you calm down.

919
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,842
You talk.

920
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:48,476
Okay, quick version.

921
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:50,880
Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

922
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,517
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

923
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,185
Tails!

924
01:01:57,318 --> 01:01:59,320
Wait! All this happened
since yesterday?

925
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:00,722
Wait. Who's Tails?

926
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:01,991
Tails, can you hear me?

927
01:02:02,123 --> 01:02:04,025
Oh, Lord,
there are two of them now.

928
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:06,427
Okay, let me think.
Tails, come on, buddy.

929
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,433
Hey!

930
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:15,036
Randall,
why do all of your friends have weapons?

931
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:20,308
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

932
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:22,143
Olive Garden guy?

933
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:25,046
It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.

934
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:28,082
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

935
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:35,757
You mean to tell me

936
01:02:35,891 --> 01:02:39,028
that this entire wedding was a
setup? Rachel, wait a minute.

937
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,160
What?

938
01:02:40,228 --> 01:02:41,362
That's correct, ma'am.

939
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,131
Every single aspect
of Operation Catfish

940
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:45,099
was a complete fabrication.

941
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:47,268
Operation Catfish?

942
01:02:47,402 --> 01:02:50,138
So is everyone here an agent?

943
01:02:51,205 --> 01:02:52,574
Are you an agent?

944
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:54,609
Son of a...

945
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:58,146
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

946
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,548
The woman who waxed my...

947
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:02,617
at the spa?

948
01:03:04,085 --> 01:03:05,085
Is Jojo an agent?

949
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:06,521
Rachel.

950
01:03:06,654 --> 01:03:07,957
What?

951
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:09,089
Rachel, listen to me.

952
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:10,325
I'm done listening!

953
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,560
I am done listening!

954
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:15,831
I am so sorry. I am
so sorry.

955
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:17,665
I really am. I am so sorry.

956
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:21,569
No. Hey, no!

957
01:03:21,703 --> 01:03:24,339
Let him go! Hey!

958
01:03:27,876 --> 01:03:29,377
Sonic, hang on.

959
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,980
Take it easy. It's not worth it.

960
01:03:31,112 --> 01:03:32,614
Tom! Ah-ah-ah.

961
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:35,350
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.

962
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,352
He's an uncontrolled
extraterrestrial.

963
01:03:37,485 --> 01:03:39,487
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

964
01:03:39,621 --> 01:03:42,323
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

965
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:44,325
You're making a mistake.

966
01:03:44,459 --> 01:03:46,661
Hold on, Major A-hole!

967
01:03:46,794 --> 01:03:48,229
This is still my day,

968
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:52,067
and someone is gonna explain to
me what the hell is going on here!

969
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,520
After the events
in San Francisco,

970
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,403
a global task force was created,

971
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:58,640
devoted to protecting
our planet from alien threats.

972
01:03:58,773 --> 01:04:01,442
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.

973
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:03,979
G-U-N. Seriously? GUN, yeah.

974
01:04:04,113 --> 01:04:07,215
Look, what about protecting
our planet from Dr. Robotnik?

975
01:04:08,249 --> 01:04:09,484
Robotnik is dead.

976
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,619
You're wrong. He's back.

977
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:14,522
And you just hauled away the
only ones who could stop him.

978
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:19,028
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.

979
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,796
If he is,
I want him found immediately.

980
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:25,433
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.

981
01:04:25,566 --> 01:04:27,201
Aunt Maddie? Yeah.

982
01:04:27,335 --> 01:04:29,303
Sonic and his friend
dropped this.

983
01:04:35,944 --> 01:04:37,211
I have an idea.

984
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:39,414
And I want to have
a word with my fiancé.

985
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:41,482
And that word is "murder."

986
01:04:45,787 --> 01:04:48,589
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

987
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:52,260
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor,
a vet, anyone!

988
01:04:53,294 --> 01:04:54,796
Tails,
you got to wake up, buddy.

989
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,564
Please wake up.

990
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:05,808
All clear.

991
01:05:09,277 --> 01:05:10,979
All right. Game plan.

992
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:13,753
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

993
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:15,483
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?

994
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:16,952
And then I squeeze the breath

995
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:21,222
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

996
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:25,326
I'm going through
a lot right now.

997
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,129
So let me process this
my own way, okay?

998
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,529
Sure, sure.

999
01:05:28,663 --> 01:05:30,866
No judgment. Should've
brought a journal.

1000
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:32,433
Okay...

1001
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:35,938
Okay. Is this meant to be a
weapon? This is adorable.

1002
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:38,107
Pew, pew! Take that, Randall!

1003
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,209
Run, Randall!

1004
01:05:40,341 --> 01:05:41,609
All right.

1005
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,611
We're about to
find out. All right!

1006
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:46,347
Let's go kick some Booty.

1007
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:49,952
Shh! Shh!

1008
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:00,795
Rachel! No. Rachel!

1009
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:03,297
In a minute.

1010
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,733
Mm-mmm! Mm.

1011
01:06:08,837 --> 01:06:10,239
Stop right there!

1012
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:11,773
Get the bag.

1013
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:21,282
He's gonna
come back down, right?

1014
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,918
I don't know.

1015
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:24,285
Good luck!

1016
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:28,389
Look. Tom and Sonic
have to be inside.

1017
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:30,993
I got a fiancé to
vaporize. Uh-huh.

1018
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:32,493
Watch your back, sis. Okay.

1019
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:36,664
Randall!

1020
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:44,672
We got her.

1021
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,407
Move in.

1022
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:51,046
Okay.

1023
01:07:07,262 --> 01:07:09,430
I did not mean to do that!

1024
01:07:11,332 --> 01:07:13,401
Whoo!

1025
01:07:21,776 --> 01:07:23,711
Something bothering you, Agent?

1026
01:07:23,846 --> 01:07:26,315
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

1027
01:07:26,447 --> 01:07:30,018
Ah, don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

1028
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:32,486
Now, I propose a toast.

1029
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:38,193
To a perfectly
executed operation.

1030
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:44,465
Sir, we're under attack.

1031
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:09,457
Randall, wifey's home!

1032
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:14,930
Oh, my God. Rachel.

1033
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:19,101
<i>♪ You lying so low
In the weeds ♪</i>

1034
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:23,205
<i>♪ I bet you gonna ambush me ♪</i>

1035
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:28,911
<i>♪ You'd have me down, down
Down, down on my knees ♪</i>

1036
01:08:29,044 --> 01:08:31,712
<i>♪ Now wouldn't you, barracuda? ♪</i>

1037
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:35,984
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

1038
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:42,556
What a woman.

1039
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,861
You no-good,

1040
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,764
lowdown, dirty, lying...

1041
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:51,199
Rachel, just listen to me.

1042
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,767
What kind of twisted sicko

1043
01:08:52,901 --> 01:08:55,469
tricks someone
into a fake wedding?

1044
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:00,809
Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.

1045
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:03,544
You son of a...

1046
01:09:03,678 --> 01:09:05,746
Have it your way. No!

1047
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:07,816
No!

1048
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:12,387
Oh. Ugh. Oh!

1049
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,023
Very disappointing,
Agent Handel.

1050
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:19,094
Ha! Is that supposed
to be a weapon?

1051
01:09:19,227 --> 01:09:20,996
I don't know,
but we gonna find out.

1052
01:09:21,129 --> 01:09:23,597
Haven't you caused
enough trouble for one day?

1053
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:26,567
I haven't even begun
causing trouble.

1054
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:30,038
Hell hath no fury like
a bride scorned.

1055
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:40,481
Looks like it's real, huh?

1056
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,185
Whoa! Uh! Ah! Huh?

1057
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:44,820
No. Right.

1058
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,924
Be honest. How bad is it?

1059
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:52,593
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

1060
01:09:56,465 --> 01:09:57,466
I'm so cold.

1061
01:09:57,598 --> 01:10:00,302
You landed on our ice sculpture.

1062
01:10:00,435 --> 01:10:01,736
Get up.

1063
01:10:07,575 --> 01:10:08,944
Just...

1064
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:11,913
Just tell me the truth,
for once.

1065
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:17,685
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

1066
01:10:18,286 --> 01:10:21,490
Rachel, look at me.

1067
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,557
Before I met you,

1068
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:26,761
I didn't think that I was even
capable of real happiness.

1069
01:10:28,063 --> 01:10:30,531
But that all changed when
you walked into my life.

1070
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:34,302
And I ended up breaking the
first rule of undercover work.

1071
01:10:34,436 --> 01:10:36,371
Which is?

1072
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:38,773
Never fall in love.

1073
01:10:51,153 --> 01:10:52,988
Maddie! Maddie!

1074
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:55,589
We're busting out of here.
How'd you get past the guards?

1075
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,634
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

1076
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:00,062
Come on.

1077
01:11:00,195 --> 01:11:02,130
Let's go. You're amazing.

1078
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:15,609
The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

1079
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:25,187
Ah.

1080
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:55,117
What's happening?

1081
01:11:56,585 --> 01:11:58,353
Wait for it.

1082
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:12,200
Yes. Eureka!

1083
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:15,137
I've found it!

1084
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:35,824
Sonic.

1085
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:40,095
What is that? A big problem.

1086
01:12:40,228 --> 01:12:42,063
The compass led Robotnik
to the Emerald.

1087
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:44,432
That's got to be
hundreds of miles away.

1088
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,068
All right.

1089
01:12:47,202 --> 01:12:49,237
Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

1090
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:50,371
Together.

1091
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:51,806
There's no time for that.

1092
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,584
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

1093
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:56,144
Sonic, this is way too big
for you to do by yourself.

1094
01:12:56,278 --> 01:12:58,213
You see that little fox
over there?

1095
01:12:58,346 --> 01:13:01,883
He came all the way across
the universe to meet his hero.

1096
01:13:02,017 --> 01:13:05,187
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

1097
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:08,123
You know what? You were right.

1098
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:10,559
My moment came and I blew it.

1099
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:11,860
I'm no hero.

1100
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:13,161
Wait. No.

1101
01:13:13,295 --> 01:13:14,695
I'm not letting
anyone else get hurt

1102
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:15,931
because of me.

1103
01:13:16,064 --> 01:13:17,866
I'm gonna fix this
while I still can.

1104
01:13:19,034 --> 01:13:20,669
Sonic!

1105
01:13:20,802 --> 01:13:23,205
Sonic, wait!

1106
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:27,775
Hold on. Wait. Don't move.

1107
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:29,578
Take it easy, little guy.
You're hurt.

1108
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:33,415
But we have to help him. You
don't know what he's up against.

1109
01:13:40,555 --> 01:13:42,090
You believe us now?

1110
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:45,493
Mm-hmm.

1111
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:49,998
Hey, Bob!

1112
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,033
Hey, Maria, how you doing? Hey!

1113
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,301
Ah.

1114
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:56,538
Working on my moves.

1115
01:13:56,671 --> 01:13:59,074
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

1116
01:13:59,207 --> 01:14:01,376
Speaking of fuel...

1117
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:09,484
Closed?

1118
01:14:09,618 --> 01:14:11,119
That doesn't seem right.

1119
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:25,000
Close.

1120
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:30,572
Yes.

1121
01:14:30,705 --> 01:14:33,275
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.

1122
01:14:33,408 --> 01:14:34,909
Freeze! Police!

1123
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:37,979
Oh, my God, you got robot hands.

1124
01:14:38,113 --> 01:14:39,247
No, they're gloves.

1125
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:41,850
Get 'em up.
Now spread your fingers!

1126
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,786
Now wiggle 'em!
Wiggle your digits!

1127
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:49,924
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

1128
01:14:51,559 --> 01:14:52,961
Good.

1129
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:54,829
Why is there
a light on your head?

1130
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,802
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

1131
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,578
Ugh. Water.

1132
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,847
Why did it have to be water?

1133
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,453
Okay, you can do this.

1134
01:15:21,923 --> 01:15:23,825
Gotta go fast.

1135
01:16:53,415 --> 01:16:54,916
Oh!

1136
01:17:05,895 --> 01:17:09,597
I don't want to die
like this! It's derivative!

1137
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:12,967
Make room for Daddy!

1138
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,477
Two and two. Great!

1139
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:25,680
We're still bipedals,
more or less.

1140
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,218
Fire in the hole!

1141
01:17:31,953 --> 01:17:35,557
I've solved it. There is a
booby trap every seven seco...

1142
01:17:42,063 --> 01:17:44,032
That was a little early. Mmm.

1143
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:48,369
Oh! So glad it didn't
cut off my mustache.

1144
01:17:48,503 --> 01:17:51,573
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

1145
01:17:51,706 --> 01:17:53,909
I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,

1146
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:58,480
but can we be a little bit more
mindful of our surroundings?

1147
01:17:58,613 --> 01:17:59,613
May I?

1148
01:18:06,154 --> 01:18:08,756
<i>In 30 feet, turn left.</i>

1149
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:11,025
Work smarter, not harder.

1150
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:33,681
My pelvis.

1151
01:18:37,752 --> 01:18:42,290
Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.

1152
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:50,164
Whoa!

1153
01:18:50,298 --> 01:18:52,133
No, no, no! No!

1154
01:18:56,671 --> 01:18:57,705
No.

1155
01:18:58,807 --> 01:19:00,775
Yes!

1156
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,558
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

1157
01:19:07,582 --> 01:19:10,585
Wow. That really
opened up the space.

1158
01:19:10,718 --> 01:19:13,555
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

1159
01:19:13,688 --> 01:19:16,057
And the rubble
is always a nice touch.

1160
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,703
At last. The Master Emerald.

1161
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:29,972
Ultimate power.

1162
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:32,707
Soon order will be restored.

1163
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:36,244
All because of what
we have done together.

1164
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:39,080
Such a lovely sentiment,
Knuckles.

1165
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:42,116
I think I feel
a single tear forming.

1166
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:45,988
Sadly...

1167
01:19:47,288 --> 01:19:48,408
You're as useful to me now

1168
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:52,327
as a backstage pass
to Limp Bizkit.

1169
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,863
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1170
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:07,541
Nailed it.

1171
01:20:08,811 --> 01:20:12,881
This guy is always trying
to spoil a bad thing!

1172
01:20:13,015 --> 01:20:14,649
Ah! You guys are here, too?

1173
01:20:14,782 --> 01:20:16,018
Took the long way, huh?

1174
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,219
Is everything a joke to you?

1175
01:20:18,353 --> 01:20:21,056
Why must you constantly
interfere with my destiny?

1176
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:25,060
Because my destiny is to
protect my friends and family.

1177
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:27,062
I think I just threw up
in my mouth.

1178
01:20:27,228 --> 01:20:33,568
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

1179
01:20:38,974 --> 01:20:40,441
Whoa!

1180
01:20:55,556 --> 01:20:58,526
The Echidna's
taking no prisoners today!

1181
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:02,697
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

1182
01:21:04,133 --> 01:21:08,302
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

1183
01:21:13,474 --> 01:21:17,679
Too easy. Let's do this.

1184
01:21:23,152 --> 01:21:24,585
Huh?

1185
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:49,044
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

1186
01:21:49,178 --> 01:21:50,311
Let me think about it.

1187
01:21:50,445 --> 01:21:54,116
Okay, I thought about it
and I pass.

1188
01:22:03,558 --> 01:22:05,326
Hi there, beautiful.

1189
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,897
You're the real deal,
aren't you?

1190
01:22:16,337 --> 01:22:18,807
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

1191
01:22:22,077 --> 01:22:25,147
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

1192
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:27,782
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

1193
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,350
Just look.

1194
01:22:31,753 --> 01:22:33,254
Mine.

1195
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:36,925
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

1196
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:42,931
Oh, you poor, naive creature.

1197
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:44,799
It's not your fault.

1198
01:22:44,933 --> 01:22:48,170
A more advanced intellect would
have seen this move coming a mile away.

1199
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:50,438
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1200
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:53,307
But I trusted you!
You were my friend!

1201
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:03,618
I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

1202
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,287
Let this be
my final lesson to you,

1203
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,024
you dim-witted
celestial skin tag.

1204
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:11,026
Friends...

1205
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,097
are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1206
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:17,765
Which means X squared times
the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1207
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:21,236
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

1208
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:22,369
dookie!

1209
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,906
Oh, no.

1210
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:36,852
Chaos is power!

1211
01:23:55,237 --> 01:23:56,972
Let's get out of here!

1212
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:10,853
Knuckles!

1213
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,126
Water again? Come on!

1214
01:24:37,913 --> 01:24:40,048
Mmm?

1215
01:24:40,182 --> 01:24:42,017
Mmm?

1216
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,886
Mmm. Mmm.

1217
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,088
Mmm?

1218
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:17,920
You saved me.

1219
01:25:18,053 --> 01:25:20,822
Don't talk to me.
I'm not in the mood.

1220
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:25,793
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1221
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:28,729
Why did you save me?

1222
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:32,134
Because you saved me first,

1223
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:35,938
which clearly gave you a tactical
advantage I do not understand.

1224
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:39,908
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1225
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:41,910
Why?

1226
01:25:42,044 --> 01:25:45,314
I've been trying to destroy
you since the moment we met.

1227
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:49,318
Because being a hero isn't
about taking care of yourself.

1228
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:53,221
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1229
01:25:54,256 --> 01:25:58,559
Hmm. Wise words.
An ancient Earth proverb?

1230
01:25:58,693 --> 01:26:00,963
No, sir, that's
a Wachowski family special.

1231
01:26:01,096 --> 01:26:03,764
I got it from a guy
in a rowboat.

1232
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:05,434
Someone who means a lot to me.

1233
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:09,137
Wait a second.
What's that sound?

1234
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,575
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1235
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,913
That sly little fox!

1236
01:26:20,115 --> 01:26:23,118
Come on, Knucklehead.
We're not beat yet.

1237
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:25,988
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1238
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:27,889
The way I did.

1239
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:30,993
But you seem
so hopeful and free.

1240
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:35,430
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1241
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:39,134
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1242
01:26:39,267 --> 01:26:42,904
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1243
01:26:43,038 --> 01:26:45,639
I found a new family.
New friends.

1244
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:47,541
And you can too.

1245
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:52,114
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1246
01:26:54,983 --> 01:26:56,985
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1247
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,022
Are you kidding me
with that handshake?

1248
01:27:01,789 --> 01:27:03,992
I'm done
playing games, pal.

1249
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,895
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know.

1250
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:12,733
And I am asking you
for the last time...

1251
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:17,072
what would you like
on your bagel?

1252
01:27:17,205 --> 01:27:19,274
I'm not telling you anything.

1253
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:22,077
And that is a display bagel.

1254
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:25,514
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1255
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:27,015
I was good cop. I was bad cop.

1256
01:27:27,149 --> 01:27:29,284
I was cop
who offers you a bagel.

1257
01:27:29,418 --> 01:27:30,485
And nothing. It's like...

1258
01:27:30,618 --> 01:27:32,620
That is a display bagel. Wow.

1259
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:43,932
Doctor, you're here.

1260
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,671
Yes,
I'm here, and yet I'm...

1261
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:53,542
not all there.

1262
01:27:53,674 --> 01:27:55,210
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1263
01:27:55,343 --> 01:28:00,015
I'm more than okay.

1264
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:03,185
I'm upgraded.

1265
01:28:03,318 --> 01:28:06,288
Sinister 3.0.

1266
01:28:06,421 --> 01:28:10,225
My game is next level.

1267
01:28:15,497 --> 01:28:16,865
Hi.

1268
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:25,574
I can smell the electricity
in your brain.

1269
01:28:27,509 --> 01:28:29,978
You smell like a snack plate.

1270
01:28:31,079 --> 01:28:34,682
Yeah, no, that's fair.
I had a couple today.

1271
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,617
Sit down.

1272
01:28:41,123 --> 01:28:42,690
In the chair.

1273
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:47,496
I didn't know.

1274
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:50,832
'Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't... Okay.

1275
01:28:50,966 --> 01:28:53,135
Sir? We have a problem.

1276
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,742
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

1277
01:29:01,877 --> 01:29:03,744
Move! Move! Move!

1278
01:29:18,627 --> 01:29:22,364
<i>Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.</i>

1279
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:26,201
After all these years,

1280
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,702
what I finally got...

1281
01:29:29,604 --> 01:29:31,873
is a solution.

1282
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,784
Commander. Status report.

1283
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:47,422
Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

1284
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:50,926
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,

1285
01:29:51,059 --> 01:29:53,428
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1286
01:29:53,562 --> 01:29:55,030
Wade.

1287
01:30:06,408 --> 01:30:08,109
Um...

1288
01:30:09,311 --> 01:30:10,879
Okay.

1289
01:30:11,012 --> 01:30:13,648
Rockin' that new
spring collection, I see.

1290
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:18,353
Well, if it isn't
the Pastry King.

1291
01:30:18,486 --> 01:30:19,854
The Donut Lord.

1292
01:30:19,988 --> 01:30:21,866
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1293
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,558
who helped kick your butt
off this planet.

1294
01:30:23,692 --> 01:30:25,652
And I'll do it again
if you mess with Green Hills.

1295
01:30:25,726 --> 01:30:30,498
Congratulations on your
oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.

1296
01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:33,034
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1297
01:30:33,168 --> 01:30:35,670
Your lab, your drones,
your funding!

1298
01:30:35,804 --> 01:30:39,374
Let's see how big of a man you
are without your silly little robots.

1299
01:30:40,942 --> 01:30:43,111
Would you like to see how...

1300
01:30:44,446 --> 01:30:46,780
big a man I can be?

1301
01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:00,829
Welcome to the new norm.

1302
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,374
My God!

1303
01:31:15,744 --> 01:31:19,547
Doctor! Take me with you!

1304
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:46,608
He's taking everything apart.

1305
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:48,310
He's building something.

1306
01:31:56,084 --> 01:31:58,320
That can only be one thing.

1307
01:31:58,453 --> 01:32:00,889
The fearsome power
of the Emerald.

1308
01:32:01,022 --> 01:32:03,325
If that thing really
turns thoughts into power,

1309
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:05,060
we are in big trouble.

1310
01:32:05,193 --> 01:32:07,062
Robotnik has a lot
of bad thoughts.

1311
01:32:07,195 --> 01:32:10,098
Hey, Sonic, are you sure
it was a good idea

1312
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:11,900
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1313
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:15,637
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1314
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,272
I am not mixed up!

1315
01:32:17,405 --> 01:32:20,709
I have steely focus.
And I'm complex.

1316
01:32:20,842 --> 01:32:22,444
And that's a lot
for some people.

1317
01:32:22,577 --> 01:32:25,815
Hope you're not
still mad I hit you with that car.

1318
01:32:25,947 --> 01:32:28,216
Pfft!
I was completely uninjured.

1319
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:32,020
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1320
01:32:58,246 --> 01:32:59,481
Whoa.

1321
01:33:03,051 --> 01:33:05,653
Sir, you're magnificent!

1322
01:33:05,787 --> 01:33:07,756
Thank you, sycophant.

1323
01:33:07,889 --> 01:33:10,458
Your admiration is inevitable.

1324
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:21,770
I knew it!

1325
01:33:21,903 --> 01:33:24,539
Just like the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

1326
01:33:25,373 --> 01:33:27,542
World Domination playlist.

1327
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:42,257
Fall back.

1328
01:33:43,358 --> 01:33:46,461
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1329
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:50,432
How are we supposed
to beat this thing?

1330
01:33:50,565 --> 01:33:51,366
We need a plan.

1331
01:33:51,499 --> 01:33:54,035
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1332
01:33:54,169 --> 01:33:56,371
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1333
01:33:56,504 --> 01:34:00,575
Okay, this is what we're
GONNA DO. STEP 1: Light taunting.

1334
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,544
I have no idea.

1335
01:34:05,613 --> 01:34:06,981
Sonic!

1336
01:34:09,885 --> 01:34:11,586
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1337
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:15,089
Does it do anything or just
stand there looking ugly?

1338
01:34:18,393 --> 01:34:21,796
Like a blister,
he keeps coming back!

1339
01:34:21,931 --> 01:34:24,834
He's on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot
the missiles. Make a decision.

1340
01:34:24,966 --> 01:34:27,937
I need a moment, sir. I'm
trying to figure out how to do this.

1341
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:30,071
Did you even glance at a manual?

1342
01:34:30,205 --> 01:34:32,474
No! I'll do it.

1343
01:34:32,607 --> 01:34:33,675
Pardon my lightning.

1344
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:36,144
You might want to
ground yourself.

1345
01:34:37,612 --> 01:34:39,047
Uh-oh.

1346
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:42,952
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

1347
01:34:43,084 --> 01:34:44,084
Whoa!

1348
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:45,987
Hang on!

1349
01:34:47,722 --> 01:34:49,591
Whoa!

1350
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:54,395
Whoa!

1351
01:34:57,065 --> 01:34:58,299
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1352
01:34:58,433 --> 01:35:01,035
Oh,
yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Close one.

1353
01:35:01,169 --> 01:35:03,338
Sonic!

1354
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,610
Robotnik!

1355
01:35:10,078 --> 01:35:11,613
Deceiver!

1356
01:35:11,746 --> 01:35:13,581
Die, mosquito.

1357
01:35:25,026 --> 01:35:27,128
Ooh! I felt that.

1358
01:35:39,607 --> 01:35:42,277
Oh! Whoa!

1359
01:35:46,047 --> 01:35:47,415
What just happened?

1360
01:35:47,549 --> 01:35:51,119
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.

1361
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,623
Return to sender.

1362
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:04,299
Stone?

1363
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,036
Oh, great.

1364
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:10,305
Next thing you know, there'll be a
report about a hostile work environment.

1365
01:36:12,942 --> 01:36:16,011
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1366
01:36:16,144 --> 01:36:18,746
We can't beat Robotnik as
long as he's got that Emerald.

1367
01:36:18,881 --> 01:36:20,381
He's too powerful.

1368
01:36:20,515 --> 01:36:23,284
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1369
01:36:23,418 --> 01:36:24,552
But there's three of us.

1370
01:36:24,686 --> 01:36:27,957
Your strength, your smarts
and my speed.

1371
01:36:28,089 --> 01:36:29,557
Together. That's how we win.

1372
01:36:29,691 --> 01:36:34,395
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1373
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:35,763
As a team.

1374
01:36:35,898 --> 01:36:37,532
This is it.

1375
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,569
This is our moment.

1376
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:45,206
Time to fight.

1377
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:56,150
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1378
01:36:56,919 --> 01:36:58,519
Tails, any ideas?

1379
01:36:58,653 --> 01:37:00,321
We have to find his weak spot.

1380
01:37:00,455 --> 01:37:02,091
I suggest the groin.

1381
01:37:02,223 --> 01:37:04,225
What? No. No!

1382
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:06,962
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1383
01:37:07,096 --> 01:37:09,064
Stop saying "groin."

1384
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:10,966
Hedgehog!

1385
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,600
Look out!

1386
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:17,739
I know what his
weak spot is. It's me.

1387
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,707
I'm the groin!

1388
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,344
Think about it. Whoa!

1389
01:37:23,478 --> 01:37:25,080
I live rent-free
in this dude's head.

1390
01:37:25,213 --> 01:37:26,815
So if I go out there
and rile him up...

1391
01:37:26,949 --> 01:37:29,417
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1392
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,686
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1393
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:34,555
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1394
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:37,358
Go to your certain death
with honor.

1395
01:37:37,492 --> 01:37:39,560
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1396
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:42,263
Yeah. Let's go.

1397
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,235
All right, mustache.

1398
01:37:47,368 --> 01:37:50,171
You want me? Come and get me.

1399
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:52,841
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1400
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:55,610
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1401
01:37:55,743 --> 01:37:57,412
Coming, getting.

1402
01:37:57,545 --> 01:38:01,917
Coming, getting. Coming,
getting. Coming, getting.

1403
01:38:04,352 --> 01:38:06,155
Oh, you're really heavy.

1404
01:38:06,287 --> 01:38:10,591
That's because I am one million
percent muscle. Faster, fox!

1405
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:15,797
Go! Move, guys! Move back! Let's go,
that's it! Go, go, go!

1406
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:16,931
Keep going! Go! Go!

1407
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:18,834
No, no! Stop! Stop the truck!

1408
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:20,468
Tom, what happened here?

1409
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:23,138
You thinking what I'm
thinking? Let's get our kid.

1410
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:24,807
We need your truck!

1411
01:38:30,745 --> 01:38:33,982
Coming,
getting. Whew!

1412
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:35,717
Yoo-hoo!

1413
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:37,552
So what's the
plan here?

1414
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:38,519
Huh?

1415
01:38:38,653 --> 01:38:40,388
You gonna build
a big robot house?

1416
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:42,825
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1417
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:47,361
I'm going to enslave humanity and
force them to service my machines.

1418
01:38:47,495 --> 01:38:50,298
First, Green Hills.
Then the universe.

1419
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:51,666
Then the multiverse.

1420
01:38:51,799 --> 01:38:54,669
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.

1421
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:56,671
Full disclosure?

1422
01:38:57,338 --> 01:39:00,241
You won't be there.

1423
01:39:04,445 --> 01:39:06,781
Eye lasers? Really?

1424
01:39:19,128 --> 01:39:21,329
Snot rocket!

1425
01:39:22,764 --> 01:39:23,832
No, no, no!

1426
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:33,341
Giving up already?

1427
01:39:33,474 --> 01:39:37,678
Not so tough when you're fighting
someone 700 times your size, are ya?

1428
01:39:39,547 --> 01:39:42,050
You can't beat me!

1429
01:39:42,184 --> 01:39:45,586
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

1430
01:39:48,123 --> 01:39:50,525
All-seeing.

1431
01:39:51,392 --> 01:39:53,594
Looks like your fancy robot
has a glitch.

1432
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,940
Is it me?
What about me? I'm over here.

1433
01:39:55,964 --> 01:39:57,799
Up top! Down below!
Behind you!

1434
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:00,013
I'm
over here. Sorry! Over here.

1435
01:40:00,135 --> 01:40:01,669
Too slow! Try again.

1436
01:40:01,804 --> 01:40:03,972
You can't outsmart me.
Missed me again.

1437
01:40:04,106 --> 01:40:05,107
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1438
01:40:10,012 --> 01:40:13,115
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1439
01:40:13,248 --> 01:40:15,050
Robotnik!

1440
01:40:15,184 --> 01:40:17,920
I am also a hologram.

1441
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:19,922
Disloyal.

1442
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,958
"Dis" is how I roll.

1443
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:52,921
Where's my Emerald?

1444
01:40:53,521 --> 01:40:55,324
No, no, no, no!

1445
01:40:55,456 --> 01:40:57,960
Computer, auxiliary power.

1446
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:06,869
Oh.

1447
01:41:07,002 --> 01:41:09,905
The Emerald. It's right there.

1448
01:41:10,038 --> 01:41:12,007
Move, you hunk of junk!

1449
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:19,948
I have to... reach it.

1450
01:41:43,105 --> 01:41:44,139
Come on.

1451
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:48,609
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1452
01:41:57,319 --> 01:41:58,319
No!

1453
01:41:58,419 --> 01:41:59,888
We got you, Sonic.

1454
01:42:01,023 --> 01:42:02,590
Hold on!

1455
01:42:15,536 --> 01:42:17,973
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1456
01:42:19,341 --> 01:42:21,076
Okay.

1457
01:42:25,814 --> 01:42:27,782
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1458
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:31,186
Come on, come on. How does
this thing work? What do I do?

1459
01:42:32,421 --> 01:42:34,156
What?

1460
01:42:34,289 --> 01:42:37,092
No. No, no, no!

1461
01:42:40,761 --> 01:42:45,133
Look at the happy little family.

1462
01:42:50,806 --> 01:42:53,342
You have to get away from
me. I'm the one he wants.

1463
01:42:53,474 --> 01:42:54,742
Hey.

1464
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:56,510
We're not going anywhere.

1465
01:42:56,644 --> 01:42:58,612
We're family.

1466
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:03,819
And families stick together...

1467
01:43:06,487 --> 01:43:07,889
no matter what.

1468
01:43:10,758 --> 01:43:12,094
I love you guys.

1469
01:43:12,793 --> 01:43:14,363
We love you too, Sonic.

1470
01:43:23,038 --> 01:43:24,638
No!

1471
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:28,509
I got him!

1472
01:43:28,642 --> 01:43:34,449
I finally got him!

1473
01:43:37,685 --> 01:43:39,720
What was that?

1474
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,302
It's over, Eggman.

1475
01:44:27,436 --> 01:44:31,973
I like the
new look. It works for you.

1476
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:35,043
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1477
01:44:35,177 --> 01:44:37,012
I did some things,
you did some things.

1478
01:44:37,145 --> 01:44:39,214
There are good people
on both sides.

1479
01:44:40,748 --> 01:44:44,052
Surely two intelligent beings

1480
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:47,856
can work these things out!

1481
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:00,633
Come on, buddy.

1482
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:02,137
Get him, Sonic! Come on.

1483
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,771
Yeah. Come on.

1484
01:45:19,988 --> 01:45:21,789
It's like that?

1485
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,626
Okay, we're not friends.

1486
01:45:29,763 --> 01:45:32,200
Later, hater!

1487
01:45:43,478 --> 01:45:45,380
Sonic! Buddy!

1488
01:45:45,514 --> 01:45:47,282
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1489
01:45:47,415 --> 01:45:50,085
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1490
01:45:50,218 --> 01:45:54,823
I am sorry. He is no longer
the Sonic you once knew.

1491
01:45:55,257 --> 01:45:56,291
What?

1492
01:46:14,675 --> 01:46:15,810
Mmm.

1493
01:46:15,944 --> 01:46:17,946
Oh, you got to try this.

1494
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:27,022
Okay. He is exactly
the Sonic you once knew.

1495
01:46:28,689 --> 01:46:30,225
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1496
01:46:38,567 --> 01:46:40,302
Sonic! Whoa!

1497
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:43,771
Bring it in, bud.

1498
01:46:44,906 --> 01:46:46,608
It's good to be back in blue.

1499
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,345
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1500
01:46:50,478 --> 01:46:51,580
Looks good on you.

1501
01:46:51,712 --> 01:46:54,149
Sonic, you were
the most powerful hero

1502
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:57,085
in the universe,
and you let it go.

1503
01:46:57,219 --> 01:46:58,320
Why?

1504
01:46:59,888 --> 01:47:03,225
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1505
01:47:05,193 --> 01:47:07,562
And I kind of like being a kid.

1506
01:47:07,696 --> 01:47:09,531
And you're not just any kid.

1507
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:11,499
You're our kid.

1508
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:12,901
That's right.

1509
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,537
Bring it in! Yay. Hugs.

1510
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:18,974
It's a good thing we didn't do
this before. You would've blown up.

1511
01:47:26,248 --> 01:47:27,849
Whoa! You fixed it.

1512
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:31,386
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1513
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:32,687
Now I have it.

1514
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:34,589
Now we have it.

1515
01:47:34,723 --> 01:47:37,125
What do we do with it?
What next?

1516
01:47:37,259 --> 01:47:39,294
There were once
two orders of heroes

1517
01:47:39,427 --> 01:47:43,465
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1518
01:47:43,598 --> 01:47:47,636
But they have all passed on to
the great battleground in the sky.

1519
01:47:47,768 --> 01:47:51,273
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

1520
01:47:51,406 --> 01:47:52,773
This is no light task.

1521
01:47:52,907 --> 01:47:57,946
We must make a vow to use our
powers to keep the universe safe,

1522
01:47:58,613 --> 01:48:00,415
to watch out for each other.

1523
01:48:00,548 --> 01:48:02,250
Our new tribe.

1524
01:48:02,384 --> 01:48:03,418
Oh, I know!

1525
01:48:03,551 --> 01:48:04,785
A power bump!

1526
01:48:04,919 --> 01:48:06,588
Good idea.

1527
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:10,225
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1528
01:48:10,358 --> 01:48:12,227
Very well.

1529
01:48:12,827 --> 01:48:15,397
A power bump it is.

1530
01:48:16,498 --> 01:48:18,266
Power bump!

1531
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,705
It's truly a beautiful day

1532
01:48:23,838 --> 01:48:26,007
for baseball here
in Green Hills.

1533
01:48:26,141 --> 01:48:27,842
An exciting lineup today

1534
01:48:27,976 --> 01:48:31,146
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1535
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:35,550
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1536
01:48:35,684 --> 01:48:38,053
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1537
01:48:38,186 --> 01:48:43,425
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1538
01:48:43,558 --> 01:48:46,161
Um, I don't understand.

1539
01:48:46,294 --> 01:48:48,563
Why am I angry
at the enemy ball?

1540
01:48:48,697 --> 01:48:49,864
You're not angry.

1541
01:48:49,998 --> 01:48:51,700
You just want to hit it
as hard as you can

1542
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:53,034
and then run around the bases.

1543
01:48:53,168 --> 01:48:56,371
But if my quest ends
where I am standing,

1544
01:48:56,504 --> 01:48:57,906
why run at all?

1545
01:48:58,039 --> 01:49:00,975
Ugh. I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1546
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:03,778
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1547
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:05,447
Just having some fun.

1548
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,949
Fun. Huh.

1549
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,318
All right!
Give him the heat, Tails!

1550
01:49:10,452 --> 01:49:12,320
Hope you're ready
for my fastball.

1551
01:49:12,454 --> 01:49:14,956
Your fastball
will be dishonored.

1552
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,425
And so will you, fox.

1553
01:49:17,559 --> 01:49:18,593
Easy, guys!

1554
01:49:18,727 --> 01:49:19,961
Don't think about it too much.

1555
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:21,996
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball

1556
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,398
and give it a ride.

1557
01:49:23,531 --> 01:49:25,100
A ride? To where?

1558
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:30,538
Power bump!

1559
01:49:34,876 --> 01:49:37,045
Ha! Victory is mine!

1560
01:49:37,178 --> 01:49:39,748
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

1561
01:49:39,881 --> 01:49:42,016
First base is also mine!

1562
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:43,853
I think that was our
only ball.

1563
01:49:43,985 --> 01:49:46,755
I have conquered
the second of the bases!

1564
01:49:46,888 --> 01:49:48,256
Who wants ice cream?

1565
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:49,691
Knocked the cover off that.

1566
01:49:49,825 --> 01:49:52,127
Ice cream! Ice cream, yeah!

1567
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:56,264
I am having
the fun! What is ice cream?

1568
01:49:56,398 --> 01:49:59,601
It's a dessert. If you like fun,
you're gonna love it.

1569
01:49:59,734 --> 01:50:03,004
Oh, yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1570
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:04,739
No, not usually.

1571
01:50:04,874 --> 01:50:07,175
I'm proud of our little guy.

1572
01:50:07,308 --> 01:50:10,813
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1573
01:50:10,945 --> 01:50:13,581
He cracks me up.
Heck of a swing too.

1574
01:50:13,715 --> 01:50:14,850
Come on, fox.

1575
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:16,618
Our dessert adventure
awaits. Whoo!

1576
01:50:16,751 --> 01:50:17,786
Good job, guys. Yeah.

1577
01:50:17,919 --> 01:50:19,220
You too, baby.

1578
01:50:19,354 --> 01:50:22,157
Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1579
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:24,559
I'm happy for you, pal.

1580
01:50:24,692 --> 01:50:26,094
Got your wingmen.

1581
01:50:26,227 --> 01:50:27,562
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1582
01:50:27,695 --> 01:50:31,366
Come on,
Knuckles. Ah! My victory chariot!

1583
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:36,371
I've got a lot more
than that... Dad.

1584
01:50:41,709 --> 01:50:43,211
Race you to the truck.

1585
01:50:44,712 --> 01:50:45,980
One, two, three, go!

1586
01:50:46,114 --> 01:50:48,550
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

1587
01:50:48,683 --> 01:50:51,586
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1588
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:55,390
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1589
01:50:55,523 --> 01:51:00,395
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1590
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:03,231
What? I mean,
you barely beat me.

1591
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:06,601
Ha! You've never been
beaten so hard.

1592
01:51:10,906 --> 01:51:12,273
Can't forget this.

Agent, I want an update.

1633
01:53:13,127 --> 01:53:16,197
Still searching,
sir. We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1634
01:53:16,331 --> 01:53:18,566
No one could've
survived that crash.

1635
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:21,870
He's toast. Good riddance.

1636
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:25,139
What a mess that lunatic made.

1637
01:53:25,273 --> 01:53:27,910
Sir, there's something else.

1638
01:53:28,043 --> 01:53:31,947
When we were wiping Robotnik off
our database, we found something.

1639
01:53:32,081 --> 01:53:36,018
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1640
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:37,685
What was it?

1641
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:39,021
Coordinates, sir.

1642
01:53:39,153 --> 01:53:40,990
Coordinates? To what?

1643
01:53:41,122 --> 01:53:44,192
<i>A secret research facility.</i>

1644
01:53:44,325 --> 01:53:46,461
<i>It was a black site, sir.</i>

1645
01:53:46,594 --> 01:53:49,397
<i>Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.</i>

1646
01:53:50,465 --> 01:53:51,867
<i>My God.</i>

1647
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,302
<i>Project Shadow.</i>
