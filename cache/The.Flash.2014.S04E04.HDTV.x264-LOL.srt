1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,359
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:04,679
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:06,015
To the outside world,

4
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:07,651
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:09,445
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:10,851
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:12,906
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,175
like me.

9
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,985
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,688
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,456
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,959
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,495
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:27,031
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,538
Previously, on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,046
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

17
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,901
12 markers, 12 metas.

18
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:36,437
They identified the targets
sooner than we planned.

19
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,929
Perhaps.

20
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:39,407
There's nothing within miles of here

21
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:41,191
capable of even creating dark matter.

22
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:42,977
There was three weeks ago.

23
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,945
This is where I came
out of the Speed Force.

24
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:48,015
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

25
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:50,051
You think the guy behind
the samurai robot...

26
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,052
Samuroid.

27
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,119
He wanted us to create

28
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:53,488
a busload of metas?

29
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,823
I think it's all connected.

30
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,421
Hello, gorgeous.

31
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,060
You ready to get your schmoopy on?

32
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,718
Joe, I'm pregnant.

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,673
Look, I was thinking...

34
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:14,442
No, no. Less thinking, more kissing.

35
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,646
Okay, but hold on a minute.

36
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,382
This thing we got going
on, this is real good.

37
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:22,516
It's okay.

38
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:23,538
What?

39
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,186
No, I'm just kidding.
It's better than okay.

40
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,789
Yeah, that's right. It's better than okay.

41
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,124
But because of that,

42
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:29,132
I think we're at a place

43
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:30,173
in our relationship

44
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,692
where the guy says to his girl

45
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:35,062
those three magic words.

46
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:37,331
What... what three words?

47
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:41,535
What's your name?

48
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:43,350
Um, oh.

49
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,940
Well, that is technically four words.

50
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,741
Mmm, actually, technically
it's three words

51
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:48,943
'cause contractions are one word

52
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,611
and that's how grammar works.

53
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:53,462
That's not the point,
though. What's your name?

54
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:54,748
Gypsy.

55
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,439
- My name is Gypsy.
- For real?

56
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:57,870
So, you were born, and
somebody was just like,

57
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,283
"I'm gonna name you Gypsy?"

58
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,254
Gypsy is what I like to be called.

59
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:03,319
It is mysterious. And it's moody.

60
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,959
Hmm. Moody's right.

61
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,093
All right.

62
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:07,294
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

63
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,529
And when I get back,

64
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:11,098
you'd better stop
asking me my real name.

65
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,201
And be wearing less clothes.

66
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,737
I don't need to know your name.

67
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:22,587
♪ Mmm, this girl, she
'bout to rock your world ♪

68
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,817
You're a dead man.

69
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:35,489
Those are collectibles.

70
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,424
Aah.

71
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,371
Who are you?

72
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:52,173
Daddy?

73
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,643
Pleased to meet you, sir.

74
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:59,228
Is he gonna put me down?

75
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,525

76
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:06,569
You know, some of you may not realize,

77
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,255
but before I was mayor,

78
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:11,025
I was a cop in this very precinct.

79
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:13,694
And it's because of these men and women

80
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:17,431
every family in Central City
can sleep comfortably at night.

81
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,933
What's happening?

82
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:21,390
Mayor Bellows is on
his reelection campaign.

83
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:24,928
Detective Joe West.
Keep up the good work.

84
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,941
What do you say, Joe?

85
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,514
I'll do that.

86
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,416
And that's why he's not a politician.

87
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:36,717
I hate that.

88
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,751
Yeah? Thought about

89
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:38,852
running against him?

90
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:39,962
Can't you picture yourself

91
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,522
shaking hands and kissing babies?

92
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,756
What?

93
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,358
Ain't nobody talking about babies.

94
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,092
You said you had a lead
on this meta bus situation.

95
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,327
Yeah, I do. Come here.

96
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,698
Fellow for Bellows!

97
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:56,097
You took the photos down
from your mother's case.

98
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,323
Yeah, well, the case was solved.

99
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,469
This one isn't.

100
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,471
We got these two. Kilgore and Hazard.

101
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,540
But that still leaves ten
meta-humans that were created

102
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,908
when I came out of the Speed Force.

103
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,942
How hard can it be to track

104
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,644
down ten bus passengers?

105
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,847
Well, according to the
Department of Transportation,

106
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,650
over 900 people rode that bus that day.

107
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,970
What about the bus driver?

108
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:15,586
That's where things
get more interesting.

109
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,521
He's dead.

110
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,789
Drowned in his own bathtub.

111
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,291
That's not too suspicious.

112
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,484
Harry said it was all connected.

113
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,593
I think he's right.

114
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,961
I mean, the Samuroid

115
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,416
pushing you guys to bring me back,

116
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:26,525
me not coming out

117
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,737
of the place you thought I would,

118
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,615
the bus being in the exact right place

119
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,234
to be hit by dark matter...

120
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,503
It was planned.

121
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,972
Yeah. By somebody smart.

122
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,007
We're pretty smart.

123
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,141
Well, I think so.

124
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,376
Okay, let's look closer

125
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,944
into the bus driver's death.

126
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,064
It may give us a lead.

127
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,713
I'll have Iris pull
up the autopsy report

128
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,714
from the coroner's office.

129
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,751
Sounds good.

130
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,219
What?

131
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,387
I don't know.

132
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,275
This morning, you're, like...

133
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:54,441
glowing.

134
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,277
What do you mean, "glowing?"

135
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,330
I just mean, like, you got,
like, a warmth about you.

136
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,498
Like a Lite-Brite.

137
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,466
There's no warmth. No glow.

138
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,035
And I ain't no damn Lite-Brite.

139
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,203
You're wasting time. S.T.A.R. Labs.

140
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,239
Glowing and irritable.

141
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,444
How's Cecile?

142
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,970
Fine. The same.

143
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:16,463
I mean, nothing's changed.
If something changes,

144
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,782
I'll let you know.

145
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,783
All right.

146
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,924
This facility is poorly guarded.

147
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,727
Clearly.

148
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,995
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

149
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,998
Okay. Power down, buckaroo.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Oh, good. You're both here.

151
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,897
Cisco, who is this?

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,669
This is Breacher.

153
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,738
AKA Gypsy's father.

154
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,173
Oh.

155
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,676
Yeah, I, um, can see the resemblance.

156
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,411
There is no resemblance.

157
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,047
So, you know how Gypsy's
kind of a big deal collector

158
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,107
on Earth-19? Well,
her boss is her dad...

159
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,311
Who decided to pay us
a little surprise visit

160
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:56,754
at the perfect time.

161
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,178
Which is why I decided to
show him around where I work.

162
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,859
- You know?
- I'm Barry Allen.

163
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,961
Cisco's personal assistant.

164
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,804
- His what?
- And he is the best

165
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,473
personal assistant I've ever had.

166
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,076
He stays late, starts early.

167
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,179
One day, I'll be working for him.

168
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,068
What are you doing?

169
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,136
I wanted to impress him,

170
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,537
and now I can't stop.

171
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,639
Joe West.

172
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,540
A fellow law man.

173
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,186
You, I can respect.

174
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,645
And Harry Wells back there.

175
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,030
You look like someone I once
sent my daughter to kill.

176
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,816
I get that a lot.

177
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,119
Uh, I thought maybe someone
would want to give him

178
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,772
the, uh, the old look-see.

179
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,423
Great idea. Um, Allen, Detective West,

180
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,492
why don't you give Gypsy's father here

181
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,727
the nickel tour of the facilities?

182
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,562
Joe.

183
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,166
I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

184
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,233
What is wrong with you?

185
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:46,734
Have you seen his face?

186
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,469
The guy's killed people with that face.

187
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,885
I'm not even joking. Gypsy said that

188
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,651
- literally happened.
- You want his approval, right?

189
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,220
Yes, I want his approval.
He's my girlfriend's father.

190
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:54,502
Of course. Cisco, listen.

191
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,861
You're a fine, upstanding,

192
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,114
smart, well-groomed young man.

193
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,282
Any father would be happy

194
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,550
to have you date his daughter,

195
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,685
except me.

196
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,049
Can't date my daughter, all right?

197
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,587
Can't date Jesse. Jesse's off limits.

198
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,689
Went for the compliment,

199
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,090
did not stick the landing.

200
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,877
Just take him for coffee, okay?

201
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,379
Go for coffee, get to know him

202
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,027
a little bit better.
I bet that you'll be

203
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,496
pleasantly surprised at how much

204
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,964
you have in common, right? You both have

205
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,999
the same powers. You're breachers.

206
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,100
You have ridiculous hair.

207
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,101
He has ridiculous hair.

208
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:17,846
Okay, but...

209
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,738
And you both love Gypsy.

210
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,973
Are you actually giving me
decent relationship advice

211
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,041
- right now?
- I am.

212
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,409
You'll be fine.

213
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,279
I don't wanna be here anymore.

214
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,514
And we're leaving.

215
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,554
Have fun storming the castle.

216
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,789
Why is the scariest
person I've ever seen

217
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,024
roaming our halls?

218
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,887
- Cisco.
- Oh.

219
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,391
Okay, so, I've got the coroner's report

220
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:44,646
for the death of the bus driver,

221
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,327
but it doesn't seem like
there's any signs of foul play.

222
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,464
Aside from him being the one
guy that could have told us

223
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,715
who else was on that bus.

224
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:53,169
They logged his personal
effects, let's see...

225
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,650
Credit cards, cash, receipts, um...

226
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:56,742
Wait, go back.

227
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:03,978
- Ralph Dibny.
- I'll be damned.

228
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,913
Who is Ralph Dibny?

229
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,382
He used to be a cop.

230
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,851
Dirty cop. He got kicked off the force.

231
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:10,985
For what?

232
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,787
It's a long story.

233
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:15,623
- That's him.
- Oh.

234
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,625
He's handsome in a square-jawed

235
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,027
Oliver Queen kind of way.

236
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,106
For real?

237
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:22,276
Babe, you know I've
only got eyes for you.

238
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,898
The I.O.U. is dated the same day

239
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,671
that I came out of the Speed Force.

240
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,541
You think Dibny was on the bus that day?

241
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:29,871
Maybe he's a meta-human now?

242
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,139
Let's pay him a visit.

243
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,340
Hey.

244
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,044
You seem... something.

245
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,643
What's up with you and this Ralph guy?

246
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,179
It's like Joe said. It's a long story.

247
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,215
Oliver Queen is hot.

248
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:43,584
Amen, hallelujah.

249
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:47,422
I promised there wasn't a
single case I couldn't crack.

250
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:50,758
And a promise made is a promise kept.

251
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,860
Dibny detects.

252
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:56,097
Your husband didn't die in
that plane crash, Mrs. Broome.

253
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,565
He didn't? Then where is he?

254
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:00,835
Well, that brings us
to the difficult part.

255
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,137
Turns out he got remarried
and moved to Minnesota.

256
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,252
Has two kids now. Twins.

257
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:10,840
Twins in the twin cities.

258
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,350
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey.

259
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,352
No, no, no, no, no. Don't.

260
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,388
Don't cry for that jerk.

261
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,956
He doesn't deserve it.

262
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,391
The sun still shines.

263
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,509
The birds, they still chirp.

264
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,428
Chirp, chirp.

265
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,642
Mrs. Broome, you are a
very attractive woman,

266
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:34,802
and you will find someone else.

267
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,916
Someone who will hold you.

268
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,442
Someone who will wipe away those tears.

269
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,779
Do you like shrimp?

270
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,716
Ow!

271
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,554
Uh...

272
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,856
This is definitely his place.

273
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:00,294
Reconsidered, huh?

274
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,064
- Ralph.
- Joe West.

275
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,005
Barry Allen.

276
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:12,775
Been a long time, rookie.

277
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,728
Well, I'm not a rookie anymore, Dibny.

278
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:16,947
You look healthy.

279
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,103
Yeah. Got the spare tire

280
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:21,040
out of the trunk. It happens.

281
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:23,584
Might even happen to you,
too, one day, Slim Jim.

282
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,687
So what brings you
boys to Casa de Dibny?

283
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,186
Were you on the 405 bus
four weeks ago around noon?

284
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,122
That's a very specific question.

285
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,692
We found your I.O.U. from
the deceased bus driver's

286
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:35,794
personal effects.

287
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,562
Deceased? Hey.

288
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,330
That's one less "U" I owe.

289
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,099
What's it to you two?

290
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,353
It's a simple question. Why
don't you just answer it?

291
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,137
You walk into my office after five years

292
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,559
like nothing ever happened,
and ask me for a favor?

293
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,176
I smell a mystery.

294
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,745
It's not a favor. It's information.

295
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:56,514
And how much is this information worth?

296
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,270
Are you shaking us down?

297
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,932
I know something you don't.

298
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,556
And you need to know it
badly, otherwise you'd never

299
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,826
swallow your pride and
face me after what you did.

300
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:09,561
After what I did?

301
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:11,095
Ralph.

302
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,764
The people on that bus were exposed

303
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,265
to a dangerous substance.

304
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,334
Dangerous?

305
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:21,439
Dangerous like what? Like... Ebola?

306
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,817
Were you on the bus?

307
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,553
No.

308
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:27,912
Okay. Let's go.

309
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,482
Hey, I heard you shacked
up with that hot D.A.

310
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:33,251
She got a sister?

311
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,453
Okay.

312
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,247
Good luck. All the best.

313
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,416
So, what's it worth?

314
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,043
Ah, crap.

315
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:58,810
Guys, you don't want to do this!

316
00:11:58,812 --> 00:11:59,978
I don't know what you want.

317
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,192
Let's talk about this.

318
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,495
Put me down.

319
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:03,847
- Whoa!
- Don't put me down!

320
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,452
Don't put me down!

321
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,197
That guy hasn't changed a bit.

322
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,666
You really expect him to?

323
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:25,370
Whoa!

324
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:30,332
I guess he was on that bus.

325
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,250
Hey, guys? What the hell?

326
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,998
Yeah, yeah, well, you're welcome.

327
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,000
What happened to me?

328
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,254
Breathe, okay?

329
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:54,347
- I am breathing.
- Okay.

330
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,536
Clearly this guy is a bus meta.

331
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:56,872
This is interesting. The dark matter has

332
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,707
polymerized Dibny's cells.

333
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,395
What the hell is dark matter,
and why is it in my cells?

334
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:02,972
You're saying the walls of every cell

335
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,899
- in his body have elasticized?
- I'm saying they formed

336
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,035
an unbreakable bond at the atomic level.

337
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,275
Now you can stretch these cells

338
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:08,253
and stretch these cells.

339
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,771
- Like Silly Putty.
- Like Silly Putty.

340
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:10,828
I'm Silly Putty?

341
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,806
No.

342
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:12,675
Kinda.

343
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:13,558
I'm Silly Putty?

344
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,378
Ralph.

345
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,714
Who were the guys on the roof?

346
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:18,511
Is that really the issue right now?

347
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,147
Look at me!

348
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,450
Allen, you and your S.T.A.R. Labs nerds

349
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,018
better put me back together.

350
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,553
Get your hands off me.
We're trying to help you.

351
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,854
- You're not trying to help me.
- Shut up.

352
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,593
Come on! Oh, come on!

353
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,695
You can do this later. I
just need a sample of blood.

354
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:34,936
Whoa.

355
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,241
Ow!

356
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,478
Oh, is that my face?

357
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:59,154
Four years seeing this
stuff, I finally puked.

358
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,741
Can I plug in?

359
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,606
Daddy.

360
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,943
I know you love me, and I love you.

361
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,905
I really like Cisco, and I
need you two to get along.

362
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,175
So do you think that
you can try to do that?

363
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:24,746
I'll do anything for you, petal.

364
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:28,272
Ah, three coffees.

365
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,540
How about you, huh?

366
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:30,850
Ready for some hot java?

367
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,886
We don't have coffee on my Earth.

368
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,522
Crops were destroyed.

369
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:38,339
My world was attacked...
Invaded... by the worst,

370
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:41,863
most evil creatures in the multiverse.

371
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:44,232
I'll never drink coffee again.

372
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,434
- Two for me.
- It's okay.

373
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:47,869
Daddy, why don't I get you a tea?

374
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:48,970
Like a relaxing tea?

375
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,003
- Yeah.
- Please.

376
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,508
- Okay.
- Thanks.

377
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,080
Pop a squat. Uh...

378
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,414
I know from a friend...
Who is also a father...

379
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,650
How important his daughter is to him.

380
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,020
And I just wanted to let
you know how important

381
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,822
your daughter is to me.

382
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:12,093
And that after you and I get
to know each other a little,

383
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:15,463
maybe we might find that...

384
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:18,499
we're not so different.

385
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,834
I'm going to hunt you.

386
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,104
You're not worthy of her.

387
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,006
Isn't that for her to decide?

388
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,131
Ten.

389
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,910
Also, I could have sworn you said,

390
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,277
uh, you were gonna hunt me.

391
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,878
What, like a deer?

392
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,747
I have hunted some of the worst

393
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,496
breach criminals in history.

394
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:39,387
Marla the Dark Lord.
Soolunga of Sheerdra.

395
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,557
The Sand People of Scar.

396
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,967
You will be easy prey.

397
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,350
Nine.

398
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:49,497
Listen, I have tried
to be polite with you,

399
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,780
but this is going a little too far.

400
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,735
I get that you're overprotective...

401
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:54,897
Eight.

402
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,105
- Are you counting?
- For the next 24 hours,

403
00:15:57,107 --> 00:15:59,640
I will be hunting you
throughout this city.

404
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,542
We will not use our powers.

405
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,810
But when it's over,

406
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:05,279
my daughter will be free of you.

407
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,781
Seven.

408
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,449
Do you do this with all her boyfriends?

409
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:10,218
I hunted her last one, yes.

410
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,252
Where is he now?

411
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,327
I don't know.

412
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,483
- He got away.
- I don't know

413
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,545
where you go when you die.

414
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,688
Five.

415
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:17,958
You just skipped six.

416
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,695
I know. Four.

417
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:22,230
And don't try to breach.

418
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,246
I'll know it if you do.

419
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,803
You can't hide from
me. So if I were you,

420
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,939
I would start running, Cisky.

421
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:42,655
Three, two, one.

422
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,655
Damn.

423
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,258
He's hunting him.

424
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,130
I finally calmed him down.

425
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,132
Amazing what 50 milligrams
of Lorazepam can do

426
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,920
when you get it in aerosol form.

427
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,011
Is there anything you can
do to put him back together?

428
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:03,746
Please, my stomach can't take much more.

429
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,940
I think I could stabilize
his cells if I had a sample

430
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,042
of his DNA from prior to when

431
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,844
he was exposed to the
dark matter on the bus.

432
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:12,412
Why? So he can go out

433
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:13,614
and start hurting people,

434
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,316
like our other friends here?

435
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,419
I think we should lock
him up in the Pipeline.

436
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,720
He hasn't done anything.

437
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,756
Yet. Trust me.

438
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,511
I know this guy. He's a bad guy.

439
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:27,762
Barry, I took an oath to help people.

440
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:30,191
I'm a doctor. I can't just leave him

441
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,866
in there like spaghetti.

442
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,269
Villains?

443
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:34,569
Yeah.

444
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:37,138
Every person that was on
that bus is now 1,000 times

445
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,066
more dangerous than they were before.

446
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,175
Dibny included.

447
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,926
- What if he's changed?
- People don't change.

448
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,010
- I did.
- When I became Killer Frost,

449
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:45,363
you still believed in me.

450
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:48,663
You're a good person. He's...

451
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,832
not.

452
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,118
Barry, how about you and I

453
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,620
go back to Dibny's office?

454
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,238
Find a DNA sample for Caitlin?

455
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,424
Dad, you go back to
CCPD, see what you can

456
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,592
dig up on Dibny?

457
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:59,495
Yes, boss.

458
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,504
Looks like someone tossed this place.

459
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,663
Yeah. Probably the same guys

460
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,174
that hung Dibny off the roof.

461
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,585
Why do you think?

462
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,527
I dunno. Guy like that probably has

463
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,014
a long list of people that
wanna toss him off rooftops.

464
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,749
Why do you want to?

465
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,381
No, seriously. What happened between

466
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:25,985
the two of you?

467
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:30,686
It was one of my first cases
when I was a junior CSI.

468
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:33,290
Dibny was the lead detective.

469
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:35,526
What case?

470
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:38,332
A woman named Judy Gimlin
was stabbed to death.

471
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:41,302
Her husband, Reagan,
was the prime suspect.

472
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:44,366
But there was no evidence...
Nothing to tie him

473
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,335
to the crime scene.

474
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:50,410
And then, Dibny
miraculously found a knife

475
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,413
with the husband's fingerprints.

476
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:55,516
Case closed. Dibny was a hero.

477
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,418
I don't know, maybe
because my mom was stabbed,

478
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,999
I wanted to be sure.
So I analyzed the knife.

479
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,735
The serrations on the
blade did not match

480
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,424
the wound on the vic.

481
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,241
So Dibny planted the knife.

482
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,762
Yep. And then he lied about it.

483
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:09,155
Under oath.

484
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,898
- And you busted him?
- I mean, he didn't just

485
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,234
bend the rules, Iris.
He committed perjury...

486
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:16,604
Evidence tampering. He
was thrown off the force.

487
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,408
Point is, he was crooked
then. He's crooked now.

488
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,113
Hey, how much DNA do
you think Caitlin needs?

489
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:27,481
Not much.

490
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:28,684
Okay.

491
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,153
Oh, think this will work?

492
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:35,489
Barry!

493
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:48,570
I guess someone hates
him more than you do.

494
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,064
And that's what it feels like

495
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:58,500
to vibrate through solid matter.

496
00:19:58,503 --> 00:19:59,860
I'm just glad you two weren't hurt.

497
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,781
No thanks to your new buddy in there.

498
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,350
He's not my buddy. He's my patient.

499
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,001
Caitlin, I just don't understand
why you're defending him.

500
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,069
Because I know what it's like

501
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,137
to suddenly find yourself

502
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,289
with extraordinary powers

503
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,055
and be totally freaked out by it.

504
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,158
And so do you, for that matter.

505
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:15,001
You and I both woke up in this
lab once knowing that our lives

506
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,470
would never be the same.

507
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,594
So how about you give
the guy a little sympathy?

508
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,029
- Hey.
- Guys.

509
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,732
I pulled the LUDS on Dibny's phone.

510
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,735
There were 15 phone calls

511
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,706
between him and the Mayor's office.

512
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,008
What is Mayor Bellows doing
talking to Ralph Dibny?

513
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:34,020
Oh, look. It's my
good buddy Barry Allen.

514
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,516
Someone just blew up your office.

515
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,385
Sweet. Insurance claim.

516
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,234
My fiancee and I almost died.

517
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:45,526
You landed West's daughter? Wow.

518
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:47,261
Everything's coming up Allen.

519
00:20:47,263 --> 00:20:48,629
The job. The girl.

520
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:50,464
Who's trying to kill you, Dibny?

521
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,533
Do you know how many
people I have pissed off

522
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:53,766
in the last five years?

523
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,503
Angry husbands. Angry wives.

524
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,204
Not exactly dealing with high society

525
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,706
taking photos of cheating spouses.

526
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,374
Then why are you talking to the Mayor?

527
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,509
Who says I am?

528
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,875
Your phone records.

529
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:05,713
Did... did you get a warrant for that?

530
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,781
'Cause I know you're all by-the-book.

531
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,630
What's your business with Mayor Bellows?

532
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,552
Nothing. Just calling to tell him

533
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:13,641
what a swell job I think he's doing.

534
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,977
15 times?

535
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,763
12 of those were butt dials.

536
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,016
All right, look, whatever.

537
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,593
Maybe we'll go talk
to the Mayor ourselves.

538
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:20,995
You know, he's a huge fan of Joe's.

539
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,453
Yeah, you go do that.

540
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:23,316
All right.

541
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,153
I'm gonna stay here.

542
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:26,516
Stretch my legs.

543
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:31,372
Ramon, do you think it's
wise to be sneaking around

544
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,674
a technologically weaponized facility?

545
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:37,178
It's a lot safer than what
I'm up against out there, so...

546
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,812
Coffee didn't go well, I take it?

547
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:43,621
Well, Gypsy's dad wants
to hunt me for 24 hours

548
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:45,784
to see if I'm worthy of his daughter...

549
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:48,822
No powers... so, don't know
what the hell I'm supposed to do

550
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,545
- about that.
- Fight back.

551
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:53,160
I swear, it's like
you're trying to listen,

552
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:55,896
but you just nod while you're
thinking of something else.

553
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,468
- You're doing it right now.
- Fight back.

554
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,647
Ramon, what did you say?

555
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,449
You said no powers?

556
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,785
Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,303
Well, in addition to being Vibe,

558
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:06,072
you have another superpower...
You're smart in here.

559
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,418
All right? Outwardly, you're weak.

560
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,776
All right? Too much.

561
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,477
But use your outwardly weak appearance

562
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,179
to your advantage. He's gonna anticipate

563
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:13,914
a pathetic target.
Well, you're pathetic.

564
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,916
You're pathetic. You're weak.

565
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,318
Not helping, just hurting.

566
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,153
All I'm saying is, set a trap, okay?

567
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:22,122
Beat him at his own game. Set a trap.

568
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:25,626
- Set a trap.
- That's right, a trap.

569
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,095
A trap, I can do.

570
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,965
'Cause he may be the Predator,

571
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,967
but I'm the Schwarzenegger.

572
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,002
Where is he?

573
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:42,276
He was here.

574
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,983
Uh, he went that way.

575
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,945
I farted.

576
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:56,287
I'm not sure everything's still

577
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,715
where it's supposed to be down there.

578
00:22:57,717 --> 00:22:59,702
- Drink this.
- What is it?

579
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,639
I don't just drink stuff.

580
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:02,997
My body is a temple.

581
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,464
Clearly. Drink it.

582
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,933
I wanna know what it is.

583
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:07,433
It's 17% alcohol.

584
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:10,070
You should have lead with that, sister.

585
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,519
Ugh! What was that?

586
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,744
It's a serum of sulfur,
zinc oxide, and steric acid

587
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,812
to cross-link your polymerized cells.

588
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,047
In English.

589
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:21,915
It's gonna fix you.

590
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:27,788
Oh.

591
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,952
You did it. I'm cured.

592
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,089
Well, not cured. All I did was introduce

593
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:35,496
a stabilizing enzyme to reset
your body to default shape

594
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,332
through vulcanization.

595
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,667
It's like muscle memory.

596
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,002
Muscle memory, huh?

597
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,637
Huh.

598
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,173
How far back memory, you think?

599
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,675
I don't know.

600
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,239
Uh, think about the shape you want to be

601
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,512
and just be it.

602
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,717
I'm back. I look like a Hemsworth.

603
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,263
Joseph.

604
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,331
Thank you for meeting us.

605
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,475
Quick stop on my way

606
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,433
to a hospital ribbon
cutting. No problem.

607
00:24:13,436 --> 00:24:16,331
What's with you? You're glowing.

608
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:19,106
- N-no, I'm not.
- You are.

609
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:20,607
Well, how can I help you, gentlemen?

610
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,543
I've got a lot on my schedule today.

611
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,195
Ah, we won't take up much
of your time, Mr. Mayor.

612
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:25,855
Uh, do you know a man named Ralph Dibny?

613
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:27,481
Doesn't ring a bell. Who is he?

614
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:30,108
Well, he's a former cop
turned private investigator.

615
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,610
- I don't think so.
- Really?

616
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:34,087
He called your office
over a dozen times.

617
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,202
Oh, I'm gonna have to
check with my secretary.

618
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,101
Anthony, you used to be a cop.

619
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,602
We're not talking to the mayor, here.

620
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:49,936
It's three cops talking.

621
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,106
Whatever cops say to each other,

622
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:55,175
they don't say to anybody else.

623
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:58,319
What's going on with you and Dibny?

624
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,323
I, uh...

625
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:04,197
- Made a mistake.
- A mistake?

626
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,756
You mean like the kind of
mistake you make with a woman

627
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,725
who's not your wife?

628
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:15,116
It was only that one time, Joe.

629
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,297
I regretted it the moment I did it,

630
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,100
and I broke it off right away.

631
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:25,305
And then Dibny shows up,
and he's got pictures of us.

632
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,843
And he threatens to show them
to my wife unless I pay him.

633
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,945
- How much?
- Not enough.

634
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,881
All those phone calls,
it was him negotiating

635
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,185
for a bigger price.

636
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,218
I love my family, Joe.

637
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,855
Just let me pay him,

638
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,287
and I'll be done with it.

639
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,292
No, Mr. Mayor, you're
not gonna have to do that.

640
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,861
We're gonna take care of it.

641
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:50,303
Joe, Barry. Thank you.

642
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:53,106
Mm-hmm.

643
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:55,561
So much for Dibny changing.

644
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:59,171
Dibny's alive and talking.

645
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:01,841
Find him. I want those pictures

646
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:02,777
and his head.

647
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,670
And the cops?

648
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:05,242
What do I care about cops?

649
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:06,911
Waste 'em.

650
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:11,218
Your vitals are fantastic.

651
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,619
Yeah.

652
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,354
You're blackmailing the Mayor?

653
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,491
Classic Barry Allen. Enters
room and accuses wildly.

654
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,792
We know about the photos, Ralph.

655
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:20,327
Bellows told us everything.

656
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,528
Hey, I'm not the one who told him

657
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,940
to step out on his wife.

658
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,475
That's your defense?

659
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:26,466
It's his fault that
you're extorting him?

660
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:28,702
Isn't that a little easy for you to say?

661
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:30,737
Your fancy lab, your good job,

662
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,339
and your hot girlfriend?

663
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,507
People like me are just trying to get

664
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,479
from one bill to the next.

665
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:36,969
And I wouldn't have
to be living like that

666
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,879
if you hadn't cost me my job.

667
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,714
You got yourself fired.

668
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:43,159
You tampered with evidence.
You framed that guy.

669
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:45,062
Because he was guilty.

670
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:47,198
And he was gonna get away
with killing his wife,

671
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,768
and then you let him go.

672
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:53,440
I was a good cop. I
was a good detective.

673
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:55,395
I lost everything.

674
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,281
Mayor's got plenty of money.

675
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,638
He can afford to spare a little.

676
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,876
Consider it the pension you cost me.

677
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:13,080
Good people don't destroy
lives and call it noble.

678
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:16,750
You were dirty then. You're dirty now.

679
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,753
Live with that.

680
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:20,954
You're not going anywhere.

681
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:23,090
Get off me.

682
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:31,899
Are you kidding me?

683
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,705
Thanks for ruining my life twice, Allen.

684
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,019
Cisky.

685
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,821
Show yourself.

686
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,991
No one can avoid me forever.

687
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:02,259
I'm not going to.

688
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,162
Are you kidding me?

689
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,331
Say good-bye, my little enemy.

690
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:12,937
What the Sheol?

691
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:19,677
Guess who's got a hologram?

692
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,565
Ho, ho, ho.

693
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,517
Bet you're wondering what this is.

694
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,052
This is an anti-vibrational force field

695
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,553
with an oscillating power grid.

696
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,140
It's good enough for the Reverse-Flash,

697
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,623
good enough for you.

698
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,437
So you might as well
wave your white flag,

699
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,927
'cause you aren't
getting out of this thing

700
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:40,064
until the clock strikes Cisco's victory.

701
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:43,546
Oh, victory. Feels good.

702
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,968
I pulled this from the body

703
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,296
of an Earth-48 hunter-killer.

704
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,742
You can't trap a trapper.

705
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,804
I just needed to cool off.

706
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:17,701
I figured.

707
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:22,640
Dibny seemed to have
gotten under your skin.

708
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:28,445
Why is it so important to
you that he be the bad guy?

709
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,735
When I first started at CCPD,

710
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,870
all I cared about was the rules.

711
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,739
But, you know, these last few years,

712
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,041
we've locked up
meta-humans without a trial.

713
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:41,746
Played with time and space,
messed with other worlds.

714
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:43,742
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with Dibny?

715
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:45,816
Just that everything
that we've done we did

716
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,585
because we were trying to help people.

717
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,353
Keep them safe.

718
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,455
Hm.

719
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:56,861
Is that all Dibny was
trying to do back then?

720
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:01,899
Good people don't destroy
lives and call it noble.

721
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,002
Did I make a mistake back then?

722
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,471
Did I cost a good man his life?

723
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,973
I don't know, Bare.

724
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,742
He did break the law... Cross the line.

725
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,743
But you didn't make him do that.

726
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,579
And you didn't make
him blackmail the Mayor.

727
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,282
But, maybe Caitlin was right.

728
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,685
Everyone who's gone
through what you and her

729
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,586
and now Dibny's gone through...

730
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,423
Maybe he deserves a second chance.

731
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,462
I got it.

732
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,961
Allen. Detective West.

733
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:40,071
Aren't you two on the Mayor's detail?

734
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,460
Sorry to bother you at home,
but dispatch just radioed.

735
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,942
Captain Singh needs you
down at station ASAP.

736
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:48,612
All right, let me get my jacket.

737
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,581
Bare!

738
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,666
That never gets old.

739
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,202
Those two work or the Mayor.

740
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:12,436
They just tried to kill us.

741
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,916
Dibny's next.

742
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,709
Cisky, Cisky, Cisky.

743
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,114
Cisky.

744
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,917
Cisky.

745
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,288
Come out. Come out and meet your end.

746
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,560
Plastoid.

747
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:40,097
You creatures destroyed my planet.

748
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:45,202
Now I will kill every last one of you.

749
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:58,082
Guys, anyone there?

750
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,651
Barry, I'm here. It's me.

751
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,752
What's up?

752
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,722
I need you to activate

753
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:04,422
the tracker I put on Dibny.

754
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,724
You put a tracker on Ralph?

755
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,794
Plastoid.

756
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,662
Cisco, do you know where he is?

757
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,532
He's at City Hall.

758
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:33,985
You lost weight.

759
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,797
Lap band surgery. Heh.

760
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,664
Since killing you didn't work out,

761
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,862
what we agreed upon. 200K.

762
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:46,998
Let me have the photographs.

763
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:49,169
Here's the pictures.

764
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,240
- Keep the money.
- What?

765
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,742
- I take it back.
- Take it back?

766
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,278
I take my blackmail back.

767
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,289
- Is this some kind of a trick?
- I'm not dirty.

768
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:07,086
And I don't want any
part of this anymore.

769
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,622
And don't you forget, I
can tie you to that bomb

770
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,257
you had your goons plant in my office,

771
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,094
so if you don't walk away,
I will go to the cops.

772
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,274
- That's still blackmail.
- No, it's not.

773
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:21,025
Yes, it is. You're telling me if I don't

774
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,961
give you this money,
you won't go to the cops.

775
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:25,727
Okay, fine. I am blackmailing you

776
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,838
into not being blackmailed.

777
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,774
So, we're good, then.

778
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,177
Yeah, we're good.

779
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:44,722
Bullet booger. Super gross.

780
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,594
Sorry, Mr. Mayor. It's over.

781
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:58,303
Die, Plastoid, die!

782
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:06,529
You will not infest this world

783
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:09,342
as you did mine, Plastoid.

784
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:11,444
Plastoid, what? Is he talking to me?

785
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:13,613
Breacher, stop.

786
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:21,021
- Okay.
- He dies, speedster.

787
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:23,456
Get in there, Joe.
You're coming with me.

788
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,226
Flash!

789
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:36,503
Look, you don't have to do this.

790
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:38,104
Yes, I do.

791
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,781
Leave him alone.

792
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:49,683
This guy didn't invade your planet.

793
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:51,151
He didn't do anything wrong.

794
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:53,453
He's like this 'cause of me and my team.

795
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:55,822
So if you've got a problem
with him and his powers,

796
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:58,558
then you deal with me.

797
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,936
Hey, are we good here?
Because I definitely

798
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,604
gotta change my drawers.

799
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,978
The Mayor took Joe.

800
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,546
I can't run fast enough right now.

801
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,915
I'll never have enough
speed to jump off a building.

802
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,350
Can you breach me up there?

803
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:25,051
No way. The event horizon would rip

804
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,252
that helicopter apart.

805
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,454
But we've gotta save Joe.

806
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:29,456
What do we do?

807
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,680
You can get me up there.

808
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,983
- Me?
- Yeah.

809
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,794
- How?
- You can stretch.

810
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:36,829
Grab it.

811
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,665
Are you... are you
crazy? I can't do that.

812
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,066
Yes, you can. All right?

813
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:41,501
I know that you have it inside you

814
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:43,870
to help someone other than yourself.

815
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:45,205
I know you, Ralph.

816
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:48,375
How could you possibly know me?

817
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:55,348
Dude, are you kidding me?

818
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,579
You're the Flash?

819
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:58,508
Everyone else gets struck
by lightning and dies,

820
00:35:58,511 --> 00:36:00,771
- and you get super powers?
- Ralph, yeah, that's right.

821
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:02,389
Your assistant's a speedster?

822
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:04,560
I liked the Flash. Now
I have to hate the Flash.

823
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:08,192
Ralph, focus. I need you to do this.

824
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,295
Joe needs you to do this. Please.

825
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:13,800
Show me I was wrong about you.
You said you were a good cop.

826
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:15,969
Be one right now.

827
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,585
Aah!

828
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,092
What the hell?

829
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,795
I got it!

830
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,497
Ooh.

831
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:45,732
Ooh-oh...

832
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:48,368
- Help!
- Hold on, Ralph.

833
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,013
Ooh.

834
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,251
Cecile's pregnant.

835
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:41,761
Well, we've reached the end of our road.

836
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,963
We had some stumbles along the way,

837
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:47,666
but we pulled it
together. We made it home.

838
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,641
- I hate you.
- Wow.

839
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,048
Really thought that one would work.

840
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:53,172
But I respect you.

841
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:54,874
You're a steadfast warrior

842
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:58,244
who would fight the fiercest of
enemies to protect your friend

843
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:00,213
and the only person I love.

844
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:02,216
With my dying breath, sir.

845
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,712
I know that, but I still hate you.

846
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,390
I have never seen him gush like that.

847
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,657
That's gushing? I'm
terrified to experience

848
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,059
him loving me.

849
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:17,563
Well, that's my job.

850
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:21,120
Oh, that's right. It is.

851
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:24,702
I feel a code-17 breach in progress.

852
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:27,339
We have to leave now, Cynthia.

853
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:30,409
Cyn-Cynthia?

854
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:34,251
Cynthia. What's your dad's name?

855
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:35,820
Josh.

856
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,844
Cynthia and Josh. That's great.

857
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,922
Not so scary now, Cynthia.

858
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,191
Keep calling me that. See what happens.

859
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,325
All right.

860
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:49,528
See you around... Gypsy.

861
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:35,908
- I fixed up your office.
- Sweet fancy Moses.

862
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,310
Thanks for screwing
up my insurance claim.

863
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,146
No payout, no mayor money.

864
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:41,647
I gotta pick up a case soon.

865
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:44,180
What if I had a job for you?

866
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,016
I wanna laugh really hard right now,

867
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,253
but I'm afraid my face
will fall off again.

868
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,955
I can't change what has happened

869
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,219
between us in the past,

870
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,659
but I can offer you a
chance to change what happens

871
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,961
- in our future.
- How?

872
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,704
Let my team and I study your powers,

873
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:02,534
figure out how to improve them,
see what your limitations are.

874
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:04,477
And let me train you.

875
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,810
Train me? For what?

876
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:09,213
To do what I do.

877
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,985
To be a detective again, Ralph.

878
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,512
A real one. Like,
it's not gonna be easy.

879
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,891
I'm gonna push you to your limit.

880
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,196
I think it's safe to say some
days you're gonna hate me.

881
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,566
Allen, it's safe to say
that I always hate you.

882
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:24,235
Do I get a cool super hero name?

883
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:26,860
What do you think about... Plastic Man?

884
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,980
I think that's the dumbest
name I've ever heard of.

885
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,462
Yeah, Cisco comes up with the names.

886
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,821
It's better that way.

887
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:33,357
What do you say?

888
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:47,191
There's just one thing I gotta ask you.

889
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,195
What made you look into Mayor
Bellows in the first place?

890
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,469
Oh, it was a client. Asked
me to follow the Mayor.

891
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,883
Never met him, though. He did
everything over the phone.

892
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:55,954
Who was it?

893
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,824
Only gave me his last name.

894
00:40:57,827 --> 00:40:59,760
DeVoe.

895
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:03,107
You and I have been enemies for years.

896
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,204
Oh, you've had others, of course.

897
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:08,071
There's Thawne. Zoom. DeVoe.

898
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:11,342
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

899
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,876
to use against DeVoe.

900
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,423
What's wrong? The name DeVoe

901
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:19,043
mean something to you?

902
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:23,884
I smell a mystery.

903
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:33,950
