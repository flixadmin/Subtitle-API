1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,764
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

2
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

3
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:08,004
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:10,044
<i>are your own responsibility.</i>

5
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:12,004
<i>Since my mother
passed away four years ago,</i>

6
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:13,404
<i>Tommy and I haven't even spoken.</i>

7
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:14,684
I'm very much looking forward

8
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,860
to working with you again,
Michael.

9
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:19,084
That, my friend, is
the finest opium in the world.

10
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:20,084
Why would you sell?

11
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:21,724
<i>The Irish are being difficult.</i>

12
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:23,084
The Italians are not an option.

13
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:25,004
- You're going to America?
- To Canada,

14
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,340
to collect payment
for the shipment.

15
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:28,644
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

16
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,804
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

17
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.</i>

18
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:35,484
She's gone, Tommy.
She's gone.

19
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:37,724
A daughter lost. A son found.

20
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,764
This is my son.
They call him Duke.

21
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:43,524
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

22
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,444
- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

23
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,044
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby.

24
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:49,964
<i>And you are going to give us
his brother.</i>

25
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,484
What are
Michael's real intentions

26
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:52,604
towards me, Gina?

27
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,444
And if you lie, I will know.

28
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,964
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

29
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,124
<i>It was the ambitions
and strategies of one man</i>

30
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:26,324
<i>that caused this.</i>

31
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,884
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

32
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:03,604
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

33
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,764
I want to see my wife first.

34
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,444
After you've fucked your wife,

35
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:10,924
you're going to kill a man,
right?

36
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:59,644
The smoke
from your daughter's funeral

37
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:00,924
is still in your clothes...

38
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:05,044
...and you slept with someone.

39
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:09,324
Not just someone.

40
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,044
The enemy.

41
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:16,404
Every enemy we ever had
in one woman.

42
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:22,204
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I...

43
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:25,044
You're not so good at lying
any more, Tommy.

44
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,604
These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

45
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,324
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

46
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:36,164
I need to know
where you will go.

47
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,404
See? You just accept it.

48
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,524
You don't fight it.

49
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,524
You are cursed, Tommy.

50
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:52,164
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

51
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:57,204
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

52
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,524
A curse never to be lifted.

53
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,364
I will be away, Lizzie.

54
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,604
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where...

55
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:14,324
Always gone, always away.

56
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,444
Well, now your rings are gone,

57
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,724
your rings are away.

58
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,244
I'm already packed.

59
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,524
Now leave me
to say goodbye to Ruby.

60
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,124
I have to go away for a bit,
Charlie.

61
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,564
Look at me.

62
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:56,564
Hey. Look at me.

63
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:03,244
Mum already told me
she's leaving...

64
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,124
...and she told me why.

65
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,444
Mum, where are you going?

66
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,564
A hotel.

67
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,524
And then your father
will get me a house.

68
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:35,844
Mum, I'll come with you.

69
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:38,564
I'd rather be with you.

70
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:40,724
Wherever it is.

71
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:43,524
You're not my mum...

72
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:46,884
...but you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

73
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,524
He's never here.

74
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,604
I'd be on my own here.

75
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:57,404
Oh, Charles, love...

76
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,724
...I don't think your father
would allow that.

77
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,564
You can go.

78
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:09,364
You can go, son.

79
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:12,524
I know a good place.

80
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,124
Lizzie, I'll arrange that place.

81
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,884
And, Charlie,
you can take him, eh?

82
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:21,684
They have stables
at this new place.

83
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:24,964
After a while,
he'll... he'll listen to you.

84
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,164
He'll forget about Ruby.

85
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,844
That's how horses are.

86
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,924
And you'll be here all alone.

87
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:37,524
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

88
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:39,364
This place I've bought

89
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,364
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there.

90
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,644
Dad...

91
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,724
...where will you go?

92
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:57,684
This is
the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

93
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:00,284
We have a very good relationship

94
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,724
with the BSA factory
in Armoury Road.

95
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:09,164
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

96
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:12,964
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

97
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,124
For what purpose?

98
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,924
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

99
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,644
When men come to us
with bad intentions,

100
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,604
the family come together.

101
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,884
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

102
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:31,484
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

103
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,484
You're going to be a general...

104
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,324
...some day.

105
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,204
So, I need to ask you
some questions.

106
00:07:51,644 --> 00:07:53,124
What have you ever fired?

107
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,884
Shotgun.

108
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:01,724
Pistol.

109
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,004
22.

110
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,124
What have you ever killed?

111
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:09,324
Few rabbits.

112
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,444
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

113
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,404
Arthur tells me

114
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:16,900
when they were taking care
of some business

115
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,404
at the betting shop,

116
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,284
you ran away.

117
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:22,604
It was unfair.

118
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,684
Fairness is not
a soldier's concern.

119
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,924
You do what you do.

120
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:33,644
I already have done.

121
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:35,924
Fair and square.

122
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,884
I have killed a man.

123
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,404
Tommy's always right.

124
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,444
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

125
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,444
In the Black Country.

126
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,844
My mother was dying.

127
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:59,804
And the orderly
wouldn't give her a bed

128
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,804
cos she was a Gypsy -
she had no insurance.

129
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:07,164
She never saw the sunrise.

130
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,324
Nor did that man who denied her.

131
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,684
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

132
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,404
Can you keep a secret?

133
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:32,044
I know, brother.

134
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:43,764
I know.

135
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,524
I know.

136
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,684
I stole your keys.

137
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,044
Tuberculoma.

138
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,604
In your brain.

139
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,284
Yeah.

140
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,284
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

141
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,964
Fuck you, Tommy.

142
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:16,644
I don't need anyone to know,
Arthur.

143
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,764
No, you don't, do you?

144
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:22,020
You don't need anything, do you?

145
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,364
No, I don't need anything.

146
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,484
I don't need anything.

147
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:28,124
How long have we been dead for,
eh?

148
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:30,084
You and me, how long?

149
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,964
At least now
I'll have a certificate.

150
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,604
Wherever it is,

151
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,004
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

152
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:43,164
- Fuck's sake.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:46,564
All them bullets that missed.

154
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:49,044
It's funny, Arthur.

155
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,044
It's funny is what it is.

156
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,724
So don't you fucking weep.

157
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,284
Weep!

158
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:03,324
When everyone
is taken care of financially,

159
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,244
I will take myself away.
On my own.

160
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:11,284
I don't want anyone...

161
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,844
...anyone who may
or may not...

162
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,404
...love me...

163
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,444
...to have to see me crawl...

164
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,444
...or grow insane and helpless.

165
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:27,724
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

166
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:34,684
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

167
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,164
What about Lizzie?

168
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:41,084
I have some papers
I need you to sign

169
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:42,484
on behalf of the company.

170
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:44,924
Told Lizzie?

171
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,804
I'm working
with the housing minister.

172
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,804
I will be allocating contracts,

173
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:52,284
construction contracts
worth £10 million.

174
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,124
You haven't told Lizzie?

175
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:55,964
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

176
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,700
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

177
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:00,484
Fuck you and your contracts!

178
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,644
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue

179
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,084
to earn money.

180
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,764
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing
it because it's a good thing.

181
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,084
- Building houses.
- Oh...

182
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,804
Yeah, for ordinary
working people...

183
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:14,564
Oh, yeah, good for you.
Fuckin'...

184
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:17,444
...in the interests
of a fairer future.

185
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:21,884
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

186
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,684
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

187
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,484
Oh, five fucking million?

188
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,964
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

189
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:33,684
And that will be my legacy.

190
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:36,004
Instead of me,
there will be money.

191
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,244
Because for most of the people

192
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:40,484
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

193
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:43,204
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

194
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:45,444
Is that all you think you are,
eh?

195
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,604
Hmm?

196
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,444
Stand up.

197
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,484
You heard me.

198
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:56,644
Stand up.

199
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:58,764
On your feet.

200
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,604
- On your fucking feet.
- Arthur...

201
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:04,004
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.

202
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,804
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

203
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:10,324
No!

204
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:12,484
No.

205
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,924
You hear me?

206
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,044
Enough.

207
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:19,644
Enough!

208
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:28,244
Now you know.

209
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,204
You tell no-one else...

210
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,004
...until I am gone.

211
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:36,684
Until you're gone, yeah?

212
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,604
When the time comes,
I'll call you.

213
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,084
I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

214
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,604
Fuck your wagon!

215
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,044
You light the flame.

216
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:56,724
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

217
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,604
Get drunk.

218
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:01,564
Rake the ashes
for silver and gold.

219
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:03,324
Fuck you!

220
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,204
And your fucking plans!

221
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:23,804
That time,
I did let you fucking win.

222
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:32,764
John...

223
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:38,244
Fuckin' you, John.

224
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:44,004
Fuckin' both of you.

225
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,804
Arthur...

226
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,244
Arthur.

227
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,404
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

228
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,684
Come here.

229
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,244
Come here.

230
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,204
Come here.

231
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:00,644
Let me see your eyes.

232
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,404
I'm clean, man.

233
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:06,084
The dragon's fucking gone.

234
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:10,004
Thanks to you. Fucking...
Fucking thanks to you.

235
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:38,524
You all right?

236
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:39,924
Come on.

237
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:42,244
Fucking...

238
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:44,164
Hey, I'm still fucking here.

239
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,724
Pull yourself together, come on.

240
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,044
We have work to do.

241
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:50,164
Come on!

242
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:16,844
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

243
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,524
Yes. We want Billy.

244
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,364
Sit down, Billy.

245
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,804
Thank you for inviting me,
Mr Shelby.

246
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:32,644
Good to see you again, Billy.

247
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:43,404
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

248
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,004
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about it.

249
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,884
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

250
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,524
Now, we are all gathered...

251
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,044
...and those...

252
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,804
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

253
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,884
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn it.

254
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,204
I heard "tachipen".

255
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,244
Truth.

256
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:26,884
You said something
about the truth.

257
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,884
Truth. The truth is...

258
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,564
...I called men here
that I can trust...

259
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,524
...because
I will be going away.

260
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:39,124
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

261
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,084
which left Liverpool
ten days ago.

262
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,004
Payment from who?

263
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:45,564
South Boston Irish, Finn.

264
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,844
Bootleggers.

265
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:51,684
Are you going alone?

266
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,404
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

267
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,724
Michael will be there.

268
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,244
Michael is family.

269
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:02,844
Michael will be my guarantee
of safety.

270
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:06,204
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

271
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,724
I need you to go to Arrow House.

272
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:10,364
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good.

273
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:13,484
And there are things
that need removing.

274
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:15,604
I need men that I can trust.

275
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,084
There is cash,
there are valuables.

276
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:19,964
There is information
about important people

277
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:22,004
that has more value than gold.

278
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:27,044
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

279
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,524
which need digging up

280
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:30,484
before the contractors
start moving earth.

281
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:32,844
Isiah, you will be in charge.

282
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,284
In Arrow House,
there is a wine cellar.

283
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:38,284
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

284
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:41,084
that are worth more than
a man's life.

285
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:44,204
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

286
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,844
...be like a farewell party.

287
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:49,204
Are you ready for the party,
son?

288
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,964
Tachipen.

289
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,644
The fucking truth again.

290
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:00,404
What truth?

291
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:02,044
You'll need shovels,
you'll need boxes,

292
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:04,324
and you'll take the bones
to Mr Patches

293
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,964
to put in the furnace
at Greenham's.

294
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,004
Got it?

295
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:10,844
Right. Any questions?

296
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,404
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

297
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,044
No, Billy.

298
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,764
All the fun will be laid on
for you.

299
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,844
So, when is the party, Tom?

300
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:28,484
Mr Shelby.

301
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,884
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

302
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,484
You mean this Sunday?

303
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,324
Yeah.

304
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,444
And while you're
digging fucking holes,

305
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:43,404
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

306
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,564
It's our wedding anniversary.

307
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,804
Right.

308
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,084
Oh, and Finn,

309
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,804
by the way,

310
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:53,444
please explain to, erm,
what's her name?

311
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,844
- Mary.
- Mary?

312
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,324
- Yes.
- Is it Mary?

313
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:00,004
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

314
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,764
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

315
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,764
Have a look - Shelby.

316
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:04,924
Look.

317
00:20:05,044 --> 00:20:08,124
This means you own the watch,

318
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:09,964
the watch doesn't own you.

319
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,044
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

320
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:14,724
Have a whiskey.

321
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:17,924
Enjoy the party, boys.

322
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:35,764
Want a drink, baby?

323
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,124
No.

324
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:39,444
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

325
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,124
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

326
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,284
Leave it.

327
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,284
Yeah?

328
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:13,004
Good.

329
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:15,084
That's good.

330
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:18,404
Look, I've got to go.

331
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,244
Good news, Michael.

332
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,444
Listen.

333
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,964
That was our informant
in Birmingham.

334
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,964
The Shelby men will
all be together on Sunday.

335
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,884
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

336
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,844
at the bar
of the Garrison Tavern.

337
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,244
As I recall,

338
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:46,444
the Shelby table is right next
to the windows, correct?

339
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:48,124
Every table's a Shelby table.

340
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:49,604
Yes, but...

341
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:54,164
...maybe our people could just
drive by and...

342
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,564
...shoot Arthur
through the glass

343
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:57,324
without even getting
out of the car.

344
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:01,444
Michael...

345
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:04,964
...we've talked about this -
there's no other choice.

346
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:07,604
This business is between me
and Tommy.

347
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:11,164
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

348
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:13,084
Arthur will come after you.

349
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,844
He has to die, too.

350
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:20,804
If Arthur's in a bar,
he'll be drunk.

351
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:23,564
Or worse.

352
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:26,564
At least he'll die without pain.

353
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,124
Who'll do the killing?

354
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:39,924
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

355
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:42,124
Connor has connections.

356
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,564
They made a deal.

357
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:48,244
A favour in return for guns.

358
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,244
But, Michael...

359
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,084
...whilst the assassin's
in this city...

360
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,044
...Tommy has a son.

361
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:00,124
He's a kid.

362
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,604
Kids grow up.

363
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,564
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

364
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:09,924
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

365
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,644
Do you want
a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

366
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,524
I know about the new boy.

367
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,324
I've decided that
the illegitimate son

368
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,404
is not a threat. My decision.

369
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:24,444
Only Arthur.

370
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,804
Michael, baby...

371
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,524
...everything's been agreed.

372
00:23:34,004 --> 00:23:36,124
Everybody wants the same things.

373
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:42,804
How many men do you think
they killed with bullets

374
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:44,484
and blades?

375
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,724
That's how Tommy became king.

376
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:50,644
And in three days' time...

377
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,644
...that's how
you will become king.

378
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:59,964
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead anyway.

379
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,484
On Sunday, we'll just...

380
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,004
...give them what they want.

381
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,724
Oswald was called away.
He sent me instead.

382
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:42,084
Actually, that's not true.

383
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:44,324
I sent Oswald away
and elected myself

384
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:45,844
to be his representative.

385
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,724
What was it you wanted?

386
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,164
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill

387
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,884
before Parliament.

388
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:55,924
You'll need to start drawing up
a list

389
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,724
of all your land-owning
families with gambling debts,

390
00:24:58,844 --> 00:24:59,964
drug addictions,

391
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,084
any other drain
on their resources.

392
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:05,084
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

393
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,884
using Treasury bonds.

394
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,644
Thomas, why don't we fuck here,

395
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,164
on these benches?

396
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:12,604
Right now.

397
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:16,364
We wouldn't be the first.

398
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:20,044
I hear your wife left you.

399
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,964
Over the last few months,

400
00:25:30,084 --> 00:25:32,844
I've had some associates
of mine...

401
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,444
...break into
some of your pals' houses.

402
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,084
They stole paperwork.

403
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,084
Letters, bills,
bank statements...

404
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:43,204
Are you not upset?

405
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:50,444
This is a list
of all land-owning families

406
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:52,084
facing foreclosure.

407
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,324
And to answer your question...

408
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:03,924
...no.

409
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:08,924
No, I'm not upset that
my wife left me.

410
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:13,764
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

411
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:15,444
But you'll have
to cross the floor

412
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:18,004
cos I refuse to fuck
on Tory benches.

413
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:35,124
Mr Shelby...

414
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:39,684
...I was going to have
this delivered to you,

415
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:42,364
but I decided to bring it
in person.

416
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:48,324
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

417
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:50,524
It's in Berlin.

418
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:53,164
We are going to get married

419
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,964
in the presence
of the Führer himself.

420
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:02,284
Were you having fun?

421
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,724
Making paper aeroplanes.

422
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:07,644
I'm afraid, er...

423
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:10,724
...I have business.
I will be in Canada.

424
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:14,644
Pity.

425
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:21,164
Oh, and, er...

426
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:25,804
...the other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

427
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,484
was to tell you that,
after our wedding,

428
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,444
you must understand,
Mr Shelby...

429
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:34,044
...that if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

430
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:35,844
I will have you killed.

431
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,924
Come, Diana.

432
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,204
Just think...

433
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,524
...very soon, crumbling
old institutions like this one

434
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:50,844
will be swept away

435
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:53,044
and become a thing
of ancient memory.

436
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,324
Fly safe.

437
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,204
Be careful with this baby.

438
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:11,804
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

439
00:29:30,284 --> 00:29:33,164
Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

440
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:36,324
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

441
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:37,620
We are hearing so many rumours

442
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,084
about what is happening
to the house.

443
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:43,004
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is,

444
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,684
you don't ask questions.

445
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,804
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

446
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,924
OK, let's find
these bottles of wine

447
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,644
worth more than a man's life.

448
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:52,884
There's only one guest here.

449
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,484
The rest of the rooms are free

450
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,564
if you want to use them
while you wait.

451
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:59,644
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

452
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,684
There was a storm last night.

453
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:05,004
Last of a hurricane.
Boats all came in.

454
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:08,844
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

455
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,084
Then your friend is dead.

456
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,404
Wind was like...

457
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,604
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

458
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:20,444
My name is not fucking Mickey,

459
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:23,084
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

460
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:28,764
Another one.

461
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,044
<i>There will be a war...</i>

462
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,204
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

463
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:48,484
Which one I cannot tell.

464
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:50,444
<i>You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.</i>

465
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,804
<i>Where the fuck were you?</i>

466
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:56,324
<i>She's gone Tommy.
She's gone.</i>

467
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:59,444
<i>The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.</i>

468
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,484
<i>Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.</i>

469
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:05,564
<i>How long?</i>

470
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,124
<i>Perhaps 18 months.</i>

471
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,564
<i>I will change.
And change for good.</i>

472
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,764
<i>What is this good
that you have become?</i>

473
00:32:11,884 --> 00:32:13,444
<i>Kill...</i>

474
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,044
...and kill.

475
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:49,724
What's going on?

476
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:55,604
What the fuck is this?

477
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,724
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

478
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:59,164
It is now you're here.

479
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,004
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

480
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,764
In the kitchen.

481
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:05,044
All the booze is in the kitchen.

482
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:06,284
All right.

483
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:23,364
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

484
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,924
but God steps in and says,

485
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:29,124
"No, this is grievous,
mindless evil!"

486
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,564
Where is he, Jeremiah?

487
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:33,804
In heaven, looking down.

488
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:40,484
God tells us
that blood is given to him

489
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:41,764
from us.

490
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:44,764
Why don't you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

491
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,764
Well, there's no longer
any power

492
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:48,404
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

493
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,604
Why not?
What do you mean?

494
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,804
What happened?

495
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,484
I thought there were
gonna be girls here.

496
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:55,604
Who need girls

497
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:57,124
when you're in a house
bound for hell?

498
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,564
Fuck d'ya mean?

499
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,604
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

500
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:14,524
Fuck!

501
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,004
Fuck!

502
00:34:16,124 --> 00:34:18,564
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

503
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,364
It's got a death sentence.

504
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:26,564
I don't want a drink.

505
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,884
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

506
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,564
- Billy?
- Yeah?

507
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:33,444
Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

508
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:35,284
before you start digging them
back up.

509
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:38,364
What the fuck does that mean?

510
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,764
I'm a fucking Shelby.

511
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:44,604
So am I.

512
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,084
He's here.

513
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:53,044
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

514
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:54,684
Charge is set to blow
in 30 minutes.

515
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:56,764
That's at exactly 16.20.

516
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:57,924
Everybody got that?

517
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:03,604
I'll do it.

518
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:07,284
This is between me and Tommy.

519
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:09,084
I'll do it with my own hand.

520
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:12,324
I'll come with you.

521
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:20,244
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

522
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:36,364
Easy.

523
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,684
It's just a pity
you didn't have the guts

524
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,804
to shoot him face to face.

525
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:49,684
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

526
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:52,844
She always said
it won't be a bullet

527
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:54,324
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

528
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:01,524
Hey, lads.

529
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:03,324
Over by the bridge.

530
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:05,644
Big, big fish.

531
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:07,684
Poisson. Grande.

532
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,244
Go on.

533
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,284
Take the gun, Finn.

534
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,124
Arthur says if you don't do it,

535
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,284
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

536
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:24,564
What the fuck do <i>you</i> know
about family?

537
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,684
You're not family.

538
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,124
You're the son
of a fucking whore!

539
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:35,124
Just take the gun and do it,
Finn.

540
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:37,564
Take the fucking gun.

541
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,684
Now you have the gun, Finn,

542
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,044
you have the gun.

543
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:51,684
Use it on these fucks!

544
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,564
Argh!

545
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,964
Charlie Strong told me,

546
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,564
"When you give Finn the gun,

547
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:13,444
"make sure the first two
chambers are empty."

548
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:16,924
Good old Uncle Charlie.

549
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:41,444
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

550
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:46,844
By order of
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

551
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,964
I will come for you.

552
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:53,164
I will fucking come for you!

553
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:42,804
...That find me faulting them

554
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:46,444
who govern like dogs
in Garrison Lane.

555
00:40:46,564 --> 00:40:48,964
Hear this, then came Jesus forth

556
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:51,164
wearing the crown of thorns

557
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:52,844
and the purple robe,

558
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:56,524
and Pilate said,
"Behold the man,

559
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:57,884
"he is the man."

560
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:00,564
Not the Peaky Blinders,

561
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:04,524
we see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their...

562
00:41:12,524 --> 00:41:13,964
Hmm.

563
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,684
Order your man to drop it.

564
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:27,084
Order him.

565
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,684
Empty the fucking gun.
Tell him.

566
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,524
You all right, Charlie?

567
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:39,084
All good here, Arthur.

568
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:41,204
Let's move.

569
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:45,204
Take you out to the street
cos I don't wanna spoil my pub.

570
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:58,044
You'd shoot us like dogs?

571
00:42:58,164 --> 00:43:02,084
No. I don't shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

572
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:57,324
Fuck! Fuck!

573
00:45:05,164 --> 00:45:06,604
Fuck!

574
00:46:19,964 --> 00:46:21,364
Oh, Lord!

575
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:26,364
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

576
00:47:02,964 --> 00:47:05,804
Kids, no, come here.

577
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,084
I said, come here!

578
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:09,244
What have I told you
about running off?

579
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:12,444
Don't pick up things. Don't.

580
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:13,844
Come here, come on.

581
00:47:20,564 --> 00:47:23,084
Emily! Emily, come on.

582
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:24,484
If you get lost in the fog,

583
00:47:24,604 --> 00:47:26,284
the Peaky Blinders will get you.

584
00:47:29,124 --> 00:47:30,444
Jeremiah.

585
00:47:31,844 --> 00:47:35,764
Let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

586
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:53,564
Fuck!

587
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:58,204
Fuck!

588
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:09,924
Come here.

589
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:12,684
Shh... Shh...

590
00:49:14,564 --> 00:49:17,364
Breathe. Breathe.

591
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:26,044
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

592
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:30,444
She was my Aunt Polly.

593
00:49:32,284 --> 00:49:33,724
My Aunt Polly.

594
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:38,284
Vengeance is for the...

595
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:45,924
Not in Small Heath, it ain't.

596
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,804
Rest in peace, Pol.

597
00:50:24,924 --> 00:50:27,084
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

598
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:28,564
We're still in France.

599
00:51:10,844 --> 00:51:12,324
OK.

600
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:15,444
I see him coming out of the fog.

601
00:51:36,684 --> 00:51:37,764
How was the flight?

602
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:42,044
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

603
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:43,604
Whiskey.

604
00:51:45,884 --> 00:51:48,004
Hello, Michael.

605
00:51:49,444 --> 00:51:50,524
Tommy.

606
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,324
Give me another.

607
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:05,524
We want you to take us

608
00:52:05,564 --> 00:52:07,324
to where the opium
is being stored.

609
00:52:08,804 --> 00:52:11,324
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

610
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:13,044
for the full amount.

611
00:52:14,444 --> 00:52:15,524
$5 million.

612
00:52:17,524 --> 00:52:18,924
$5 million.

613
00:52:19,964 --> 00:52:20,964
Let's go.

614
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:30,404
I'll go with Tommy.

615
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:31,924
You boys follow behind.

616
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:42,204
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

617
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:36,524
Mum...

618
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:40,884
...it's done.

619
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:45,164
It's over.

620
00:54:47,764 --> 00:54:49,444
And may God forgive me.

621
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:27,244
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

622
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,604
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

623
00:55:35,844 --> 00:55:38,244
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

624
00:55:49,444 --> 00:55:51,204
Goodbye, Michael.

625
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:52,724
Goodbye, Johnny.

626
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:56,564
You're a good man.

627
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:03,724
I'm gonna go look at the fog,
Tom.

628
00:56:09,484 --> 00:56:11,164
Speak to me.

629
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,244
Speak to me, Michael.

630
00:56:17,804 --> 00:56:19,004
You killed her.

631
00:56:19,124 --> 00:56:20,524
Polly made her own choices,

632
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:21,804
- Michael.
- No...

633
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,244
No-one close to you

634
00:56:24,364 --> 00:56:26,564
makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

635
00:56:28,644 --> 00:56:30,164
Not Arthur,

636
00:56:30,284 --> 00:56:33,244
not me, not Ada.

637
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:37,844
We can't escape you.

638
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:42,524
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

639
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:48,764
Polly was half of me.

640
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:52,084
Still visits me in my dreams.

641
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,084
She'll visit me no more.

642
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,444
I have no limitations.

643
00:58:17,004 --> 00:58:19,844
I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

644
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:22,044
Oh, yes, hello.

645
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:25,364
I also smell
the smell of tobacco,

646
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:27,044
which is forbidden
in my presence

647
00:58:27,164 --> 00:58:28,324
for all except for one -

648
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:30,404
my new wife, Edna.

649
00:58:31,764 --> 00:58:34,804
With the Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

650
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:37,964
I now own half of Boston, so...

651
00:58:38,084 --> 00:58:42,524
...out of respect
for my restored authority...

652
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:46,724
...put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

653
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:50,284
Hello, Alfie.

654
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:51,804
I heard it was a good wedding.

655
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,004
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

656
00:58:54,124 --> 00:58:56,484
Edna's from a family circus.

657
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:59,124
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

658
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:03,284
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

659
00:59:03,404 --> 00:59:04,724
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

660
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:06,964
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

661
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:09,244
and even the Gentile
what normally fucking hate me,

662
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:11,124
they waved with their hankies.

663
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:14,404
Justice.

664
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:20,684
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

665
00:59:20,804 --> 00:59:22,724
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

666
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:25,204
he's ascending to the heavens!

667
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:27,644
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

668
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,844
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

669
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:32,124
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

670
00:59:32,244 --> 00:59:33,804
Dead men can see through life

671
00:59:33,924 --> 00:59:35,724
like it was a curtain
that billows

672
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:37,444
with the flicker of truth
upon it.

673
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:39,724
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

674
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:43,044
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

675
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,604
Unlike you,

676
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:47,844
who, on Judgment Day,

677
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:49,724
is probably truly fucked

678
00:59:49,844 --> 00:59:51,804
when the other shoe drops.

679
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:53,324
Hmm?

680
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:58,604
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

681
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:02,204
You know, Alfie...

682
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:06,564
...so many people,

683
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:08,724
so many times

684
01:00:08,844 --> 01:00:10,564
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

685
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:13,324
I'm fucking dying anyway.

686
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,244
We're all dying anyway.

687
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:17,524
No.

688
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,684
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

689
01:00:20,804 --> 01:00:22,684
not a knife.

690
01:00:22,804 --> 01:00:24,964
Is it clap? Is it clap?

691
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:27,764
No, not even that noble.

692
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:29,940
What are you trying to say?

693
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:33,004
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

694
01:00:33,124 --> 01:00:34,244
to you as part of this deal.

695
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,244
Are you saying you're
just gonna die in your bed?

696
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:41,164
I'm not gonna die in bed,
Alfie. Who fucking dies in bed?

697
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:43,964
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

698
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:45,524
- Good people, eh?
- Hmm.

699
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:48,524
Good people.

700
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:50,404
And yet here we are, Alfie.

701
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:53,764
After all this time,
just you and me.

702
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,084
And I crossed the line.

703
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:02,924
Michael.

704
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:06,484
Polly.

705
01:01:08,724 --> 01:01:10,484
Ruby.

706
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:18,764
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

707
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,044
you might be better served
expressing it

708
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:23,684
to someone who gives a fuck

709
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:26,924
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

710
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:28,884
to pretend to have to.

711
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:33,164
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

712
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,644
And as for death,

713
01:01:37,764 --> 01:01:40,084
speaking as someone
who has been dead

714
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:42,324
for a number of years,

715
01:01:42,444 --> 01:01:44,364
I can only
heartily recommend it.

716
01:01:45,884 --> 01:01:50,244
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

717
01:01:56,964 --> 01:02:00,244
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

718
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:47,484
Whenever you're ready, boys.

719
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,204
That's enough.

720
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:35,124
Thank you all for coming.

721
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:39,084
Well, at least I can say that,
er...

722
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:42,404
...I am one of those
rare politicians

723
01:03:42,524 --> 01:03:44,204
who actually makes good
on his promises.

724
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:48,364
Country estate -

725
01:03:48,484 --> 01:03:52,684
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

726
01:03:52,804 --> 01:03:55,844
I improved my own home
with good intentions

727
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:58,524
and 1,500 lb of dynamite.

728
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:05,004
Now I'm back where we began...

729
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:08,364
...with horses and caravans...

730
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:12,764
...vagabonds and thieves.

731
01:04:16,284 --> 01:04:18,364
Frances, sit down, please.

732
01:04:27,804 --> 01:04:29,244
I'd like to raise a toast.

733
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:32,164
A simple toast.

734
01:04:35,564 --> 01:04:36,884
To family.

735
01:04:37,004 --> 01:04:38,604
- To family.
- To family.

736
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:42,924
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

737
01:04:44,684 --> 01:04:46,564
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

738
01:04:57,924 --> 01:05:00,284
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

739
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,044
After I'm gone...

740
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,524
Ada.

741
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,124
...in this family...

742
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,844
...it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

743
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:16,924
Remember that.

744
01:05:18,404 --> 01:05:20,844
And if ever a seat
is to become available

745
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,284
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

746
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:25,924
Where's Arthur?

747
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:29,204
He went for a walk
down the river.

748
01:05:29,324 --> 01:05:31,484
He said he's not good
at farewells

749
01:05:31,604 --> 01:05:34,084
so he's decided to go
and catch a trout instead.

750
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:39,204
He told me to tell you that...

751
01:05:41,524 --> 01:05:44,524
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

752
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:48,324
"...very soon. Love, Arthur."

753
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,644
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

754
01:06:00,004 --> 01:06:02,644
You watch him, Linda.

755
01:06:02,764 --> 01:06:04,644
You love him.

756
01:06:08,684 --> 01:06:09,724
Charles...

757
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,724
...I want you
to look after your mum.

758
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:16,004
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

759
01:06:21,884 --> 01:06:23,404
I want you to be the bes...

760
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,724
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

761
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:43,804
Thanks, Curly.

762
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,204
I want you to be...

763
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,764
Tom, the horse.

764
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,484
Shut up, Curly.

765
01:07:11,604 --> 01:07:12,724
Is she hitched, Johnny?

766
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:17,524
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

767
01:07:18,644 --> 01:07:21,124
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

768
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:22,724
Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

769
01:07:22,844 --> 01:07:24,004
You always come to me.

770
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,404
Not this time.
Not this one, sister.

771
01:07:26,524 --> 01:07:29,604
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

772
01:07:31,324 --> 01:07:32,484
Tommy!

773
01:11:44,324 --> 01:11:48,724
In the bleak midwinter...

774
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:54,084
<i>Dad, come out, come out!</i>

775
01:11:55,364 --> 01:11:56,444
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

776
01:12:11,004 --> 01:12:12,604
Did Polly send you?

777
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:15,644
Did Polly send you?

778
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:18,244
Or am I dead already?

779
01:12:18,364 --> 01:12:19,604
<i>No.</i>

780
01:12:21,924 --> 01:12:23,084
<i>You're not dead.</i>

781
01:12:24,324 --> 01:12:26,404
<i>You're not even sick.</i>

782
01:12:26,524 --> 01:12:27,964
But I am, my darling.

783
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:30,964
I am sick.

784
01:12:32,564 --> 01:12:33,884
Sick like you was.

785
01:12:34,004 --> 01:12:36,084
<i>No. Not true.</i>

786
01:12:36,204 --> 01:12:38,524
<i>I know it.
You've got to live, Daddy.</i>

787
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,764
<i>You let the fire go out.</i>

788
01:12:45,884 --> 01:12:48,404
Light the fire again
and get warm,

789
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:51,644
and you will see
that you must live.

790
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:56,644
<i>You're not even sick, Daddy.</i>

791
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:35,204
Fucking Gypsies.

792
01:14:43,364 --> 01:14:45,564
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

793
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:47,324
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir,

794
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:48,524
but there was no-one there.

795
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:49,900
Well, go back up there
and set fire

796
01:14:49,924 --> 01:14:50,964
to the fucking thing.

797
01:14:51,084 --> 01:14:53,004
Yes, sir.

798
01:14:58,724 --> 01:15:00,604
Have you filled the car
with petrol?

799
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,844
I said, have you filled the car
up with petrol?

800
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:16,564
How was the wedding in Berlin?

801
01:15:19,884 --> 01:15:22,484
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

802
01:15:25,044 --> 01:15:28,204
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

803
01:15:29,884 --> 01:15:32,284
Never knew you were
so well connected.

804
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:34,724
Oh, and the doctor
at St Thomas's

805
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:36,804
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

806
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:38,364
second set of X-rays?

807
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:41,444
A maid of honour
at the same wedding.

808
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,484
All so very well
fucking connected.

809
01:15:46,684 --> 01:15:48,364
On your knees, Holford.

810
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:56,924
I'm guessing you people
all decided

811
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,284
that the only person

812
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,164
who could ever kill
Tommy Shelby...

813
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,284
...is Tommy Shelby himself.

814
01:16:07,724 --> 01:16:10,044
You made me believe
death was coming.

815
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:12,644
Let my nature do the rest, eh?

816
01:16:17,684 --> 01:16:20,204
You may not have tuberculoma,
Mr Shelby...

817
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:22,644
...but you are sick.

818
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:25,284
I know you.

819
01:16:26,844 --> 01:16:28,844
You are sick with guilt.

820
01:16:30,644 --> 01:16:33,604
Sick of death at your own hand.

821
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:36,564
Sick of who you were.

822
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:41,404
You are no longer
the kind of man

823
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:43,884
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

824
01:16:49,684 --> 01:16:53,844
Tommy, you have been
on a journey,

825
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:56,924
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

826
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:01,204
You cannot go back.

827
01:17:03,044 --> 01:17:04,364
You are a different man.

828
01:17:06,484 --> 01:17:08,644
The gun no longer belongs
in your hand.

829
01:17:15,404 --> 01:17:16,964
Oh, but I am back.

830
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:22,564
Back from under the ground.

831
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:25,444
Close your eyes.

832
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:30,444
Close your eyes.

833
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:54,844
The eleventh hour.

834
01:17:57,244 --> 01:17:58,324
Armistice.

835
01:18:01,204 --> 01:18:02,764
Peace at last.

836
01:18:06,204 --> 01:18:07,604
Peace at last.
