1
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,636
You want me to open the doors?

2
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,954
Here. The keys. Take them.

3
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,196
Why you talking?

4
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,189
No! No, no, no -

5
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,234
Gambling destroyed my life.

6
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,917
Me, my family, everything I loved.

7
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,948
It was like a robbery, only I was the thief.

8
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,875
It's amazing the stories you tell yourself to justify it.

9
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,394
The lies that lead you to just one more hand, one more spin...

10
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,398
...one more roll of the dice.

11
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,038
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.

12
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,595
You guys are not lifting a finger. I mean it.

13
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,356
Yeah, we're bringing everything.
So - This is not up for debate, okay?

14
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,033
Great.

15
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,750
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not
gonna say one word about the bills.

16
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,076
We just wanna bring everyone up to speed.

17
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,078
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

18
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,679
So...

19
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,989
Tonight's the night. No turning back.

20
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,873
Well...

21
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,913
Okay. Let's do this.

22
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,198
Okay. So first, I assign point values.

23
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,595
Correlate to the effect of removal.

24
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,037
- You're gonna split the eights?
- Skyler, please.

25
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,592
Now, the mathematical principle known as the Kelly Criterion...

26
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,870
...upon which I devised my own strategy -

27
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,991
Not dissimilar to the MIT system -

28
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,430
Walt, you're not teaching them.

29
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,911
- You wanted me to be thorough.
- Play. You're taking too long.

30
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,516
You don't think it behoves me to be able to explain any of this?

31
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,111
It behoves you to be a pro, that's all.
That's the fiction. So, chop-chop.

32
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,913
Don't chop-chop me.

33
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,678
Now, we both know that the first decision...

34
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,673
...is whether or not to split or to surrender.

35
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,956
On eights. Split them.

36
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,919
Good on both.

37
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,799
Next decision is whether to double down or not.

38
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,077
- Which you should be doing.
- On an 11, yes. Double.

39
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,437
Okay, this hand over here, we have a soft 18.

40
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,713
The final decision is whether or not to hit or to stand. Hit it.

41
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,275
- Becomes a hard 15.
- Dealer has a nine.

42
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,993
I see that.

43
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,755
Hit it.

44
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,559
Okay, let's see what I got.

45
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,991
And 21.

46
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,355
- Damn.
- Yup.

47
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,315
Okay, the key thing to remember here
is that it's not about any one hand.

48
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,597
The key is the number of hands per hour.

49
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,838
Let's go again.

50
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,870
Zero, minus one, 0.6.

51
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,196
Okay.

52
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,553
- Walt.
- It's not as if I don't know how to play.

53
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,953
I certainly more than understand how to count cards.

54
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,394
Let's just keep going.

55
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,359
No, you know what? I'm in recovery, remember?

56
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,318
I shouldn't even be playing.

57
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,235
And that is the fiction that we should be sticking to.

58
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,959
You know what?

59
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,037
You're right. Yeah.

60
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,070
Okay. We're not leaving anything to chance.

61
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,512
All right. Let's get started. Got a lot of...

62
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,271
- Walt. We got a lot of ground to cover.
- What is this?

63
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,950
We have to get our story straight.
We've gotta be on the same page.

64
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,838
- A script?
- Bullet points.

65
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,838
Bullet points? We got a novella.

66
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,192
This is smart. You really wanna try to sell a DEA agent some...

67
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,789
...full-of-holes story about how we suddenly...

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,956
...have enough money to buy a car wash?

69
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,913
- Am I supposed to memorise this?
- We need to practise.

70
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,350
- We need to be word-perfect.
- Within reason.

71
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,278
We need this story to be solid...

72
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,597
...and sympathetic and, most of all, completely believable.

73
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,796
The story that you already told Marie.

74
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,036
You think that she hasn't told Hank?

75
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,714
Come on, this is Marie we're talking about here.

76
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,032
No, she hasn't. She hasn't.

77
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,834
Hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything.

78
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,952
Marie's not telling him we are paying his therapy bills.

79
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,390
- And neither are we.
- And why is that again?

80
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,553
- Really?
- If we have the gambling story...?

81
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,195
Did you take money, Walt? You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

82
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,551
I seem to recall that you'd rather sell drugs than take help.

83
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,394
- Fine.
- Marie will tell Hank in her own time.

84
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,830
And at least we'll have laid the groundwork.

85
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,833
And coming clean with Hank and Juni -

86
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,999
Appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone.

87
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,519
We talked about this.

88
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,111
- Okay? We agreed about this.
- Yes, we did. It's just...

89
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,313
What?

90
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,957
Never mind. Just -

91
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,988
Okay. So I really think we should tag team the narrative, okay?

92
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,990
We'll each be responsible for certain
portions of the story and then we can -

93
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,113
We can hand off so we don't leave anything out,
and it'll seem natural.

94
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,153
Okay. So I'm gonna launch with the exciting news...

95
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,875
...that we are buying a car wash.

96
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,393
The next logical question Hank will probably ask is:

97
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,831
"Where are you getting the money?" To which I'll say:

98
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,833
We wanna tell you the whole story. It's a doozy...

99
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,998
...so hold onto your hats.

100
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,358
Do you like that?

101
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,159
Sure.

102
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,554
It accomplishes two things.
It keeps it light while letting them know...

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,910
...to expect something big.

104
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,634
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

105
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,112
Okay. Anyway, that's where you will take over,
starting with your diagnosis.

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,550
Pages one and two. Okay. And it's -

107
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,588
It's pretty much gonna run parallel
to the truth, which makes it easier.

108
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,675
But just make sure to really hit the cancer.

109
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,871
Really touch on the fear and despair.

110
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,839
It's good to remind them and to get their sympathy.

111
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,878
We want them to understand why you could do something so stupid.

112
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,155
Now, after that, per pages three and four, after you say:

113
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,597
"Gambling became an addiction and I just couldn't control it."

114
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,153
- Do you see that?
- Yes.

115
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,549
In the middle. Okay.

116
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,554
I put in that line about robbery,
from the GA meeting. That was good.

117
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,389
So next, I'll chime in about how it affected our marriage...

118
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,673
...starting with the confusion, the deceit,
why we couldn't tell anyone -

119
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,952
I'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.

120
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,310
- Yeah.
- Two "terribly"s?

121
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,791
- It's to show contrition.
- Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

122
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,719
I would never say the word "terribly."

123
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,509
Phrase it however you want. Okay? You're jumping ahead. Now -

124
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,877
And why-? And why am I so ashamed?

125
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,911
Do I really need to answer that?

126
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,790
I was, and am, providing for our family.

127
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,193
- Let's just pick up where we left off.
- I'm weak, I'm out of control.

128
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,879
This makes me look like crap.

129
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,594
This has to be a warts-and-all story.

130
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,274
That's how we'll sell it. We both look bad.

131
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,152
How do you look bad exactly?

132
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,119
Where is the "I slept with my boss" bullet point?

133
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,237
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

134
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,598
For a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth...

135
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,189
...I'd say you're coming out pretty much ahead.

136
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,591
I don't like it. I don't want Junior thinking less of me.

137
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,595
At least you won at gambling.
I'm the bitch mom who wouldn't cut you slack.

138
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,118
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,919
I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.

140
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,191
How's that sound?

141
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,078
Two "sorry"s.

142
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,910
I believe we were on page five.

143
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,314
So after you say how very sorry you are,
in your own words, of course...

144
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,919
...we're almost to the end.

145
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,113
And then I say how proud I am of you
for joining a 12-step programme.

146
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,678
And this is where I think we should
enact how we're feeling, you know?

147
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,319
Just a suggestion. You might look down at the floor with remorse.

148
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
What? You don't have to mean it.

149
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,508
You just stare down at your feet, Walt, okay?

150
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,676
Then I'm gonna...

151
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,914
I was thinking of taking Marie's hand
and saying something emotional like:

152
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,758
It's such a relief to tell you.

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
We're glad we have a strong family to help us.

154
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,193
That we can all support each other.
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

155
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,710
I don't know. We'll just have to see what happens in the moment.

156
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,952
You're gonna cry on cue?

157
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,038
- I said, I don't know. Maybe.
- When you dab your eyes...

158
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,959
...you gonna do it with your right hand or your left?

159
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,197
- One tear? Two tears? How many?
- This has to be convincing.

160
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,358
Especially to Hank. I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.

161
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,198
And yes, I'm thorough.

162
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,709
Maybe lying doesn't come as easily to me as it does to you.

163
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,279
- Guys! Come on in! Hi!
- Hey.

164
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,595
- Good to see you!
- Hey.

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,559
- Hey, you little punk! Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,478
- Great to see you.
- How you doing?

167
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,035
Look at my little princess. She's getting big.

168
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,118
- Yeah. And heavy too.
- Is that actual food I'm smelling?

169
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,276
I might get an honest-to-God meal here?

170
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,436
- You look good.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

171
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,592
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute, but she could burn water.

172
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,837
You are so hilarious. Show the boys your rock collection.

173
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,554
- We're gonna get organised.
- It'll be 20 minutes.

174
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,638
- You have a rock collection?
- It's a mineral collection.

175
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,831
Just something I've - You wanna see it?

176
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,036
- Sure.
- All right. Let's go see it.

177
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,317
- Oh, hey, let me -
- Hey, no. I-I got it.

178
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,596
Come on, guys. It's down the hall here.

179
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,037
Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
Okay? It's manganese inosilicate.

180
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,113
Cool. What makes it be all pink like that?

181
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,239
Well, that's the manganese part.
Okay? It oxidises, you know, like rust.

182
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,476
Manganese can have an oxidation state...

183
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,875
...of between minus-three and plus-seven...

184
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,470
...which takes it through a range of colours. Purple, green, blue.

185
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,275
But its most stable state is plus-two, which is usually pale pink.

186
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,633
So...

187
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,439
Exactly. Whatever the hell he said. Anyway, you get the idea.

188
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,033
Yeah, it's interesting. Interesting stuff, that. Really.

189
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,070
Oh, hey. Yeah, give me that.

190
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,158
Give me that file, will you? You gotta check this out.

191
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,070
I've been working on something here.
I'm doing a little consulting.

192
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,319
You know, weighing in on a case for A.P.D.

193
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,829
Put that in for me. Put that in over there.

194
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,429
Hank, what is this? It's not a dead body?

195
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,029
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing like that. No.

196
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,515
Seriously, you guys you gotta check this out.

197
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,632
This is good. Ready? Let me get it going here.

198
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,838
Look at this guy.

199
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,878
Look at -

200
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,836
Oh, man. You can't make this stuff up.

201
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,718
Who is this?

202
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,313
That, my friends, is Albuquerque's public enemy number one.

203
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,115
It's such a relief to finally tell you.

204
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,553
We're just so glad that we have a
strong family to help us through this.

205
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,069
That we can all support each other.

206
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,589
Jesus. I don't even know where to - Holy shit.

207
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,432
Yeah.

208
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,915
Walter H. White.

209
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,436
Man of hidden talents.

210
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,996
Dad, you're such a stud. How much did you win exactly?

211
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,751
- Dad?
- I don't think I have exact figures.

212
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,875
It's enough to- After taxes, of course, to buy the car wash.

213
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,233
Maybe even pay for...

214
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,392
...a couple of halfway reasonable college educations.

215
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,398
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

216
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,268
I can totally get a car for my birthday now, right?

217
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,398
Son, I'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.

218
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,399
Would you excuse me, please? I need to use the restroom.

219
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,438
Walt?

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,274
Hey!

221
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,029
Sorry.

222
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,637
- Thought you might have fallen in.
- No, no, I just...

223
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,071
Hey, man, that was some big stuff back there.

224
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,073
No, we wanted to be thorough, so...

225
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,032
Yeah, well, it was quite a tale.
Couldn't have been easy to, you know...

226
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,152
...talk about.

227
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,158
You know, Walt, if you...

228
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,831
You can always bend my ear, right? I mean,
if you ever need to talk...

229
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,318
...or just blow off some steam, I'm here.

230
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,671
Not going anywhere, so...

231
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,718
Thanks, Hank.

232
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,275
Same goes for me, you know.
If you ever wanna bounce anything off me...

233
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,119
...I don't know, casework, anything, really.

234
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,555
Sometimes just talking something through...

235
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,399
...you know, really can make a difference.

236
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,310
We're definitely not talking bathtub crank here.
This is a big-ass operation.

237
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,080
You know, hundreds of pounds a week. Maybe more.

238
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,077
So who is this person? What do you know about him?

239
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,754
Other than he's deader than a Texas salad bar...

240
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,678
...and has a decent set of pipes?

241
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,031
- I'd say he's my guy.
- Your guy?

242
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,229
There's this mystery man I've been
chasing for the better part of a year.

243
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,591
Cooks the purest meth that me or anyone else has ever seen.

244
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,388
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

245
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,628
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

246
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,710
I looked him up. It was one of these physic- One of Hitler's guys.

247
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,799
You know, a physicist named Werner Heisenberg. Real cute, huh?

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,675
I figure with a handle like that,
my guy's gotta be some sort of...

249
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,440
Some sort of an egghead. No offence.

250
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,031
And here we go. Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

251
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,874
Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm, you know...

252
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,197
...not barking up the wrong tree, chemically speaking.

253
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,748
As far as I can make out, he's writing
about a phenylacetone cook, right?

254
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,118
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's pretty rare these days...

255
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,357
...but it does jibe with the blue stuff I've been tracking.

256
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,270
"Two sticks dairy-free soy margarine,
two-third cup turbinado sugar."

257
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,999
It's a recipe for vegan s'mores.
There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.

258
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,879
Yeah, like, you know, top-ten recumbent bicycles...

259
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,593
...indoor composting tips.

260
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,914
All right next to the mother of methamphetamine syntheses.

261
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,631
This guy was a... Man, he was a real character.

262
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,877
Yeah, he seems unique.

263
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,588
Yeah. Let me show you something. Give it here.

264
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,598
Right here at the... Right here at the top it says:

265
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,955
"To W.W. My star, my perfect silence."

266
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,357
W.W.

267
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,150
I mean, who do you figure that is?

268
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,791
Woodrow Wilson?

269
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,996
Willy Wonka?

270
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,233
Walter White?

271
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,112
You got me.

272
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,950
W.W.

273
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,799
Wait a minute. Let me see this...

274
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,200
...for a second, because I think I remembered...

275
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,879
Here.

276
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,954
Yes.

277
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,069
Yeah.

278
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,635
"When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer."

279
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,159
Learned.

280
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,997
And from time to time Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

281
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,476
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

282
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,911
Your W.W.

283
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,830
You freaking brainiac.

284
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,553
You freaking brainiac.

285
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,317
I must have skipped that day in school or something.

286
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,398
I been chasing my tail about that one. Bet you're right.

287
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,433
- Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
- Yeah.

288
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,835
Walt Whitman.

289
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,514
So you think this Gale person is your Heisenberg?

290
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,796
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,592
God, I wanted to get this guy.

292
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,793
It looks like you did.

293
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,276
No, I mean, you know, me personally, you know?

294
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,439
I wanted to be the one to slap the
handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.

295
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,156
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.

296
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,599
If I recall, at least from the first French Connection...

297
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,190
...Popeye Doyle never actually caught him.

298
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,471
Yeah, I guess me and old Popeye, huh?

299
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,916
Day late and a dollar short.

300
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,752
- What about the person who killed him?
- A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.

301
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,598
- Any leads?
- My buddy Tim says...

302
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,394
...they got some fingerprints they're trying to ID.

303
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,637
Eyewitness saw a person of interest. Might get lucky there.

304
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,276
Somebody knows something. They'll track the shooter eventually.

305
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,158
Jesse.

306
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,919
Jesse.

307
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,473
What's up?

308
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,192
I need to talk to you.

309
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,913
Okay.

310
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,873
Now.

311
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,272
Go ahead.

312
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,516
Would you stop doing what you're doing, please?

313
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,957
I'm not done, yo. And that dude's next.

314
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,115
- What the hell? What is wrong-?
- We have business to discuss.

315
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,515
So discuss. Jesus.

316
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,039
Let go of me.

317
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,708
Gale's murder is being investigated.

318
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,598
And I have it on good authority that
they found fingerprints at the scene.

319
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,592
Not mine.

320
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,833
- We done here?
- No, we are not done here.

321
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,508
What if they are yours? How can you be so sure?

322
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,275
Because I'm here. Your brother-in-law's
got such a hard-on for me...

323
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,596
...if the cops found my fingerprints -

324
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,071
If the cops found my prints within five blocks of that place...

325
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,430
...they would've picked me up by now.

326
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,672
What about the casing?

327
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,791
- Oh, my God.
- Or casings?

328
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,713
How many times did you shoot him, anyway?

329
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,594
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?

330
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,195
Did you pick them up?

331
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,389
No.

332
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,358
Yeah, well...

333
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,516
Listen, we gotta go over this step-by-step, everything.

334
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,792
Tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there.

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,036
- I got in, I got out.
- No.

336
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,789
No, I need to know specifics. Now, we'll start from the beginning.

337
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,630
You drove there. You drove over there.
You went to his door, right?

338
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,152
Jesse, I need you to concentrate.

339
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,874
This is very important. Did you knock or ring?

340
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,395
Knock or ring?

341
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,068
Knock.

342
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,352
Good, good. That's very good. Now, listen.

343
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,871
Assume that Gale answered the door. What happened after that?

344
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,354
Did he recognise you?

345
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,596
Did you say anything to each other?

346
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,554
Did you walk into the room or did
you shoot him right then and there?

347
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,988
What?

348
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,275
- Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

349
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,352
Look, the kid's probably right.

350
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,149
If they had anything on him, he'd be locked up already.

351
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,828
What about my brother-in-law? He suspects Jess -

352
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,352
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved in the sale of blue meth.

353
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,510
That was Hank's one-and-only lead.
What if he puts two and two together...

354
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,870
...and he goes after Jesse for the murder?

355
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,072
Goes after him how, on his Rascal scooter?

356
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,633
That perhaps sounded insensitive.

357
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,793
But if he goes after him, I'll sue his ass for police brutality...

358
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,230
...harassment, assault and 16 other things.

359
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,796
No, history those two have together, being what it is...

360
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,073
...gotta figure your brother-in-law's
smart enough not to go down that road.

361
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,949
Goose egg. Bubkes. That's what the cops got.

362
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,151
I wouldn't worry about it.

363
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,318
Yeah, what else should I not worry about, Saul?

364
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,399
Should I not worry that Gus plans to
murder me at the first chance he gets?

365
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,071
That my drug-addicted partner doesn't
seem to care whether he lives or dies?

366
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,070
You should see his house. It's like skid row.

367
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,113
He has actual hobos living there.

368
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,636
Now, how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk?

369
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,595
Jeez, I got Mike, that grunting, dead-eyed cretin...

370
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,152
...sucker-punching me in the face.
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

371
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,911
I mean, Western Union, message received.

372
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,791
Let me ask you. When did this stop being a business?

373
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,676
Why am I the only person capable of
behaving in a professional manner?

374
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,232
No, any way you slice it, everyone is in danger.

375
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,879
I mean, how can I protect anyone?

376
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,640
My family, Jesse, myself?

377
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,228
My name never comes up with those guys, does it?

378
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,238
And meanwhile, we're buying this stupid car wash.

379
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,434
Oh, yeah. That ship has sailed, bon voyage.

380
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,393
We are committed. We already told our family about it.

381
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,398
And now Skyler, I'm sure she believes -

382
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,957
She needs to believe that everything is neat and tidy.

383
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,875
And she's telling herself that I work
in this nice, quiet little lab...

384
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,640
...with a white lab coat and a pocket protector...

385
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,196
...and when my contract is up, I'll just simply hang it all up...

386
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,311
...tip my hat and walk away.

387
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,157
Oh, God.

388
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,320
How did everything get so screwed up?

389
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,596
Yeah, you do have a little shit-creek action happening.

390
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,796
You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle.

391
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,879
This is a last-resort, back-pocket kind of thing...

392
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,517
...but if you really gotta protect yourself, disappear...

393
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,475
There's a guy who can make it happen.
They call him a "dissapearer."

394
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,913
For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial...

395
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,999
...you and your loved ones can vanish. Untraceable.

396
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,754
I mean, he sets you up with a whole new life.

397
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,758
What, like a witness protection kind of thing?

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,150
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

399
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,632
New identities, new everything.
No one would ever be able to trace you.

400
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,634
Now, be clear. This is an end game, if you get my meaning.

401
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,115
I mean, there's no coming back.

402
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,073
So you want his card?

403
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,554
God, there's gotta be something else that I can do.

404
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,917
Some way to keep everything from spiralling out of control.

405
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,678
Well, from what you told me...

406
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,793
...it sounds like Pinkman is first
up in the imminent-demise department.

407
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,996
Gus won't risk letting the police find Jesse.

408
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,475
I know him. He won't.

409
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,949
I'm not kidding. If you really think about it,
you can't even see it.

410
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,072
How can you know how bad radio frequencies, microwaves...

411
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,077
...and cell phones are getting you?

412
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,511
You could be strolling through security at the airport -

413
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,073
Hey, wake up, bitches.

414
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,874
You get waved through a full-body x-ray scanner.

415
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,198
Next day, you could be dead or dying
from all the radiation they say is safe.

416
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,029
But there's no way it could be.
It has to deliver a concentrated dose.

417
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,673
Enough to penetrate clothes.

418
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,555
The accumulated amount could be
dangerous to susceptible individuals...

419
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,830
- ...especially from a rural area.
- Yo.

420
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,952
The ozone layer is already thin because of the cow farts.

421
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,515
- Yo!
- Oh, hey.

422
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,035
Make sure there's pizza here when I get back.

423
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,708
- All right? Enough for everybody.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,514
I can do that. I can definitely do that.

425
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,712
Not a problem. I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff.

426
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,878
But as far as the financial situation, you know...

427
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,189
- Just hang on. Hang on.
- Yeah, yeah.

428
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,119
And you know, the concentrated doses...

429
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,598
...it's gonna fuck with your bone marrow and it's gonna mess up...

430
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,480
Because- Because especially if you have cancer.

431
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,877
You know, because if you gotta get a bone-marrow transplant...

432
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,436
...your odds are 60 percent. You got a 60 percent chan -

433
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,073
Hey.

434
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,350
Hey, hey.

435
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,312
Get some dipping sticks too, yo.

436
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,239
Yeah, I can definitely get dipping sticks.

437
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,438
All right. I can get them.

438
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,749
Hey, smoke it up, bitches.

439
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,911
Gotcha!

440
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,399
Wake up.

441
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,513
Wake up.

442
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,598
What's up?

443
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,316
What's up with your ear?

444
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,239
Downstairs. Now.

445
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,309
Where is everybody?

446
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,159
I invited your guests to leave.

447
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,631
Know who this is?

448
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,273
- Nope.
- You ought to.

449
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,597
He's been at your house for three solid days.

450
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,949
Okay.

451
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,832
He stole your money.

452
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,758
Okay.

453
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,439
That $78,000 or so look familiar?

454
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,200
- This is it?
- That's it.

455
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,317
Okay. Thanks.

456
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,272
Wanna know what's next for Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?

457
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,072
- No.
- You sure, now?

458
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,432
- Yep.
- Don't even wanna take a wild guess?

459
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,430
You're gonna kill him.

460
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,150
Is this the part where I'm supposed to beg you not to do it?

461
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,715
Oh, please, please.

462
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,632
And then what?

463
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,918
I'm supposed to promise, cross my heart...

464
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,793
...to straighten up and fly right or toe the line...

465
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,355
...or some other crap that I'm not gonna say?

466
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,597
Is that what your little show here was all about?

467
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,872
You're on thin ice, you little shithead. You know that?

468
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,159
You ain't gonna smoke that dude in there.

469
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,952
You know how come I know?

470
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,039
Because you went through the trouble
of putting a blindfold on him.

471
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,951
I'm going back to bed.

472
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,270
Let yourselves out.

473
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,156
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

474
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,637
- How's the ear?
- Mending.

475
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,159
What can I do for you?

476
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,918
It's Pinkman.

477
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,315
He's become increasingly incautious.

478
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,474
He's a risk. A liability.

479
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,952
I know he and Walter come as a team
and that Walter won't like it...

480
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,874
...but something's gotta be done.

481
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,953
You gotta be kidding.

482
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,832
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

483
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,715
Right. This is message number three.

484
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,159
You'd better be ready in two minutes,
because I am right outside your door.

485
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,479
Jesse.

486
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,433
Jesse!

487
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,273
Damn it.

488
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,118
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

489
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,594
Oh, great.

490
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,759
Jesse!

491
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,552
This is perfect.

492
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,830
You are a piece of work, you know that?

493
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,752
Jesse?

494
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,829
Jesse.

495
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,793
Jesse?

496
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,232
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

497
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,677
Where is he?

498
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,869
Gonna ask where we're going?

499
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,118
Nope.
