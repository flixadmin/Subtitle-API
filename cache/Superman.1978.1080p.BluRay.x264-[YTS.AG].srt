1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:45,201
In the decade of the 19303,
even the great city of Metropolis

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,122
was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,793
In the times of fear and confusion,
the job of informing the public

4
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,883
was the responsibility
of the Daily Planet

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:02,427
a great metropolitan newspaper,
whose reputation for clarity and truth

6
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:07,564
had become a symbol of hope
for the city of Metropolis.

7
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,143
This is no fantasy

8
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,984
no careless product
of wild imagination.

9
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,820
No, my good friends.

10
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:58,123
These indictments
I have brought you today

11
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,495
the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals

12
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,292
their acts of treason,
their ultimate aim of sedition

13
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,971
these are matters of undeniable fact.

14
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,183
I ask you now to pronounce judgment

15
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,194
on those accused.

16
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,367
On this...

17
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,872
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression

18
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,284
are wanton violence and destruction.

19
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,880
On the woman, Ursa

20
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,634
whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind

21
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,672
have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

22
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,686
Finally, General Zod.

23
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,068
Once trusted by this council

24
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,857
charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

25
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,241
Chief architect
of this intended revolution,

26
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:21,248
and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us

27
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,001
with himself as absolute ruler.

28
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,756
You have heard the evidence.

29
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,092
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

30
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,594
Guilty.

31
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,718
Guilty.

32
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,925
Guilty.

33
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,222
The vote must be unanimous, Jor—El.

34
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,683
It has therefore
now become your decision.

35
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,194
You alone will condemn us if you wish,

36
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,276
and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

37
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,453
Join us.

38
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,629
You have been known to disagree
with the council before.

39
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,461
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order

40
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,546
second only to my own.

41
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,263
I offer you a chance
for greatness, Jor—El!

42
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,550
Take it! Join us!

43
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,803
You will bow down before me, Jor—El.

44
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,266
I swear it.

45
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:31,310
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

46
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,819
Both you,

47
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,989
and then one day

48
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,485
your heirs!

49
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,852
No!

50
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,488
- Let us out of here!
- Help me!

51
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,577
- Forgive me!
- I shall return!

52
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,081
Forgive me!

53
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,785
I shall return!

54
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,563
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor—El.

55
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,770
They have received the fate
they deserved.

56
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,435
Isolation in the Phantom Zone

57
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,902
an eternal living death.

58
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,280
A chance for life, nonetheless.

59
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,070
As opposed to us.

60
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,123
It's suicide. No, it's worse.

61
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,621
It's genocide.

62
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,751
Be warned, Jor—El.

63
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:59,292
The council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

64
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,759
My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

65
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,927
I am not given to wild,
unsupported statements.

66
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,596
And I tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately.

67
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,646
Jor—El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

68
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,981
Yes, but so is Vond—Ah.

69
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,988
It isn't that they question your data.
The facts are undeniable.

70
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,127
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

71
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,339
This planet will explode
within 30 days, if not sooner.

72
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,091
I tell you,
Krypton is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,183
Jor—EI, be reasonable.

74
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,515
My friend.

75
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,681
I have never been otherwise.

76
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,941
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,854
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,949
The decision of the council is final.

79
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:30,717
Any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace

80
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,977
must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

81
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,231
You would accuse me of insurrection?

82
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,484
Has it now become a crime
to cherish life?

83
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,814
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment

84
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,402
in the Phantom Zone

85
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,826
the eternal void

86
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,163
which you yourself discovered.

87
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,827
Will you abide by the council's decision?

88
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,959
I will remain silent.

89
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:12,007
Neither I, nor my wife
will leave Krypton.

90
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,733
Have you finished?

91
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,864
Nearly.

92
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,495
It's the only answer, Lara.

93
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,881
If he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will.

94
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,381
But why Earth, Jor—EI?

95
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,214
They're primitives
thousands of years behind us.

96
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,095
He will need that advantage to survive.

97
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,887
Their atmosphere will sustain him.

98
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,941
He will defy their gravity.

99
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,573
He will look like one of them.

100
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,113
He won't be one of them.

101
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,949
No.

102
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,786
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

103
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:06,121
He'll be odd. Different.

104
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:11,377
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

105
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,297
Isolated, alone.

106
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,810
He will not be alone.

107
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,768
He will never be alone.

108
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,324
The energy input to Jor—El's quarters

109
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,534
is now in excess.

110
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,659
Our data indicates the loss is due
to a misuse of energy.

111
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,164
Investigate.

112
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,002
And if the investigation
proves correct?

113
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,003
He knew the penalty he faced.

114
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,839
Even as a member of this council.

115
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,184
The law will be upheld.

116
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:55,150
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

117
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,824
But we will never leave you

118
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,620
even in the face of our deaths.

119
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,786
The richness of our lives,
it will be yours.

120
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,672
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel

121
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,672
all this and more.

122
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,013
I bequeath you, my son.

123
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:29,522
You will carry me inside you
all the days of your life.

124
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,651
You will make my strength your own,
see my life through your eyes

125
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,861
as your life will be seen through mine.

126
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,580
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

127
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,212
This is all I...

128
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,629
All I can send you.

129
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,048
Kal-EI.

130
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,068
Stop. Stop, stop!

131
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,649
Which Einstein called

132
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,987
his theory of relativity.

133
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:01,155
Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature,

134
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,166
and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds

135
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,578
spanning the 28 known galaxies.

136
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,228
Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationships...

137
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,991
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...

138
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,623
Chief among these powers
will be your sight

139
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,704
your strength, your hearing

140
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:51,714
your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

141
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:56,878
The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

142
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,968
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through

143
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,975
contain their own individual law,
space and time.

144
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:07,354
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

145
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,093
What was that?

146
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,452
Now, wouldn't that beat all get-out?

147
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,332
Will you... You...

148
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,621
Huh?

149
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,297
Pa...

150
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,129
Oh, my.

151
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,838
All these years, as happy as we've been

152
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,840
how I've prayed the good Lord

153
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,593
see fit to give us a child.

154
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,589
Honey, will you hand me
that rag up there.

155
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,257
You take things easy, Jonathan.

156
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,973
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

157
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,068
Who that boy's proper family is.

158
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,201
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

159
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,616
Martha, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

160
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,963
We could say he's the child
of my cousin in North Dakota.

161
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,464
And just now orphaned.

162
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,424
- Oh, Martha.
- Jonathan, he's only a baby.

163
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,307
Martha, now, you saw how we found him.

164
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,310
There's something very
strange about that boy.

165
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,392
Yeah, you saw him.
Martha, you saw him

166
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,023
just as plain as I did, Martha.

167
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,111
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening
to what I'm saying?

168
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,783
Jonathan!

169
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,996
All right, bring that ball back.
Come on, now.

170
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,880
Again, and through the uprights!

171
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,638
Pick up that ball, it's a fumble!
Come on back, let's sharpen and try again.

172
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,509
Hey, yo! Let's go!

173
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,188
Come on, let's get that ball over
the uprights, not underneath it!

174
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:21,020
What, do you think that ball's gonna do,
just fly there by itself?

175
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,401
- Come on!
- Ra, ra, ra!

176
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,527
What's wrong?
We've got to get it together, guys.

177
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,114
Come on, gang.

178
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,867
Come on.

179
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,753
- That was a great game.
- Yeah, but next week we're...

180
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,085
All right.

181
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,716
Come on, gang, hustle. Let's go.

182
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,423
Stack your helmets neatly.

183
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,589
Remember about those uniforms.
Cleaned and washed by tomorrow,

184
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,758
and looking like a football team.

185
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,926
Clark, have the clothes
washed and ready,

186
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,719
- for tomorrow's game.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,263
Got to beat Mount Vernon High!

188
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,353
- Can you give me a lift?
- Home early!

189
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,691
Lana? Don't bother with these, huh?

190
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,611
I'll take them in
with the other equipment.

191
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,576
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

192
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,124
I think you're the nicest guy
in the whole school.

193
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,878
Well, thanks.

194
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:28,125
Of course, it's part of the job,
being team manager and all.

195
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,053
And I'd do it for you anyway.

196
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,807
Listen, a whole bunch of us
are going up to Mary Ellen's

197
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,592
play some records.

198
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,720
Would you like to come?

199
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,681
Oh, well...

200
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,441
Heh. I don't know...

201
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,282
Sure. Sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.

202
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,114
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

203
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,372
What are you talking about?
I just finished stacking all the...

204
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,873
- All that?
- Oh.

205
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,367
Oh, Brad.

206
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,494
Hey, come on, Lana.

207
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,961
Bad taste, bad Brad.

208
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,843
Sorry, Lana.
Guess I'd better clean it up.

209
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,507
Come on, Lana.

210
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,392
Come on, let's go.

211
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,058
- He's got to clean up.
- Bye, Clark.

212
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,894
- Yeah. Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

213
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,604
- Let's go.
- Bye, Clark.

214
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,395
- We're off to Mary Ellen's.
- See you, Clark.

215
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,564
All right.

216
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,324
- Bye, Clark.
- Bye, Clark.

217
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,737
Bye, Clark. See you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

218
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,059
Woo-hoo!

219
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,072
Golly, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

220
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,323
Faster even!

221
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,911
Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift
for invention.

222
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,076
- |'|| say that for you.
- But... But...

223
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,537
Lois, please read your book.

224
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,414
No one ever believes me.

225
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,089
Hey, look. There's Clark.

226
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,595
How come he's here?

227
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,757
Clark.

228
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,640
How'd you get here so fast?

229
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,303
- I ran.
- Ran, huh?

230
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,645
Told you he's an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

231
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,070
Been showing off a bit,
haven't you, son?

232
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,450
Uh...

233
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,630
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

234
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,554
It's just that, guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

235
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,589
Yeah. I know.

236
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,884
- Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
- Yeah, I know

237
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,053
you can do all these amazing things,

238
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,938
and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust

239
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,895
unless you can tell people about it.

240
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,902
Yeah. I mean, every time
I get the football

241
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,939
- I can make a touchdown. Every time.
- That's for sure.

242
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,608
I mean, is it showing off
if somebody's doing

243
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,404
the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

244
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,744
No. No, now you listen to me.

245
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,079
When you first came to us,
we thought people

246
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,916
would come take you away
because when they found out

247
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,753
you know, the things you could do,
and that worried us a lot.

248
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,794
Then a man gets older,
and he thinks very differently,

249
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,679
and things get very clear.

250
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,722
And there's one thing I do know, son,

251
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,306
and that is you are here for a reason.

252
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,892
I don't know whose reason,
but whatever the reason

253
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,022
maybe it's because...

254
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,520
I don't know, it's...

255
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,115
But I do know one thing:

256
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,948
It's not to score touchdowns.

257
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,657
Huh?

258
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,781
Thanks, Dad.

259
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,038
|'|| race you to it. Dad.

260
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,203
- You will, huh?
- Come on. Come on, Pop, run.

261
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,542
Come on. Move. Move.
Yeah, go, go, go. Come on, run.

262
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,089
Hey, Baron! Hey, Baron. Hey, boy.

263
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,889
Oh, no.

264
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,824
Jonathan.

265
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,994
Jonathan!

266
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,089
Dad.

267
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,927
Jonathan!

268
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,262
No! Jonathan!

269
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,933
All those things I can do

270
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,474
all those powers,

271
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,483
and I couldn't even save him.

272
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,673
Clark, get up.

273
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,387
Good morning, Smiley.

274
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,095
Clark, breakfast.

275
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,352
Are you gonna sleep all day?

276
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,693
Clark, come on. Get up.

277
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,508
I have to leave.

278
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,763
I knew this time would come.

279
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,311
We both knew it

280
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,597
from the day we found you.

281
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,035
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday,

282
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:14,543
and he said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

283
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,301
Mother...

284
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,297
I know, son.

285
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,724
I know.

286
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,940
Do you know where you're headed?

287
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,237
North.

288
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,570
Remember us, son.

289
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,247
Always remember us.

290
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,058
My son

291
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,907
you do not remember me.

292
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,569
I am Jor-El.

293
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,079
I'm your father.

294
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:41,627
By now, you will have reached
your 18th year

295
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:44,459
as it is measured on Earth.

296
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:48,091
By that reckoning,
I will have been dead,

297
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,504
for many thousands of your years.

298
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,967
The knowledge that I have

299
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,886
matters physical and historic

300
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,273
I've given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

301
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:08,858
These are important matters, to be sure,
but still matters of mere fact.

302
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,200
There are questions to be asked.

303
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,113
And it is time for you to do so.

304
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,745
Here in this...

305
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,041
This Fortress of Solitude

306
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,503
we shall try to find
the answers together.

307
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,805
How does a good man live?
What is virtue?

308
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:39,560
When does a man's obligation to those
around him exceed his obligation to himself?

309
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,642
And these are not simple questions.

310
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,899
Even on Krypton

311
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:51,822
there is no precise science
which provides us with the answers.

312
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:58,033
I can only tell you
what I myself believe.

313
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,578
And to this end I've tried to anticipate
your questions

314
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,334
in the order of their importance to you.

315
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,917
So, my son

316
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,381
speak.

317
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,134
Who am I?

318
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,758
Your name is Kal—El.

319
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:20,259
You are the only survivor
of the planet Krypton.

320
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,137
Even though you've been raised
as a human being

321
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,180
you are not one of them.

322
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,024
You have great powers

323
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:32,279
only some of which
you have as yet discovered.

324
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,279
Come with me now, my son

325
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,286
as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement.

326
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,948
Traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions.

327
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,493
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

328
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,789
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

329
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,676
Rather, let your leadership
stir others to.

330
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:59,887
In this next year, we shall examine
the human heart.

331
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,767
It is more fragile than your own.

332
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,144
For the past two years...

333
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,808
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy

334
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,352
we'll enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun

335
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,146
source of your strength
and nourishment

336
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,031
cause of our eventual destruction.

337
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,028
The planet Krypton, my son.

338
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,573
Your home, as it was.

339
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:29,787
This year, we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality,

340
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,707
and their basis in actual fact.

341
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:37,595
The total accumulation of all knowledge,
spanning the 28 known galaxies

342
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,131
is embedded in the crystals
which [have sent along with you.

343
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,345
Study them well, my son,

344
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,353
and learn from them.
We've reasoned out logical judgments.

345
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,890
By the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy

346
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,810
12 of your years will have passed.

347
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:57,948
For this reason, among others,
I have chosen Earth for you.

348
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:01,406
It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world,

349
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,993
and to serve its collective humanity.

350
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,957
Live as one of them, Kal-El

351
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,666
to discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

352
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,551
Always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage.

353
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:21,054
They can be a great people, Kal—El.
They wish to be.

354
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,717
They only lack the light to show the way.

355
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:30,014
For this reason above all,
their capacity for good.

356
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,728
I have sent them you

357
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,193
my only son.

358
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,570
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

359
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,784
Fresh fruit. Hey, lady,
how about a tomato?

360
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,870
Fresh fruit.
Hey, baby, how's it going?

361
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:35,333
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
They're SO fresh...

362
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,628
Fresh fruit and vegetables.
Get them while they're hot.

363
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:41,339
Look at these tomatoes.
Aren't they beautiful?

364
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,771
He did a great job.
You see his article this morning?

365
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,243
Smile.

366
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,287
- How many T's in "bloodletting"?
- TWO.

367
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,666
- What are you writing, Miss Lane?
- An Ode to Spring.

368
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,880
- How do you Spell "massacre"?
- Uh...

369
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:27,343
- M—A—S—S-A-C-R-E.
- A... C...

370
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,257
R-E. Thank you.

371
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,643
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

372
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,099
A good reporter doesn't
get great stories, Jimmy.

373
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,105
- A good reporter...
- makes them great.

374
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,937
Here's that story
on the East Side murder.

375
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,194
Way I see, it's a banner headline,
front page with maybe my picture...

376
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,481
There's only one P in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

377
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,945
- Told you one P.
- Hello, Miss Lane. How are...?

378
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,452
Remember my exposé
on the sex and drug orgies

379
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,204
in the senior citizens home?

380
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,365
How you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

381
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,376
- Oh, hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

382
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,663
It's got everything. It's got sex,
violence, the ethnic angle...

383
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,207
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

384
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,717
- Kent, can you Open this?
- Oh, sure, Mr. White.

385
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,549
This could be a series of articles:

386
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,715
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings,"
by Lois Lane.

387
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:12,475
We get psychologists, sociologists...

388
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:16,230
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

389
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,061
- The Daily Planet has a tradition...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

390
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,728
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to Shake it up like that.

391
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,897
Oh, of course not, Lois.

392
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,567
Why would anyone want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

393
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,238
- |'|| take that.
- Oh, thank... I'm sorry, Mr. White.

394
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:37,159
Olsen, why am I paying you when
I Should have you arrested for loitering?

395
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,918
- Go get Mr... A towel.
- Kent.

396
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,545
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, chief.

397
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,580
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, chief.

398
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,171
- And don't call me sugar.
- "Blood is in Metropolis...

399
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,427
- Right, sugar.
- While the crocuses bloom."

400
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,760
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

401
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:54,552
Lois, why don't you take Kent
out to meet everybody, huh?

402
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,937
Just introduce him around.
He's starting with the paper today.

403
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,518
I'm giving him the City beat.

404
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,440
Chief, that's my beat.

405
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,947
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just
a mild-mannered reporter, but listen

406
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,576
not only does he know how to treat
his editor in chief with respect

407
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,283
not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style,

408
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,291
but he is, in my 40 years in this
business, the fastest typist I've seen.

409
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,122
- That's great.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

410
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,583
Here, you forgot my article.

411
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,795
Oh, excuse me, Mr. White?

412
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,212
I was wondering if perhaps
you could arrange for half my salary

413
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,302
to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

414
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,057
- Your bookie, right?
- My what?

415
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:39,312
Don't tell me, he sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

416
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,473
Actually, she's silver-haired.

417
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,942
Uh, I'll see what I can do.

418
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,105
Uh, thank you very much, Mr. White.

419
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,947
Excuse me.

420
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,492
Well...

421
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,078
Any more at home like you?

422
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,365
Not really, no.

423
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,911
I didn't think so.

424
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,499
- Well, get yourself a desk over here.
- Over here?

425
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,010
Yeah, right here. There are
some papers in a pile right there.

426
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,014
Sorry. Excuse me.

427
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,648
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

428
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,466
- Very nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

429
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,651
Thank you.

430
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,034
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Um, Kent.

431
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,288
- What?
- Kent.

432
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,165
Oh. Clark Kent.

433
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,997
Jimmy Olsen.

434
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,218
- Yeah. It's fantastic.
- So you...?

435
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,888
- I met this really great guy.
- Hey, fabulous.

436
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,057
Yeah, fabulous.
I met him at this dude ranch.

437
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:08,188
- Did you know I used to ride?
- Yeah, I've been Since I was 7.

438
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,400
- Oh, I gotta mail these letters.
- Okay, bye. Good luck tonight.

439
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,064
- Oh, hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

440
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,074
How'd you like your first day on the job?

441
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,737
Well, frankly, the hours
were sort of longer than I expected,

442
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:22,407
but on the whole, I mean, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White

443
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,200
gosh, I'd say it's been swell.

444
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,916
- Swell?
- Yeah.

445
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:32,426
You know, Clark, there are very few people
left in the world

446
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,756
who feel comfortable saying that word.

447
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,262
- What word?
- "Swell."

448
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,015
Really? I always thought
it was kind Of natural.

449
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,762
Ooh.

450
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,348
- I'm sorry.
- Clark.

451
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,104
It's all right.

452
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,607
- Sorry, Lois.
- Oh, hi, Rex.

453
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,438
- Oh, Lois.
- See anything good today?

454
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,193
- Not until you came along.
- Lois?

455
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,070
- Oh, Rex, this iS...
- Clark Kent.

456
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,698
- Yeah, hi, see you around.
- Bye.

457
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:00,370
- Lois?
- Hey, where you going?

458
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,202
- Can I help you with your coat?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

459
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,117
- So you like Mr. White.
- I thought he was a nice guy.

460
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,953
- Jimmy Olsen was fantastic.
- Hey, come here.

461
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,589
Come on, come on. Get in here.
Hurry up. Come on.

462
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,796
- We'd better get out of here.
- I think we'd better do what he says.

463
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,134
- Come on, come on. Get in here, quick.
- Don't do anything.

464
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,718
- That's it.
- We're coming.

465
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,975
- Come on.
- We're coming. Excuse me.

466
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,385
- GO on, back there.
- Here?

467
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,474
Please don't point that at me, sir.

468
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,980
- You could hurt somebody with that.
- Yeah, yeah.

469
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,984
- Okay, okay, hold it there.
- Just a minute, mister.

470
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,146
I realize of course that times are tough
for some these days,

471
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,821
but this isn't the answer.

472
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:40,156
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

473
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:44,448
You know something, buddy? You're
right. I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

474
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,789
Good for you, sir. That's the Spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anybody.

475
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:48,997
Uh-huh.

476
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,005
- Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
- Of course.

477
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,165
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

478
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,960
Lois, I think maybe you better...

479
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,508
Lois, what are you doing?

480
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,946
Clark! Clark.

481
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,327
Clark, are you all right? Clark!

482
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,329
What happened?

483
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,707
Golly. I guess I must have fainted.

484
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,538
Fainted?

485
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,328
- You fainted?
- Sorry.

486
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,383
Swell.

487
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,178
Oh, really, Lois, supposing that man
had Shot you?

488
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:52,565
Is it worth risking your life over $10, two
credit cards, a hairbrush, and lipstick?

489
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:56,065
- How'd you know that?
- Know what?

490
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,198
You just described the exact contents
of my purse.

491
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:02,067
Hm.

492
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,537
Um, wild guess.

493
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,075
Taxi!

494
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,126
- Mustard, sauerkraut?
- Plain.

495
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:57,289
- What, no mustard or sauerkraut?
- No, plain, man. Plain.

496
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,387
Here's a buck.
GO buy yourself a trip to Bermuda.

497
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,510
Gee, thanks a lot.

498
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,259
- Hey.
- Hi, Otis.

499
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,768
- SO, what's happening, partner?
- Look what we got.

500
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,358
- Let'S take him.
- Wait a minute.

501
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,365
Maybe he'll lead us
to the big man himself.

502
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,948
- Lex Luthor?
- You got it, Armus.

503
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,871
We'll make captain by midnight.

504
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:40,048
Metropolis 46 to headquarters.
We have suspect under surveillance.

505
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,958
Let's go.

506
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,959
Hey, what do you read?

507
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,750
XK 101 rocket to be used.

508
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,464
Hey, what do you read?

509
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,219
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, hey, Otis.

510
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,597
Just getting the Daily Planet here.

511
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,768
Hey, what do you read?
Down, down.

512
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,644
Okay, okay.

513
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:39,475
Okay. All right. See, I'm paying him.
I got a pretzel too.

514
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:43,236
Thanks, Otis. Okay.
How many did he take, Shutzy?

515
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:49,234
Now arriving on track 10 upper level

516
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:56,204
the Yankee Clipper from Augusta, Boston,
Springfield, Hartford...

517
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,244
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

518
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,958
Let's go.

519
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,760
Your attention, please.

520
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,795
Your attention, please.

521
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:16,595
Metropolis Railway is announcing
a delay of departure for the express

522
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:22,109
to Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Indianapolis, and Chicago.

523
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:29,616
That train will now depart on Track 28
lower level at 8:15.

524
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:34,200
No further delays are
expected at this time.

525
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,843
Your attention, please.

526
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,674
Your attention, please.

527
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,306
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure

528
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:58,686
on the upper level, Track 6,
stopping at New Rochelle.

529
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:02,019
All right, he's going down to
the train platform. I'm going after him.

530
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,650
Okay, Harry. I'll call for backup.
Be careful, now.

531
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,187
- All right, Armus, all right.
- All aboard, please.

532
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,524
Now boarding on the lower level...

533
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:15,160
- Smoking cars forward, all aboard.
- Hey.

534
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:19,995
Metropolis Transportation. Metropolis
Transportation. Buffalo, Syracuse.

535
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,252
Come along, gotta get these cars going.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

536
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,671
Ten minutes we leave, folks.
Ten minutes.

537
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,299
Metropolis Transportation, folks.
Hurry along, now.

538
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,710
All aboard. Boarding.

539
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,929
Ten minutes, folks.
Come on, air-conditioned cars.

540
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,637
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie,
Glen Corners.

541
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,302
Aboard now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation.

542
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,972
Metropolis Transportation.
Buffalo, Syracuse.

543
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,983
Smoking cars are forward.
Move along now.

544
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,563
Put your luggage up the top.

545
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:51,401
Smoking cars forward.
All aboard. Boarding.

546
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,444
I seen him, and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

547
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:19,823
So that's it.

548
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:40,382
Armus, come in please. Listen,
make it Track 23. Repeat, Track 23.

549
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,347
I watched him and I think
I know how he does it. Out.

550
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,414
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

551
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,919
Harry.

552
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,803
Harry, where are you? Harry.

553
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,142
Oh, no.

554
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,525
Harry...

555
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,274
Sick.

556
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:34,082
- Sick. You're really Sick.
- Sick, Miss Teschmacher?

557
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:37,498
Sick, when I'm mere days from executing
the crime of the century?

558
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,634
No, no, no.
Step away from that, please.

559
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:45,674
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

560
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,517
DO you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, no.

561
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,019
That would be too Obvious, I grant you.

562
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,853
Charismatic. Fiendishly gifted.

563
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:56,813
Try "twisted."

564
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,192
Get away from there.
Get away, get away, get away!

565
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,195
Tell me something, Lex.

566
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:11,286
Why do SO many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

567
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,200
Why? You ask why?

568
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,371
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

569
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,629
Why is the most brilliantly
diabolical leader of our time

570
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,886
surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

571
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,963
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

572
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,724
Yes, I was just talking about you.

573
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,889
You were followed again.

574
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,900
In spite of those catlike reflexes.

575
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,739
Mr. Luthor. Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

576
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,399
Otis.

577
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,531
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

578
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,579
Yeah.

579
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,241
Why am I not reading it?

580
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,835
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

581
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,416
- Right.
- Oh.

582
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,090
At last, it's official.

583
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,756
Thanks to the generous help of the United
States government, we will pull off

584
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,767
the greatest real-estate swindle
Of all time.

585
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,349
Lex, what iS this obsession
with real estate?

586
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,434
All the time, "land, land, land."

587
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:19,601
MiSS Teschmacher, when I was
6 years Old, my father said to me...

588
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,018
"Get out."

589
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:26,274
Before that. He said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall.

590
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,784
Utilities and transportation systems
may collapse.

591
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,866
People are no damn good.
But they will always need land,

592
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,282
and they'll pay through the nose
to get it."

593
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,291
"Remember," my father said...

594
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,373
- Land.
- Right.

595
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:43,628
It's a pity that he didn't see
from such humble beginnings

596
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,463
how I've created this empire.

597
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,128
An empire? This?

598
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,464
MiSS Teschmacher,
how many girls do you know

599
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,970
who have a Park Avenue address
like this one?

600
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,931
Park Avenue address?

601
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,811
Two hundred feet below.

602
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,644
Do you realize what people
are shelling out up there,

603
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,810
for a few miserable rooms
Off a common elevator?

604
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,650
What more could anyone ask?

605
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:10,485
Sunshine? A night on the town
instead of under it?

606
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,329
- Otis?
- YeS?

607
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,869
Did you feed the babies?

608
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,623
Not... Not today, Mr. Luthor.

609
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:27,635
Otis, feed the babies.

610
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,012
- Mr. Luthor, please.
- Otis!

611
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,524
Relax.

612
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:19,436
Your babies weren't hungry, Mr. Luthor.

613
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:24,232
Ugh. Lex, you're sick.

614
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,893
You are really sick.

615
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,279
You would take a diaper pin
to cut a baby's throat.

616
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:32,283
You'd fix the brakes
on your own grandmother's wheelchair.

617
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:38,030
I don't know, just explain
one thing to me, Lex.

618
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:41,708
Why do I love you so much?

619
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,716
Because life with me is never dull.

620
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,888
No, it's never dull, Lex

621
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,683
because you are the pits.

622
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,220
You're really the pits.

623
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,605
Later.

624
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,155
- Olsen!
- Yeah?

625
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,325
Get this Loch Ness update
right into Composing.

626
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,412
Yeah? NO, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

627
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,627
- What are you standing around here for?
- |'m not...

628
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,339
- I wasn't gonna say it.
- GO.

629
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:39,008
- Ah, the sex maniac profile.
- Right.

630
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,848
Look, 9-to-5 it's a Pulitzer Prize winner.
What do you bet?

631
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,762
There's no Z in "brassiere."

632
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:46,182
Hey, nice job
on that union scandal, Kent.

633
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,521
Well, gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

634
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,483
Uh...

635
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,194
Oh, hi, Clark. Good night.

636
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:57,110
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

637
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,323
Lois, have you got a minute?

638
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,705
Excuse me, please. Lois?

639
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:05,208
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, Okay?

640
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:08,337
Lois, I was wondering if you
would like to have dinner With me?

641
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,123
- Gosh, Clark, I'm sorry. I'm booked.
- Oh.

642
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:14,168
Air Force One'S landing at the airport
and this kid's there

643
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:18,009
to make sure you-know—who answers
a few questions he'd rather duck.

644
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,640
- My goodness, don't you ever let up?
- What for?

645
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,723
I've seen how the other half lives.
My Sister, for instance.

646
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,889
Three kids, two cats,
and one mortgage. Yech.

647
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,565
I would go bananas in a week.

648
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,396
Oh, can I take you to the airport?

649
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:32,812
Not unless you can fly.

650
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,902
- Clark? Ladies.
- Sorry.

651
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:39,409
- Change my clothes. Thank you. Bye.
- Hey, Lois, maybe we could...?

652
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,206
Um...

653
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:46,662
Lois?

654
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,584
- Would you be a pet and mail that?
- Oh, sure... Good night.

655
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:59,718
Oh. Going down, please. Going down.

656
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:05,436
- Going down?
- Going up, up, up.

657
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:08,597
Good night.

658
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,119
Daily Planet Copter 1, this is ground.

659
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,617
Planet 1, go ahead.

660
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:30,249
We have Miss Lane for a ride to
Metropolis Airport to meet Air Force One.

661
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,330
Roger, we're on our way
and have you in sight.

662
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,670
Have one aboard for transfer, over.

663
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,258
Roger, Planet 1. You're cleared.
Wind, 020 at 15, gusting.

664
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,717
Altimeter two-niner-eight-niner.

665
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,470
Roger, over and out.

666
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,259
A malfunction. Can't get liftoff.

667
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,800
- You hooked the cable.
- What'S happening?

668
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,351
- Ah!
- Set it down.

669
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,514
Oh, my God! We've lost stabilizer
rotor control, I can't hold it!

670
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,980
I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

671
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,044
Wake up!

672
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,837
Help!

673
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,882
Help! Help!

674
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:04,735
Come on, step back. Step back, folks.

675
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,073
- All right, let's get back a little.
- Move over across the street.

676
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,744
Bring the cameras over here. Okay.

677
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:15,409
Okay, you see the helicopter up there?

678
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,417
Help me!

679
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,594
All right, move back.
Let the ambulance through.

680
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,601
Help me!

681
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,733
Ah!

682
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,407
Okay. Come on, hold it. Get back.

683
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,956
Come on. Come on, get Off the streets.
Come on, get back.

684
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,959
Move, let the firemen through.

685
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,415
Boys, come on, now. Make a line.

686
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,793
Move to the other side of the street.

687
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,971
Come on. Get along.

688
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,473
Get away from the building.

689
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:16,265
Hold these crowds back. Move. Move.

690
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,140
Help me!

691
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:38,826
- Say, Jim, woo!
- Excuse me.

692
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,790
That's a bad outfit.

693
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,963
- WOO!
- Okay, Bresslaw, move these people out.

694
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,429
Oh, God, look up there.

695
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,095
What the hell's that?

696
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,640
- Oh!
- Easy, miss. I've got you.

697
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,524
You... You've got me?

698
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,686
Who's got you?

699
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:10,524
I can't believe it. I just
cannot believe it. He got her.

700
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,238
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

701
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:03,077
Well, I certainly hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

702
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:08,461
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

703
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,172
Right. Wait.

704
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,432
Who are you?

705
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,601
A friend.

706
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,474
Bye.

707
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,774
Hi there. Something wrong
with the elevator?

708
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,487
Ah!

709
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,698
Going down.

710
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,124
Nah.

711
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,046
Officer.

712
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:03,139
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

713
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:06,142
Well, they say confession
iS good for the soul.

714
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,475
I'd listen to this man.

715
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,480
Take him away.

716
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:57,982
Come on. Let's get out of here.

717
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,373
Move your ass. Come on. Come on.

718
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:13,035
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

719
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:17,206
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons.

720
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,169
Come on, let's get out of here.

721
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,050
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

722
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,215
- Freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot.

723
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,004
Be cool. You got us.

724
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,406
Bad vibrations?

725
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:54,747
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear, flying.

726
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:57,207
With a big red cape
and bright red boots, as well.

727
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:59,543
- Watch the desk.
- Quick as a wink, he was gone.

728
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:02,584
Flew up in the air again, he did,
like a big blue bird.

729
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:04,502
- A blue bird...
- You don't believe me.

730
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:06,421
- With bright red boots.
- Flying.

731
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,180
Take off, go back to Murphy's bar.

732
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:10,433
- Continue what you started.
- Don't believe me.

733
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:14,266
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there myself.

734
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:26,107
Mooney, the first bottle's on me.

735
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:27,742
Let me get my hat.

736
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,372
Hey, Frisky,
will you come down from there.

737
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:44,172
Hey, cat. Come on, Frisky,
come down!

738
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,087
Come on down, you dumb cat.

739
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,005
Come on.

740
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:52,092
Frisky, you dumb cat, will you
come down from there?

741
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,970
Come on, Frisky, come on.
Come down.

742
01:34:56,482 --> 01:34:58,222
Hi. I'll get him.

743
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:04,813
Come on. It's all right.

744
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,570
Here you go, miss.

745
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,451
Gee, thanks, mister.
He's such a naughty cat.

746
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,533
- I always tell him not to...
- Hold on, now.

747
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:16,040
Let's not be too hard on Frisky, okay?
You know something

748
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,748
we all get a little afraid of heights
now and again.

749
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:20,214
Well

750
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,298
goodbye, Frisky. So long, now.

751
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,888
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

752
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,061
This man swooped out of the Sky
and gave him to me.

753
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,395
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies?

754
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:50,029
Get a weather report
from Metropolis Airport.

755
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:53,532
Metropolis Airport,
this is Air Force One.

756
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,243
- Could we have the weather report?
- Roger, Air Force One.

757
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,658
Metropolis, currently
ceiling 500 overcast.

758
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,747
700 broken,
visibility one half and showers.

759
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:03,538
Wind 240 at 25,
altimeter niner-niner-eight.

760
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,252
Roger.

761
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,792
Well, it doesn't look too good.
What do you think?

762
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:10,419
No, it doesn't.

763
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,805
Yeah, and the old man hates bumpy,
that's great.

764
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:16,389
- Better tell him to get rid Of his drink.
- The old man drinks?

765
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:19,269
After a mouthful of peanuts,
wouldn't you? Ha-ha-ha.

766
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:23,645
- What the hell was that?
- What happened?

767
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,188
We lost power in number one.

768
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,194
Lost power? We lost the whole engine.

769
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:29,982
- Shut down one.
- Pu|I one throttle closed.

770
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,696
- Bring up two and three.
- There's not enough pressure...

771
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,372
Mayday, mayday, Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

772
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:41,831
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

773
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:44,712
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

774
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:46,793
Ten miles southwest
Of Metropolis Airport.

775
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:49,550
- Notify them the president's on board.
- POSition, 10 miles

776
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,383
that's 10 miles southwest
Metropolis Airport.

777
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,345
Heading 305. Height, 6000 feet.

778
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,242
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

779
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,407
What the hell's going on out there?

780
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:23,827
Fly. Don't look. Just fly.

781
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,916
We got something.

782
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:30,959
I ain't saying what it is. Just trust me.

783
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:50,233
You enjoyed it.

784
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,733
I don't know what to say, Father.

785
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:56,947
I'm afraid I just got carried away.

786
01:37:57,163 --> 01:38:00,997
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.

787
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:03,829
You couldn't have imagined...

788
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,785
How good it felt?

789
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,957
You are revealed to the world.

790
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:14,802
Very well. So be it.

791
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,470
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

792
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:20,679
Why?

793
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:23,095
The reasons are two.

794
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:26,480
First, you cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.

795
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:30,351
- 24.
- Or 24...

796
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:33,693
as it is in Earth time.

797
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,482
Your help would be called for endlessly.

798
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:40,700
Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.

799
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:44,536
It is their habit to abuse their resources
in such a way.

800
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:45,870
And secondly?

801
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:49,879
Second, your enemies will discover

802
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,210
their only way to hurt you:

803
01:38:52,385 --> 01:38:54,671
By hurting the people you care for.

804
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,844
Lastly

805
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,603
do not punish yourself
for your feelings of vanity.

806
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,604
Simply learn to control them.

807
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:11,688
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

808
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:15,071
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some

809
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:18,449
who consider us indestructible.

810
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,328
Were it not for vanity, why

811
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,616
at this very moment.

812
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:33,123
I could embrace you in my arms

813
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,673
my son.

814
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,211
Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving

815
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:22,596
- of Air Force One...
- A burglar was apprehended

816
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:26,225
- by a man in a blue suit and red cape.
- Rescuing Miss Lois Lane

817
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,307
writer on the Daily Planet,
with one hand, and a...

818
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:37,729
Yeah, that'll be the day, huh?

819
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:40,819
I said, that'll be the day
when a guy could fly, huh?

820
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:44,110
Oh, I don't know. You'd be surprised.

821
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,781
- Yeah.
- Some sort of fantastic hoax.

822
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:49,665
Your guess is as good as anybody's.

823
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:52,326
True or false, miracle or fraud?

824
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:55,463
- The answer is up to you. Man or myth?
- Miss Teschmacher!

825
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:57,214
Turn it Off.

826
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:09,936
Mr. Luthor? What's a myth?

827
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:13,690
Something unreal.
Something not quite human.

828
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:15,850
Something like you, Otis.

829
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:19,027
I'm a myth.

830
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:29,539
Lex, what's the story on this guy?

831
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,574
Do you think he's the genuine article?

832
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,915
- If he is, he's not from this world.
- Why?

833
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,252
If any human being were gonna perpetrate
such a fantastic hoax

834
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:40,291
it would have been me.

835
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,095
Otis! My robe!

836
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:56,770
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

837
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,524
It all fits somehow,
his coming here to Metropolis,

838
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,815
and at this particular time.

839
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:09,570
There's kind of a cruel justice about it.

840
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,954
Miss Teschmacher, you look so pretty today.

841
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,293
I'm gonna take your picture.

842
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:24,214
Smile.

843
01:42:29,101 --> 01:42:30,932
There you go.

844
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,344
Otis!

845
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,939
To commit the crime of the century

846
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:41,565
a man would just naturally want to face
the challenge of the century.

847
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:47,408
Listen, Mr. Luthor, maybe this guy that
flies is just sort of passing through.

848
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,944
- You know?
- Passing through?

849
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:51,950
Not on your life, Otis

850
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,615
which I would gladly sacrifice,
by the way,

851
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:58,958
for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

852
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:01,796
And, Otis, by the way

853
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:05,459
the next time, put my robe on
after I'm out Of the pool.

854
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:09,430
Mr... I'm sor.

855
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:22,727
Now look. The Post: "It flies."

856
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:25,237
The News: "Look, Ma, no wires."

857
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:27,364
The Times: "Blue bomb buzzes
Metropolis."

858
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:28,570
The Planet:

859
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:31,736
We have the story of the century here.

860
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:33,870
I want the name of
this whatchamacallit

861
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,202
to go with the Planet
like bacon and eggs

862
01:43:36,377 --> 01:43:39,335
franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

863
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,416
I don't think that
he would lend himself

864
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,581
to any cheap promotion schemes,
Mr. White.

865
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:45,920
Exactly how would you know that, Kent?

866
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:47,335
Um...

867
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:50,095
Just a first impression.

868
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,678
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him partner if I have to.

869
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,558
- Right?
- Right, chief.

870
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,603
I want the real story.

871
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:00,105
I want the inside dope on this guy.

872
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:03,939
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the S stand for?

873
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:06,441
"Tonight at 8, your place.
Hopefully, a friend."

874
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:07,772
How does he fly?

875
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,440
A friend?

876
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:15,238
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

877
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:17,748
What's he got hidden under
that cape? Batteries?

878
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,283
Why did he Show up last night?

879
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,623
Dick, where does he come from?

880
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,082
Does he have a girlfriend?

881
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:27,295
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

882
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,303
Now, listen to me.
I tell you, boys and girls

883
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,464
whichever one of you
gets it out of him

884
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:35,553
iS gonna wind up with
the Single most important interview.

885
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:39,471
Since God talked to Moses.

886
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:44,149
What are you standing around about for?

887
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,653
Move. Get on that story.

888
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:50,802
Let me tell you something, Vinnie. A
good reporter doesn't get great stories

889
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,908
- a good reporter makes them great.
- Oh, yeah?

890
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:55,364
- Olsen!
- Yeah. Chief wants me.

891
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,370
- Yeah, Chief?
- Black, no sugar.

892
01:44:57,541 --> 01:45:00,203
[FIAUGHS]

893
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:05,288
Black, nO sugar! You heard him.

894
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:08,802
Sheesh.

895
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:22,893
"Eight O'clock," he says, 8:00, 8:00.

896
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:24,557
Some friend.

897
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:28,569
The story of my life.
Cinderella bites the dust.

898
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,249
Good evening, Miss Lane.

899
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,205
Uh, hi.

900
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:49,419
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you have plans this evening?

901
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,921
Oh. Oh, this Old thing... NO.

902
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:56,089
- It'S no trouble at all to come later.
- No. Don't move!

903
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:58,383
Um... Or...

904
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,059
Sure, you can move.

905
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:03,391
Just don't fly away, all right?

906
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:06,436
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
Miss Lane,

907
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,022
but there must be a lot
of questions about me

908
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:12,563
- that people would like the answers to.
- Of course, yes.

909
01:46:18,163 --> 01:46:20,279
You really Shouldn't smoke,
you know, Miss Lane.

910
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:24,120
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

911
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:28,288
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

912
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:33,130
Um, would you like a glass of wine?

913
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:35,465
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

914
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:38,138
Nice place.

915
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:41,472
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

916
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:44,557
Should we get started
with the interview?

917
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,683
Oh. Thank you.

918
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:52,611
Well, let's start with
your vital statistics.

919
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,567
Are you married?

920
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,323
No. No, I'm not.

921
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,988
Do you have a girlfriend?

922
01:46:59,163 --> 01:47:03,156
No, I don't, but if! Did, Miss Lane,
you'd be the first to know about it.

923
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:10,913
Um, how old are you?

924
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:13,503
- Over 21.
- Oh, I get it.

925
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,508
You don't want anyone to
know how old... Okay.

926
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,341
How big are you? How tall are you?

927
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:20,927
- About 6'4".
- Six-foot-fou r.

928
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,014
- And hOW much do you weigh?
- Around 2, 225.

929
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:28,018
Two... 225?

930
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:31,600
Hm.

931
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:37,319
Well, I assume, then, that

932
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:41,694
the rest Of your bodily functions
are normal?

933
01:47:42,373 --> 01:47:43,704
Sorry. I beg your pardon?

934
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:47,036
Well, putting it delicately

935
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:52,959
do you

936
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,047
eat?

937
01:47:57,221 --> 01:48:00,384
Yes. Yes, I do. When I'm hungry.

938
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:04,054
You do. Of course you do.

939
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,220
Well. Well, then, is it true

940
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:11,641
that you can see through anything?

941
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:14,310
Yes, I can. Well, pretty much.

942
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:18,072
And that you're totally
impervious to pain?

943
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,073
Well, so far.

944
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:23,573
What color underwear am I wearing?

945
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:25,658
Hm.

946
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:29,412
- I'm sorry. I embarrassed you, didn't I?
- No.

947
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:31,201
- I did.
- No, no. Not at all.

948
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,588
It's just that this planter must be
made of lead.

949
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:36,999
- YeS, it is. So?
- Oh, you see, I

950
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,384
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

951
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,008
Oh, that's interesting.

952
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,093
"Problems seeing through lead."

953
01:48:44,685 --> 01:48:47,893
- Do you have a first name?
- What, like Ralph or something?

954
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:49,769
- No. I mean like...
- Pink.

955
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,272
- Huh?
- Pink.

956
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,902
I'm sorry, Miss Lane.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

957
01:48:57,406 --> 01:48:59,738
You didn't embarrass me.

958
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:01,944
Um... Uh...

959
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:04,280
What's your background?
Where do you hail from?

960
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:07,954
Well, that's kind of
hard to explain, actually.

961
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:11,743
You see, I'm from...
Well, pretty far away.

962
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,626
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.

963
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:16,296
- I come from a planet called Krypton.
- Huh?

964
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,131
Krypton.

965
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:23,630
Oh, Cripton. With a C-R-I...? NO.

966
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:27,425
No, actually, it's Krypton,
with a K-R-Y-P-T-O-N.

967
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:32,472
K-R-Y... Do you like pink?

968
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:40,066
I like pink very much, Lois.

969
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,485
- Why are you...?
- I'm sorry?

970
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:50,831
I mean, why are you here? There
must be a reason for you to be here.

971
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:54,994
Yes. I'm here to fight for truth
and justice and the American way.

972
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:58,998
You're gonna end up fighting
every elected official in this country.

973
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,167
I'm sure you don't really mean that, Lois.

974
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:02,835
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

975
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:06,005
- Hm?
- IneverHe.

976
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:09,429
Oh.

977
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:11,680
Um...

978
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:13,846
Uh... Oh.

979
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:17,357
- Just how fast do you fly, by the way?
- I don't know, really.

980
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:20,110
You know, I never actually bothered
to time myself.

981
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,441
- NO?
- Say...

982
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,948
And how do you propose we do that?

983
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:29,703
Take a ride with me?

984
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,283
You mean I can fly?

985
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,870
Actually, I'd be handling the flying,
if that's Okay.

986
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:37,207
- ThiS iS utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

987
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:39,542
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

988
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:42,003
What's the matter, don't you want to go?

989
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,293
Okay. You don't need these.

990
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,632
I need a sweater.
It must be kind of cold.

991
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:48,638
No, you'll be warm enough.

992
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:57,063
- Ready?
- Clark

993
01:50:57,234 --> 01:51:01,568
said that you're just a figment
of somebody's imagination

994
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:03,228
like Peter Pan.

995
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:05,989
Clark. Who's that, your boyfriend?

996
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,242
Clark? Oh, Clark. No, he's nothing.

997
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:09,732
- He's just a...
- Peter Pan, huh?

998
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:11,237
Uh-huh.

999
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:16,246
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

1000
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:24,170
Ah!

1001
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,178
Oh!

1002
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:13,923
Oh! Ah!

1003
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:35,282
Can you read my mind?

1004
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:42,539
Do you know what it is
that you do to me?

1005
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:47,619
I don't know who you are.

1006
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:55,628
Just a friend from another star.

1007
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:02,555
Here I am, like a kid out of school

1008
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:06,145
holding hands with a god.

1009
01:55:07,067 --> 01:55:08,807
I'm a fool.

1010
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:13,987
Will you look at me, quivering.

1011
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,990
Like a little girl, shivering.

1012
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:19,818
You can see right through me.

1013
01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:27,125
Can you read my mind?

1014
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:32,498
Can you picture the things
I'm thinking of?

1015
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:39,095
Wondering why you are

1016
01:55:40,809 --> 01:55:43,016
all the wonderful things you are.

1017
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:47,850
You can fly.

1018
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,853
You belong in the sky.

1019
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,360
You and I

1020
01:55:56,158 --> 01:55:58,524
could belong to each other.

1021
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:03,153
If you need a friend.

1022
01:56:06,209 --> 01:56:08,666
I'm the one to fly to.

1023
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,873
If you need to be loved

1024
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:18,377
here I am.

1025
01:56:19,347 --> 01:56:21,383
Read my mind.

1026
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:45,070
Oh, we forgot to time ourselves.

1027
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:46,325
Uh-huh.

1028
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,707
Oh, well, maybe next time.

1029
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:50,579
Oh.

1030
01:56:57,844 --> 01:57:00,051
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

1031
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:04,222
Well, good night.

1032
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:06,887
Oh, good night.

1033
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:14,107
What a super man.

1034
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:21,857
Superman.

1035
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:26,027
Lois? Lois?

1036
01:57:26,206 --> 01:57:30,825
Anybody home? Hello? Lois?

1037
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:39,086
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

1038
01:57:39,761 --> 01:57:42,298
Lois, for goodness' sake,
did you even hear me knocking?

1039
01:57:42,472 --> 01:57:43,632
Uh-huh.

1040
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,257
Lois, we did have a date tonight,
remember?

1041
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:48,641
Oh.

1042
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:53,434
-Lois? You haven't been:
-Oh, no, no.

1043
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:58,147
Well, I Should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, Shall we?

1044
01:57:58,321 --> 01:57:59,652
- I'd better get a coat.
- Okay.

1045
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:02,781
It might be kind Of cold out.
NO, I mean

1046
01:58:02,951 --> 01:58:06,569
I need a purse, and I have to
fix my hair, and

1047
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,737
put some blush on...

1048
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:26,179
Lois

1049
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:29,849
there'S something I have to tell you.
I'm really...

1050
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:37,107
I mean, lwaS, at first,
really nervous about tonight.

1051
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:41,486
But then I decided, well, darn it, I was
gonna Show you the time of your life.

1052
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:43,692
That's Clark, nice.

1053
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:48,818
I was thinking maybe we could go
for a hamburger.

1054
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:57,210
Now, then

1055
01:58:58,214 --> 01:59:01,798
given the exact location of the galaxy
that he mentions,

1056
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:06,052
and the proximity
to our own solar system

1057
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:09,802
it's amazing.

1058
01:59:09,976 --> 01:59:12,718
Amazing. Too good to be true.

1059
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:15,683
It's too good to be true.
He's 6'4", has black hair

1060
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:19,020
blue eyes, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke,
and tells the truth.

1061
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:21,685
Miss Teschmacher, some people read
War and Peace,

1062
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:24,730
and come away thinking
it's a Simple adventure story.

1063
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:27,695
Others can read the ingredients
on a chewing gum wrapper,

1064
01:59:27,869 --> 01:59:30,451
and unlock the secrets of the universe.

1065
01:59:31,206 --> 01:59:35,074
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

1066
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:40,245
Right. Right, Miss Teschmacher.

1067
01:59:43,385 --> 01:59:45,376
N, N, N...

1068
01:59:45,553 --> 01:59:48,260
M. You want M, Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

1069
01:59:49,683 --> 01:59:51,389
So there you go. M.

1070
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:54,266
M, as in "moron," Otis?
No, no, no. It's N!

1071
01:59:54,437 --> 01:59:57,725
N, as in "Neanderthal,"
"nincompoop," "nitwit."

1072
01:59:57,899 --> 02:00:00,766
- And I, as in "ladder"!
- Ladder, Mr. Luthor. Coming right up.

1073
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:03,356
I didn't see, because I...

1074
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:06,397
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor. I... Ooh!

1075
02:00:06,574 --> 02:00:10,783
In the interview,
he says that the planet Krypton

1076
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,454
exploded in 1948.

1077
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:19,618
Ridiculous little freak took three years
in a rocket ship to get to Earth.

1078
02:00:19,796 --> 02:00:25,257
- Ergo...
- Ergo. Ergo, 1948, three years...

1079
02:00:25,427 --> 02:00:28,419
- He'S 6'4", you know that?
- I said that.

1080
02:00:28,596 --> 02:00:30,803
Did you say he don't drink
and he don't smoke?

1081
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:33,465
I said that. It was in the paper
right there. I said it.

1082
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:37,306
Do you know why the number 200
is so vitally descriptive

1083
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,267
to both you and me?
It's your weight and my IQ.

1084
02:00:40,442 --> 02:00:42,649
Now, think, people, think.

1085
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:46,312
Deductive reasoning,
that's the name of the game.

1086
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:52,951
Fragments from the planet Krypton
exploded and went into outer Space.

1087
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:57,160
It iS reasonable to assume
that some Of those particles of debris

1088
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:59,164
drifted to Earth.

1089
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:02,122
Meteorites.

1090
02:01:05,341 --> 02:01:07,332
Voila!

1091
02:01:12,348 --> 02:01:13,508
Voila.

1092
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:15,765
Voila.

1093
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:20,269
A meteorite found in AddiS Ababa?

1094
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:25,400
Uh, I know I'm gonna get rapped
in the mouth for this, but SO What?

1095
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:29,313
So what? You mean, to us
they are just meteorites.

1096
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:34,451
Fair enough. But the level
of Specific radioactivity is so high

1097
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:38,159
to anyone from the planet Krypton,
this substance is lethal.

1098
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,831
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

1099
02:01:41,002 --> 02:01:45,120
You mean fire and bullets
can't hurt this guy, but this stuff here...

1100
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,664
Will kill him.

1101
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:49,173
I3 iii, ”:22; I%I¥f”;:§.

1102
02:01:49,344 --> 02:01:50,834
Yeah, wow...

1103
02:01:51,012 --> 02:01:52,752
Doesn't it give you kind of

1104
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:57,015
a Shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

1105
02:01:58,186 --> 02:02:01,269
Not like the one you'll get
when you try to lay that rock on him.

1106
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:04,681
He can see you coming from miles
with those super peepers of his.

1107
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:08,693
Oh, Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see.

1108
02:02:08,863 --> 02:02:11,229
Nor can Superman, through lead.

1109
02:02:13,034 --> 02:02:15,696
He can't see through lead.

1110
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:18,031
And kryptonite will destroy him.

1111
02:02:21,376 --> 02:02:23,332
Any questions, class?

1112
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:26,870
Wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa.

1113
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:28,458
Looks like a burnoose.

1114
02:02:28,675 --> 02:02:30,711
There's gold. It's 24 karat...

1115
02:02:30,885 --> 02:02:34,127
- Are we going to Addis Ababa?
- Not 18 karat gold.

1116
02:02:34,556 --> 02:02:37,047
Mother Bird to missile convoy. Over.

1117
02:02:37,225 --> 02:02:39,716
Missile convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.

1118
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:44,137
Everything looks good.
See you at base. Over and out.

1119
02:02:44,315 --> 02:02:47,022
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.

1120
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:49,828
Mr. Otis, do you live in England?

1121
02:03:50,048 --> 02:03:52,414
I... I don't think so, Mr. Luthor.

1122
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,129
Why are you driving on the left side?

1123
02:04:07,065 --> 02:04:08,305
Ready, Miss Teschmacher?

1124
02:04:10,193 --> 02:04:12,855
Have you ever tried running in high heels?

1125
02:04:14,572 --> 02:04:16,153
He probably has.

1126
02:05:02,787 --> 02:05:05,073
God, what a mess.

1127
02:05:06,416 --> 02:05:09,078
- What?
- I don't know, man.

1128
02:05:09,252 --> 02:05:12,415
Yeah, I'm gonna get a call to headquarters.
See if we can get an ambulance here.

1129
02:05:12,588 --> 02:05:13,998
Uh, this is Charlie-Baker—Four...

1130
02:05:24,517 --> 02:05:28,226
- Man, look at this.
- Looks pretty bad.

1131
02:05:30,606 --> 02:05:34,019
- Think she's dead?
- Better check her pulse.

1132
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:45,701
All right, get an ambulance down here.

1133
02:05:45,872 --> 02:05:48,534
I don't wanna hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

1134
02:05:49,042 --> 02:05:51,704
She's having trouble breathing, Sir.
What do you think?

1135
02:05:51,878 --> 02:05:54,369
Well, I suggest vigorous chest massage.

1136
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:57,209
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

1137
02:05:57,383 --> 02:05:58,839
Yes, sir.

1138
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:02,548
Sergeant, I won't have one of my men
doing anything I wouldn't do myself.

1139
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:04,838
- Yeah, but, sir...
- Get an ambulance.

1140
02:06:05,016 --> 02:06:07,007
All right, men. Gather around.

1141
02:06:07,727 --> 02:06:09,763
About face!

1142
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:21,691
Ow!

1143
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:32,540
Hup! Two, three, four.
Hup! Two, three, four.

1144
02:06:56,901 --> 02:07:00,439
Enough. Enough, enough, enough!
I'm Okay now. I'm Okay.

1145
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:04,071
By the way, what did you have for lunch?
Whew!

1146
02:07:04,242 --> 02:07:05,652
- My, my.
- Sorry.

1147
02:07:08,246 --> 02:07:10,532
Hi. Somebody hurt?

1148
02:07:10,706 --> 02:07:13,288
- Well, that was fast.
- Fast?

1149
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:17,039
When this woman's life is at stake?

1150
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,164
Let's see here...

1151
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:25,902
- You have a stretcher?
- Get a stretcher.

1152
02:07:25,972 --> 02:07:27,553
- Get a stretcher.
- Get a stretcher.

1153
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:31,136
- Get a stretcher.
- Get a stretcher! Go on, you guys!

1154
02:07:31,602 --> 02:07:34,560
- Anything I can do?
- Oh, I think you've already done it.

1155
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:38,097
- Oh, yeah?
- She'S gonna be all right.

1156
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:41,313
- I don't feel too good.
- Miss Teschmacher

1157
02:07:41,487 --> 02:07:45,571
- you've done very well.
- |'ve done very well.

1158
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:47,819
I said that.

1159
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:47,334
I did it. I did it, Mr. Luthor,
Miss Teschmacher.

1160
02:08:47,511 --> 02:08:50,799
- I did it, just like you told me.
- All right, Otis. All right.

1161
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:54,807
All right, Otis. Listen,
it isn't that I don't trust you, but...

1162
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:57,343
I don't trust you, Otis. What'd you do?

1163
02:08:57,521 --> 02:09:03,983
Well, I... I set the first
directional vector to 38

1164
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:08,192
the second one to 67,
and the third one to 117.

1165
02:09:08,366 --> 02:09:11,449
- What about the fourth one?
- What fourth one?

1166
02:09:11,619 --> 02:09:14,861
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The third one to 117?

1167
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:17,371
Yes. See? I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
I wrote it...

1168
02:09:17,541 --> 02:09:19,782
Otis. Otis!

1169
02:09:19,961 --> 02:09:23,545
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, seven.

1170
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:27,499
Oh. Well, gee, Mr. Luthor.

1171
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:30,214
Oh, I see. I guess my arm
wasn't long enough, see?

1172
02:09:30,388 --> 02:09:32,879
Otis, would you like to see a long arm?

1173
02:09:33,057 --> 02:09:36,015
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very long arm?

1174
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:39,393
- Oh, no, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis. Otis!

1175
02:09:39,563 --> 02:09:40,723
Ah!

1176
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:45,107
- My marshmallow!
- Leave me alone! Give me your arm, Otis.

1177
02:09:45,278 --> 02:09:50,193
Hand it over! I'll wring your neck!
I'll give you a long arm!

1178
02:10:17,768 --> 02:10:21,852
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1179
02:10:22,023 --> 02:10:24,143
- I... I just got... I got mixed up.
- It's all right.

1180
02:10:24,233 --> 02:10:26,233
- |'|| go in there and fix that thing.
- It's okay.

1181
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:29,773
It's Okay, Otis, it's Okay.

1182
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:33,360
There's another XK 101 being launched
at the same time.

1183
02:10:33,534 --> 02:10:36,241
See? There's another XK 101 being launched
at exactly the same time.

1184
02:10:36,412 --> 02:10:38,744
- I just said that.
- No, She said there was a XK 101

1185
02:10:38,914 --> 02:10:41,155
being launched at "exactly"
the same time, Mr. Luthor.

1186
02:10:41,375 --> 02:10:44,208
- Don't tell me that.
- But there is another XK 101 being launched

1187
02:10:44,378 --> 02:10:46,869
- at exactly the same time.
- I told you not to tell me that!

1188
02:10:47,048 --> 02:10:51,917
Oh, no, no, no. Mr. Luthor, please.
She didn't mean it. Miss Teschmacher...

1189
02:10:58,017 --> 02:11:00,258
Shut up in there!

1190
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:14,150
Mr. Luthor, are you mad?

1191
02:11:15,659 --> 02:11:18,617
- You did it again, Otis.
- MiSS Teschmacher, I think you did.

1192
02:11:20,915 --> 02:11:23,748
- I know! But he didn't say "exactly."
- But he always hits me!

1193
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:03,909
Mr. Luthor, come on. Let me do it again.
I can get it right.

1194
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:06,165
- Otis!
- I got experience now.

1195
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:11,750
Otis, how would you like the heady experience
Of being thrown from a moving vehicle?

1196
02:12:12,299 --> 02:12:14,164
You want a bite of that?

1197
02:12:31,152 --> 02:12:34,940
- All right, get it right, will you?
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1198
02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:40,070
McDonald, I thought you told me
this road was blocked Off.

1199
02:12:40,244 --> 02:12:43,611
- Jablonski, you said it was blocked.
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.

1200
02:12:44,832 --> 02:12:47,448
All right, follow me. Follow me, men.

1201
02:12:48,169 --> 02:12:51,502
- Back that thing off the road.
- Back that thing up out of here.

1202
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:52,912
Off the road!

1203
02:12:55,092 --> 02:12:57,754
Back it off the road, we got a convoy.

1204
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:07,893
You fellas get back into that thing
and back it Off the road.

1205
02:13:08,063 --> 02:13:10,349
We got a convoy coming through here.

1206
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:15,064
Listen, you're gonna have to Circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

1207
02:13:15,237 --> 02:13:16,818
Heck of a day, isn't it?

1208
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:24,073
We took the wrong turn.
We were looking for Route 12.

1209
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:27,738
- Route 12? That's back there, isn't it?
- No, sir. It's up there.

1210
02:13:29,585 --> 02:13:33,419
- Sergeant, we took the wrong route.
- I'm a lieutenant, a naval Officer.

1211
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:42,336
Shut up!

1212
02:13:42,515 --> 02:13:44,255
Route 12 is back that way.

1213
02:13:50,606 --> 02:13:54,349
This man is a diabetic, you see.
And he has to have his insulin.

1214
02:13:54,527 --> 02:13:57,735
- What's he eating chocolate for?
- Well, it gives him a lot of sugar.

1215
02:13:57,905 --> 02:13:59,816
- Yeah.
- All right, now listen, fellas.

1216
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:02,732
Back out here, go back a few miles,
pull Off...

1217
02:14:15,798 --> 02:14:18,540
- Just back up, we'll open an exit.
- Can't we get past you here?

1218
02:15:06,974 --> 02:15:09,340
Tell me, chief, what do you think
about all of this?

1219
02:15:09,518 --> 02:15:15,764
No oil, no uranium, no coal,
no precious minerals.

1220
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:20,401
Hell, no water anymore. Not since
the government dammed it all up

1221
02:15:20,571 --> 02:15:25,110
to service those towns
on the other Side Of the mountain.

1222
02:15:25,284 --> 02:15:29,527
- If we still had water, we would never sell...
- Mm-hm.

1223
02:15:29,705 --> 02:15:32,993
- Our beloved land.
- Well my, uh...

1224
02:15:33,167 --> 02:15:35,328
My associate, Mr. Olsen

1225
02:15:35,502 --> 02:15:39,336
iS taking pictures of that dam,
but what I don't understand

1226
02:15:39,506 --> 02:15:42,088
iS why you'd sell out
to a person you've never met.

1227
02:15:42,259 --> 02:15:44,500
I mean, you don't even
know his name. Oh, yeah.

1228
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:50,176
At the stupid-high price he Offered,

1229
02:15:50,351 --> 02:15:55,015
for this worthless piece of desert,
I hope it's Custer.

1230
02:15:56,690 --> 02:15:59,352
Perfect. That's just what I need,
thank you.

1231
02:15:59,526 --> 02:16:03,895
Reporting live
from the launch site, ground zero.

1232
02:16:04,323 --> 02:16:07,360
Well, today marks an historic occasion.

1233
02:16:07,534 --> 02:16:12,699
Two XK 101 rockets
will be launched simultaneously

1234
02:16:12,873 --> 02:16:15,535
one by the Army and by the Navy.

1235
02:16:15,709 --> 02:16:18,041
Hi, everybody. Has anybody
seen Lois around today?

1236
02:16:18,212 --> 02:16:20,373
No, I haven't, but the chief
wants to see you.

1237
02:16:20,547 --> 02:16:22,959
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1238
02:16:23,133 --> 02:16:27,046
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today, okay?
Good? Great.

1239
02:16:27,221 --> 02:16:29,007
- Excuse me, Mr. White?
- Come in, Kent.

1240
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:32,048
You wanted to see me?
Sir, have you seen Lois anywhere today?

1241
02:16:32,893 --> 02:16:35,225
She's out west looking into
a land fraud deal.

1242
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:38,053
Sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1243
02:16:38,232 --> 02:16:41,395
Some unidentified clown out there
is buying up thousands of acres

1244
02:16:41,568 --> 02:16:43,900
of worthless desert
at incredible prices.

1245
02:16:44,071 --> 02:16:45,561
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1246
02:16:45,739 --> 02:16:48,651
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that by now.

1247
02:16:48,826 --> 02:16:51,067
Look at this dispatch
from Addis Ababa.

1248
02:16:51,245 --> 02:16:54,328
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people,

1249
02:16:54,498 --> 02:16:57,080
and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.

1250
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:58,866
- How do you figure that?
- Well

1251
02:16:59,044 --> 02:17:02,252
frankly, I've never been able
to understand violence in any form.

1252
02:17:02,423 --> 02:17:06,541
I know that about you, Kent. That's one
of the reasons I wanted to talk to you.

1253
02:17:06,927 --> 02:17:10,260
I've been in this news game 40 years,
man and boy.

1254
02:17:10,472 --> 02:17:14,761
And I got where I am
with guts, compassion, elbow grease,

1255
02:17:14,935 --> 02:17:17,768
and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1256
02:17:17,980 --> 02:17:20,096
- Um, humility?
- No, not humility.

1257
02:17:20,274 --> 02:17:22,060
You got bags of humility.

1258
02:17:22,234 --> 02:17:24,600
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1259
02:17:24,778 --> 02:17:26,769
Take charge. Let people know
who you are.

1260
02:17:35,289 --> 02:17:37,450
This is Lex Luthor.

1261
02:17:37,624 --> 02:17:42,414
Only one thing alive with less than four
legs can hear this frequency, Superman: You.

1262
02:17:42,796 --> 02:17:45,208
In approximately five minutes,
a poison gas pellet

1263
02:17:45,382 --> 02:17:48,089
containing propane-lithium
compound

1264
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:51,047
will be released through
air ducts in the city

1265
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:54,463
effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.

1266
02:17:54,641 --> 02:17:58,099
I was a reporter before
most of my friends were copy boys.

1267
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:01,103
I want you to do that.
Get Lois to introduce you to Superman.

1268
02:18:01,273 --> 02:18:04,481
Find out who he is. What's he like?
Where'd he get that blue suit?

1269
02:18:04,651 --> 02:18:07,814
Did he have it made?
Is it Silk? IS it plastic?

1270
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:11,651
I know it all seems a bit much,
but how else was I going to meet you?

1271
02:18:11,825 --> 02:18:16,319
I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.

1272
02:18:16,997 --> 02:18:22,617
But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help

1273
02:18:22,795 --> 02:18:27,505
we/I, I just knew you couldn't resist
the chance to sort of pitch in.

1274
02:18:27,674 --> 02:18:29,505
Know what I mean?

1275
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:48,520
It'S Superman.

1276
02:18:58,539 --> 02:19:00,200
- Look.
- Oh, my God!

1277
02:19:02,376 --> 02:19:06,369
There's a strong streak of good
in you, Superman,

1278
02:19:06,713 --> 02:19:09,375
but then, nobody's perfect.

1279
02:19:11,677 --> 02:19:13,668
Almost nobody.

1280
02:19:21,395 --> 02:19:23,226
- What the...?
- Oh, Superman.

1281
02:19:23,397 --> 02:19:25,638
- Gee.
- Stand back, please. Stand back.

1282
02:19:25,816 --> 02:19:27,556
Nothing to get worried about.

1283
02:19:33,407 --> 02:19:35,068
Well, don't just sit there. Get out.

1284
02:19:49,006 --> 02:19:52,248
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1285
02:19:52,426 --> 02:19:53,506
Tell me what you see.

1286
02:19:54,678 --> 02:19:56,885
Cuteness, dimples.

1287
02:19:57,264 --> 02:19:59,550
You like cuteness, huh?

1288
02:19:59,725 --> 02:20:01,261
Dimples.

1289
02:20:01,435 --> 02:20:03,391
I'll give you dimples.

1290
02:20:37,471 --> 02:20:41,134
The pressure is still on you, Superman.
You know what they say:

1291
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:44,425
"If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the tunnel."

1292
02:21:07,501 --> 02:21:09,992
This is your last chance, Superman.

1293
02:21:10,337 --> 02:21:13,795
Why don't you do yourself
a flavor and freeze.

1294
02:21:37,197 --> 02:21:38,562
Yeah.

1295
02:21:55,882 --> 02:21:57,338
Hah.

1296
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:16,350
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1297
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:29,450
He's definitely coming, Mr. Luthor.

1298
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:42,842
It's Open. Come in.

1299
02:22:44,848 --> 02:22:48,136
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1300
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:50,175
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1301
02:22:55,776 --> 02:22:59,360
- I don't think he wants me to.
- Luthor, where's the gas pellet?

1302
02:22:59,863 --> 02:23:01,273
Somewhere

1303
02:23:03,033 --> 02:23:07,868
in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1304
02:23:08,038 --> 02:23:12,327
Is that how your warped brain gets its
kicks? Planning the death of innocents?

1305
02:23:13,043 --> 02:23:16,206
No, by causing the death
of innocent people.

1306
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:26,341
Seven, six, five, four

1307
02:23:26,515 --> 02:23:29,882
three, two, one.

1308
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:31,596
Fire.

1309
02:23:33,605 --> 02:23:36,768
Navy Bird, we have a launch.

1310
02:23:36,942 --> 02:23:40,275
Navy missile, XK 101.

1311
02:23:40,445 --> 02:23:41,935
Angle of attack is perfect.

1312
02:23:42,948 --> 02:23:46,281
- Climbing fast.
- Hydraulics, general function.

1313
02:23:46,451 --> 02:23:50,444
Now, as you may or may not know,
I am, as they say

1314
02:23:50,664 --> 02:23:53,121
very heavy into real estate.

1315
02:23:53,291 --> 02:23:57,705
To make money in that game, you have to
buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1316
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:00,120
- Right.
- Right.

1317
02:24:00,298 --> 02:24:03,131
SO the problem:

1318
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:06,134
How to make land more valuable
between the time you buy it,

1319
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:08,295
and the time you sell it.

1320
02:24:08,682 --> 02:24:13,392
Now, this is California, the richest,
most populous state in the union.

1321
02:24:13,562 --> 02:24:16,645
I don't need a geography lesson
from you, Luthor.

1322
02:24:16,815 --> 02:24:21,058
Oh, yes, of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1323
02:24:21,236 --> 02:24:23,318
- Where was I?
- California.

1324
02:24:23,488 --> 02:24:27,072
California, right. The San Andreas Fault.
Maybe you've heard of it?

1325
02:24:27,242 --> 02:24:30,985
Yes. It's the joining of two land masses.
The fault line is unstable

1326
02:24:31,163 --> 02:24:33,779
which is why you get earthquakes
in California.

1327
02:24:33,957 --> 02:24:36,824
Wonderful.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1328
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:41,419
Everything west of this line
is the richest real estate in the world.

1329
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:44,252
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1330
02:24:44,426 --> 02:24:49,170
Everything on this Side is just hundreds
Of miles of worthless desert land

1331
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:51,087
which happens to be owned by...

1332
02:24:52,475 --> 02:24:54,932
Lex Luthor, Incorporated.

1333
02:24:55,145 --> 02:24:59,514
Now, call me foolish,
call me irresponsible...

1334
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:02,979
It occurs to me
that a 500-megaton bomb

1335
02:25:03,153 --> 02:25:05,986
planted at just the proper point,
would...

1336
02:25:06,156 --> 02:25:08,522
Would destroy most of California.

1337
02:25:09,659 --> 02:25:13,117
Millions of innocent people would die
The West Coast as we know it would...

1338
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:17,622
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1339
02:25:17,792 --> 02:25:21,000
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1340
02:25:23,381 --> 02:25:26,873
Costa del Lex, Luthorville,
Marina del Lex, OtiSburg...

1341
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:32,216
- Otisburg?
- MiSS Teschmacher.

1342
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:34,722
- She'S got her own place, Mr...
- OtiSburg?

1343
02:25:34,893 --> 02:25:37,885
- It's a little bitty place.
- OtiSburg?

1344
02:25:38,063 --> 02:25:41,055
Okay. I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
It's a little town.

1345
02:25:41,233 --> 02:25:44,396
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A Sick, twisted dreamer.

1346
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:46,901
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1347
02:25:47,072 --> 02:25:49,108
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1348
02:25:49,282 --> 02:25:52,149
Adjusting the precise trajectory
Of the missile

1349
02:25:52,327 --> 02:25:56,036
finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself.

1350
02:25:56,206 --> 02:25:59,915
Which, by the way, is target zero, right

1351
02:26:00,502 --> 02:26:01,502
here.

1352
02:26:01,878 --> 02:26:02,993
Ooh.

1353
02:26:19,521 --> 02:26:23,184
Chief, listen. I promise you my
friends and I are gonna do all we can

1354
02:26:23,358 --> 02:26:25,519
- to get to the bottom of this.
- Thank you, Miss Lane.

1355
02:26:25,694 --> 02:26:27,525
Okay, bye.

1356
02:26:58,268 --> 02:27:01,135
- What's happening, lieutenant?
- Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1357
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:06,147
- Then abort.
- Yes, Sir.

1358
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:12,980
Function negative, sir.

1359
02:27:13,158 --> 02:27:15,991
- Can't you knock them down?
- Absolutely impossible, Sir.

1360
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:18,823
They have the new B-20 low-level
avoidance systems.

1361
02:27:18,997 --> 02:27:20,658
Get me the Pentagon.

1362
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:24,161
Red line.

1363
02:27:25,128 --> 02:27:26,868
Hello? Hello!

1364
02:27:28,923 --> 02:27:33,292
That's impossible. Stand by.

1365
02:27:37,098 --> 02:27:41,011
Two hundred and eighty million dollars
and there's not a goddamned thing

1366
02:27:41,186 --> 02:27:43,677
- we can do about it?
- That'S right, senator.

1367
02:27:43,855 --> 02:27:46,016
You got what you paid for.

1368
02:27:46,191 --> 02:27:50,560
Can't happen here. Heh.
Can't happen here.

1369
02:27:50,737 --> 02:27:52,477
Get me the president.

1370
02:28:04,209 --> 02:28:05,619
Yeah?

1371
02:28:10,924 --> 02:28:13,006
Mr. President. Mr. President!

1372
02:28:13,176 --> 02:28:17,545
- Goddamn it, what is it now?
- The Pentagon's calling, Sir.

1373
02:28:29,401 --> 02:28:32,985
Well, what do you think, Supe baby?
Interesting?

1374
02:28:33,154 --> 02:28:37,739
- Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
- Would you go to the viewing room?

1375
02:28:38,326 --> 02:28:41,318
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a Sick fantasy.

1376
02:28:41,496 --> 02:28:44,488
Fantasy? NO. No.

1377
02:28:44,666 --> 02:28:47,658
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1378
02:28:47,836 --> 02:28:49,497
Miss Teschmacher!

1379
02:28:54,342 --> 02:28:57,425
- YeS, Lex?
- Where's the rocket now?

1380
02:28:57,595 --> 02:29:01,338
It'S going like a bat over the
Grand Canyon. 80 is the other one.

1381
02:29:01,516 --> 02:29:04,508
The other one? There's two of them?

1382
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:10,013
Yeah, Superman. Double jeopardy.

1383
02:29:10,191 --> 02:29:13,149
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1384
02:29:13,319 --> 02:29:16,811
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1385
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:20,528
All right, Luthor. Where is it?
Where's the detonator?

1386
02:29:34,382 --> 02:29:35,963
You diseased maniac.

1387
02:29:36,134 --> 02:29:39,342
Did you really think you could hide it
from me by encasing it in lead?

1388
02:29:41,389 --> 02:29:45,382
- |'|| mold this box into your prison bars.
- Don't touch that.

1389
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:57,190
I told you. It's kryptonite, Superman.
A little souvenir from the old hometown.

1390
02:29:57,530 --> 02:30:00,693
I've spared no expense
to make you feel right at home.

1391
02:30:07,665 --> 02:30:12,204
You were great in your day, Superman.
But it just stands to reason

1392
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:14,661
when it came time
to cash in your chips

1393
02:30:14,839 --> 02:30:18,502
this old, diseased maniac

1394
02:30:18,676 --> 02:30:20,837
would be your banker.

1395
02:30:23,932 --> 02:30:26,139
Mind over muscle.

1396
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:38,235
You don't even care where
the other missile's headed, do you?

1397
02:30:38,446 --> 02:30:42,906
Certainly, I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.

1398
02:30:43,076 --> 02:30:44,737
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1399
02:30:50,583 --> 02:30:53,245
I have to leave you now.
No hard feelings.

1400
02:30:53,461 --> 02:30:57,500
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.

1401
02:31:11,771 --> 02:31:15,764
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1402
02:31:25,618 --> 02:31:28,109
Miss Teschmacher!

1403
02:31:46,306 --> 02:31:47,967
Both birds uncontrolled.

1404
02:31:48,141 --> 02:31:49,141
Impossible to reset.

1405
02:31:55,607 --> 02:31:57,287
(: 3312;?::§::2:52;
,7;27:5)»:3:32:: ZE:§

1406
02:32:01,154 --> 02:32:02,439
Freeze.

1407
02:32:58,378 --> 02:33:00,369
Miss Teschmacher.

1408
02:33:00,546 --> 02:33:02,457
Miss Teschmacher.

1409
02:33:04,133 --> 02:33:06,715
Please, you can't...

1410
02:33:06,886 --> 02:33:08,126
You can't just stand there.

1411
02:33:08,388 --> 02:33:10,344
Shh.

1412
02:33:11,766 --> 02:33:13,256
You can't just stand there,

1413
02:33:13,434 --> 02:33:16,267
and let innocent people,
millions of innocent people, die.

1414
02:33:17,271 --> 02:33:18,977
Maybe -Please.

1415
02:33:19,816 --> 02:33:21,898
If it wasn't for my mother...

1416
02:33:23,653 --> 02:33:26,144
Please. Please help me to save them.

1417
02:33:28,199 --> 02:33:30,690
If I help you, do you promise
to save my mother first?

1418
02:33:31,869 --> 02:33:33,985
But Lois and Jimmy...

1419
02:33:34,163 --> 02:33:35,528
Oh, but my mother comes first.

1420
02:33:35,707 --> 02:33:39,199
If you promise me, I'll believe you,
because you always tell the truth.

1421
02:33:41,546 --> 02:33:44,208
I promise. I promise.

1422
02:34:38,603 --> 02:34:41,140
Why did you kiss me first?

1423
02:34:42,273 --> 02:34:45,561
It... I didn't think you'd let me later.

1424
02:34:46,569 --> 02:34:48,434
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1425
02:34:48,654 --> 02:34:52,738
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1426
02:34:57,663 --> 02:34:59,073
Stand aside now.

1427
02:34:59,248 --> 02:35:00,909
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1428
02:35:19,477 --> 02:35:21,138
Army bird still heading due east.

1429
02:35:21,312 --> 02:35:24,770
- Navy bird still heading due west.
- Losing radar contact.

1430
02:35:24,941 --> 02:35:26,977
Next radar contact in three seconds.

1431
02:35:27,151 --> 02:35:28,891
Intercept both birds.

1432
02:36:06,232 --> 02:36:08,348
Army bird still headed east, Sir.

1433
02:36:13,197 --> 02:36:15,188
Someone's trying to destroy Metropolis.

1434
02:36:15,366 --> 02:36:18,733
Uh, actually sir, it looks like it's headed
for New Jersey.

1435
02:36:18,911 --> 02:36:21,903
Jersey? What the hell's in New Jersey?

1436
02:37:42,703 --> 02:37:45,035
- Army bird gaining altitude.
- Miss Teschmacher.

1437
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:48,243
- Radar contact strong.
- We have straight climb.

1438
02:37:48,417 --> 02:37:50,408
Miss Teschmacher!

1439
02:37:50,586 --> 02:37:52,918
Radar report,
Navy bird, San Andreas area.

1440
02:37:53,089 --> 02:37:55,421
Heading down.
Fifteen seconds to impact.

1441
02:37:55,591 --> 02:37:58,082
Navy bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.

1442
02:37:58,594 --> 02:38:00,209
Fifteen seconds and counting.

1443
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:19,771
- Impact: San Andreas.
- God!

1444
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:18,495
We interrupt the program
for a news flash.

1445
02:39:18,674 --> 02:39:22,007
A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.

1446
02:39:22,178 --> 02:39:25,545
The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas Fault.

1447
02:39:25,723 --> 02:39:28,385
California is suffering
a major earthquake.

1448
02:41:01,986 --> 02:41:03,522
What the...?

1449
02:41:17,501 --> 02:41:19,366
What's going on?

1450
02:41:21,172 --> 02:41:22,252
It's a quake. Look!

1451
02:41:38,355 --> 02:41:39,595
Look out!

1452
02:41:50,492 --> 02:41:52,153
Get to the back Of the bus!

1453
02:42:54,807 --> 02:42:56,263
Okay, kids. It's all right now.

1454
02:42:56,433 --> 02:42:58,094
Thank God, we're back on the bridge.

1455
02:42:58,269 --> 02:43:00,681
- Hey, it's Superman.
- It's Superman!

1456
02:43:09,113 --> 02:43:11,229
Holy mackerel!

1457
02:43:12,157 --> 02:43:13,272
Going off the tracks!

1458
02:43:15,911 --> 02:43:17,276
Hang on!

1459
02:43:22,835 --> 02:43:23,950
I can't hold her!

1460
02:44:12,801 --> 02:44:14,541
All personnel, evacuate now.

1461
02:44:16,096 --> 02:44:18,178
All personnel, evacuate now.

1462
02:44:21,977 --> 02:44:23,717
Watch that cable!

1463
02:44:23,896 --> 02:44:25,432
My eyes! I can't see!

1464
02:44:34,323 --> 02:44:36,905
Execute earthquake procedure.

1465
02:44:37,076 --> 02:44:40,159
- Execute earthquake procedure.
- Get out! Get out, get out!

1466
02:44:42,956 --> 02:44:44,662
Someone try and pull the main!

1467
02:44:44,833 --> 02:44:47,040
It's impossible, it's red-hot!

1468
02:44:55,511 --> 02:44:57,877
- Gentlemen, is that man all right?
- Yeah.

1469
02:44:58,764 --> 02:45:02,302
Gee, that's Superman.
He must've been the one that saved us.

1470
02:45:29,086 --> 02:45:31,919
- Ah...!
- Hang on, kid.

1471
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:39,380
Go ahead, Shoot.

1472
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:55,935
The dam burst!

1473
02:45:56,280 --> 02:45:59,397
Forget the car! Come on, come on!

1474
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,611
You're safe here, son.

1475
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:08,951
That's Okay!
Miss Lane will be driving by soon.

1476
02:46:18,802 --> 02:46:20,793
- Come on, George.
- Make for the hill.

1477
02:46:37,196 --> 02:46:39,278
There has been major quake damage

1478
02:46:39,448 --> 02:46:40,488
to Southern California.

1479
02:46:40,657 --> 02:46:43,194
The San Andreas Fault
has miraculously sealed itself,

1480
02:46:43,368 --> 02:46:46,610
yet Southern California is suffering
major aftershocks of a major earthquake.

1481
02:47:15,651 --> 02:47:16,891
Please, come on, turn over.

1482
02:47:17,069 --> 02:47:18,980
- Which in some areas has...
- Come on!

1483
02:47:46,598 --> 02:47:48,429
Help me Help me.

1484
02:47:49,851 --> 02:47:51,057
NO.

1485
02:50:11,326 --> 02:50:12,441
Water!

1486
02:51:02,002 --> 02:51:03,082
Lois.

1487
02:53:59,012 --> 02:54:02,004
No, no, no.

1488
02:54:03,016 --> 02:54:05,849
NO. No.

1489
02:54:18,698 --> 02:54:20,654
My son.

1490
02:54:20,867 --> 02:54:23,859
It is forbidden for you to interfere
in human history.

1491
02:54:24,037 --> 02:54:29,282
One thing I do know, son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

1492
02:54:29,459 --> 02:54:32,542
- It is forbidden for you to interfere...
- Those things I can do

1493
02:54:32,712 --> 02:54:36,045
all those powers,
and I couldn't even save him.

1494
02:54:36,216 --> 02:54:37,877
It is forbidden.

1495
02:54:40,303 --> 02:54:42,510
It is forbidden.

1496
02:54:46,518 --> 02:54:50,227
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

1497
02:54:50,397 --> 02:54:52,308
It is forbidden.

1498
02:56:10,310 --> 02:56:11,766
Don't bother, I think it's dead.

1499
02:56:13,646 --> 02:56:15,728
Sure it's dead.

1500
02:56:16,858 --> 02:56:20,271
The problem with men of steel, there's
never one around when you want one.

1501
02:56:20,445 --> 02:56:22,777
Know what happened to me
while you were Off flying?

1502
02:56:22,947 --> 02:56:24,483
I was almost in an earthquake

1503
02:56:24,657 --> 02:56:26,648
I had this gas station blow up

1504
02:56:26,826 --> 02:56:29,158
there's telephone poles
falling all over

1505
02:56:29,370 --> 02:56:32,157
I'm almost killed,
and to top the whole thing off

1506
02:56:32,332 --> 02:56:33,947
this stupid car runs out of gas!

1507
02:56:34,125 --> 02:56:35,990
I'm sorry about that, Lois,

1508
02:56:36,169 --> 02:56:38,330
but I've been kind of busy
for a while.

1509
02:56:40,924 --> 02:56:43,381
I'm sorry. That's all right.

1510
02:56:44,469 --> 02:56:46,710
We're sort of alike, aren't we?

1511
02:56:46,930 --> 02:56:49,717
I mean, our work comes first.

1512
02:57:02,779 --> 02:57:04,315
Hey!

1513
02:57:04,864 --> 02:57:06,149
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1514
02:57:06,533 --> 02:57:09,149
You put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1515
02:57:09,327 --> 02:57:11,363
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.

1516
02:57:11,538 --> 02:57:14,200
- I had no idea if you were coming back...
- Jimmy.

1517
02:57:15,583 --> 02:57:18,871
Listen, there's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1518
02:57:21,214 --> 02:57:23,671
He can't stay still for a second.

1519
02:57:25,468 --> 02:57:27,925
You could at least send for a tow truck!

1520
02:57:28,096 --> 02:57:32,339
Oh. Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent didn't see all this.

1521
02:57:32,517 --> 02:57:34,098
Yeah, poor Clark.

1522
02:57:34,269 --> 02:57:36,260
He's never around when S...

1523
02:57:36,646 --> 02:57:38,011
Clark... Wait a minute.

1524
02:57:38,189 --> 02:57:39,975
Wait a minute -What?

1525
02:57:41,526 --> 02:57:43,767
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea ever.

1526
02:57:43,945 --> 02:57:47,688
Let me tell you something, Miss Lane,
I think he really cares about you.

1527
02:57:47,866 --> 02:57:49,948
- Clark? Of course he does.
- NO, not Clark.

1528
02:57:53,371 --> 02:57:57,956
Oh, well, Superman cares
about everybody, Jimmy.

1529
02:57:58,376 --> 02:58:02,710
But, who knows, someday,
maybe, if he's lucky...

1530
02:58:04,632 --> 02:58:05,792
- Miss Lane?
- Hm?

1531
02:58:07,427 --> 02:58:10,134
Jimmy, my hair!

1532
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,840
Now.

1533
02:58:12,515 --> 02:58:14,881
Ooh, nice. Nice, nice.

1534
02:58:15,059 --> 02:58:17,141
Front page, Daily Planet?

1535
02:58:18,605 --> 02:58:21,267
Oh, gosh. I didn't have any film.

1536
02:58:31,326 --> 02:58:35,535
You must have been a beautiful baby.

1537
02:58:35,705 --> 02:58:40,119
You must have been a wonderful child.

1538
02:58:40,293 --> 02:58:45,788
When you were only starting
To go to kindergarten

1539
02:58:45,965 --> 02:58:49,628
I'll bet you drove the little boys wild.

1540
02:58:51,262 --> 02:58:57,633
And when it came to winning blue ribbons
Bet you showed the other kids how

1541
02:58:57,810 --> 02:59:02,019
I can see the judges' eyes
As they handed you the prize.

1542
02:59:04,067 --> 02:59:07,434
I bet you made the cutest bow.

1543
02:59:07,654 --> 02:59:13,991
Oh, you must've been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby...

1544
02:59:14,577 --> 02:59:17,159
But Lex, you can't do this to me.

1545
02:59:17,330 --> 02:59:19,366
Why, Lex, why?

1546
02:59:19,874 --> 02:59:22,866
Because I love you, Miss Teschmacher.

1547
02:59:26,464 --> 02:59:27,624
Miss Teschmacher...

1548
02:59:38,810 --> 02:59:41,973
By the way Miss Teschmacher,
your mother sends her love.

1549
02:59:53,241 --> 02:59:54,856
You're messing up my suit.

1550
02:59:55,034 --> 02:59:56,774
You big lummox, you.

1551
02:59:56,953 --> 02:59:59,035
Come on, stop it, will you.

1552
02:59:59,205 --> 03:00:01,787
Otis, it's your fault.
Watch the ground!

1553
03:00:02,542 --> 03:00:03,873
Good evening, warden.

1554
03:00:04,043 --> 03:00:05,783
These two men should be safe here

1555
03:00:06,004 --> 03:00:08,370
- until they can get a fair trial.
- WhO is it?

1556
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:12,381
Lex Luthor!

1557
03:00:12,552 --> 03:00:15,294
- The greatest criminal mind Of our time!
- Of our time!

1558
03:00:15,471 --> 03:00:17,052
- I hereby serve notice...
- Notice

1559
03:00:17,223 --> 03:00:18,963
- that these walls...
- These walls here...

1560
03:00:19,142 --> 03:00:20,302
Will you shut up, please.

1561
03:00:20,476 --> 03:00:21,966
All right, take them away, boys.

1562
03:00:22,145 --> 03:00:24,557
- You nitwit. Nincompoop!
- Guard, guard...

1563
03:00:24,731 --> 03:00:28,815
This country is safe again, Superman,
thanks to you.

1564
03:00:28,985 --> 03:00:31,021
No, sir. Don't thank me, warden.

1565
03:00:31,654 --> 03:00:33,815
We're all part of the same team.

1566
03:00:34,032 --> 03:00:35,522
Night.
