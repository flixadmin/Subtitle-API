1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,126
When the public found out
about the excessive lifestyle

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,209
of the prisoners at La Catedral,

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,330
the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,483
being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,770
The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,888
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,727
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,290
It's from upstairs.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,570
Oh, I get a card.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,050
Oh, CIA.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,771
"Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency."

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,049
This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,969
Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,560
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,161
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,806
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,566
Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,481
Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,370
I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,363
- Ambassador...
- Good, report to Washington.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,807
'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,850
associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,845
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,485
Go home.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,570
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,922
Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,767
Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,242
It's clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,964
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,044
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,360
Forgive me, Eduardo...

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,291
but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,322
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

34
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,528
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

35
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,486
Ahh!

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,206
Good morning, boss.

37
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,125
Bad news.

38
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,042
Have the bodies disappeared?

39
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,163
Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

40
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,768
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

41
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,888
Yes, yes,
but we have to tread carefully.

42
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,323
If he feels we're violating his terms,

43
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,171
he'll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

44
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,323
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

45
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,609
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

46
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,365
while we improve security
at La Catedral.

47
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,011
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

48
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,401
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

49
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,608
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,490
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,607
Hm.

52
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,241
Can we trust him?

53
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,169
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,041
Success.

55
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,005
Sure, <i>it</i> cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,280
I just call <i>it</i> a week's paternity leave.

57
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,968
I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

58
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,566
See, because of me and Peña,

59
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,962
the Colombian government
was sending <i>in</i> the army.

60
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,611
Not the cops,
but the fucking army.

61
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,841
There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

62
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,163
But, then again, <i>in</i> Colombia...

63
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,971
nothing goes down
the way you think <i>it</i> will.

64
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,405
I'm calling him.

65
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,289
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

66
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,601
I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

67
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,523
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

68
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,961
Pablo, what's happening?

69
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,566
Why would something
be happening here?

70
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,801
The soldiers.

71
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,051
Soldiers?

72
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,125
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

73
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,770
I don't know, Pablo.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,363
Tell me what's happening.

75
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,166
No, my love, it's nothing.

76
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,924
Everything is cool.

77
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,802
I'll call back soon, all right?

78
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,843
I love you, baby.

79
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,485
Yes, my love.

80
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,884
Get out the weapons.

81
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,442
As you wish, sir.

82
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
Listen up, company!

83
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,368
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

84
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,802
Let's secure the perimeter.

85
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,963
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

86
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,329
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.

87
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,601
Dismissed.

88
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,003
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

89
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,651
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

90
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,441
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

91
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,444
to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,361
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

93
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,369
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!

94
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,804
The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

95
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
the keys still in the ignition.

96
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,130
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

97
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,010
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

98
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,326
What? Why not?

99
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,325
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

100
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,926
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

101
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,202
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

102
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,851
I'm gonna take care of this.

103
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,050
I'll find out where he is, all right?

104
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,487
Look, I'll make you a drink.

105
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,284
Boss...

106
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,089
they're gonna
try to take you out of here

107
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,164
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

108
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,811
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

109
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,409
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

110
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,411
What the fuck,
let's give those bastards lead.

111
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,051
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

112
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,929
For every one of our men,
they have 20!

113
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,010
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

114
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,811
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,241
We have the escape routes.

116
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,762
We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

117
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,562
There is a time to fight...

118
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,968
and there is a time to be clever.

119
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,490
Yes, sir.

120
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,886
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

121
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,530
Be smart.

122
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,643
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

123
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,369
If that fails?

124
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,529
What the hell are you doing back here?

125
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,524
- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.

126
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,568
Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

127
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,085
We gotta talk.

128
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,771
Back here.

129
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,449
What? You get a hooker pregnant?

130
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,648
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

131
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,121
I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

132
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,804
We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

133
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,769
It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

134
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,729
Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

135
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,848
If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm fire,

136
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,649
and whoever has him might panic.

137
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,849
If it is Escobar,
he's dead already.

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,720
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

139
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,124
Jesus Christ.

140
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,604
Let me see what I can do.

141
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,323
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

142
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,530
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

143
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,082
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.

144
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,845
You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

145
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,083
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

146
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,128
We both know that's not true.

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,927
But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

148
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,887
Yes, Mr. President.

149
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,326
What's wrong?

150
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,849
I've got a bad feeling about this.

151
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,448
Eduardo, I trust you...

152
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,242
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

153
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,406
I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

154
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,323
You know that very well.

155
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,450
Nothing will make me happier than to see
that asshole get the justice he deserves.

156
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,804
Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

157
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,362
So there's no indication Escobar had
anything to do with Murphy's disappearance?

158
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,566
It's time to sound the alarm.

159
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,923
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

160
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,441
We call out the troops,
he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.

161
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,761
Thanks.

162
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,770
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet

163
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,968
until further notice, understand?

164
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,611
All right. What else do you have?

165
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,765
- I know that.
- Velasco.

166
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,444
I'll call you back.

167
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,165
Yes, boss?

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,043
What's happening outside?

169
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,049
We don't know.

170
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,888
I fucked up.

171
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,170
What's that, boss?

172
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,883
Gather the boys.

173
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,529
And tell the prison guards they're
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

174
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,604
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

175
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,563
They'd better. I hired them.

176
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,291
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

177
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,921
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

178
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,046
Mm.

179
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,888
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

180
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,042
General!

181
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,248
Let him through.

182
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,163
Good evening, General.

183
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,129
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

184
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,929
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,050
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

186
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,726
Inside the prison, obviously.

187
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,848
What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

188
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,890
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

189
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,521
I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

190
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,728
Then what were your orders?

191
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,691
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

192
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,489
and wait for you.

193
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,607
That's not what the president believes.

194
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,127
He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

195
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,044
I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

196
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,930
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

197
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,247
But since there is
no justice in this country,

198
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,448
he is the vice minister of nothing.

199
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,770
This is good.

200
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,123
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

201
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,044
This is very good.

202
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,846
General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

203
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,811
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

204
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,526
I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

205
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,491
I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

206
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,201
And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

207
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,489
I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

208
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,762
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

209
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,448
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

210
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,090
At least let me make a call
so they don't shoot you when you walk in!

211
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,846
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

212
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,929
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

213
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,526
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

214
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,761
Open it.

215
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,563
Vice Minister, good evening.

216
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,291
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

217
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,085
Wait here.

218
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,768
Good evening, Vice Minister.

219
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,242
It's been a while.

220
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,645
Good evening.

221
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,049
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

222
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,090
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

223
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,170
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

224
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,641
for your safety
and everyone else's here.

225
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,846
Mm.

226
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,928
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

227
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,884
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

228
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,440
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.

229
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,531
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

230
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,370
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

231
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,081
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

232
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,491
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

233
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,849
We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

234
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,771
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

235
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,205
and take me to the US?

236
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,290
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

237
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,643
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

238
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,609
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

239
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,250
- Your word.
- Mm.

240
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,565
As vice minister of justice?

241
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,770
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,403
Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

243
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,364
We can end this peacefully...

244
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,967
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

245
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,844
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

246
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,449
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

247
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,727
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

248
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,966
If Gaviria wants me out of here...

249
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,489
he can come here...
and do it himself.

250
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,122
Meanwhile...

251
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,128
I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

252
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,365
I'll inform the president
of your position.

253
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,370
Excuse me.

254
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,082
Mr. Vice Minister.

255
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,250
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

256
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,568
I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

257
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,324
Let me out!

258
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,724
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

259
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,445
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

260
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,531
I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

261
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,368
It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

262
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,645
Come on, Vice Minister.

263
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,081
Calm down, let's go.

264
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,363
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

265
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,363
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

266
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,086
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?

267
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,724
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,284
Just trying to hold it together.

269
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,967
God, I just wanna go home.

270
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,689
I want my husband back.

271
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,004
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,926
No.

273
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,603
You're just not sure he's dead.

274
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,330
What's taking this guy so long?

275
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,168
General, with all due respect,

276
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,528
I don't think we should've
let him go inside.

277
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,769
No.

278
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,970
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

279
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,648
Can I get you something to drink?

280
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,241
I don't need anything.

281
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,051
Look, don't be so nervous.

282
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,290
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

283
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,520
that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

284
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,444
there will be grave consequences.

285
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,284
But if he withdraws the troops,

286
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,490
we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

287
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,487
Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

288
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,281
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

289
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,930
One minute, please.

290
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,049
Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

291
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,930
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

292
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,287
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.

293
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,161
Hello?

294
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,042
Hello?

295
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,930
How long will I be here
as a hostage?

296
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,768
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

297
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,249
Escobar has Sandoval
inside the prison.

298
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,527
Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

299
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,166
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

300
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,526
Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

301
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,809
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

302
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,526
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

303
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,166
Hang up the phone. Sir!

304
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,761
Leave us alone.

305
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,167
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.

306
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,810
Shut up!

307
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,131
So, then...

308
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,890
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

309
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,047
I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

310
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,129
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

311
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,330
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

312
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,847
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

313
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,646
Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

314
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,611
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

315
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,126
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

316
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,206
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

317
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,003
Do I have your permission?

318
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,401
Good.

319
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,763
María Clara, connect me
with DAS, immediately.

320
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,322
- No. No.
- Cancel the call.

321
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,170
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

322
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,243
If Sandoval dies...

323
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,731
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

324
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,766
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

325
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,928
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

326
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,850
I just realized something.

327
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,728
The president didn't just betray me...

328
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,404
he also betrayed you.

329
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,204
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

330
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,123
...there would be three options.

331
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,683
One: I leave with you, peacefully.

332
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,367
Two: I take you hostage.

333
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,167
Three: I shoot you,

334
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,371
and then, he really would
have a good excuse to kill me.

335
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,601
Right?

336
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,210
Either way, he wins.
Right?

337
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,847
Maybe the president
is betraying us both.

338
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,888
You could be right.

339
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,883
But you know something?

340
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,851
I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're dead.

341
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,810
You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

342
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,361
I come from nothing.

343
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,921
I fought hard
to become what I am.

344
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,330
If the government
hadn't come after me...

345
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,202
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

346
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,361
You and I are nothing alike.

347
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,448
You are a criminal.

348
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,687
And criminals can't run forever.

349
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,521
Sir.

350
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:30,440
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

351
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,091
while you're still inside.

352
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,122
I would have done the same thing.

353
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,206
Don't kill him.

354
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,326
If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

355
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,209
Good luck, Vice Minister.

356
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,126
Now what?

357
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,163
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

358
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,730
Damn right we do.

359
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,571
Hey, partner.

360
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,089
Remember how I told you
that no one <i>in</i> their right mind

361
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,242
would ever kill a DEA agent?

362
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,165
Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

363
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,442
I'd forgotten that, myself.

364
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,923
But then, I calmed down and realized
that <i>if</i> they wanted to kill me,

365
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,129
they would've blown my brains out
right <i>in</i> front of my house.

366
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,124
This... was something different.

367
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,846
I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

368
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,408
and grabbing
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.

369
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,120
Sit.

370
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,208
Man, you fucked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

371
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,725
No. No!

372
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,089
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin'
prison and blow his fuckin' head off!

373
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,171
I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

374
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,768
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

375
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,642
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

376
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,444
but you've made a huge mistake.

377
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,844
I don't see it that way.

378
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,126
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

379
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,330
I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

380
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,961
That's wonderful,
but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.

381
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,601
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

382
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,963
Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

383
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,328
I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

384
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,082
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

385
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,881
to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

386
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,882
Two hours later, they were dead.

387
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,647
Along with an innocent woman.

388
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,640
OK.

389
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,201
Poison will be at La Dispensaria

390
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,203
at around midnight with his crew.

391
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,808
Who's your contact at the embassy?

392
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,526
Did you know she had two kids?

393
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,401
What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

394
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,721
Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

395
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,287
I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

396
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,966
You'd lose your career at the DEA,

397
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,682
go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

398
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,371
But don't worry.

399
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,761
I won't ask you or Javier Peña

400
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,003
to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

401
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,763
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

402
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,083
There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

403
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,845
who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

404
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,968
The families of Moncada and Galeano,

405
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,089
the families of judges and police...

406
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,607
people with resources
who need to be unified.

407
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,609
They want vengeance.

408
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,490
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

409
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,611
I can't make any commitments right now.

410
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,921
But I can tell you this:

411
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,489
When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

412
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,484
you'll hear a knock at your door,

413
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,006
and it'll be me.

414
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,291
You haven't tried my daiquiri.

415
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,051
That Herrera's a pretty good host.

416
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,011
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

417
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,560
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

418
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,051
What'd he say?

419
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,124
You fuckin' gave him that information.

420
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,005
He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

421
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,531
Answer me.

422
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,290
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

423
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,569
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

424
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,371
That your version of "all in"?

425
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,490
I got one goal: get Escobar.

426
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,363
That's not an answer.

427
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,969
Who gave him the fucking photos?

428
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,044
Hey.

429
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,803
See you around, Jav.

430
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,565
I'm gonna go call my wife.

431
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,806
Sir, I have her on the line.

432
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,362
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

433
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,604
Look, we're having
a little problem here.

434
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,527
We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

435
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,568
if it doesn't work out, right?

436
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,210
Yes, Pablo.

437
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,764
I love you very much.

438
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,885
Me, too.

439
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,531
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.

440
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,962
We are bandits.

441
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,567
- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

442
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,689
You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

443
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,723
Come on, come on.

444
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,002
- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

445
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,848
Don't move, don't move!

446
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,961
- All clear!
- All clear!

447
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,600
- Don't move! Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

448
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,124
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

449
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,204
Speak.

450
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,282
Yes, it's him.

451
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,011
Speak up, please,
I can't hear you.

452
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,725
Is that confirmed?

453
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,689
Wait a minute.

454
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,046
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

455
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,489
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

456
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,810
And Escobar?

457
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,805
- All clear!
- All clear!

458
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,490
- All clear!
- All clear!

459
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,324
Look what we found.

460
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,249
Do you think he's OK?

461
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,603
I'm sure he's fine.

462
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,649
See you tomorrow.

463
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,126
Good night.

464
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,083
It's OK... it's OK.

465
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,964
It's OK.

466
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,163
Steve...

467
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,322
I just wanna go home.

468
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,010
This is home.

469
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,365
Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

470
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,684
word had spread all over Colombia
that war was coming again.

471
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,206
But this time would be different.

472
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,329
This time,
there would be no surrender...

473
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,165
no negotiations...

474
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,924
no deals.

475
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,487
This time...
we were gonna kill him.

476
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,929
Escobar said, "Better a grave
<i>in</i> Colombia than a cell <i>in</i> the US."

477
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,926
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

478
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,207
That works for me.
