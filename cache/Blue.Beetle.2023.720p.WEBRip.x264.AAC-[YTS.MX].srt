1
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:23,487
Lieutenant Carapax,

2
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,152
tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,428
- They're cutting into it now.
- Ah. That's exciting.

4
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:30,044
I've had them working
around the clock

5
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,025
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

6
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,366
Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

7
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:35,903
until we're ready
to show the board.

8
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,402
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

9
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:40,768
- Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
- Sorry.

10
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:42,309
Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

11
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:44,508
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

12
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,841
We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

13
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:49,049
Well, push your men harder.

14
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:50,382
I've searched for 15 years.

15
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,314
I don't want
to wait another second.

16
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,791
Should've called before
making the trip out, Miss Kord.

17
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,085
This could be another decoy.

18
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,654
It's in there.

19
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,321
I can feel it.

20
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,095
All right.
Let's do this.

21
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:31,036
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

22
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,239
Like you're six figures in debt.

23
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,115
Okay.

24
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,952
We say nothing for now.

25
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:47,422
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

26
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:48,558
I'll tell him.

27
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,658
What the hell? Why not?

28
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:52,793
Even good news...

29
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,037
And this is pretty bad news.

30
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,735
I can be joyful.

31
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,836
Your job is the balloon.

32
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,306
Hope I can handle it.

33
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,675
Handle what?

34
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,677
Hey, hey, hey!

35
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,482
The graduate is here!

36
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:10,944
- How was your flight?
- Good.

37
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,185
- Are you hungry?
- Of course.

38
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,050
Here. It's all they had.

39
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,218
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:20,121
Nana!

41
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,663
Now we hug!

42
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,300
Hey, where's Uncle Rudy?

43
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:49,250
Welcome back,
<i>pinche</i> college boy.

44
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,355
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

45
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,924
No. No hugs, man.

46
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,298
They got<i> Big Brother</i> watching.
There's cameras.

47
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:55,927
I knew you were gonna
say something.

48
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,301
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

49
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:58,474
Yeah, and they're all so happy

50
00:05:58,498 --> 00:05:59,798
to finally catch you.

51
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,138
You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

52
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,402
that's gonna get us all busted.

53
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:03,602
Where'd you get this?

54
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,234
I bought it for Jaime.

55
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,978
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

56
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,405
Come on. What are you doing?

57
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:24,486
Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

58
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,090
Good to know
some things don't change.

59
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,859
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

60
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,493
- Milagro.
- What?

61
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,665
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

62
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,537
The truth? What is it?

63
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:40,767
- We...
- We...

64
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:41,769
We're losing the house.

65
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,569
What?

66
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,275
See?

67
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,956
- He didn't take it that bad.
- No, no, no, losing the house?

68
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,475
What does she mean,
losing the house?

69
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:50,157
- The landlord tripled the rent.
- They gave us three months

70
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,621
to come up with the money
or get out.

71
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:53,347
I am so sorry,<i> flaquito.</i>

72
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:56,656
No.<i> Ama,</i> don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

73
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,756
It just means that
we're gonna have to

74
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,063
bust our ass at the shop, right?

75
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,893
Mmm... auto shop's gone.

76
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:04,930
- How?
- You can thank Kord for that.

77
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,895
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

78
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:09,367
Especially since your dad, he...

79
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,265
He, uh... had a...

80
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,666
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

81
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,668
What?

82
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,076
I'm fine!

83
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,744
At least the food's the same.

84
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,408
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

85
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,950
You were working so hard,
<i>mi amor.</i>

86
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,488
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

87
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:30,487
Ma, I could have done something.

88
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:31,822
I could have come back.

89
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:34,019
I could have been here.
I could have...

90
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,287
<i>Animo,</i> Jaime.

91
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,194
We figured it out.
We always do.

92
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:41,728
We have a lot
to be grateful for.<i> Mira...</i>

93
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,407
Yeah. And the last!

94
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,334
Yes, because you didn't apply.

95
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,775
What, so I can get into debt

96
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,278
for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

97
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,377
What? 25%?

98
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>Mi amor,</i>
these people make nothing.

99
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,284
We are broke.

100
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,418
Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

101
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:21,705
<i>Remember how Mom taught us salsa</i>

102
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,172
<i>right there on the front porch?</i>

103
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,111
<i>You were always better than me.</i>

104
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:26,649
<i>Yeah.
No, I still think you don't know</i>

105
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,410
<i>how to dance salsa.</i>

106
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,954
<i>Yeah, I got
two left feet. I can't help it.</i>

107
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:31,246
<i>Yeah.</i>

108
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,447
<i>Do you remember
your 21st birthday?</i>

109
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:36,155
<i>I remember the first half.</i>

110
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,754
<i>I can't believe
we're losing this place.</i>

111
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,586
<i>It was rough.</i>

112
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,187
<i>Yeah, well,
I'm not leaving again.</i>

113
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,061
What about grad school?

114
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,228
Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

115
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,364
I can't get us
into even more debt.

116
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,036
<i>Animo,</i> bro.

117
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,571
Okay, you always land
on your feet.

118
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:57,239
You're "Jaime."

119
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,872
Thank you, but...

120
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:04,484
This wasn't how it was
supposed to happen, Mili.

121
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,079
What was supposed to happen?

122
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:08,283
I was supposed to make it out.

123
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,217
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

124
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,925
Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

125
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,523
- You know what I meant.
- Yeah.

126
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,297
Doesn't it bother you

127
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:23,013
that they talk about progress
and get everything

128
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,557
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

129
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,969
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys,<i> carnal.</i>

130
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,538
That progress is not for us.

131
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:33,242
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

132
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:36,080
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

133
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,727
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

134
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,013
and now they want that, too.

135
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,019
I still have a degree, right?

136
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:43,921
That's gotta mean something.
I'll get a job.

137
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:47,356
Not just any job,
but a prime job.

138
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:49,489
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

139
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,494
Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

140
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,903
in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

141
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,543
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

142
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,565
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

143
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,910
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

144
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:07,573
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

145
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,917
Just watch.

146
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,238
Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

147
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,344
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

148
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,111
This is bullshit.

149
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:47,281
Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

150
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,422
for hooking me up
with this gig."

151
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:53,122
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out the way you wanted.

152
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,498
How am I supposed to
get experience

153
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:55,958
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

154
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,590
Sounds like a "you" problem.

155
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:01,968
Seriously?

156
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,003
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

157
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,564
Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

158
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,568
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

159
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,572
- With the actual code in hand...
- Hey.

160
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,950
- ...we can move beyond the prototype phase.
- Check it out.

161
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,139
Yes, yes.

162
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,048
There goes Victoria Kord.

163
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,909
Look at that walk.

164
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:21,049
She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

165
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:22,283
I don't think so.

166
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,698
- I'm gonna say hi.
- What? No...

167
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,052
Good afternoon, ma'am.

168
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,952
If you want, we could.

169
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,095
It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

170
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,262
Mm-hm.

171
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,567
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

172
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:36,700
It's like our superpower.

173
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,536
Okay. Back to work.

174
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,974
I agree. That's a waste of time,
but General, I am telling you

175
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,037
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

176
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,106
is gonna blow you away.

177
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:48,641
Yes. I look forward, also.

178
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,648
Bye.

179
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:52,352
Aunt Vicki?

180
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:59,054
Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

181
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,585
I didn't know you were coming.

182
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,695
Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

183
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,395
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

184
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,003
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

185
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,636
<i>The world has changed.</i>

186
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:18,178
<i>Kord Industries faces
an unprecedented challenge</i>

187
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:22,709

both here and abroad,</i>

188
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:25,418
<i>from our promethium mines
in Guatemala,</i>

189
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:29,848

the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

192
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,562
Where are we going?

193
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:43,101
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

194
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,976
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,870
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

196
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,773
I...

197
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:55,743

<i>The O.M.A.C.</i>

204
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:20,801
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

205
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:25,811
So, this... project
was shut down years ago.

206
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,745
Why have you relaunched it?

207
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,782
Jennifer, the O.M.A.C. is
the future of this company.

208
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,450
You should be so excited.

209
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:37,054
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

210
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,118
- That's classified.
- Mm.

211
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:40,522
It's a secret.

212
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,217
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

213
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,930
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

214
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,393
It's gonna be an amazing evening

215
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:46,991
with some
very interesting people,

216
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,966
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

217
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:51,102
All right, see you later.

218
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,071
I know what you're doing, Vicki.

219
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,972
We don't make weapons anymore.

220
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,145
Whoa, whoa, "we"?

221
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,808
Who's "we"?

222
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:04,478
You are nothing to this
company. You're an expense.

223
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:06,945
A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

224
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:10,356
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

225
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:12,757
- doing your "charity work."
- My father would never...

226
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:16,424
Look, your father was handed
a company I built... my company.

227
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,529
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

228
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:22,094
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

229
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,703
and then after he'd done all
that, you know what he did?

230
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,005
He just disappeared,

231
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,469
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

232
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,309
Your father
abandoned this company.

233
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,240
And he abandoned you.

234
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,512
I won't let you do this.

235
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:42,819
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

236
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:44,553
Back away.

237
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,751
I'm not afraid of you.

238
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,027
Maybe you should be.

239
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:51,296
Hey, hey!

240
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:55,665
Uh, sh... she said
to back away, ma'am.

241
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,935
Oooh-whee!

242
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,307
That was lavish!

243
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,073
Oh, shit.

244
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,808
And who are you, handsome?

245
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,251
Jaime Reyes.

246
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:15,251
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

247
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:18,590
- I'm...
- You, too, toilet. Go.

248
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:19,852
<i>Andale.</i>

249
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,559
Thanks.

250
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:26,799
Where's the car?

251
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,531
Uh, 47 minutes.

252
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,333
Hey, are you okay? That was...

253
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:35,108
I appreciate the chivalry,

254
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:36,737
but I can take care
of myself, okay?

255
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:41,212
Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

256
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:43,275
She's a Kord.
They're all dicks.

257
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,417
Jenny Kord.

258
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:49,583
We're not all dicks.

259
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:52,357
- Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
- Uh...

260
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,793
Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

261
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,297
It's fine.

262
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,006
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

263
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,561
Okay. Yeah.

264
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:02,865
Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,736
Okay.

266
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,844
I might be able to get you a job
somewhere else in our company.

267
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,537
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

268
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:11,006
I'll do anything. Really.

269
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:12,870
Anything, huh?

270
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,145
Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

271
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,842
- Pre-law.
- I... Yeah.

272
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:18,980
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

273
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:20,148
Okay.

274
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,284
- Text me.
- Okay.

275
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,819
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

276
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,626
Nice to meet you, too...

277
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,130
Jenny Kord.

278
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,199
I think she might be into you.

279
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,237
What? No.

280
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:39,467
Bye.

281
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:42,066
- You think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,640
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

283
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:49,012
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

284
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:50,314
Hey, you know what?

285
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,757
Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

286
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,251
- like<i> Maria la del Barrio.</i>
- Okay.

287
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,052
Except, she's
the rich white dude

288
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:56,714
and you're the Maria!

289
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,890
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:02,718
You drinking?

291
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,358
- Just one.
- Okay.

292
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:08,757
Don't tell your mother.

293
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,794
Can't sleep?

294
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:14,933
No.

295
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,931
Yeah.

296
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,271
I planted those<i> nopales</i> with
<i>la</i> Nana,

297
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:23,640
when you were a baby.

298
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,611
Look at them now.

299
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:30,581
Like you and<i> la</i> Mili,
grown and beautiful.

300
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,783
You okay?

301
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:36,653
Yeah.

302
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,793
Sorry,<i> Apa,</i> it's just
everything right now

303
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,724
feels so out of reach, and...

304
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,658
I feel like I failed you guys.

305
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:54,165
We're on a journey, Jaime...

306
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,338
This house, the<i> nopales,</i>
<i>el</i> auto shop.

307
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,543
Everything.

308
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,743
They're just a stop
in the journey.

309
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:06,280
But this isn't the destination.

310
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:07,820
And what is it?

311
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,347
I don't know.

312
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,492
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

313
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,789
Things don't last.

314
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:20,096
<i>La familia,</i> that's forever.

315
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,731
That lasts.

316
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:31,209
Everyone has a purpose.

317
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:33,706
You just haven't found yours.

318
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,679
So what's your purpose then?

319
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:40,079
I'm still searching, too.

320
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:43,720
But right now, it's this.

321
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,691
Talking to you, right here.

- Oh, you can stand there.
- Okay.

Okay. Thank you.

It's me. Jaime from yesterday.

371

- I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
- No, that's all good.

372
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,839
But you know, yesterday you
said you'd consider getting me a job

373
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:18,594
and, you know,
I can't leave without one

374
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,129
even if that sounds too...

375
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:21,812
Do you think you could pause
for one second? Please...

376
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,396
Look, Jaime,
this is really a bad time.

377
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,437
Okay. Let's... let's talk
while you have lunch.

Stay on comms.

380
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,708
You said you'd
do anything, right?

381
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,608
Yeah. Basically, anything.

382
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:36,978
Here.

383
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:38,712
- Guard that with your life.
- Okay.

384
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:40,080
But do not open it.

385
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:42,051
Do not touch it!
Don't even look at it!

386
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:43,732
Okay. I'm just gonna
guard it with my life.

387
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:45,050
Yeah, you're a quick learner.

388
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:46,723
- Yeah.
- Good. Now go!

389
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:48,288

You two, with me!

391
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:16,787
So, you went in to get us jobs,

392
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:19,691
and all you brought back
was a hamburger?

393
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:21,130
Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

394
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,593
You haven't looked?

395
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,222
She said not to open it. I...

396
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,764
Oh...

397
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,899
- She's not here.
- What?

398
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,198
Okay, okay. One look.

399
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,809
Oh, you guys are so childish.

400

Huh.

402
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,250
Why was she hiding it?

403
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:47,213
I don't know.

404
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,817
Hm.
It's kind of a letdown.

405

The world's biggest tick.

406
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,787
Okay. You guys are the ones
who wanted to see it.

but she said to not open it, so please...

409

Mmm, she said for you
to not open it, bro.

410
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,964
Stop, stop. Hey,<i> oye.</i>

- Okay, okay.

I'm gonna use a motor,
all right?

413
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:09,579
- I'm gonna get my drill.
- Wait, wait!

414
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:11,163
Don't get the drill!
What are you doing?

415
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:12,940
God, I hate when you do that.

00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,620

00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:28,165
- Cut what?
- ...and flew into orbit.

<i>- Apa,</i> I don't know.

No police. They work for Kord.

when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

has that type of military tech
inside of him?

578
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,843
They're gonna lock his ass up.

579
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,744
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

580

so that we don't tell anybody.

581
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,662
And it's not like
the government isn't

582
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:51,046
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

583
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,492
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

584
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:57,989
- This is Area 51!
- Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

585
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:00,824
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

586
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,567
are gonna be all over this,

587
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,374
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

588
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:07,969
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

589
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:10,406
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

593
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,461
- Jaime, you flew out of the roof.
- You don't understand.

- No, I'm not.
- Oh!

596

- Stalked her Insta.
- Where'd I put my...

597
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,585
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

598
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:27,822
And she's single, by the way.

599
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,389

601
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,562

603

Okay.

And that... that's Rudy.

We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

641
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,020
Thinking about turning our
house into a nuclear power plant?

642
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,534
I went swimming out there

00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:53,602
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

645
00:38:53,737 --> 00:38:55,806
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

646
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:58,676
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

647
00:38:59,643 --> 00:39:01,644
- Where is it?
- Yeah.

648
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,246
Allow me.

649
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:05,549
Rudy! What?

650
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:07,514
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

651
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,553
I thought the<i> chingaderas</i>
would come out.

652
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:14,088
- Come out?
- Jeez.

653
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:16,343
- What is he talking about?
- He's talking about this.

654
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,031
Oh, I forgot how bad it looks.

655
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:22,554
No, it doesn't look that bad.

656
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:24,732
I've seen worse.

657
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,504
- Where?
- You don't wanna know.

658
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,406
Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

659
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,201
It's... it's called the Scarab.

660
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:33,106
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

661
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,607
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

662
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:36,974
Oh, that's nice.

663
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,447
- Weapon?
- What did she say?

664
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:40,785
What?

665
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,960
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

666
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:45,418
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

667
00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,685
No, I swear to you, I had
no idea this would happen.

668
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,355
I mean, come on.

669
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:51,538
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

670
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:52,994
It has to choose you.

671
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:56,763
So I'm guessing it's chosen you.

672
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,163
No more blind dates.

673
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:01,572
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

674
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,974
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

675
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,203
because my aunt will kill
us all just to get it back.

676
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,677
Kill us?

677
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:09,120
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

678
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:10,584
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

679
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,611
Yeah.

680
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,215
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

681
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:20,588
I had no idea it would activate.

682
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:21,956
Really. I didn't know.

683
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,825
That's convenient.

684
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,335
But she already said
she didn't know.

685
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,464
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

686
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,535
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

687
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:36,672
Come on, we are the Reyes.

688
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:38,973
We've dealt with harder things.

689
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,339
We have?

690
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:45,513
<i>Animo.</i> We can do this.

691
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,186
Yeah. Yeah,<i> Apa.</i>

692
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,481
He's right.

693
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:55,158
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

694
00:40:55,294 --> 00:40:57,793
You know, before it busts
another hole in our house.

695
00:40:57,929 --> 00:40:59,863
Exactly.

696
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:02,932
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

697
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,063
But we need the key.

698
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,800
Okay, so where's the key?

699
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:09,669
At the Kord building.

700
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,187
And they're probably on high alert
over there since I took the Scarab.

701
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:15,742
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

702
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:17,548
Wide area motion imagery?

703
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,982
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

704
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,782
I really don't...

705
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,517
Because I've been working on
something that I believe can help us.

706
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,089
And it's almost finished.

707
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:29,944
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

708
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:31,056
Mm. I love you, Ma.

709
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,991
Give me a couple hours.

710
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:05,462
You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

711
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:06,763
you'd be the most powerful

712
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,428
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

713
00:42:08,564 --> 00:42:10,713
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

714
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,797
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

715
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:16,139
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

716
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:19,107
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

717
00:42:19,242 --> 00:42:22,105
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

718
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:23,914
during the anti-communist

719
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:27,478
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

720
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,953
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

721
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,951
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

722
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:33,555
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

723
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:38,325
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

724
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,500
- When will it be ready?
- Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

725
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:44,029
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

726
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,733
We have a problem.

727
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,597
Well, if you'll excuse us.

728
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,502
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

729
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:55,943
You lost her? How?

730
00:42:56,078 --> 00:42:57,609
My men saw someone helping her.

731
00:42:57,745 --> 00:43:00,481
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

732
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:03,987
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

733
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:07,417
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

734
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,256
This time I'll do it personally.

735
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,061
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

736
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:14,662
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

737
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:18,396
Just think of how much suffering
your body has been through.

738
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:20,935
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

739
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,673
My God... What<i> we've</i> done.

740
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:29,773
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

741
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:33,379
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

742
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:36,855
How badly crippled you were?

743
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,154
How broken?

744
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:44,459
I am just trying to fix you.

745
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:45,897
Okay?

746
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:49,898
Good.

747
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:51,969
I have to go back to the party.

748
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:55,940
Now, go get me that Scarab.

749
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:07,111
That's it?

750
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,284
I call it,<i> El Chapulin.</i>

751
00:44:11,522 --> 00:44:13,254
Why?

752
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,123
You know,
when you make something cool,

753
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,562
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

754
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,393
Here, be useful. Hold that.

755
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:21,999
You're sure that this one works?

756
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:24,201
Thank you. Yes.

757
00:44:24,337 --> 00:44:28,102
Unlike the junk that Kord
makes, my tech delivers.

758
00:44:28,238 --> 00:44:29,734
Okay. You could have
just said yes.

759
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,680
Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

760
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:33,107
Hit the yellow switch.

761
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:35,106
I just did.

762
00:44:37,781 --> 00:44:39,349
Okay.

763
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:41,157
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

764
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,753
It's going on your tab.

765
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,853
So just give me, like, one step.

766
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:46,189
Just gotta give it a little...

767
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,588
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

768
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:54,130
That's... that's great.
Uh, so it works.

769
00:44:54,265 --> 00:44:57,360
Uh, yeah, it works.

770
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,065
I'll keep the truck running.

771
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:00,268
- Let's go.
- Wow.

772
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,239
"So it works?"

773
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,408
Guys!

774
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:11,143
Something's happening.

775
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:18,154
What the hell is this?

776
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,952
<i>El Chapulin Colorado!</i>

777
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,526
<i>So join me and my little pals</i>

778
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,126
<i>and all of our Kord
subsidiaries...</i>

779
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:30,762
The key's here.

780
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,098
<i>...around the globe,
to build a better future.</i>

781
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:37,338
<i>A Kord future.</i>

782
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,774
She seemed so different
back then.

783
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,775
Vicki and my grandfather
started Kord Industries together...

784
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,885
and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

785
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,715
Then, when my grandfather died,

786
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,290
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

787
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:58,260
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

788
00:45:58,996 --> 00:46:00,663
- Seems kind of...
- Sexist?

789
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:01,959
Yeah.

790
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:03,661
Yeah.

791
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:06,230
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

792
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:08,132
in a different direction.

793
00:46:08,267 --> 00:46:12,010
So, Victoria became obsessed
with erasing my father's legacy.

794
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,310
Could I get a hand over here?

795
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,978
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

796
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:20,050
- Just hold this.
- Okay.

797
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:21,915
There's a signal blocking
our feed.

798
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:23,183
We're being jammed out.

799
00:46:26,753 --> 00:46:29,753
Lieutenant Carapax?
We got a problem.

800
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:39,664
- This is the key?
- Yeah.

801
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,836
Okay, let's go.

802
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:44,141
Let's go.

923
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,687

Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

But just, uh...

929

I don't know,

No. But I mean...

942
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:40,477
Like, look at this. It's
like Batman's stuff, but...

943
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:42,376
like if he had ADHD
or something.

944
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:44,107
Batman's a fascist.

945
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:47,347
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

946
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:51,350
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

947
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:55,889
So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

948
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:58,454
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

951
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:09,565
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

952
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:12,106
That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

953
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,415
Jeez.

954
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,344

Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

959

Good.

962

00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,282
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

965
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:01,124
It was just you three in here?

966
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,260
Yeah.

967
00:57:02,354 --> 00:57:04,156
That was my mother's
last painting.

968
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,363
Why'd she stop?

969
00:57:06,498 --> 00:57:08,358
My mom died when I was six.

970
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,528
Oh... We don't...

971
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,543
- I'm so sorry to...
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

972
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:15,838
It's fine.

973
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:18,907
What was she like?

974
00:57:20,246 --> 00:57:21,811
She was great.

975
00:57:23,843 --> 00:57:24,843
She was great.

976
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,380
She changed my dad's life.

977
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:32,619
She was the one who taught him
that the world

978
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:34,123
is a place to protect.

979
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:35,258
Nice.

980
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:41,325
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

981
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,263
He obsessed over the Scarab

982
00:57:47,399 --> 00:57:49,707
and he would disappear for days.

983
00:57:51,408 --> 00:57:53,073
Sometimes weeks.

984
00:57:53,906 --> 00:57:55,372
And one day, he...

985
00:57:57,008 --> 00:57:58,474
he left and...

986
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:01,818
didn't come back.

987
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

988
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:11,255
You're really lucky.

989
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:15,733
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

990
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:19,033
Your house is full of love.

991
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:23,268
A family.

992
00:58:25,177 --> 00:58:26,308
Yeah.

993
00:58:26,444 --> 00:58:27,811
That's a home.

994
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:34,615
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

995
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,350
Sorry for... for what?

996
00:58:36,486 --> 00:58:40,384
I... I haven't talked about
this in a very long time.

997
00:58:42,256 --> 00:58:44,388
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

998
00:58:46,529 --> 00:58:47,897
Thank you.

999
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:49,596
Yeah.

1000
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:51,263
You're a good listener.

1001
00:58:53,003 --> 00:58:55,030
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1002
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:04,452
Hey, guys,
I found something that... Ho!

1003
00:59:04,476 --> 00:59:06,784
- Nothing happened.
- Her mom died.

1004
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:09,225
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1005
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:12,856
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

1006
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,892
Nice jammies,<i> guey.</i>

1007
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:23,693
Okay.
I've gone through the files.

1008
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,703
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1009
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,001
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1010
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:31,634
before it chose you, Jaime.

1011
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:34,603
And<i> pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1012
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:37,408
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1013
00:59:37,543 --> 00:59:39,943
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1014
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,718
It didn't go up my ass.

1015
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:43,717
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1016
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:46,790
and that's what it's trying to do to
you, Jaime, connect to your brain.

1017
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:48,619
It's trying to become one
with you.

1018
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:49,858
Why?

1019
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:51,235
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1020
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:52,858
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1021
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:53,993
It's sentient.

1022
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:55,993
That's why it chooses a host.

1023
00:59:56,129 --> 00:59:58,967
That's why sometimes, it does what
you want, and sometimes, it doesn't.

1024
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,762
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1025
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,067
This wasn't made
on Earth,<i> cabezon.</i>

1026
01:00:03,202 --> 01:00:04,835
- No way.
<i>- Si</i> way.

1027
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,943
It's alien.

1028
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:08,718
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1029
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,655
- You can use it, but I just...
- Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1030
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:14,518
What happened to Ted's
professor guy? How did he get it out?

1031
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:15,919
You might want to sit down.

1032
01:00:18,221 --> 01:00:20,416
- Or not. All right...
- Rudy, please. Focus.

1033
01:00:20,552 --> 01:00:22,257
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1034
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:24,593
The good news is, I
figured out how to get it out.

1035
01:00:24,728 --> 01:00:26,095
Fine.

1036
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,492
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1037
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,965
- What?
- Dead.

1038
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:32,263
What do you mean "dead"?

1039
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,971
Okay, right now, Jaime, look.

1040
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:36,203
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1041
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:39,570
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1042
01:00:39,706 --> 01:00:41,976
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1043
01:00:42,112 --> 01:00:44,744
It's designed
to protect its host.

1044
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,313
To keep it alive.

1045
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:48,380
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1046
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:50,620
No, it's not forever.

1047
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:52,516
I mean, it's just until you...

1048
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:54,857
until you die.

1049
01:00:54,993 --> 01:00:56,588
I think it's kinda cool.

1050
01:00:56,724 --> 01:01:00,062
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero,<i> cabron.</i>

1051
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:02,429
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing...

1052
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:05,330
Oh, you had no idea. So
then what are my options now?

1053
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,735
So, option one is
to become an android

1054
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:10,304
for the rest of my life.

1055
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:12,567
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1056
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,741
- billionaire psychopath?
- I'm so sorry.

1057
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:16,210
All I wanted was a job.

1058
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:18,646
- Maybe there's a...
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1059
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,215
It's all bad news.

1060
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:21,863
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1061
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,646
I don't understand
why you can't...

1062
01:01:24,456 --> 01:01:26,517
God.

1063
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:29,185
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1064
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,954
Jaime, just...

1065
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:33,288
Let me go talk to him. I
think I know where he's going.

1066
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:36,065
<i>Cabezon,</i> wait up.

1067
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:47,307
God.

1068
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:55,850
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1069
01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:58,087
Like a cat, Jaime.

1070
01:02:06,497 --> 01:02:08,465
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1071
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,531
I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...

1072
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:13,870
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1073
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:16,336
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1074
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:20,510
Yeah, we're...

1075
01:02:20,646 --> 01:02:22,409
we're resilient people.

1076
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:26,247
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1077
01:02:26,383 --> 01:02:29,614
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1078
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,020
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1079
01:02:34,156 --> 01:02:38,721
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1080
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:41,460
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1081
01:02:41,596 --> 01:02:43,495
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1082
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:47,932
The next 20 years after,
I mean,<i> la chinga.</i>

1083
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:52,570
But your<i> viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1084
01:02:52,705 --> 01:02:54,976
Any<i> jale</i> he could
get his hands on.

1085
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,444
<i>Jornalero,</i> bus boy, waiter.

1086
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,813
He was a mechanic,
<i>era de todo,</i> dishwasher.

1087
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:06,121
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1088
01:03:06,256 --> 01:03:09,224
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1089
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:12,061
That's what we come from.

1090
01:03:12,196 --> 01:03:15,662
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1091
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:18,695
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do with it.

1092
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,170
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1093
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:25,405
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1094
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:29,277
And not just some
foot up our ass.

1095
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:31,419
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1096
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:32,742
I'm just some failed promise

1097
01:03:32,877 --> 01:03:34,777
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1098
01:03:36,755 --> 01:03:38,055
Don't say that, man.

1099
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:40,353
You're not a failed promise.

1100
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:43,058
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1101
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:45,293
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1102
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:49,595
And... and I love you.

1103
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,463
And I love you, too,<i> cabezon.</i>
Yeah, all right.

1104
01:03:52,598 --> 01:03:54,604
Guys?

1105
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:58,075
Do you hear that?

1106
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,572
That's Victoria.

1107
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:07,447
Where are they going?

1108
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:10,850
Home.

1109
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:14,352
You're wasting too much water.

1110
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:27,136
It's always my fault.

1111
01:04:28,973 --> 01:04:30,002
Yeah.

1112
01:04:55,294 --> 01:04:56,595
Guys?

1113
01:04:58,302 --> 01:05:00,236
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1114
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:11,407
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up.</i>

1115
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:12,909
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

1116
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:15,879
<i>We are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

1117
01:05:16,014 --> 01:05:18,588
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up...</i>

1118
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,218
<i>We are authorized

01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:14,029
every sacrifice we've made,

1283
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:16,731
has led to this moment.

1284
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:21,036
Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

1285
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:22,638
Almost there.

1286
01:17:22,774 --> 01:17:25,677
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1287
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:27,316
Are you ready?

1288
01:17:27,451 --> 01:17:28,577
I'm ready.

1289
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,060
Is this thing bulletproof?

1290
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:52,139
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1291
01:17:56,178 --> 01:17:58,708
Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

1292
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:01,914
Oh, no, no.
That's not what you think it is.

1293
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,581
It's just a special prototype

1294
01:18:04,716 --> 01:18:07,886
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1295
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:09,623
Do these things work?

1296
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:12,093
Mm... some of them.

1297
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:14,326
Sometimes.

1298
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,433
Whoa.

1299
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,999
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1300
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,170
Try pressing another button.

1301
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:32,982
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1302
01:18:36,384 --> 01:18:39,213
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

1303
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:40,548
how to use these things?

1304
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,819
Nana?

1305
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:48,294
Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1306
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,374
This is where they took Jaime.

1307
01:19:01,509 --> 01:19:04,640
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1308
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:07,879
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

1309
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:09,711
The place is a fortress.

1310
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:11,647
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1311
01:19:14,385 --> 01:19:15,550
What the hell?

1312
01:19:15,686 --> 01:19:17,086
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

1313
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,658
about Nana's revolutionary past.

1314
01:19:18,793 --> 01:19:19,793
Her what?

1315
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:37,572
Yeah, the generators are here.

1316
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,079
- Mm.
- We could blow them up

1317
01:19:39,215 --> 01:19:41,111
and knock power out.

1318
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:51,526
Hm?

1319
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:54,360
Damn, Nana.

1320
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:17,451
Hey, who are you?

1321
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:21,286
What're you doing? Get
me out of this thing, please?

1322
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:23,659
Is there a problem, Sanchez?

1323
01:20:23,794 --> 01:20:25,294
I'm sorry.

1324
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,435
You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1325
01:20:27,459 --> 01:20:29,098
Tell her to get me out of this!

1326
01:20:31,901 --> 01:20:33,833
It's okay. It's okay.

1327
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:36,499
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1328
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:39,901
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

1329
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:45,277
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1330
01:20:45,413 --> 01:20:47,348
But now that you've
activated it,

1331
01:20:47,483 --> 01:20:51,151
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

1332
01:20:51,287 --> 01:20:52,567
What are you even talking about?

1333
01:20:52,618 --> 01:20:54,952
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

1334
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:56,656
Oh, bummer.

1335
01:20:56,791 --> 01:21:00,258
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1336
01:21:00,393 --> 01:21:03,895
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1337
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,498
Do it, Sanchez.

1338
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:07,577
With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

1339
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,205
Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

1340
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,573
Damn it.

1341
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:30,125
Bug.

1342
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,260
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1343
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:36,693
You're going too fast!

1344
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,597
Here goes nothing.

1345
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:44,239
Hold on, hold on!

1346
01:21:45,409 --> 01:21:48,276
All right. All right.

1347
01:21:49,241 --> 01:21:51,845
Incoming!

1348
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,011
Brace for impact!

1349
01:22:07,493 --> 01:22:09,293
Let's go, let's go!

1350
01:22:09,428 --> 01:22:11,926
On the wall! Engage. Engage.

1351
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:18,370
Rudy, do something.

1352
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:20,671
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1353
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:34,850
Here we go!

1354
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:40,893
Whoa.

1355
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:42,297
Okay, okay.

1356
01:22:57,846 --> 01:22:59,809
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1357
01:23:04,987 --> 01:23:07,289
- It's like I can't miss.
- Right there, right there.

1358
01:23:13,497 --> 01:23:14,577
- Twenty points!
- Whoo-hoo!

1359
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:28,805
Activating cloaking system.

1360
01:23:30,612 --> 01:23:32,545
<i>Activating bug fart.</i>

1361
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:41,752
Take that!

1362
01:23:42,385 --> 01:23:44,292
Whoo!

1363
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:16,417
- Yeah, this way.
- Okay.

1364
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,360
Hey! Come on.

1365
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:20,994
I know you can hear me.

1366
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:25,829
Just let me out!

1367
01:24:36,477 --> 01:24:38,314
I'll keep it safe.

1368
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:40,215
Start the transfer.

1369
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:42,714
And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

1370
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:44,648
Get me out of here!

1371
01:24:44,784 --> 01:24:46,058
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1372
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:47,753
from his connection
to the Scarab...

1373
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:49,168
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1374
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:52,328
Let me out! No! No!

1375
01:25:10,212 --> 01:25:12,106
Milagro, here, hide!

1376
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:23,656
Holy shit.

1377
01:25:24,557 --> 01:25:26,021
Okay, I think we're good.

1378
01:25:28,063 --> 01:25:29,063
What the...

1379
01:25:34,369 --> 01:25:38,536
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1380
01:25:38,672 --> 01:25:40,607
What the hell is this?

1381
01:25:40,743 --> 01:25:43,112
Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

1382
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:45,381
Enough to build an entire army.

1383
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,261
Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

1384
01:26:01,396 --> 01:26:02,628
What's going on?

1385
01:26:02,764 --> 01:26:04,259
Oh, no.
The Scarab download

1386
01:26:04,395 --> 01:26:05,971
is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

1387
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,534
What does it mean?

1388
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,429
The transfer is killing him.

1389
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:12,337
He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

1390
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:13,568
His pulse is dropping.

1391
01:26:13,703 --> 01:26:15,371
Well, just fix it!

1392
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:39,160
Hey,<i> flaco.</i>

1393
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:51,513
Dad.

1394
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:55,847
What's going on?

1395
01:26:59,684 --> 01:27:01,556
What are you doing here?

1396
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:06,561
You know.

1397
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:10,361
No.<i> Apa.</i>

1398
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:27,516
Milagro, here.
Help me with these.

1399
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:53,069
Jaime.

1400
01:27:55,839 --> 01:27:58,211
This is not your time.

1401
01:27:58,347 --> 01:27:59,779
You have to go back.

1402
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:03,779
Please.

1403
01:28:03,914 --> 01:28:06,522
I understand everything now.

1404
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:10,684
My destiny was
to be here with you.

1405
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,660
In this moment.

1406
01:28:13,528 --> 01:28:15,828
To help you cross into it.

1407
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,609
This is your purpose.

1408
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:02,578
<i>It's time for you
to accept your destiny, Jaime.</i>

1409
01:29:16,693 --> 01:29:18,891
How am I gonna
do this without you?

1410
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,528
How am I gonna know what to do?

1411
01:29:42,786 --> 01:29:44,719
I love you, too,<i> Papi.</i>

1412
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,839
Something's happening.

1413
01:30:06,373 --> 01:30:07,942
What?

1414
01:30:08,078 --> 01:30:10,085
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1415
01:30:10,109 --> 01:30:12,076
Right there.
They're connecting.

1416
01:30:17,353 --> 01:30:19,215
I need you, Khaji!

1417
01:30:22,018 --> 01:30:23,956
They're becoming one.

1418
01:30:35,099 --> 01:30:36,197
We've got the code?

1419
01:30:36,332 --> 01:30:37,604
The transfer's complete.

1420
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,740
The code is ours.

1421
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,269
It's working!

1422
01:30:56,392 --> 01:30:57,825
Oh, no.

1423
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:01,026
Go, go, go!

1424
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:20,775
Okay. Here we go.

1425
01:31:39,968 --> 01:31:41,737
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1426
01:31:58,486 --> 01:32:00,013
No. No, no, no.

1427
01:32:02,656 --> 01:32:04,457
Sanchez, stop him!

1428
01:32:04,593 --> 01:32:06,058
Oh, shit.

1429
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:18,873
What?

1430
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:21,040
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1431
01:32:21,175 --> 01:32:22,581
- Wait, wait, wait. My family?
- Quickly!

1432
01:32:22,605 --> 01:32:24,780
What do you mean my family?

1433
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:26,540
Go!

1434
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:29,246
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1435
01:32:30,447 --> 01:32:33,449
My name is not Sanchez, <i>pendeja!</i>

1436
01:32:33,584 --> 01:32:37,793
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1437
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,696
What are you doing?

1438
01:32:44,063 --> 01:32:46,032
Stop him, Carapax.

1439
01:32:47,536 --> 01:32:50,267
Go. I'll be fine.

1440
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,038
Okay, Khaji, come on.

1441
01:32:57,012 --> 01:32:59,040
Okay.
All right, Khaji, activate!

01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:07,515
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1445

- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

- What's wrong? What's wrong?

No, no, watch out!

Okay, Khaji.
All right, Khaji-Da.

Okay.

Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1469
01:35:31,197 --> 01:35:32,429
Keep your eyes peeled.

1470

What a mess you have made.

- Milagro.
- Where is she?

01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,720
Milagro and Jenny.
They're in there.

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1480
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:57,952
Okay, I need to head
back in there, okay?

1481
01:36:58,088 --> 01:36:59,517
Yeah.
What about the suit?

1482
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:00,831
It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

- Jaime.
- Yes?

1484

Okay.

Right.

I know you can hear me,

I want you both
to get it together.

Find your strength,<i> mijito.</i>

1491

Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

1492
01:37:23,575 --> 01:37:26,114
I want you

Wait, wait, wait! Watch out!

Engage the target.

Let's go!

1507
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:03,237
Oh, man, there's more.

1508
01:39:17,991 --> 01:39:18,991
Grab him!

Okay, I deserve that one.

1519
01:39:58,599 --> 01:40:00,664
I thought
I'd never see you again.

Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Jenny?

1528
01:40:20,321 --> 01:40:21,983
We got separated. I don't know.

1529
01:40:22,118 --> 01:40:24,021
Okay, we have to find her.

1530

Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do because I...

Give me rockets or something.

Okay, which way do we go?

1544
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,736
Go to the Bug Ship.
It's that way.

All right, big boy.

1549

You do not deserve this power!

I thought you'd
hit harder than that.

1551

Okay, we need
something else, Khaji.

All right, you wanna dance, huh?

1555
01:42:12,695 --> 01:42:14,402
Now, give me a sword.

1556
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:18,804
So I can make whatever
weapons I want, huh?

You are still

the love you feel
for your family...

1578
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,263

Hey!

01:44:35,074 --> 01:44:36,577

Oh, shit.

Jennifer, you don't know
what the O.M.A.C. is.

1589
01:45:25,394 --> 01:45:27,188
Carapax is just a prototype.

1590
01:45:27,323 --> 01:45:29,392
This is the only thing
that's important.

1591
01:45:29,527 --> 01:45:30,862
The Scarab code.

1592
01:45:30,998 --> 01:45:34,161
With this, I can make
a thousand Carapaxes.

This is the culmination
of my life's work.

This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

Not mine. I'll make sure of it.

1598
01:45:55,489 --> 01:45:57,184
That Edge Key trash...

1599
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:01,627
knows more about
family than you ever will.

1600
01:46:01,763 --> 01:46:04,027
I know. No, I know
about family.

1601
01:46:04,162 --> 01:46:08,302
I know about my family
that overlooked me,

1602
01:46:08,438 --> 01:46:09,802
just the way that you are now,

1603
01:46:09,937 --> 01:46:12,299
because you are
just like your pathetic father,

1604
01:46:12,434 --> 01:46:15,506
who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1605
01:46:15,641 --> 01:46:17,271
for the greater good.

1606
01:46:17,406 --> 01:46:21,543
I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

1607
01:46:25,983 --> 01:46:27,382
Oh!

1608
01:46:54,175 --> 01:46:56,244
No! We're not done!

1609
01:47:02,725 --> 01:47:05,820
<i>Jaime, threat disarmed.</i>

1610
01:47:05,955 --> 01:47:07,762
<i>You're losing control.</i>

1611
01:47:07,897 --> 01:47:10,194
You think
that you could beat me? Huh?

1612
01:47:10,329 --> 01:47:13,098
You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

1613
01:47:16,437 --> 01:47:20,807
<i>O.M.A.C. neutralized.
Recommend to disengage.</i>

1614
01:47:28,076 --> 01:47:29,816
What are you doing?

1615
01:47:29,951 --> 01:47:32,650
<i>We are not killers, Jaime.</i>

1616
01:47:32,785 --> 01:47:34,517
<i>Let him go.</i>

1617
01:47:34,652 --> 01:47:36,251
What about Dad?

1618
01:47:37,589 --> 01:47:39,719
What about Rudy?

1619
01:47:39,854 --> 01:47:44,231
<i>During the transfer,
I unlocked his memories.</i>

1620
01:47:44,367 --> 01:47:45,997
<i>Let me show you.</i>

1621
01:47:49,972 --> 01:47:51,936
What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

1622
01:47:52,072 --> 01:47:53,671
Then we'll just get another one.

1623
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:55,138
It could kill him.

1624
01:47:55,273 --> 01:47:57,272
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1625
01:47:59,578 --> 01:48:02,112
<i>This country is
confronting a brutal challenge,</i>

1626
01:48:02,247 --> 01:48:04,650
<i>from guerrillas

<i>by others outside Guatemala.</i>

1628
01:48:06,886 --> 01:48:10,453
<i>The United States is
committed to restoring democracy</i>

1629
01:48:10,589 --> 01:48:13,828
<i>and to address the root causes
of the violent insurgency.</i>

1630
01:48:13,963 --> 01:48:16,660
<i>We know about the problems</i>

1631
01:48:16,795 --> 01:48:18,326
<i>confronting Guatemala.</i>

1632
01:48:19,534 --> 01:48:21,736
Perfect. Round them up.

1633
01:48:31,644 --> 01:48:33,874
<i>Mama!</i>

1634
01:48:34,009 --> 01:48:36,784
Ignacio!

1635
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,071
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

1636
01:49:11,651 --> 01:49:14,085
Hey!<i> Cabezon!</i>

1637
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:08,304
You're wrong.

1638
01:50:10,978 --> 01:50:14,574
That love that
I have for my family...

1639
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:19,579
that's what makes me strong.

1640
01:50:31,329 --> 01:50:33,599
All right, give it to me.
Come on.

1641
01:50:33,734 --> 01:50:35,463
- This?
- Yes, that.

1642
01:50:39,073 --> 01:50:42,738
No!
Now what have you done?

1643
01:50:42,873 --> 01:50:44,511
No! No, no!

1644
01:50:44,646 --> 01:50:47,211
Jenny?

1645
01:50:47,346 --> 01:50:49,581
It's okay.

1646
01:50:49,717 --> 01:50:51,417
Carapax, kill them.

1647
01:50:51,552 --> 01:50:52,645
Kill them both!

1648
01:51:04,225 --> 01:51:05,626
Okay.

1649
01:51:05,761 --> 01:51:07,204
What are you doing?
They're getting...

1650
01:51:07,228 --> 01:51:08,368
Okay.

1651
01:51:09,769 --> 01:51:10,569
No.

1652
01:51:10,704 --> 01:51:12,138
Wait, Jenny, wait.

1653
01:51:12,274 --> 01:51:13,651
Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

1654
01:51:13,675 --> 01:51:14,969
- What?
- I promise.

1655
01:51:15,105 --> 01:51:18,571
We can be partners, huh?

1656
01:51:18,706 --> 01:51:21,648
I'll f... I'll fix it.
I'll fix you.

1657
01:51:21,783 --> 01:51:24,116
We can find another Sanchez.

1658
01:51:27,486 --> 01:51:30,221
Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

1659
01:51:40,535 --> 01:51:41,936
No.

1660
01:51:43,067 --> 01:51:44,701
Khaji, what's he doing?

1661
01:51:44,836 --> 01:51:46,376
<i>He's maxing out
the energy reactor in his suit.</i>

1662
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,773
<i>I advise we back away.</i>

1663
01:51:55,477 --> 01:51:57,314
<i>Ignacio.</i>

1664
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:05,054
What? What?

1665
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:07,625
What, no! What are you doing?

1666
01:52:07,761 --> 01:52:10,228
Stop! No! No!

1667
01:52:13,898 --> 01:52:17,371
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1668
01:52:17,506 --> 01:52:19,000
No! Please! No!

1669
01:52:19,135 --> 01:52:21,368
Ignacio, no! Stop!

1670
01:52:21,503 --> 01:52:23,872
<i>I suggest we run.</i>

1671
01:52:24,007 --> 01:52:25,408
Okay. Oh, shit.

1672
01:52:43,797 --> 01:52:45,428
Milagro, pull!

1673
01:52:54,203 --> 01:52:55,871
Rocio!

1674
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:13,291
You okay?

1675
01:53:15,893 --> 01:53:17,097
Hi.

1676
01:53:36,111 --> 01:53:37,414
Mili.

1677
01:53:39,248 --> 01:53:40,351
<i>Cabezon.</i>

1678
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:42,155
Rudy?

1679
01:53:43,253 --> 01:53:44,652
Rudy!

1680
01:53:48,931 --> 01:53:50,689
- How?
- Yeah. You know...

1681
01:53:55,263 --> 01:53:56,770
<i>Ama.</i>

1682
01:53:56,906 --> 01:53:58,732
Nana.

1683
01:54:30,438 --> 01:54:34,166
<i>It is a delicate moment
for Kord Industries.</i>

1684
01:54:34,301 --> 01:54:38,372
<i>And of course, we mourn
the loss of Victoria Kord.</i>

1685
01:54:38,507 --> 01:54:39,973
<i>But I'm looking forward.</i>

1686
01:54:40,108 --> 01:54:43,647
<i>As I was saying,
we will no longer make weapons.</i>

1687
01:54:43,783 --> 01:54:47,019
<i>What I want to do is honor
my father's legacy.</i>

1688
01:54:47,154 --> 01:54:48,485
<i>It's not about destruction,</i>

1689
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:50,389
<i>it's about building
a better future.</i>

1690
01:54:50,525 --> 01:54:52,422
<i>It's not about taking
from the community,</i>

1691
01:54:52,558 --> 01:54:54,227
<i>but giving back
to the community.</i>

1692
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,503
What are we gonna do now?

1693
01:55:11,309 --> 01:55:13,972
<i>Animo,</i> Rudy, okay?

1694
01:55:14,108 --> 01:55:15,788
We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

1695
01:55:17,649 --> 01:55:19,780
Hey! The Reyes are here.

1696
01:55:20,919 --> 01:55:22,185
Guys.

1697
01:56:19,407 --> 01:56:20,509
Nana.

1698
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:25,646
Okay.

1699
01:56:38,093 --> 01:56:40,030
Where,<i> Ama?</i>
We don't have a house.

1700
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:42,006
Rudy, we have, like, half the
Edge Keys in our yard right now.

1701
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,001
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1702
01:56:44,136 --> 01:56:45,701
Of course they're going to help.

1703
01:56:45,837 --> 01:56:48,339
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1704
01:56:48,475 --> 01:56:50,073
I wouldn't worry about that.

1705
01:56:51,243 --> 01:56:52,908
Jenny, Jenny.

1706
01:56:53,044 --> 01:56:54,044
Hi.

1707
01:56:55,584 --> 01:56:57,480
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1708
01:56:57,616 --> 01:56:59,045
to the people
that made it great.

1709
01:56:59,181 --> 01:57:01,381
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1710
01:57:01,516 --> 01:57:02,950
on Jenny Kord, no?

1711
01:57:03,085 --> 01:57:04,918
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1712
01:57:06,027 --> 01:57:07,327
Starting with you, Rudy.

1713
01:57:07,462 --> 01:57:08,907
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1714
01:57:08,931 --> 01:57:10,522
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1715
01:57:10,658 --> 01:57:12,408
That sounds like something that
you would say to her to tell me.

1716
01:57:12,432 --> 01:57:14,366
And don't worry, Kord Industries

1717
01:57:14,502 --> 01:57:16,332
will fix and give you back
your house.

1718
01:57:19,203 --> 01:57:20,733
Excuse me.

1719
01:57:20,868 --> 01:57:22,438
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1720
01:57:22,573 --> 01:57:24,477
- Here, Rudy.
- What's this?

1721
01:57:24,612 --> 01:57:28,112
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1722
01:57:32,121 --> 01:57:33,486
How do you like that, cupcake?

1723
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:36,684
Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1724
01:57:36,819 --> 01:57:38,788
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1725
01:57:38,924 --> 01:57:40,926
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1726
01:57:41,062 --> 01:57:43,429
- Oh, wow. Come on, help me like it.
- I'm inheriting that.

1727
01:57:45,297 --> 01:57:46,927
All right, I gotta go.

1728
01:57:48,396 --> 01:57:50,035
Yeah.

1729
01:57:50,171 --> 01:57:51,866
How about I walk you out?

1730
01:57:52,701 --> 01:57:54,572
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1731
01:58:03,313 --> 01:58:04,780
So, uh...

1732
01:58:05,781 --> 01:58:07,552
when am I gonna see you again?

1733
01:58:08,187 --> 01:58:10,555
Soon. I hope.

1734
01:58:12,258 --> 01:58:13,591
Where are you headed?

1735
01:58:14,192 --> 01:58:15,659
To my dad's.

1736
01:58:15,795 --> 01:58:18,057
I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

1737
01:58:19,434 --> 01:58:21,801
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1738
01:58:21,936 --> 01:58:23,395
Cool, cool.

1739
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:24,767
Uh...

1740
01:58:27,274 --> 01:58:28,804
What if I gave you a ride?

1741
01:58:35,784 --> 01:58:36,784
How?

1742
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,285

01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:42,952
No, no, no. Not you.

01:58:43,088 --> 01:58:44,088
Oh.

1747
01:58:48,524 --> 01:58:49,695
What's it saying?

1748
01:58:49,831 --> 01:58:50,831
Nothing.

1749
01:59:18,959 --> 01:59:19,959
Okay.

1750
01:59:20,796 --> 01:59:22,294
Hold on.

1751
01:59:22,429 --> 01:59:24,563
