1
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,438
Terrific.

2
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,881
What's up, numb-nuts?

3
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,285
Read 'em and weep.

4
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,051
Van Halen at the Centrum.

5
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,216
Third row!

6
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,121
You should take Jolene, man.

7
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,957
I heard she got big nipples.

8
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,724
This is Van freakin' Halen, man.

9
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,288
Get serious.

10
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,096
Besides, I'm just not into girls anymore.

11
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,769
Dude, I'm into guys, too!

12
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,098
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,401
That's not what I meant.

14
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,603
I'm into women.

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,196
Hey, Mary.

16
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,432
I got two tickets to Van Halen this weekend.

17
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,635
What time should I pick you up?

18
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,504
It is Miss McGarricle, Donny.

19
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,038
And that's cute,
but I am your teacher, not your girlfriend.

20
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,608
Whoa, Miss McGarricle,
who said anything about girlfriends?

21
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,244
Let's just start with a summer fling,

22
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,447
couple of hand jobs,

23
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,280
no expectations.

24
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,322
Don't get all psycho on me right away.

25
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,993
That is a month's detention.

26
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,257
What's a hand job?

27
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,858
I don't know, but I think I want one.

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,772
Can I go to the bathroom?

29
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,741
No. No talking in detention, Mr. Berger.

30
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,706
All right, I'm sorry for what I did.

31
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,245
I promise I won't do it again.

32
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,011
You're in a lot of trouble, Donny.

33
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,479
Wait, you're not gonna tell my dad, are you?

34
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,779
He'll kick my ass. He's crazy.

35
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,050
What were you trying to do, anyway?

36
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,318
Impress your friends?

37
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,919
Well, you know, you're...

38
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,828
You have a little crush on me?

39
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,259
No.

40
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,598
"No." So, you...

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,498
You don't want me.

42
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,373
No. Yeah.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,001
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say right now.

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,205
Is that gum in your mouth, Donny?

45
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,225
You know,
I've been watching you all year, Donny.

46
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,455
When you hit that shot to beat Fairfield

47
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:09,193
and you were jumping up and down
in your little Larry Bird short-shorts

48
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,793
and sweating like ajar of pickles
in the hot sun...

49
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,662
Oh, God.

50
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,331
That was so hot.

51
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,443
Is this really happening?

52
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,674
This is happening.

53
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,977
It's happening right now.

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,518
In my office.

55
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,548
Okay. Awesome.

56
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,816
So, I'm totally in.

57
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,516
How do you want to do it?

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,686
'Cause I made sex before, lots of ways.

59
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,161
So you want to go straight to hand jobs

60
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,291
or eating me out or taking me from behind?

61
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,663
I'll teach you.

62
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,532
I'm a virgin.

63
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,004
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,839
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,143
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

66
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,198
Who? Me?

67
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,255
Hey, Donny, what'd you get?

68
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,956
And if I'm elected
eighth grade class president,

69
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,054
I promise to...

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,327
You're getting so good at this!

71
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,933
I promise to do my best to lower prices at
the school stores and...

72
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,739
All of our practice is really paying off!

73
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,403
I like the sound of that.

74
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,319
Timmy, stop. Hold on a second.

75
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,903
My dad's gonna kick my ass.

76
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,215
Calm down!

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,569
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

78
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,798
Who's the man?

79
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,501
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

80
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,806
Yeah! You want some of me? Who's the man?

81
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,981
All right, everybody!

82
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,315
Enough!

83
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,414
I am aware that a lot of people think

84
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,853
that this young man

85
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,823
is not really a victim,
but someone that's living

86
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,796
the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy.

87
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,160
Absolutely.

88
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,064
But this is a serious crime.

89
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,799
Mary Beth McGarricle, rise for sentencing.

90
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,636
The fact that this relationship

91
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,170
has resulted in a pregnancy
and you show absolutely no remorse,

92
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,677
saying, and I quote,

93
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,687
I would fuck that kid again and again.

94
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:56,091
"He makes me feel like there's a rainbow
coming out of my beaver."

95
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,392
...leaves me absolutely no choice

96
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,762
but to levy the maximum penalty.

97
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,328
Thirty years
in the Massachusetts Women's Penitentiary.

98
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,066
And furthermore, the court grants custody
of the unborn child

99
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,575
to Donald Berger's father...

100
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,242
Dumb-ass.

101
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,405
...until Donald turns 18,

102
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,416
at which time he will assume full custody.

103
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,983
Take care of our baby, Donny!

104
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,246
Miss McGarricle!

105
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,255
I'll never stop loving you!

106
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,750
That is just fucking mental.

107
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,280
<i>The kid is young, he's attractive,</i>

108
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,328
<i>he can probably keep a hard-on
longer than this fucking guy.</i>

109
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,935
<i>Made you flinch, pansy.</i>

110
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,700
<i>Go ahead! I don't need you!</i>

111
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,675
<i>I'mDonny freakin' Berger!</i>

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,913
<i>I'm wicked famous
and I got a wicked big schlong!</i>

113
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,074
<i>Hey, here's something.
Donny Berger's back in the news.</i>

114
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,277
<i>That kid who got his teacher pregnant?</i>

115
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,649
<i>- Exactly.
- I love that guy.</i>

116
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,450
<i>Seems like he bought a round last night.</i>

117
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>Okay-</i>

118
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,114
<i>For everybody in Boston Garden.</i>

119
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,285
<i>Oh, my God, he's my hero.</i>

120
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,491
<i>That kid is burning through that money,
but he's having a good time doing it.</i>

121
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,779
<i>So, guy, how'd we do?</i>

122
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,012
<i>What them fuckers at the IRS say?</i>

123
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,417
Well, they said a lot of stuff.

124
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,887
The thing that really jumped out

125
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,323
-was "three years in prison."
- Three years?

126
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,793
Yeah, you haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donny.

127
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,729
What... I thought they were
taking it out automatically!

128
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,390
I told them that's what you thought,

129
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,365
and they said
it's the stupidest thing they ever heard.

130
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,992
But there is some good news.

131
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,628
If you can pay
the balance off by the end of the weekend,

132
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,934
they'll suspend the sentence.

133
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,507
Oh, okay, there you go.

134
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,975
What are we talking about? Hit me.

135
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,236
Forty-three thousand.

136
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,506
Forty-three grand?

137
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,740
No!

138
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,847
Come on, Donny!

139
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,578
Don't screw up my Tom Brady poster.

140
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,085
It's my favorite one.

141
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,780
Look at that jaw line.

142
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,346
Just the right amount of scruff.

143
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm sorry! I'm just freaking out here!

144
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,252
I don't got 43 grand!

145
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,125
Well, look, hey, good news.

146
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,789
Monday's Memorial Day,

147
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,730
so you don't need
to get the money till Tuesday.

148
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,134
All right. That'll give me time to
sell my diamond Lamborghini!

149
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,937
Hey, hey, hey! You're killing me, man!

150
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,975
Don't mess with the genius.

151
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,909
Jimmy, I got $28 to my name.

152
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,378
Twenty-eight, huh? Okay.

153
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,109
I got a hot tip on a long shot
that just might come in.

154
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,614
- What is it, a horse?
- No.

155
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,743
This is Tubby Tuke, fat guy.

156
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,221
Fat guy?

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,816
Gonna run the marathon.
Odds on him winning are 8,000-to-1.

158
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,918
But this cat's got wheels on him.

159
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,930
I think he's gonna win, I really do.

160
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,456
All right, I'll put 20 on the fat fuck,
but I can't count on that.

161
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,593
It's a long shot, you said it yourself.

162
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,830
But what about your kid?

163
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,200
Maybe he can come up with the dough.

164
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,936
We don't talk no more.

165
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,976
He kind of moved out when he turned 18,

166
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,977
and that's the last I seen of him.

167
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,842
- What happened?
- I don't know.

168
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,314
I loved that little Han Solo
more than anything in the world, too.

169
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,082
- You named your kid Han Solo?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,621
Han Solo Berger?

171
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,157
Coolest name in the world, right?

172
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,692
Why don't you just Facebook him?

173
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,251
I can't afford that shit.
What am I, a billionaire?

174
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,423
I don't think he wants to be found, anyways.

175
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
Especially by me.

176
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,505
Hey, look! It's us!

177
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,811
- On the cover!
- Don't we look great?

178
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,113
Yeah, well, you look good.

179
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,710
I kind of look like a ventriloquist.

180
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,620
I don't know, it's still kind of weird, right?

181
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,626
I mean, it's got our faces and our names.

182
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,559
It just seems like anyone could find us.

183
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,155
"Find us"?
Honey, did you take your Xanax today?

184
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,290
Yeah, two.

185
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,766
I always double down
when your parents are in town.

186
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,029
Do you have your security undies?

187
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,504
- Yep, right here.
- Good.

188
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,972
I know that makes you feel better.

189
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,031
There's stranger things than walking around

190
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,544
with an extra pair of underwear
for emergencies.

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,548
Look, just this once, don't be so weird.

192
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,379
We're gonna have the best wedding ever.

193
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,577
Okay.

194
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,796
<i>Holy shit. What the hell happened
to my life, Champale?</i>

195
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,265
Don, honey, no way to come up
with that money, huh?

196
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,132
No. The only thing
I'm good at is being Donny Berger,

197
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,900
and no one wants to pay for that anymore.

198
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,599
Aw, Donny.

199
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,541
Wow!

200
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,339
My face is your toilet!

201
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,006
Show some fucking respect
over there, Kenny.

202
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,412
Hey, whoa.

203
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,047
Hey, Mom, did you want
some breakfast after you finish your dance?

204
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,484
Give it to me now, honey.

205
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,613
Donny doesn't mind, do you, Donny?

206
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,023
Holy cow, that's my son!

207
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,381
Who, Han Solo?

208
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,690
I thought you said he was a fatty.

209
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,163
No, no, no.
He must have lost the weight or something,

210
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,097
'cause I swear to God, that's my boy.

211
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,927
It says, "Todd Peterson to
wed Jamie Martin this Sunday

212
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,993
"at All Saints Church on Cape Cod."

213
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,733
Todd Peterson?

214
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,069
He changed his name!

215
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,200
Why?

216
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,777
What was wrong with Han Solo Berger?

217
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,939
It's the coolest fucking name of all time.

218
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,380
"Peterson is one of the youngest

219
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,112
"large-cap hedge fund managers
in the financial industry."

220
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,051
He got rich on us, huh?

221
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,217
"All the more impressive
considering he was orphaned

222
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,786
"at age nine, when both his parents died
in a horrific explosion."

223
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,962
He fucking blew me up and his mother?

224
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,229
Donny, maybe your son could
help you, financially.

225
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,804
I don't know. This kid changed his name.

226
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,931
He doesn't even want
to be a Berger anymore.

227
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,532
He's not gonna want to talk to me.

228
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,775
<i>That was the incomparable Champale.</i>

229
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,276
<i>And now, looking hot
and ignoring doctor's orders,</i>

230
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,078
<i>let's welcome Amber.</i>

231
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,450
What the fuck happened to her?

232
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,488
Fuck you, Kenny!

233
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,524
Hey, what's up, Robe-Cop?

234
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,490
This is where your boss lives?

235
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,792
It's actuallyjust his summer home.

236
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,493
- Summer home. What a dick.
- Dad!

237
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,562
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,867
Todd, it's just breathtaking!

239
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,872
Hey! There he is.

240
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,238
Hey, Mr. Spirou.

241
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,277
There's my golden boy.

242
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,676
Come over here, champ.

243
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,304
Come on, get over here.

244
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,507
Hi.Yeah.

245
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,107
Look at you.

246
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,383
Look at you, the lovely bride.

247
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,386
What a couple!

248
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,084
Mr. Spirou, it's so amazing
that you're letting us all stay here.

249
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,319
Seriously, thank you so much.

250
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,292
Steve, these are
my parents, Gerald and Helen.

251
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,727
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi.

252
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,059
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

253
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,664
You can tell she likes Todd for Todd,

254
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,793
not because he's gonna be rich.

255
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,963
I wouldn't want
my boy to end up with some gold digger

256
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,937
like the last three whores I married, huh?

257
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,104
True story. All three? Whores.

258
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,077
<i>Well, guys, this weekend, mi casa es su casa.</i>

259
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,414
You know, every member
of my staff are lucky to be in this country,

260
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,284
so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em.

261
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,258
Go get the fucking bags!

262
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,688
Well, Mrs. Spirou,
I've always said that if the finance game

263
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,992
was an amusement park,
your son would be a roller coaster,

264
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,694
and I would just ride him all day long.

265
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,832
That came out weird.

266
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,429
Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think

267
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,701
that he's the star of the family.

268
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,404
But before he was born,
I modeled a bathing suit

269
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,107
for a Woolworth advertisement.

270
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,776
Well, you still have
quite a figure on you there, Delores.

271
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,411
Yeah, I can see
where Steve got his rocking bod.

272
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,612
Why, thank you.

273
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,049
Chad's here!

274
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,389
- Oh, my God.
- Hooray.

275
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,484
Fantastic.

276
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,190
I guess they didn't want to see it.

277
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,426
Yay, Chad!

278
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,230
- Come here.
- Mom.

279
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,770
- Sweetheart.
- I'm home.

280
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,236
Dad, how are you, sir?

281
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,773
- You look great.
- Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:30,966
Hey, Chad, I'm Todd.

283
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,441
Oh, my God.

284
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,671
Oh, God, I missed you, sis.

285
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,144
That's a good hug.

286
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,481
Chad, this is my fiancé, Todd.

287
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,709
Pleasure to meet you, Chadwick.

288
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,979
Are you a soldier?

289
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,646
No.

290
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,383
- Sailor?
- No.

291
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,482
- Airman?
- No.

292
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,651
Girl Scout?

293
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,216
No.

294
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,890
Well, then I'd prefer if you take
your fingers away from your forehead

295
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,764
and you shake my hand
like the civilian you are.

296
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,963
Yeah, sorry, I'm stupid.
I don't know why I did that.

297
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,131
Honest mistake. Come here,
I want to show you this.

298
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,335
Look, if you ever do anything

299
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,572
to hurt my sister, I will take
my government-issued service revolver,

300
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,015
stick it straight up your fuppin' poop chute,
and empty the clip.

301
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,313
Do you feel me?

302
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,015
Yes, I totally feel you... Dawg.

303
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,258
Randy Jackson, right?

304
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,253
I've got 10 ways
to kill you with my bare hands right now.

305
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,058
Don't.

306
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,058
Don't.

307
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,833
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

308
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,931
Can I see Randall Morgan possibly?

309
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,601
Yeah, you're gonna need an appointment.

310
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,268
I knew you were gonna say that.

311
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,077
But you know what?
Tell him Donny Berger's out here.

312
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,945
He'll be pretty psyched to see an old friend.

313
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,781
You know what? Mr. Morgan's
on vacation right now. I'm sorry.

314
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,648
- He's on vacation? That son of a...
- Oh, hey!

315
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,847
Vanilla Ice.

316
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,686
Randall's just getting makeup.
Go ahead to the green room.

317
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,129
Vanilla, what's up, guy?

318
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,861
It's been a long time. How you been?

319
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,397
Are you seriously giving me
the silent treatment still?

320
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,698
You know that hurts me.

321
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,103
Yeah? Well, that's why I'm giving it to you.

322
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,196
How's it feel, chump?

323
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,865
It's breaking my heart.

324
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,171
We were friends for 20 years, guy.

325
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,008
We were friends until you banged my mother!

326
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,048
I didn't know it was her, I swear to God!

327
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,014
It's not like her last name is Ice.

328
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,510
You should've known by the haircut!

329
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,349
Aw, come on, Vanilla Bean Latte.

330
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,753
- Will you just...
- What?

331
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,585
I'm just saying, I'm in big trouble, guy.

332
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,683
This, like, monetary thing.

333
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,594
I'm going to prison
if I don't get 43 large, so...

334
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,892
What, do you think I got that kind of money?

335
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,398
Of course you got that kind of money.

336
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,061
<i>Royalties from Ice Ice Baby,
you must be fucking loaded!</i>

337
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,536
Man, listen, Queen took 50%.

338
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,231
Suge took the other 60%.

339
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,070
I fucking owe money when
that shit gets played, man!

340
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,270
Dude, come on,
will you please stop, collaborate and listen?

341
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,040
- Oh, here...
- What? No, I love that song.

342
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,206
You know that shit.

343
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,772
I was on top of that, fucking day one.

344
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,382
Listen, man. I work at a ice rink now.

345
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,284
I deep-fry chicken nuggets, man.

346
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,253
I'll get you a deal on
a barbecue sauce packet.

347
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,585
Fucking A, buddy.

348
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,354
Both of us. This sucks.

349
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,417
Broke. Who'd have thought
this would happen to us?

350
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,892
Maybe I should call your mother.
She'll give me the money, I know that.

351
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,128
- What?
- What? What? What?

352
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,933
Hey, dude.

353
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,235
Didn't spill my beer, fucker.

354
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,435
Fuck you.

355
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,068
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

356
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,108
Nobody comes in here
and starts busting up my joint

357
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,240
unless I got cameras rolling.

358
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,813
Look, Donny,
nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did,

359
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,718
let alone something
that happened 25 years ago.

360
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,381
I'm telling you, when I walk down the street,

361
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,924
people are like, "There's that guy!"

362
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,516
I'm still fucking big, dude.

363
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,394
All right, how about this?
I'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks.

364
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,830
Maybe I slip you in
after that Milli Vanilli guy, all right?

365
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,334
- Who, Fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine.
- Yeah.

366
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,233
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

367
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,534
Maybe 400 bucks.

368
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,904
Four hundred bucks?

369
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,434
Dude, I need 43 G-birds.
What are we talking about right now?

370
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,572
You need $43,000?

371
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,081
Are you back on drugs?

372
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,378
- Yeah.
- It's never...

373
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,180
This is never going to happen. Never.

374
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,686
Little bit more blush if you can.

375
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,814
Just like you did that John Wayne Bobbitt
in his penis reunion show.

376
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,923
That's actually a good idea, a reunion.

377
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,996
Me and Miss McGarricle, together again,
live from a women's prison.

378
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,407
A women's prison.

379
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,435
Very sexy.

380
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,673
We could shoot it this weekend.
You could give me the money.

381
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,608
Very sexy.

382
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,049
You know, you could eat that ass
after I leave the room,

383
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,018
but I need an answer right now.
What do you think?

384
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,247
What about your kid?

385
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,017
My kid? What about my kid?

386
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,081
He's got to be a walking Gong Show.

387
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,355
No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

388
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,124
He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

389
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,132
-down at the Cape this weekend.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

390
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,725
"Horny teacher baby makes good."

391
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,862
Smell that? Smell it, Donny?

392
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,535
What? That's not me.
She probably cut the cheese.

393
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,372
No, no, no. No, ratings.

394
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,103
I smell ratings.

395
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,405
My kid is very publicity-shy, so I...
You know, to be honest,

396
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,075
I don't think he'd do
a piece of shit show like this.

397
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,584
All right, here's the deal.

398
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,314
You get yourself and your actual kid

399
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,118
up to the women's
prison this weekend, I will shoot it,

400
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,056
I will give you 50 grand in cash.

401
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,123
'Cause I'm going to guess, Donny,
you want to be visiting a prison,

402
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,857
not living in one.

403
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,163
So, Todd, how does one get into
the hedgehog business anyway?

404
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,297
Oh, it's actually hedge funds.

405
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,034
You think you're better than me?

406
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:32,833
No.

407
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,374
Chad, did you know
that Todd is really great with numbers?

408
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,778
- You got to see this.
- Jamie, no. Don't make...

409
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,611
What's 452 times 77?

410
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,047
84,304.

411
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,486
Oh, he could just be making that up.

412
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,647
No, he's not!

413
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,453
There's a calculator on my cell phone.

414
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,516
Okay.

415
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,195
What is 94

416
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,531
times 312, Todd?

417
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,005
29,328, Helen.

418
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,768
Freaky.

419
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,310
I don't know. It's just something I can do.

420
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,345
Are you sure you're not a Chinaman?

421
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,971
Oh, that's inappropriate.

422
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,174
White whore.

423
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,484
I'll get it.

424
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,958
Oh, my God. You must be Jamie.

425
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,918
You're, like, even hotter
than you looked in the paper.

426
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,427
Look at your hair,
blowing in the wind like Tawny Kitaen

427
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,490
when she was fucking dry-humping that car.

428
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,194
Okay.

429
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,431
And you must be...

430
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,001
Donny.

431
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,601
What's the matter?
Chubby never even mentioned me?

432
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,733
Chubby?

433
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,176
Oh, I mean Todd Peterson.

434
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,105
Why do you say it like that?

435
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,012
It just comes out that way.

436
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,381
Where are my manners, right?

437
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,421
Could you hold that?
Take a chug if you'd like.

438
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,748
I got you a fucking great gift.

439
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,351
Here it is.

440
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,958
I'll take the brew back.

441
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,654
Just, you got to read it, though. It's fucking...

442
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,056
Yeah!

443
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,928
I don't know where they
come up with this shit,

444
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,596
but it's pretty fucking funny.

445
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,435
Spencer's Gifts never fucking fails me.

446
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,133
I want to meet Mr. Spencer one day and say,

447
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,801
"Thanks, motherfucker, for all the laughs."

448
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,470
Hey, I also made you a mix tape.

449
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,310
Who the fuck is rich in this house?

450
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,405
Jeezum, it's huge.

451
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,251
Todd, your old man is here?

452
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,515
Wassup!

453
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,659
Helen, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

454
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,716
No, it's...

455
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,817
Let me just get that for you.

456
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,953
- That's...
- What? No.

457
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,497
Oh, sorry, those are yours. I...

458
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,796
Donny, what... What the fuck, man? Sorry.

459
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,899
What are you doing here?

460
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,396
What do you mean?

461
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,734
I thought you said your parents were dead.

462
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,701
No, they are. Super dead.

463
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,300
He's hilarious.

464
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,606
My old man.

465
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,970
My old man friend.

466
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,144
From...

467
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,217
Wassup!

468
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,409
Right?

469
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,122
Well, aren't you going to introduce us?

470
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,482
- No.
- Yes.

471
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,956
Yes. Here we go.

472
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,261
This is my future father-in-law, Gerald,

473
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,527
and his lovely wife, Helen.

474
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,628
And Jamie's brother, Chad.

475
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,831
- Hey-0!
- Don't. That's...

476
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,198
What?

477
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,332
I like the look of this. Who's this?

478
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,244
Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother,
Delores, who's awake now.

479
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:27,044
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where you
get all the looks from, huh, sweetie?

480
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,547
Yeah, no, we're not related.

481
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes,
'cause you got the fucking...

482
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,889
You're stacked pretty good.

483
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,993
Anyhow, Jame, this is my old friend, Donny.

484
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,590
Your best friend.

485
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,157
I'm his best friend.

486
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,396
Your best friend.

487
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,930
Yeah, no.

488
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,972
Remember I told you we met...

489
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,495
Where'd we meet?

490
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,235
- We met...
- Where?

491
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,271
- Come on.
- It's coming to me.

492
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,569
I saved his life.

493
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,245
Well, more metaphorically.

494
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,314
No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened.

495
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,818
It was, like,
one of them train track kind of deals.

496
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,611
My man over here, I see him,

497
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,656
he drops his burrito on the tracks.

498
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,448
I'm like, "All right, that happens."

499
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,326
Next thing you know,
homeboy leaps down there,

500
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,294
and he tries to retrieve the burrito.

501
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,164
Okay? I see a train whizzing at him.

502
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,758
I'm like, "This guy's about to die,
and he don't know it."

503
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,202
I fucking leap down there myself, right,

504
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,000
and I give him a little shove on the heinie.

505
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,631
"Get out of the way, buddy!"

506
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,004
Next thing you know, I realize

507
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,768
this thing's going to hit me.

508
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,470
I fucking remember, though,

509
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,740
I had a kung fu instructor

510
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,112
who taught me
how to tighten the diaphragm,

511
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,980
and I bring it in there.

512
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,314
And I feel the train go by.

513
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,409
My eyes are closed.

514
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,252
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
I open my eyes.

515
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,316
I see all these chicks just kind of looking
at me, going, "What is that?

516
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,883
"That's the fucking
most chiseled guy I've ever seen."

517
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,725
I worked out at the time.

518
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,322
Anyways, the place goes bananas for me,
I sign a couple of titties,

519
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,094
and I started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

520
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,726
Best friends, right? Here you go, my boy.

521
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,397
I just can't believe
I've never heard that story before.

522
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,967
Why wouldn't you just
get another burrito, Todd?

523
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,073
Wouldn't it be dirty?

524
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,080
Great questions.

525
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,942
It's one of the many things about this story
that's pretty hard to believe.

526
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,683
So, where are you staying, Donny?

527
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,149
He's not staying.

528
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,210
No.

529
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,723
I can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right.

530
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,988
Oh, pshaw. I mean, invite him to stay here.

531
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,530
You have to stay.

532
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,862
He's your best friend. You're his best friend.

533
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,367
Sheesh, I'm not messing with her.

534
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,903
I mean, you are my best friend, guy.

535
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,439
And, Jamie, you can be my breast friend.

536
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,076
Breast, with an With an

537
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,577
By the way, dude, you look fantastic.

538
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,376
You lost all the weight, homeboy.

539
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,647
I miss the titties.

540
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,985
You saved my life? Seriously?

541
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,956
What? They ate that up.

542
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,688
You came up with a whole lot of nothing.

543
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,657
That's a nice suitcase, by the way.

544
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,788
What is that, Louis Vuitton?

545
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,730
This is a Hefty bag.

546
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,566
What the fuck are you talking about?

547
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,532
What do you want, Donny? Money?

548
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,163
You heard I was doing well,
so you came looking for a handout?

549
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,606
I don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

550
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,109
I get it. You don't like me.

551
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,576
I exploded.

552
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,768
I wish you had exploded.

553
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,007
That way, I wouldn't have to
see your stupid face anymore!

554
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,071
Did you happen to notice

555
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,175
I created a whole fake life
just so I could get away from you?

556
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,952
Your mother's sick, by the way.

557
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,579
I don't believe you.

558
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,956
They don't know how long she's got.

559
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,322
What is that, nunchucks?

560
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,823
I told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

561
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,268
I'm kind of thinking you're the kind of guy
who would pull through for Mumsie.

562
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,068
Know what I'm saying?

563
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:39,130
She'd do the same for you.

564
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:40,799
Really?

565
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,569
Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day
before the big surgery, so...

566
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,007
So let me get this straight.

567
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,244
You want me to go visit my "sick mom"

568
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,445
that I haven't talked to in years, in prison,

569
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,987
the day before my wedding.

570
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,313
Correct.

571
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,755
Not happening, asshole.

572
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,918
What the fuck did I do to you

573
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,120
to make you hate me so much?

574
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,685
I am fucking baffled right now.

575
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,664
Well, maybe you don't remember,
but you were basically the worst parent ever.

576
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,860
Me? I did everything for you, buddy,

577
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,426
and I never gave you
an ounce of shit about nothing.

578
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,137
You never gave me nothing.

579
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,467
I gave you a snake.

580
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,134
Yeah, and then it died
after it ate all your Quaaludes.

581
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:17,470
That was the onlytime
anybody's ever seen a king cobra laugh.

582
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,305
And I take pride in that, so fuck you.

583
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,145
Yeah, great. You know what?

584
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,278
I basically had to raise myself, Donny.

585
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,719
I never learned how to swim.

586
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,279
I don't even know how to ride a bike.

587
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,824
You know how fucking humiliating that is?

588
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,924
What about Mr. Mitty? Remember him?

589
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,286
What? No. What's that?

590
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,331
Mr. Mitty. I used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

591
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,867
He would cheer you up
all the time when you were sad.

592
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,560
"Don't be upset, young man.

593
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,467
"I'm your best friend.

594
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,199
"Even though I'm an oven mitt."

595
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,106
No, I don't remember that, okay?

596
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,198
You know what I do remember?

597
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,509
You making me
drive you home from the beach

598
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,636
'cause you got too drunk.

599
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,205
It makes sense to me.

600
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,579
When somebody's hammered,
they have another guy drive home.

601
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:54,939
I was eight!

602
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,148
Well, you looked 14
'cause you were such a huge fat fuck.

603
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,210
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,823
You are such an asshole.

605
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,221
Dude, you're a millionaire now,

606
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,318
and you're marrying that hot chick.

607
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,789
I must have done
a pretty decent job as a dad, don't you think?

608
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,624
Oh, yeah? You want to check in
on your pretty decent job?

609
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,094
Oh, my God.

610
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,934
You're a junkie? 'Who's your supplier?

611
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,831
'Cause I'll smack that motherfucker around.

612
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,600
It's insulin, you dick.

613
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,237
I'm a diabetic 'cause you let me eat
cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.

614
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,941
But that's what you fucking asked for.

615
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,777
Yeah, you're supposed to say no.

616
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,044
You know, I weighed 400 pounds
by the time I was 12.

617
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,883
You know how hard it was
to take that weight off?

618
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,451
All right, all right.

619
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,849
I didn't know what I was doing.
I had no one helping me.

620
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,526
Grandpa was a psycho. You know that.

621
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,927
Han Solo, don't be like this.

622
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,192
I'm a good person.

623
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,733
Okay, don't call me that, all right?

624
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,927
My name's Todd now.

625
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,493
Call yourself Han Solo.
You're dressed like him.

626
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,068
Good one.

627
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,905
I'm just saying, buddy, give me a chance.

628
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,410
Do you have any Axe body spray?

629
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,107
No, Donny, I don't have any Axe body spray.

630
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,311
Because I'm not a fucking douche bag.

631
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,080
That's a douche bag thing?

632
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,919
When did that become a douche bag thing?

633
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,118
Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go!

634
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,352
All right, can you lighten up a little bit?

635
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,657
We got a party to attend.

636
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,719
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,598
Good person, how about
you put on a tie, okay?

638
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,726
It's a cocktail party, not a Quiznos opening.

639
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:24,003
'What? I haven't worn a tie
since my mother's funeral when I was three.

640
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,336
I'm not going to start that up again.

641
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,803
That's great. Put on a tie.

642
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,305
- No.
- Put on a tie!

643
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,810
I'll never sell out.

644
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,477
I'll give you 100 bucks.

645
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,938
Where's the tie?

646
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,015
Look at this.

647
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,578
Jamie is going to have it all.

648
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,150
By the way, Mr. Spirou,

649
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,285
I read the OPEC report, and I was thinking,

650
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,261
if we hedge our position on oil,
we could really...

651
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,867
If we were to short the euro, we could...

652
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,436
Come on, Todd.
This is your wedding weekend.

653
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,800
You are marrying a real workaholic.
You do know that.

654
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,600
Yeah, but isn't that
what you want in a partner?

655
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,803
She's good, this one.

656
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,176
She's good.

657
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,042
All right, all right.

658
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,381
I haven't made that decision yet,

659
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:11,913
but I love this kid.

660
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,450
You lost your dad in that explosion,

661
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,918
and I lost my son.

662
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,318
I thought your son
was a ski instructor in Vail.

663
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,929
He's a pot-smoking bum!

664
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,096
Not like you, Todd. Oh, no.

665
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,031
You're the type of boy
a father can be proud of.

666
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,528
Yeah, we'll never know, will we?

667
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,272
- Who's that?
- I'm not here.

668
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,708
That's Donny.

669
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,135
Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone.

670
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,639
Oh, God, hang on.

671
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,206
Let me swing these free.

672
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,210
Glad all the children saw that.

673
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,683
Donny.

674
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,222
This is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss.

675
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,057
Wassup!

676
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,523
Is that back?

677
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,694
Because I've been dying
for that to come back.

678
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,792
Wassup!

679
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,131
Yeah!

680
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,966
That's my boy! Look at him!

681
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,268
He ain't a tight-ass.

682
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,434
Wassup!

683
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,036
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

684
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,545
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

685
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,209
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

686
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,140
Wassup!

687
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,149
What's up?

688
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,456
Boo!

689
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,862
That was terrible, Todd.

690
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,686
So, I see the train coming,

691
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,790
and something
kind of like takes over me, you know?

692
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,160
- Here you go, Abigail.
- Thank you.

693
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,365
And so, I decide to jump
off the platform, right?

694
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,399
Snaps my legs in two.

695
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,968
What did I expect?
It was a 25-foot drop, you know?

696
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,541
Twenty-five feet?

697
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,873
So I grab Burrito Bandito over here,

698
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,279
and I just roll him out of the way.

699
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,580
The train missed our skulls by inches.

700
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,813
Why would you do
something like that, Todd?

701
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,621
You know, I really don't know, Steve.

702
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,859
I mean, why wouldn't you
just buy another burrito?

703
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,558
Yeah, no, I know.

704
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,254
I don't know what I could have been thinking.

705
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,628
Maybe he was high on the hashish.

706
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,930
Hey, how about I
get you another beer, huh, Donny Boy?

707
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,393
Twenty's my limit.

708
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,995
<i>No! No, no.</i>

709
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,837
But, Donny Boy
has got to go to bed, though, right?

710
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,871
Oh, fiddlesnatch.

711
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,537
It's the afternoon.

712
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,510
Remember you told me
you wanted to get to bed early?

713
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,074
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, no.

714
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,142
Todd's right.

715
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,209
Oh, my God.

716
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,954
You're right, it is him.

717
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,513
- You're Donny Berger.
- It's him.

718
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,260
Do you remember that kid who got
his teacher pregnant in Somerville?

719
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,985
Wait a minute, that is you.

720
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,223
Donny Berger.

721
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,490
Didn't you and your teacher have a kid?

722
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,999
Wait a minute. What was his name?

723
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,797
Indiana Jones, huh?

724
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,993
It was something fantastic like that.

725
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,368
Yeah, Han Solo Berger.

726
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,665
Yeah, Han Solo, Han Solo.
What ever happened to him?

727
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,067
What happened to him?

728
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,804
He actually became a dick.

729
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,745
A private eye, I mean.

730
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,608
One of the biggest
and hairiest dicks in the world.

731
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,175
Okay.

732
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,682
Hey, look, this might seem weird,
but do you think you would ever...

733
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,256
Bone your wife? Yeah, I mean, I'd love to.

734
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,052
She's a hot little number.

735
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,089
'Well, you know, I was just
going to ask you for an autograph, but...

736
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,633
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. On her tits or...

737
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,331
- Or a piece of paper would be fine.
- Yeah, or a photo.

738
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,034
Okay, well, this has been fun.

739
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,341
- But, Donny...
- Not to toot my own horn,

740
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,069
but I got kind of close once.

741
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,509
Mrs. Weiss, freshman geometry.

742
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,910
And I think she would have done it, too.

743
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,743
I just didn't know how to make the move.

744
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,482
You know what? I would have killed

745
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,280
to bang my eighth grade
biology teacher, Mrs. Cohn.

746
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,117
I used to dream of
dissecting her with my penis.

747
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:37,057
It's so weird what goes on upstairs
when you hit puberty.

748
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,862
I actually stole
my middle school librarian's glasses

749
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,160
to wear while I masturbated.

750
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,923
What is that about?

751
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,602
In my day, when I got into trouble,

752
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,773
the headmaster would
slap your hand with his dick.

753
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,371
She wins.

754
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,475
You know, Todd was working at the cubicle

755
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,949
next to mine one year,
12 weeks and one day ago

756
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,350
when he met a pretty girl
at the gym named Jamie.

757
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,014
How many days is that, Todd?

758
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,622
Computing, Steve.

759
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,820
451.

760
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,621
It's actually 450.

761
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,599
Battle of the brainiacs!

762
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,199
Yeah, this guy forgot
about leap year, I guess.

763
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,700
He's smarter than Todd!

764
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,408
Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers,
but let's get back to love.

765
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,033
What's the matter, hot stuff?

766
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,135
Where do you think you get it from?

767
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,440
Your mother was a math teacher,

768
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,311
and I was pretty much a whiz kid myself.

769
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,976
The ability to make a bong
out of a Taco Bell cup

770
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,383
doesn't make you a whiz kid, Donny.

771
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,253
Leap year, motherfucker.

772
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,355
I think it's kind of a magical moment.

773
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,055
You know, Todd's oldest friend, Donny,
miraculously appearing like this.

774
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,119
What?

775
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,793
So I am graciously
going to step aside and allow Donny

776
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,792
to take over as the best man.

777
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,893
Give it up for Donny!

778
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,369
Oh! no; no,

779
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,031
Phil, you don't have to do that.

780
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,238
No music. No, no, no, no.

781
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,603
Kill the music. Phil, Phil, you...

782
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,404
That's so nice of you,
but you don't have to do that.

783
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,806
Oh, I don't mind. You two are very close.

784
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,181
We are. We are very close,
but you and I are close, too.

785
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,952
Well, we work together,
but I wouldn't call us close.

786
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,325
I mean, I was actually kind of surprised
when you asked me to be your best man.

787
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,019
Made me feel a little sorry for you.

788
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,756
That's true. He had no idea who he was.

789
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,059
No.

790
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,326
I accept. I do. I love it. It's an honor.

791
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,164
- Way to go, Donny!
- Are you kidding me?

792
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,227
You got Fenway Park in your backyard?

793
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,534
I had that built
when my son started Little League.

794
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,666
He never used it.

795
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,437
The little douche bag
just sat in his room listening to reggae.

796
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,043
Well, let's lose these ties
and hit some dingers.

797
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,545
What do you say? Come on!

798
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,376
No, no, no.
Please, don't let this be happening.

799
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,548
Don't let this be happening, please.

800
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,057
No sports.

801
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,883
All right, guys,
let's see what we got out there.

802
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,191
Please don't hit it to me. Please don't
hit it to me. Please don't hit it to me.

803
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,023
Get under it, kid.

804
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,330
Yeah!

805
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,295
Moron.

806
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,139
Here we go! Taking down two there!

807
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,241
All right, Gerald, kid! Here we go, guy!

808
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,803
Stay on it!

809
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,779
Oh. my God!

810
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,051
Grandma, what's up, honey?
Are you awake, sweetheart?

811
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,314
Here we go.

812
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,583
Get under it! Get dirty!

813
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,453
What the fuck?

814
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,054
- Got it.
- Nice catch, Mama!

815
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,421
Let's let Todd-0 get this one, huh?

816
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,063
Oh, no, that's okay.

817
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,665
Todd, come on!

818
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,460
No, no. Hit one to that two-year-old.

819
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,968
He hasn't gotten one yet.

820
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,300
Here you go, big man.

821
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,974
- What?
- Quit showing off

822
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,806
for the girls, buddy. They're mine.

823
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:44,671
Come on, now.

824
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,448
You got it. You got it.

825
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,881
Okay, Todd, you all set, buddy?

826
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,184
Don't hit it to me.

827
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,349
Coming to you, homie.

828
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,156
Holy shit.

829
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,394
Oh, my God. Are you all right, guy?

830
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,869
Come on. You're fine.

831
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,506
Throw it in there, guy.

832
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,404
I think the ball's broken.

833
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,136
Throw it in, Todd.

834
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,374
Todd, throw the ball.

835
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,111
Come on, Todd!

836
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,117
Throw it, you big vagina. Do it.

837
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,015
Todd, we want to keep playing, buddy.

838
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,215
We need a ball, kid.

839
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,313
Just throw it.

840
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,414
Such a pussy.

841
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,750
On a rope!

842
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,091
Holy fuck!

843
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,326
<i>We now return to The Donny Berger Story,
starring Ian Ziering.</i>

844
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,697
- Yo!
- Donny.

845
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,566
- I'm in a Jacuzzi. Hang on one sec.
- Yeah.

846
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,802
Fucking... Here.

847
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,241
- Who'll take the cigar?
- Oh, no.

848
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,367
- Donny.
- Keep that lit for me.

849
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,639
Take my fucking shades.

850
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,975
- Wear them if you want.
- Yeah!

851
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,208
All right. So, hang on.

852
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,272
I want to wear them.

853
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,476
I'll be back.

854
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,912
All right.

855
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:01,979
My goodness!

856
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,384
Yeah, what's going on?

857
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,225
Guess what's on TV?

858
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,190
<i>Hey, there, little buddy.</i>

859

What is that, The Donny Berger Story?

862
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,294
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

863
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,598
Don't you get money
every time that shit is shown?

864
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,767
This could be your "get out of jail free" card.

865
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,842
Last check I got for that was 85 cents.

866
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,513
Is Han Solo gonna do
the show at the women's prison with you?

867
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,310
You know, I haven't
discussed any particulars with him yet.

868
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,355
I am actually just trying
to be a dad right now.

869
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,381
You're gonna go to prison on Tuesday.

870
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,323
You have got to get that money somehow.

871
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,220
Kenny, what the fuck?

872
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,887
I thought this was a bathroom!

873
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:42,987
Fuck you!

874
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,125
- Honk!
- Oh, nobody squeezes my titty

875
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,327
<i>for free, honey!</i>

876
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,097
Okay, good luck with that.

877
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,099
God, you're such an idiot!

878
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,232
Todd, you already messed up my flowers!

879
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,506
- I'm sorry.
- Just get the cake!

880
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,040
No walnuts! No fucking excuses!

881
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,540
I love you! Do you love me?

882
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,842
What?

883
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,451
"You screwed up my cake!

884
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,715
"You screwed up my cake!"

885
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,949
What?

886
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,685
It's me, it's me. Can I come in?

887
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,124
- Yeah, sure.
- What's up, buddy?

888
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,129
What was she yelling at?
What'd you do wrong?

889
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,557
She's just stressed out
'cause of the wedding.

890
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,031
Oh, really?

891
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,569
You sure she's not stressed out
about maybe sex or something?

892
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,399
Have you been going down on her?

893
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,338
- What?
- No, I'm just saying,

894
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,466
a lot of times, girls I've met over the years,

895
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,771
when they've been
ragging on me and yelling at me and shit,

896
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,279
if I kiss their pussies, they kind of go,

897
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,474
"You're right, you're a good guy."

898
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,979
Yeah, that's personal, Donny.

899
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,982
Yeah,no,no.
You know her better than me, fine.

900
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,813
So...

901
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,122
You wear a bathing suit in the shower?

902
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,926
- You know that's fucking nuts, right?
- Are you serious?

903
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,554
I can't even take my shirt off
in front of other people because of you.

904
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,026
Because of me. What did I do this time?

905
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,925
Let me jog your memory.

906
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,441
The New Kids on the Block!

907
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,868
Holy shit!

908
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,071
Their heads are all warped now!

909
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,580
Oh. my God!

910
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,843
Yeah, it's 'cause I got it
when I was in third grade.

911
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,009
My body grew.

912
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,178
I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine.
Let me see it again.

918
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,259
Why you getting so serious?

919
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,459
I still got the tattoo I got when I was...

920

- Yeah, Chad.
- No, no.

952

It's actually a funny story.

Aw, God, I got to start doing
some crunches or something.

Oh, you don't like him?

959
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,682
Oh, we don't like you.

960
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,214
He's talking to his dick, buddy.

961
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,248
Now he's hitting it.

962
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,879
No! Why?

963
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,616
You got to puff that fucker up!

964
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,085
Oh, what? No.

965
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,129
You don't have to puff that fucker up.

966
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,390
Let's do this.

967
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,466
Chad, I'm sure you're very athletic... Okay!

968
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,694
Okay!

969
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,095
I tap out. You win, you win. I tap out.

970
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,638
Do you like fucking my sister, Todd?

971
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,701
I mean, do you like
sticking your dirty booger fingers in her?

972
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,867
Whoa, what was that?

973
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,571
Let's all just keep our heads, okay?

974
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,943
We've all been drinking a lot tonight.

975
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,014
I'm gonna skull-fuck you...

976
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,751
And that is the end of that.

977
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,156
What, you're mad at me?

978
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,558
How am I the fucking bad guy right now?

979
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,996
You're gonna fucking give me shit
with that tattoo on your back?

980
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,033
Look at that stupid fucking thing.

981
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,089
Good buddy, he'll be fine.

982
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,864
Yeah, so we got Chad
all tucked in, safe and sound.

983
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,971
I never heard of him
passing out drunk before.

984
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,199
Yeah, it was crazy. It was like,

985
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,504
one second, he was with us, totally awake.

986
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,273
Next thing you know, he's face down,

987
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,938
birds a-chirpin'.

988
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,307
What do you think?

989
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,010
You look amazing.

990
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,615
Oh, wait! Isn't it bad luck

991
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,451
for me to see the dress
before the wedding, though?

992
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,014
This is a $12,000 Vera Wang dress.

993
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,319
I'm gonna wear it whenever I want.

994
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,025
You'd look hot in a $12 Wang Chung dress.

995
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,323
That sounds like a line Donny would say.

996
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:11,728
Yeah, except he'd say,

997
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,998
"You'd look friggin' hot
in a Wang Dang Sweet Poontang dress."

998
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,269
Just think he's, like,
trailer park-y or something, you know?

999
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,997
- Yeah.
- That's probably why his son ran off.

1000
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,639
His what? What? Who? His son about...

1001
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,470
What'd he say?
What did you hear? Did he say something?

1002
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,413
Just look at the first page of that book
he's been handing out to everyone.

1003
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,108
He has? What? No.

1004
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,048
<i>Head in the Class?</i>

1005
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:35,017
He said it's like Head of the Class,
only with blowjobs.

1006
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,053
It's gross.

1007
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,123
Yeah, it's gross. Blowjobs are gross.

1008
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,321
We don't do those.

1009
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,898
"Dear Jamie,
I know you'll make Todd very happy

1010
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,455
"if you bleach your little brown eye."

1011
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,330
Oh, no, not this part.

1012
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,343
Wow, that's sad.

1013
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,713
That weirdly got me.

1014
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,983
I don't know why it got me, but it just got me.

1015
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,754
Can I get a hug right now, or...

1016
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,155
No, no, no, no! We can't wrinkle the dress.

1017
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,161
Hey, if you don't want to wrinkle the dress,

1018
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,096
may I suggest we just remove it?

1019
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,493
Did you take two Xanax?

1020
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,933
I actually took three Xanax.

1021
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,198
And you know that the Xanax makes me

1022
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,634
<i>"H" to the "O" to the "R" To the "N" to the "Y"</i>

1023
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:27,767
<i>So horny for my fiancée</i>

1024
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,504
No! Down.

1025
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,404
I don't want to have sex
with my family in the house.

1026
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,704
No, I know.

1027
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,149
I don't want to have sex
with your family, either.

1028
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,480
In the house.

1029
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,316
Came out weird.

1030
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,784
Possibly my last night of
spanking the hell out of it

1031
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,520
without having a roommate
watching me, so...

1032
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,419
What do we got to work with here?

1033
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,258
Rich people magazines.

1034
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,373
Let's see what we got.

1035
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,072
If I hadn't partied with her husband
so many times, I would.

1036
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,977
But it's disrespectful to him.

1037
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,349
I don't know.

1038
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,444
Hello.

1039
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,986
Jeezum Crow, you really were a model,
weren't you, Grandma?

1040
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:23,495
Yeah, old Mr. Woolworth really, really knew
how to pick them, didn't he?

1041
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,329
I love that old-time bathing suit.

1042
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,270
I could take you
to the speakeasy, and we could,

1043
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,599
we could do the naked Charleston.

1044
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,370
I have to ship out in the
morning to fight the Nazis,

1045
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,381
so you better give me
something to remember.

1046
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,509
What's that?

1047
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,308
Oh, my God.

1048
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,288
Old lady Grandma wants to
get in on the action, too.

1049
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,387
Should we let her?

1050
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,723
I think we should.

1051
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,427
Oh, my God.

1052
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,623
Why do I like her better right now?

1053
00:45:58,322 --> 00:45:59,562
Oh, you bad...

1054
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,330
What have you done to me?

1055
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,234
What have you done to me?

1056
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,336
We got to go for round two,
but give me a little bit of time.

1057
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,977
Give me a little bit of time.

1058
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,713
Oh, lovely.

1059
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,685
Just lovely.

1060
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,354
Goodness.

1061
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,896
Oh, my word.

1062
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,000
Best man, wedding rehearsal in an hour.

1063
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,046
There's so many tissues.

1064
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,614
Oh, God. You know,
don't touch those, okay? Let's...

1065
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,220
Okay.

1066
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,913
I'm gonna just clean that up.

1067
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,451
Yeah, Donny's sick.

1068
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,756
You don't want to touch these
'cause you'll get sick.

1069
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,019
He's got post-nasal drip, so...

1070
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,638
The tissue's stuck to my picture.

1071
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,900
Here, let me.

1072
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,240
I'll grab that from you. I got it.

1073
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,006
Oh, look at that!
There's a little tissue beard there.

1074
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,208
No, don't touch it, please.
Don't worry about it.

1075
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,750
Oh, that poor dear.

1076
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,178
I'll just get him some nice, fresh juice.

1077
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,111
Juice. That's a great idea.

1078
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,713
Thank you, Grandma D. Thanks.

1079
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,760
You know, hon,
if he's really under the weather,

1080
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:36,093
maybe it's best
if he doesn't masturbate so much.

1081
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,962
That's good advice.

1082
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,592
I'll tell him that, thank you.

1083
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,974
Okay, you can stop
pretending to sleep, Sir Jizz-a-lot.

1084
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,970
The old broad knew I was whacking to
her the whole time, didn't she?

1085
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,336
That's so funny.

1086
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,747
But your improve were awesome.
"Post-nasal dick," or whatever you said.

1087
00:47:55,973 --> 00:48:00,217
You know, I can't believe
your balls produce that much stuff.

1088
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,315
Dude, at least I got balls.

1089
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,819
What's that supposed to mean?

1090
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,156
Let me just crack open
some happiness first, yeah.

1091
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,856
All I'm saying is the Chad thing,

1092
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,662
when that dude came at you last night,

1093
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,925
you kind of, like,
looked like a deer in headlights.

1094
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,272
Your whole aura is actually that of a pussy.

1095
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,534
Or a kiss-ass.

1096
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:20,939
It is not.

1097
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,034
It is, too.

1098
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,269
What the fuck am I doing?

1099
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,645
No, I'm just saying
you got to stand up for yourself

1100
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,979
every once in a while, buddy,
or she's never gonna bang you.

1101
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,911
I'll have you know, she bangs me all the time.

1102
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,622
All right? She bangs.

1103
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,758
<i>Does she live the la vida loca, too, or...</i>

1104
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,582
Very funny.

1105
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,356
Well, good day, everyone.

1106
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,526
Father.

1107
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,866
Father McNally, thank you so much
for coming out to the Cape.

1108
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,060
My honor.

1109
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,197
Very cool.

1110
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,262
Oh, yes.

1111
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,967
Chad.

1112
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,570
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1113
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,210
While you're in this church,
you'll show the proper respect.

1114
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,605
No e-mailing, no texting,

1115
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,247
<i>no Facebooking,
no Skyping and no Angry Birds.</i>

1116
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,220
That one hurts.

1117
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,857
No, no. I get it.

1118
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,817
It's the 2010s.

1119
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,162
Everyone's having sex and drinking lattes.

1120
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,921
No, Father.

1121
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,031
But, you see, this is my world.

1122
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,028
We'll abide by my rules while we're here.

1123
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,308
Maybe we should start
with the father of the groom.

1124
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,544
His father passed away.

1125
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,475
He died in an explosion.

1126
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,285
Sounds fishy, but it really happened.

1127
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,753
I'm truly sorry to hear that, son.

1128
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,217
Thank you, but it's fine.

1129
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,884
He deserved it.

1130
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,560
So...

1131
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,029
What is that supposed to mean?

1132
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,298
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.

1133
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,495
He just, you know, wasn't a great dad.

1134
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,746
So your father, he abused you, did he?

1135
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,714
No, nothing like that.

1136
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,211
Was he a murderer? Rapist?

1137
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,254
No. Father, I'm sorry, I...

1138
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,259
My father beat me every day with a rake.

1139
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:23,160
But you don't hear me smack-talking him
like some baby little princess.

1140
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,995
Not here in the house of the Lord.

1141
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,137
You know, I can't hear a word you're saying.

1142
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,345
All I can focus on is your shit breath.

1143
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,852
I'd like to show you the garden for a minute.

1144
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,460
Now, then.

1145
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,865
Okay, you know what? Let's just...

1146
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,867
Fucking old guy's got

1147
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,276
-a cannon on him.
- What happened?

1148
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,336
What happened
is I think he's having a mini-meltdown.

1149
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,580
- Yeah, he's taking his shirt off now.
- Oh, my God.

1150
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,086
And he's pretty ripped for an old fuck,
so we're in trouble right now.

1151
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,782
What is going on here?

1152
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,083
All right, all right.

1153
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,180
Go time, go time.

1154
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,316
No, think about what you're doing!

1155
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,620
Be careful.

1156
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,391
He bit me!

1157
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,823
Did you see that? That was amazing!

1158
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,954
This could get ugly.

1159
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,159
The Father actually killed a guy in the ring.

1160
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,530
That's why he became a priest.

1161
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,734
Just keep your hands up, kid!

1162
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,827
Get 'em down!

1163
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,372
Hang in there, guy!

1164
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,470
He keeps punching him!

1165
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,871
Come on, guy.

1166
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,839
That's my boy!

1167
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:49,816
Why, you came right back
with your own shit. Nice, kid.

1168
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
What the fuck is that?

1169
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,748
Okay, he's going to
a whole other place right now.

1170
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,289
You know what? Maybe just run.

1171
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,456
Get the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go.

1172
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,256
No.

1173
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,126
I'm not gonna run.

1174
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,702
Finish him, Father McNally!

1175
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:10,135
Finish him!

1176
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,813
Geez. He went down
like a sack of potatoes, huh?

1177
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,054
What is the matter with you?

1178
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,560
You know, we've known
Father McNally for 30 years.

1179
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,120
- Thirty years! Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

1180
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,557
I ought to rip off your head!

1181
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,090
Gerald!

1182
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,397
I'm sorry.

1183
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,098
Sorry's not gonna keep you
from burning in hell, Todd.

1184
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,931
Hey, this is all my fault.

1185
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,839
I shouldn't have hit the guy with the bottle.

1186
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,275
I'm, like, a moron over here.

1187
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,468
No, now, Donny,
I will not let you take the blame for this.

1188
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,742
You had to do it. You saved his life again.

1189
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,048
And you looked very sexy doing it.

1190
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,219
Why was the sound of that bottle so familiar?

1191
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,220
Todd is such a loser.

1192
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:03,952
Here comes your girl. Here we go.

1193
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,819
Jame, I'm sorry, but, look,

1194
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,418
you got to admit,
I stood up for myself back there.

1195
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,756
Do you have fucking rocks
in your head, Todd?

1196
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,254
No.

1197
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,322
Well, where are we gonna get married now?

1198
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,766
We got kicked out of the church!

1199
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,029
Jame...

1200
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,564
What is everybody's problem?

1201
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,401
You were awesome out there.
You kicked ass.

1202
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,236
- You should be proud of yourself.
- Proud of myself?

1203
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:21,870
For what?

1204
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,412
I got my ass kicked,
and everyone's pissed off at me.

1205
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,879
And, by the way,
thanks for the fatherly advice, guy.

1206
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,245
That's the last time I listen to you.

1207
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,047
- I'm gonna choke him out!
- He's an asshole!

1208
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:36,486
I'm gonna choke him out.

1209
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,048
I'm just gonna choke him out.

1210
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:39,453
Hey, guys, guys?

1211
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,258
Can I just say
something before we all turn on Todd?

1212
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,063
Churches freak the kid out,

1213
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,998
ever since his father's funeral.

1214
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,769
After the explosion,

1215
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:55,674
all that was left of his dad was, like,
a kneecap and a little bit of nut sack.

1216
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,676
It was supposed to be a closed casket,

1217
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,943
but there was a foul-up at the mortuary,

1218
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,007
and he actually saw a squirrel

1219
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,180
run into the coffin and kind of

1220
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,456
squeak out of there with his
dad's ball bag in his mouth.

1221
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,584
You know, that's gonna
fuck any of us up, so...

1222
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,188
So you actually knew Todd's father?

1223
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,088
Of course I knew the guy.

1224
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,962
He was handsome, he had fucking great hair,

1225
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,130
a Jedi with the chicks.

1226
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,839
Went down on girls
for a wicked long time 'cause he was a giver

1227
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,430
and he wanted to see others be happy.

1228
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,736
I wish I could have met him.

1229
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,339
Sounds like a gentleman.

1230
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,443
Was he there enough for the kid?

1231
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,778
No, maybe not. But,

1232
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,519
you know, he probably felt bad about it.

1233
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,788
You know, and there's nothing
he can do about it now, so...

1234
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,950
Toddsy.

1235
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,125
Oh, Todd.

1236
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,627
I had no idea.

1237
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,323
Poor thing. Are you okay?

1238
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,387
Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,688
It's fine, but

1240
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,066
sometimes I do still have nightmares.

1241
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,158
Oh, boy.

1242
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:57,929
That squirrel and its demonic eyes.

1243
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,306
Tiny piece of skin flapping in its mouth.

1244
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,243
One lone scraggly hair.

1245
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,670
A pubic hair.

1246
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,208
I mean, maybe this is
a blessing, though, guys.

1247
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,309
Do we really want
Father McNutty to be the one

1248
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,411
who brings these two guys together?

1249
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,750
I mean, I don't think so.

1250
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,251
I'm pretty tied into the church crowd

1251
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,191
Rageaholics Anonymous and whatnot.

1252
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,626
I could find a priest for you.

1253
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:21,992
I mean, what type are we looking for?

1254
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,392
Maybe a younger guy.

1255
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:24,454
Younger guy.

1256
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,625
How about a black guy?

1257
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,324
Now, I like that.

1258
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,267
It's very urban, very street.

1259
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:30,593
Okay.

1260
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,797
But that still doesn't get us a church.

1261
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,805
Well, I'll tell you where I would tie the knot
if I was these two sexy kids.

1262
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,883
Donny, this is just such a great idea.

1263
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,386
- Thanks.
- Don't you love the pergola?

1264
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,649
They're gorgeous!

1265
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,590
You know what,
maybe a little more girly shit up on the arch.

1266
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,784
You know, you're right.

1267
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,852
Excuse me, sir,
put some more girly shit up there.

1268
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,158
Calling all ladies!

1269
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,199
The bus for the bachelorette party is here!
Come on!

1270
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,266
Honey, you guys have fun
at the bachelor party!

1271
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,528
Okay.

1272
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,299
Don't get too crazy. Know your limits.

1273
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,200
- Okay.
- We're having a bachelor party?

1274
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,535
That's, like, my thing, man.

1275
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,672
Hookers, blow, balloons filled with piss.

1276
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,772
I mean, the sky's the limit, kid.

1277
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,879
No, no, no. Donny, we're all set.

1278
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,749
I have arranged
a very special evening for us tonight.

1279
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,679
This is gonna be awesome!

1280
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,855
I read about this place in Oprah's magazine.

1281
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:29,090
I don't know if she writes the articles herself,
but there's some real good stuff in it.

1282
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,632
Hi, we're for the Todd Peterson party, please.

1283
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,992
Good evening, gentlemen.

1284
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,793
Mrs. Ravensdale.

1285
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,303
Phil, what a blessing.

1286
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:41,137
Welcome to your bachelor party package
here at He Time Spa For Men.

1287
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,004
Woo-hoo, motherfucker!

1288
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,205
Okay. All right.

1289
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,509
We're gonna set you up
with some nice plush robes,

1290
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,641
and then we have
a wonderful full evening planned

1291
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,913
with massage, facial and nail treatments,

1292
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,548
and then we're going to send you home

1293
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:59,390
with a special gift
of our house-made lavender scrub.

1294
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,130
Confucius say,
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

1295
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:04,923
No, Donny,

1296
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,457
Phil thought
it would be nice before the wedding

1297
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,061
for us to all take a little time
to just chill and mellow.

1298
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,204
My wife and I have been
burning it on both ends all week

1299
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,742
with the preschool applications,

1300
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:16,573
and I am ready to be pampered!

1301
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,480
All right, all right. Now we're talking.

1302
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,449
Hey, thanks, honey.
What the fuck's your name?

1303
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,917
- Jessica. All right.
- Yeah.

1304
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,248
Hey, come on. Here's to the kid.

1305
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,313
He's fucking getting all fucked up tonight!

1306
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,414
Last night!

1307
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,824
Fucking last night of poontang for this kid.

1308
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,122
What the fuck is this?

1309
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,866
It's water infused with cucumber,
rose petal and harvest sandalwood.

1310
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,642
It tastes like fucking dick infused with balls.

1311
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,440
And a side of fucking Rod Stewart's jizz.

1312
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:57,041
Wait a minute. What are we drinking
water at a fucking bachelor party for, Phil?

1313
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,720
You got to show my son your tits later.

1314
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,154
Promise me. Promise me.

1315
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,061
That's nice. Yeah, good.

1316
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,895
This is great, sweetheart.

1317
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,590
Really good.

1318
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,326
Nice work. You're going deep on us, huh?

1319
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,068
That's it.

1320
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,862
What's this, sir?

1321
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:21,272
That's just a little tip, you know,
if you give me a full package.
