1
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:07,425
You're probably all wondering
why I called this team meeting

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,345
at 9:00 a.m., on a Saturday.

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:14,307
- Babe, we should've brought breakfast.
- It's fine. No one's hungry.

4
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,975
Ignore that.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,354
I could get Belgian waffles
from Brussels.

6
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:20,456
- Yum, that sounds good.
- Yeah?

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,665
- Should I do it?
- Barry, the best waffles...

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,776
No, no, no. Don't do that.

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,488
As much as I hate to say it...
waffles can wait.

10
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:34,035
First... there's something
we really need to tell you.

11
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,788
And we wanted our closest friends
to hear it first.

12
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,039
Are you guys pregnant?

13
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,749
Wait, is this about another Big Bad?

14
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,543
I'll call Chester and Allegra.

15
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:44,629
No. No. And definitely not.

16
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:49,551
What we wanted to say is...

17
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,954
- we're leaving Central City.
- We're leaving Central City.

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:55,932
When?

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,018
Tomorrow.

20
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,585
So, wait, you're...

21
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,878
You're moving?

22
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,758
Yeah. We both realize that we're ready
to start something new.

23
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,636
For me, it's my gallery show in Miami.
And, babe?

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,180
You two remember that guy, Chip Cooper?

25
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,727
Yeah. The A.R.G.U.S. director
of technology and science.

26
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:43,146
Well, he's been reassigned to CEMA.

27
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,317
The "Cosmic Emergency
Management Agency."

28
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,030
Wow. I really am the biggest nerd here.
Anyway, Chip's leaving.

29
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:57,535
And thanks to a great recommendation
from Lyla and Digg, uh...

30
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,413
A.R.G.U.S. offered me the job.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,128
The thing is,
they really need me, like, yesterday.

32
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:10,006
Yeah. I will be
joining Cisco in Star City

33
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,424
as soon as my exhibition is done.

34
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,764
Look, I know this is super short notice,

35
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,851
but they're both great
opportunities for us.

36
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,271
And we just hope you guys understand.

37
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,774
Of course we do. Yeah, it's great!

38
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,568
- This is great, man.
- So great! We're so happy!

39
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:32,778
Yeah.

40
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:35,990
You guys must have so much to do.

41
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:42,121
Um, I just have to show Chester a couple
things, and then finish packing, but...

42
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,082
Whatever you need, just let us know.

43
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,291
Of course.

44
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,834
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,601
Cool. Thanks.

46
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:50,922
- Okay.
- All right, congrats.

47
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,549
- Thank you.
- Woo-hoo! Yay!

48
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,803
- That went way better than expected.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,141
Sweet Sarah E. Goode.

50
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,770
This room has been here the whole time?

51
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,146
Yep.

52
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,776
And I kind of haven't done inventory
in six years, so...

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,073
Speed treadmill.

54
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:19,991
No way.

55
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:20,992
Yeah.

56
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,329
Yes!

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,290
Cool, cool, cool.

58
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,417
Freeze.

59
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,794
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,630
I don't even know what this is,
but it's so cool.

61
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,509
The Thinker's chair?

62
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,720
This is the droid I've been looking for.

63
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,638
Hey, what's all this?

64
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,686
You've got a lifetime's worth
of Comic-Con threads in here.

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,897
These bad boys are all coming with me...

66
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,524
- Mm.
- ...but the rest...

67
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,153
The rest is all yours.

68
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,115
Whoa!

69
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,536
Dude.

70
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,876
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

71
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,547
Team Chesco and all that.

72
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:20,553
Sorry, I know I got to be the zillionth
person to be getting all sappy on you.

73
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,973
You know, actually...

74
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:28,603
everyone else seems
to be taking the news really well.

75
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,229
Maybe it just didn't sink in yet.

76
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,647
I mean, because, dude...

77
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,275
this is the end of an era.

78
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:39,030
It is the end of an era.
You are so right, Ches.

79
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,033
This is such a big deal,
that people just...

80
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,952
probably need a little more time
to process it.

81
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,955
Yeah, they just need to soak it in,
you know?

82
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,039
Ah.

83
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,290
I gotta go pack.

84
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,420
Because an hour from now, we could be
knee deep in Kleenex and tears.

85
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,047
- Am I right?
- I bet.

86
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,091
I'm just gonna spend
the rest of the day here.

87
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,175
Go for it!

88
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,646
What the...

89
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,532
"Happy to help. Barry."

90
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,622
So, I guess that's done.

91
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,252
Wow. That was fast.

92
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:38,130
Yeah, it helps when your best friend's
the Flash, doesn't it?

93
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,507
Sure does.

94
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,885
Since it's just us...

95
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:46,764
how are you holding up?

96
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,186
You sure you're doing okay
with everything

97
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,063
that's happening, you know, me leaving?

98
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,149
Oh. Of course. I mean, come on,

99
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,529
A.R.G.U.S. has not one
but three bionic neural integrators.

100
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,031
You are moving on up, my friend.

101
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,702
Yeah, but fancy new toys aside,

102
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,248
if you wanna talk about anything...

103
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,417
Oh, there is something
that I wanted to say.

104
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,795
I knew it. What is it? Lay it on me.

105
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,965
"You suck forever.
But I love you, anyway."

106
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,843
It's from Frost.

107
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,096
She's stuck up in Mom's lab.
She's sorry she couldn't say good bye.

108
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:31,559
Frost. She kills me. She really does.

109
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,519
Me, too.

110
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:38,065
Do you remember how I got stuck
in the cryo-vault my first day?

111
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,085
You would have hacked
your way out of there.

112
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:43,029
We all knew you were a genius
from day one.

113
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,489
Yeah.

114
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,332
Can I have your ID badge?

115
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,797
Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. Right, right.

116
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,717
Thank you.
And your access codes, too, please.

117
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,888
Yes, ma'am. Happy to help.

118
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,640
Thank you.

119
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,783
So, you'd like
to open an account?

120
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,230
Actually, what I'd like to know...

121
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,610
...is what would make you happy?

122
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,490
Quitting this job. I hate it.

123
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,699
Then do it.

124
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,911
Live your best life.

125
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:33,955
You know what, I will.

126
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,917
I will record an album,
I'm thinking an EDM/country hybrid.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,001
What do you think?

128
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,797
I think what would make me happy

129
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,884
is a cashier's check
for ten million dollars.

130
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,554
Of course, right away.

131
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,309
- And who shall I make it out to?
- Cash.

132
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:01,523
And there you go.

133
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,234
Oh.

134
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,066
You're the best.

135
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,404
Well...

136
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,157
Now, I need you to wait here.

137
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,242
Okay.

138
00:08:11,243 --> 00:08:12,785
Say, 30 minutes?

139
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,245
Yeah.

140
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,748
Then you can leave
and never look back.

141
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,085
- Got it?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,669
Yes.

143
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,133
Who says money can't buy happiness?

144
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,140
<i>How much was stolen?</i>

145
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,393
Ten million, but no one stole anything.

146
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,397
Somehow, our suspect got Ellis
to give her a cashier's check.

147
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,066
Then she strolled out of the bank
and drove off in a blue van.

148
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,777
But Ellis was acting so weirdly happy,

149
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,196
I thought I'd check to see
if our suspect used

150
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,658
a neurotoxin on him
and found this instead.

151
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,303
Whoa.
It's a lot of dark matter.

152
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,787
So, we know our thief's a meta.

153
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,081
Now, we just need to figure out
how her powers work.

154
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,541
I can help with that.

155
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,376
She makes people euphoric.

156
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,462
Take a look at Ellis' brain scan.

157
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,048
So, she controls people's
cingulate cortexes.

158
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:09,050
Yes. Which is why
there's such huge levels

159
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,926
of dopamine and serotonin in his scan.

160
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,452
These levels were definitely enough

161
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,639
to make him loopy
and susceptible to suggestion.

162
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:19,018
Oh, yeah, he would have done
anything she asked him to do.

163
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,062
But the good news is,
the blissful effects

164
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,939
of her powers wear off
in about 24 hours.

165
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,649
Are you guys debriefing without me?

166
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,237
Hey. Yeah, we didn't wanna bother you.

167
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,950
We figured you'd be busy packing
your apartment... or not.

168
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,037
Yeah, well...

169
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,957
I wouldn't pass up the chance

170
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,212
to solve one last case together,
now, would I?

171
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,048
Cisco, this is just a meta
who makes people happy.

172
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,217
I think Barry and I
can handle it ourselves.

173
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,760
Or...

174
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,682
OG Team Flash can make taking her down

175
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:02,269
part of our last mission together.

176
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:08,359
Guys, come on.
I want to do this with you.

177
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,948
Oh, okay. Well, then
that's what we'll do.

178
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:16,951
Thank you so much.

179
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,701
Good news, boss.

180
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,083
Though I didn't get much
from the badge on site,

181
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,924
I did manage to get quotes from
the eyewitness who saw the perp leave.

182
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,253
Okay, great work. I will send you
my interview with Stanley Ellis.

183
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,630
Can you start on a copy?
I need a thousand words ASAP.

184
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,466
On it. I'm gonna need a photo
to run with the story.

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,427
Yeah, of course. I have one of Ellis
giving his statement.

186
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,723
Wait, was Cecile here earlier?

187
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,183
Guess so.

188
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,605
That's Detective Finn. Going to see
if he'll chat on the record. BRB.

189
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,774
Hey, Detective Finn...

190
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:52,820
Hey, so, about Cisco and me leaving.
I would have told you earlier.

191
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,663
It's just we wanted
to tell you all together.

192
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,866
No, don't worry. We were all so busy.

193
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:01,078
Iris, you trusted me
to be the eyes of <i>The Citizen.</i>

194
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,165
And that gave me the confidence
to take my career to the next level.

195
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,667
You changed my life
and I'll never forget that,

196
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,960
so, thank you.

197
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,670
You're welcome.

198
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,756
Now, I feel guilty about leaving you
on such short notice.

199
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,216
No, it's fine. Really.

200
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,218
No, it's not.

201
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,430
I know you're seeing new candidates
today, maybe I can help you vet them?

202
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,974
- Yeah, that'd be great. Come on.
- Okay.

203
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,356
I checked out Ellis' brain scan
and I had major déjà vu.

204
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,319
Folks, we've been on this exact
emotional rollercoaster before.

205
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:38,532
Well, sort of.
Last time, it was Roy G. Bivolo.

206
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,328
But our new meta
makes people happy, not angry.

207
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,791
Enter Rainbow Raider 2.0, which means
we already know how to stop her.

208
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:51,545
Using that prismatic light grid I built
to reverse Bivolo's whammy effects,

209
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,506
we can use it to neutralize
her meta abilities.

210
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,301
Just remember, don't make eye contact.

211
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,264
Hey, how many gadgets do you think
we've built over the years?

212
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,806
Huh?

213
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:08,896
Really, when you do the math... that's
a lot of bad guys we've taken down.

214
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,316
You know, when you leave,
you should take all the plans with you.

215
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,985
I'm sure everything you've built
must mean a lot to you.

216
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,740
Yeah, it does.

217
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,942
Satellites got a hit
on the van from the robbery.

218
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,792
Let's do this one last time.

219
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,927
All right. Crime spree's over, Miss.
Step away from the case.

220
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:41,636
You think I'm a crook?

221
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,137
Uh...

222
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,101
Flash, you've got it all wrong.

223
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,687
Nice leotard, by the way.

224
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,354
Thank you.

225
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,857
Mm. Who's the sidekick?

226
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,278
I'm Mecha-Vibe. And you're toast.

227
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,913
Wanna see a real light show, now?

228
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,799
It's not exactly
Circuit de la Sarthe,

229
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,485
but let's see how fast...

230
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,886
...this baby can go.

231
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,516
Uh...

232
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,643
- Flash?
- Yeah, I'm on it.

233
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,187
Where'd she go?

234
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,987
Where'd she go? She had
a million dollars' worth of jewelry.

235
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,280
Mecha-Vibe?

236
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,992
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

237
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,205
Dude, I'm so happy
to have you in my life.

238
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,710
Okay, this is happening.
On a very public street.

239
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,047
Man, don't be embarrassed.
Embrace it.

240
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,380
Yeah.

241
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,385
- We should probably stop.
- You know I love you, right?

242
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,102
<i>I got my dream job</i>

243
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,898
<i>Gonna go to A.R.G.U.S.
And do some science</i>

244
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,816
<i>Sciency science</i>

245
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,027
At least he's not raging out
and trying to kill us.

246
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,588
Why didn't the prism grid work?

247
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,448
My working theory is that Roy
used one color of the spectrum,

248
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,784
red, to induce anger in his victims.

249
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,327
<i>So many lenses!</i>

250
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,788
But our 2.0 version
uses the whole rainbow.

251
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,332
Since that makes her power
seven times stronger than Roy's,

252
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,476
when Cisco tried using the grid...

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,251
<i>And Miami Vice...</i>

254
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,464
She overloaded it
with vibrational energy

255
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,146
from the entire
electromagnetic spectrum.

256
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,926
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

257
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,595
Ouch.

258
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,349
Speaking of overloaded,
he's gonna be like that till tomorrow.

259
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,186
I'll have the satellites keep searching
for Rainbow Raider 2.0.

260
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,664
Once we get a hit, I'll meta-cuff her
and give her a one-way transport

261
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,688
to Iron Heights.

262
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,274
Okay, great. But what about him?

263
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:04,613
Hey. I'm doing just fine.
Thanks for asking.

264
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,575
We're going to need a babysitter.

265
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,790
All those applicants... I really thought
we'd meet someone you'd like.

266
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,458
Yeah, me too.

267
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,545
I will try again next week.

268
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,506
What was wrong with Kenji again?

269
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,592
She's super talented
and she seemed really nice.

270
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,178
Kamilla, you know better than anyone,

271
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,764
that we don't just cover
local politics and football scores.

272
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,435
We need someone
who can handle everything.

273
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,811
And I get that.

274
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,731
But even I couldn't handle
everything on day one.

275
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:44,445
So, maybe expecting everything
from the get-go is asking a bit much.

276
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:51,201
Okay, I will keep her in mind.
I just want to find the right person.

277
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:55,747
Totally. But she's not the only
good applicant you passed on today.

278
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,666
I said I would keep her in mind.

279
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,590
I'm sorry. That was harsh.

280
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,634
Uh, no, it's fine.

281
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,721
You don't have to explain.
I've got to go.

282
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,109
So I was thinking,
maybe waffles?

283
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,445
You know I love waffles!

284
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:30,699
Oh, yeah, you love those...
What are these doing down here, man?

285
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:35,913
Dude, you know I'm Mecha-Vibe.
You know I had to upgrade the specs,

286
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,707
but it's only 'cause
the convex filtration coating on these

287
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,792
wore off over time.

288
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,212
These poor little buggers,
I'll miss them.

289
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,005
Poor guys.

290
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,718
What else you got going on down
here, man? There's just so much stuff.

291
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:55,182
All that waffle talk made me hungry.
I gotta eat. BRB.

292
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,519
No.

293
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,522
Chester P. Runkonkoma...

294
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:05,400
You don't want me to leave
the Starchives?

295
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,987
Okay, fine.
Look, they made me do it because...

296
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,200
I know why you're trying
to keep me down here.

297
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:22,709
It's because they want to throw me
a surprise going away party.

298
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,503
I...

299
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,088
And to think...

300
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,007
I thought they didn't care.

301
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,430
- Spin move!
- No! Cisco, wait!

302
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,224
Come on, Ches!

303
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,059
Oh, man.

304
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,312
Satellites picked up our perp's van
parked right outside Ferris Airfield.

305
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,983
It's registered to a former
collections officer named Carrie Bates.

306
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,904
There aren't any banks or jewelry stores
out there. What's she up to?

307
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,156
Surprise!

308
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,282
<i>Cisco?</i>

309
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,617
Yeah, sans Chester.

310
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,453
Where are all the balloons at?
Am I early?

311
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,081
I'm early, aren't I?

312
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,251
No sweat, Boba Fett.
It's all hakuna matata.

313
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,129
I know exactly how
to get this party started.

314
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,133
Okay. Get ready. Get ready.
I'm almost there.

315
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,509
No, you get ready...

316
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,594
to laugh!

317
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:23,478
So cute, but also so funny!

318
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,314
Turn it off, turn it off!

319
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
What did you do?

320
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,861
I just turned Flash's happy dial
up to 11 with a little suit upgrade.

321
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,028
Cisco, he can't see.

322
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,364
- Yeah, he can.
- No, I can't. I can't see.

323
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,659
Oops. My bad!

324
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,350
Barry, are you all right?

325
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,626
Cisco, shut it off!

326
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,545
Shut it off!

327
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,922
Okay, Bartholomew.

328
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,006
You all right?

329
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,426
I'm fine.

330
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,011
Chipera...

331
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:57,929
Looking for me, Red?

332
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,728
You heroes. Always on a mission.

333
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,484
Well, I'm on a mission, too,
and you don't want to stop me.

334
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,818
No.

335
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:16,573
So, be a happy boy and
enjoy some me-time somewhere else.

336
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,740
Okay.

337
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,337
You okay?

338
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,880
Did you stop the bad lady?

339
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,717
Nope, I didn't want to.

340
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,650
Go, Flash! Go, Flash!
Go, Flash! Go, Flash!

341
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,194
Okay, Barry, why don't we
take a break from the dancing?

342
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,363
Yo, she said "breakdancing!"

343
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,997
You saw how he slid in like that?
Okay. Okay.

344
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,003
Yeah, Flash-dance! He's a maniac.

345
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,881
Yeah! Oh, he's a beast.

346
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,591
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,552
Since when do you know
how to breakdance?

348
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,472
Since I sped-watched
17 breakdancing videos online.

349
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,559
What up, party people?

350
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,686
My dude.

351
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,708
- I'm sending you that.
- Sending me that.

352
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,066
Chester.

353
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,693
Chester!

354
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,364
Oh, right. Yeah, my bad.
Hey, guys, guys.

355
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,742
Say "cheese!"

356
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,702
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

357
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,665
How do you guys feel?

358
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,585
Exhausted.

359
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,253
And a lot less happy.

360
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,773
Chester, how did you cure them?

361
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,967
Okay. So, I figured if we focus
Carrie's full spectrum light particles

362
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,845
through a vibrational filter,
the resulting fractal energy

363
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,972
would counteract the whammy effect.

364
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,225
You know, it's kind of like Vibe
saved the day one last time.

365
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,021
Carrie put a Ferris Air logo on her van.

366
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,731
That must be where she's going next.

367
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,107
I think I know why.

368
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,275
Why?

369
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,321
You see that airship?

370
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,907
It's a stealth dirigible
with a bleeding edge,

371
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,201
auto navigation and a two-ton payload.

372
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,203
And guess where it just got stolen from?

373
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,370
Ferris Airfield.

374
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,914
Why would she steal a blimp?

375
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,875
Maybe it's okay. It's not like
she stole the Death Star, right?

376
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,919
No, but it can cloak itself,

377
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,005
making it untraceable by satellites,
including ours.

378
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,509
Cisco, you're going to be
like a boss at A.R.G.U.S.

379
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:44,179
so, maybe they've got something
that we don't that could help us out.

380
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,017
Yeah.

381
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,269
Yeah. You know what?

382
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,564
Why don't I just show up
to work a day early,

383
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:56,691
report for duty and ask them in person?

384
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,276
Why don't I just do that?

385
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,238
I was just...

386
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,200
I need a minute.

387
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,747
Listen, I don't know what's got
you two so ready to get rid of me.

388
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,836
Maybe we should just say goodbye now,
and get it over with.

389
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,173
Cisco, we really messed up.

390
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,260
Big time.

391
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:07,512
You don't...

392
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,098
want to get rid of me?

393
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,809
No, we don't want to get rid of you.

394
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,769
I mean, we're barely
holding it together.

395
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:18,857
This whole time, I thought you guys
just didn't care that I was leaving.

396
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,651
We're so sorry
we made you feel that way,

397
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:26,531
but when you told us,
we both decided to put on a brave face

398
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,076
so we could tackle
one last case together...

399
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,954
so, you could move on...

400
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,123
and your last day
wouldn't be a tear fest.

401
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,791
Caitlin, have you met us?

402
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,675
We're going to miss you so much.

403
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,474
I'm gonna miss you, too.

404
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:57,646
Honestly, man, I was scared if
we started talking about you leaving...

405
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,273
I would ask you to stay.

406
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,611
And maybe, you actually would.

407
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,197
I couldn't do that to my best friend.

408
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,159
From the second I woke up,

409
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,620
after being hit by lightning,
you've been there.

410
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,540
You were there
every step of this journey.

411
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,961
There wouldn't be a Flash
without Cisco Ramon.

412
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,471
I did build
some pretty rad suits.

413
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,057
You did.

414
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,731
Do you remember when Psych
made us see our worst fears?

415
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,488
Mine was seeing myself
30 years from now.

416
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,783
I was still here...

417
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,412
with the next gen of heroes.

418
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,165
I still had my long hair.

419
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,170
But it was gray.

420
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,718
And everyone else was changing...

421
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,512
and growing.

422
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,141
But not me.

423
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,231
And that scares the hell out of me.

424
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,653
Cisco.

425
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,575
You are a born leader.

426
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:39,164
You're probably gonna be
running A.R.G.U.S. in no time.

427
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:40,790
I know.

428
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,170
I am a man on a mission.

429
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:55,305
What do you say, we figure out why
our thief took that blimp for a joyride,

430
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,683
so, we can wrap up this case
and celebrate?

431
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,938
I think I actually know
what Carrie's plan is.

432
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,526
Barry, you were right.

433
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,796
Carrie's been fired from
six different collection agencies

434
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,988
in the last three months.

435
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,199
- What for?
- Says here,

436
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,409
whenever somebody
had a huge medical debt,

437
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,762
she'd cancel it, instead of collecting.

438
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,329
That makes sense.

439
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,539
Carrie told me
she was on a mission, too.

440
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,541
She didn't steal cash
and diamonds for herself.

441
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,086
She's giving it away
like a Rainbow Robin Hood.

442
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,921
Then what's the blimp for?

443
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,057
<i>She's going to make it rain.</i>

444
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,893
<i>All that money and jewels,
it's gonna be chaos.</i>

445
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:49,984
As they say,
"It's better to give, than to receive."

446
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:59,869
<i>The Gotham Goliaths
are feeling small in Central City,</i>

447
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,748
<i>where the Sharks are leading
by 21 points in the fourth quarter.</i>

448
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,291
As if things weren't bad enough,

449
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,420
20,000 screaming football fans are about
to exit Sharks Stadium all at once.

450
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,464
Drunken sports fans
tearing each other apart,

451
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,675
fighting over diamonds and cash
falling from the sky.

452
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,969
We have to find a way
to stop her before it starts.

453
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,929
What about Chester's new toys?

454
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:21,224
To counter Carrie's rainbow blast,
we need a much more powerful light wave.

455
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,892
One the size of Texas.

456
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,563
Good thing we have one.

457
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,444
That's pretty high.

458
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,947
You sure you can't just fathwoom
us up there?

459
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,366
The ship's hull contains
two tons of compressed hydrogen.

460
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,368
One spark of lightning
could make it explode.

461
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,956
You can do this. You've done it before.

462
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,084
Okay. Hang on to your buns.

463
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,423
Flash?

464
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,390
Come on, Red, give me a break.

465
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,809
I'm just trying
to help ordinary people get ahead.

466
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,521
Go, go.

467
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,024
There's a better way to help people.

468
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,444
Is there? Because folks
are really hurting right now.

469
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,406
Some people can barely put food
on the table, let alone pay rent.

470
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,409
You know why?
Because the system's left them behind.

471
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,289
Those people need help. Real help.

472
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,750
The kind that starts after you're gone.

473
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,880
That's where I step in,
because I care what happens, Flash.

474
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,089
Do you?

475
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:38,009
Yes, I do.

476
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,137
That's why, instead of sending you
to Iron Heights,

477
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,848
I'm going to recommend you work off
whatever sentence you receive

478
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,142
with Mayor Sampson's
economic development committee.

479
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,270
You're right, Carrie.
The city does need you.

480
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:50,980
From what I've just heard,

481
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,358
I'm confident you're the right woman
for the job.

482
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,486
You'd do that for me?

483
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,156
My hero.

484
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,454
The auto-navigation control's
been damaged.

485
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,998
Looks like that energy tango
fried the system.

486
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,919
Folks, we got less than two minutes
to impact.

487
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,261
Flash, please tell me you can get us
off this balloon before it explodes

488
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,405
because if I use a tele sphere
with us moving this fast...

489
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,266
We might all end up pancaked
in the nearest sidewalk.

490
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:30,311
I can try and phase us out of here
without sparking an explosion.

491
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,105
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

492
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,608
Damn it! This thing
is stuck on autopilot.

493
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,030
Guys, 90 seconds.

494
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,744
Get them to safety.

495
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,871
And then evacuate the area.
If this thing crashes,

496
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,791
the hydrogen is going to flash-fry
everything within a two-mile radius.

497
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,714
- No...
- Look, Barry, there's not enough time.

498
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:54,833
I'm not gonna let you die.

499
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,964
I'm not planning on it! Go!

500
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,095
I got this.

501
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,184
Let's go.

502
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:17,608
<i>Flash, there's
20,000 people in there and the game...</i>

503
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,027
Will be over any minute, I know.

504
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:29,329
Chester, what do I need to bypass
a six dorsal propulsion unit?

505
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,040
Uh, I don't know.
What do you have up there?

506
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,300
I have me.

507
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,735
Come on.

508
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,911
You can do it!

509
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,455
Come on.

510
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,587
Come on, come on, come on.

511
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,381
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

512
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,841
Come on!

513
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,426
You can do it!

514
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:27,970
Come on, come on.

515
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,680
Come on!

516
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,184
Come on!

517
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,771
Yeah!

518
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,775
Yeah!

519
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,164
Dude, there is no word to describe
how awesome you are right now.

520
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,291
Actually, there is.

521
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,128
"He's da bomb."

522
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,673
Hell yeah, I am.

523
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:23,025
Okay, folks, our hijacked airship
is safely back at Ferris Air.

524
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,986
Where in the hell...

525
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,238
Just go on.

526
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,366
Man, this is supposed
to be my last debrief.

527
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,910
It's cool. It's cool. Just keep going.

528
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,789
Just think of it as Team Chesco,
one last time?

529
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,042
Huh?

530
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:47,175
Well, looks like
the DA is officially on board...

531
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,218
- Mm-hmm
- ...with Carrie working off

532
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,679
the rest of her sentence
at the mayor's office.

533
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,014
Yeah.

534
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:57,310
Also, the Sharks beat the Goliaths,
28-to-nothing.

535
00:32:58,436 --> 00:32:59,604
Go, Sharks.

536
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:05,735
As a bonus, CCPN is reporting
a wave of donations across the city

537
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:10,031
inspired by Carrie's
"unique brand of charity."

538
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,241
There is going to be a surprise party,
isn't there?

539
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,993
- Yes!
- Yeah!

540
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,829
Actually, there's going to be two.
And they're a little last minute.

541
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,749
But Team Citizen is going to party
with Kamilla at their office,

542
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,167
which means...

543
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,127
That the rest of the team...

544
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,213
Is going to kick it at the loft.

545
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,797
At the loft.

546
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:30,885
The only missing piece
is the guest of honor, sir.

547
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,220
You.

548
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,222
So, you ready to do this thang?

549
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,516
Not yet.

550
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:46,150
This has all of my conceptual designs
for S.T.A.R. Labs.

551
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,903
Software fixes,
fortifications with the Time Vault,

552
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,446
Babel upgrades...

553
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,035
You're the man now, dawg.

554
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,248
Thanks, Cisco.

555
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,460
This is...

556
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,712
Wow.

557
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:10,132
I know I'm leaving this place
in great hands.

558
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,888
You want to drop that off
in your new workshop,

559
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,431
so we can skedaddle?

560
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:18,724
Whoa!

561
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,476
New workshop?

562
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,520
Seriously?

563
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:23,771
Yes.

564
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:28,734
Okay.

565
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,739
Oh. I know that look.

566
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,075
You're going to bail on me,

567
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,618
so you can spend all night

568
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,638
organizing your new stuff
in that space, aren't you?

569
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,662
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

570
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,749
But I promise I'll be there
tomorrow morning

571
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,792
at the epic good bye
breakfast at Jitters.

572
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,419
I know you will.

573
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,296
Thanks for showing me the ropes, man.

574
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,550
Keep 'em safe for me, will you?

575
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,802
Roger that.

576
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,500
<i>What are you doing?</i>

577
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,295
- He likes this song.
- How could you possibly know that?

578
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,921
I checked his Facebook page.

579
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,608
It's like everyone else
is standing still.

580
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,883
<i>The party's here.</i>

581
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,385
Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo!

582
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,013
<i>I'll always remember this.
Dr. Wells and I...</i>

583
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,306
- Doppel...
- Ganger.

584
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,391
He'd have to be a Weather Wizard.

585
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,477
Captain Cold. The Mist.

586
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,270
The Turtle. Samuroid.

587
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:47,480
<i>Now, go.</i>

588
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,942
<i>Serve your higher purpose.</i>

589
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,694
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

590
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,196
How did you know what I like?

591
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:56,989
<i>I had a feeling.</i>

592
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,452
Cisco, you're a hero, man.

593
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,579
How do you feel?

594
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,290
It's the end of an era.

595
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,691
Yeah.

596
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,195
I'm gonna miss you, too.

597
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:08,043
I'm gonna miss all this.

598
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,147
Even this drafty old building?

599
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,357
Mm...

600
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,359
Kamilla, you know, about earlier,

601
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:19,447
I wasn't thinking and I was out of line.

602
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,199
It's okay. I totally get it.

603
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:26,203
I think it was just hard for me

604
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:29,832
because I'm not just saying goodbye
to a valuable team member,

605
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,293
I'm saying goodbye to a friend...

606
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:34,962
and I'm gonna miss you.

607
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,923
So, don't be a stranger.

608
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,884
You got it.

609
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:44,388
And, Iris, for the record,
from the moment I first met Cisco,

610
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,265
I knew things would be great.

611
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:51,061
But I had that same feeling coming here
and getting to know you and Allegra.

612
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,274
So, to Team Citizen.

613
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:56,877
Team Citizen.

614
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,569
Looks like I'm just in time.

615
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,252
- Now, it's a party.
- These are for you.

616
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,114
Thank you.

617
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:05,242
Hey, what's up with you being
at the crime scene this morning?

618
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:06,785
Hmm?

619
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:13,959
Oh, uh, I was meeting up
with an old contact.

620
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:17,755
There's something I've been
trying to dig up for a case,

621
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,299
and I am finally getting close.

622
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:24,762
Oh, hey, what do you say,
group selfie, ladies?

623
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,138
- Yes.
- Ready?

624
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,766
One, two, three, cheese!

625
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,355
I'm going to miss
speedster delivery so much.

626
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,232
Like, what am I supposed to do

627
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,400
the next time I get a craving
for Lou Malnati's?

628
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,277
Order online like everyone else?

629
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,279
Like a normie? No, thanks.

630
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,532
I guess you're just gonna
have to come back and visit.

631
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,741
I guess so.

632
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,660
So, you're buying a place in Star City?

633
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,036
That is the plan.

634
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,371
It's a big step.

635
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,664
But I'm proud of you.

636
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,957
Kamilla, too.

637
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:57,378
And it goes without saying,
you always have a place to stay here.

638
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,171
Thanks, Joe.

639
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,715
Hey, it's me
that should be thanking you.

640
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:05,219
All these years,
you've always had Barry's back.

641
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:09,139
You are a good man, Cisco Ramon.

642
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,431
Mm.

643
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,309
We're gonna miss the hell out of you.

644
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,272
Speaking of, I have something
that should help with that.

645
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,986
Whoa!

646
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,739
As a token of how special
you all are to me.

647
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,954
You wore this
on your first day at S.T.A.R. Labs.

648
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,163
What can I say?

649
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,876
From the beginning,
you made me feel right at home.

650
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,297
All right, it's your night.

651
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,923
What you want to do next?

652
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,595
Mm-hmm.

653
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,726
Oh, my gosh.

654
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,061
This song?

655
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,898
You know, I didn't even put this
as my favorite song on my Facebook.

656
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,334
- I don't know who did that.
- You already know what time it is.

657
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,318
Don't make me sing.

658
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,277
You know
we're gonna compete, right?

659
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,362
This is my jam, though.

660
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,071
- This is my jam.
- This is my jam.

661
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,995
Oh, my God.

662
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:17,166
<i>I wanna hold 'em
Like they do in Texas, please</i>

663
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,334
Okay.

664
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,335
<i>Fold' em, let 'em hit me</i>

665
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,630
<i>Raise it, baby, stay with me</i>

666
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:25,466
<i>Love game intuition
Play the cards with spades to start</i>

667
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:26,675
<i>And after he's been</i>

668
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,345
<i>Hooked, I'll play the one
That's on his heart</i>

669
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:34,099
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

670
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:37,394
<i>I'll get him hot, show him what I've got</i>

671
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,478
That's scary.

672
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,232
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

673
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:45,611
<i>I'll get him hot, show him what I got</i>

674
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,207
<i>Can't read my, can't read my</i>

675
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,281
- Take it.
- Dance break.

676
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:50,281
Do it!

677
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,992
<i>...poker face</i>

678
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,161
<i>She's got me like nobody</i>

679
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:58,082
<i>Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't my</i>

680
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,542
<i>- Poker face
- Poker face</i>

681
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,294
It's my favorite part.

682
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:06,090
<i>P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face</i>

683
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,597
Babe?

684
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,433
<i>Cecile.</i>

685
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,103
<i>Cecile.</i>

686
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,614
<i>Cecile.</i>

687
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,204
<i>Cecile.</i>

688
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,471
I will find you.
