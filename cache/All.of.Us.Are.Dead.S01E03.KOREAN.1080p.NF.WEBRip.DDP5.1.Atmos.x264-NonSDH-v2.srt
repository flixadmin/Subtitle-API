1
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,475
A virus, huh?

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,024
So you're telling me,

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,610
that this whole mess started with a virus
made by a high school science teacher?

4
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,950
This virus.

5
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,703
Tell me why?
Why would you do something like this?

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,496
Detective.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,418
Do you have any kids?

8
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,428
Yes, sweetheart.

9
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,142
Yun-a.

10
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,311
Oh, no. Be careful.

11
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,606
You should watch where you're going.

12
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>Could you let your child die?</i>

13
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,658
No parent on Earth could do that.

14
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,244
I don't wanna hear that bullshit.
Just answer the question.

15
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,288
What is the virus and how--

16
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,207
Jae-ik. Code red.

17
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,793
Chief needs everyone right now.
Come on, hurry.

18
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,670
It's too late.

19
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,757
We're all dead.

20
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,468
There's no hope for survival.

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,161
Oh, shit.

22
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,697
Cheong-san!

23
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,365
Look down. Down, down, down.

24
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,659
I know.

25
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,995
She's got your foot, moron. Look!

26
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,581
-I see that.
-Kick her off or something, idiot.

27
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,957
I'm trying.

28
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,046
What the hell is it taking you so long?

29
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,595
Hey!

30
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,390
Hey. I'm coming down.

31
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,268
No, stay there.

32
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,270
No. I said, don't do it.

33
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,481
-I'm coming.
-Don't!

34
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,109
-Stay there.
-Oh, shit.

35
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:00,990
Hold on.

36
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,285
Hey, Bare-su, look up.

37
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,264
My back.

38
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,808
Just stay still. I'm helping.

39
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
What are you doing?

40
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,814
Hold on, moron.

41
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,823
-Guys, look, Bare-su. Bare-su!
-Cheong-san!

42
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,371
Hang on, Bare-su!

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,872
Are you okay?

44
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,584
Shit. Why can't you just kick her…

45
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,503
…like I said?

46
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,256
Hey. Stop hugging me.

47
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,050
I'm not hugging you.

48
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,221
Fuck off.

49
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,515
You like it?

50
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,021
-Are you okay?
-Close it.

51
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,148
Close it before they get in!

52
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,609
Would you just close it already?

53
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,486
What's wrong with you?
Cheong-san still out there.

54
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,988
You want us just to shut him out?

55
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,282
Is it a crime to want the window close?

56
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,867
How can you be so selfish?

57
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,369
I can't stand you, stupid welfie.

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,003
-What did you just call me?
-Hey, come on.

59
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,212
What's happening?

60
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,131
-You just hit me?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,758
Call me that again.

62
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,968
Hey, knock it off.
What's going on over here, guys?

63
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,345
He just hit me.

64
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,138
Only 'cause you called me a welfie.

65
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,016
-Is it not true?
-You just can't say shit like that.

66
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,768
What's a welfie?

67
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,519
Tell me.

68
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,229
What is it?

69
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,275
What's a welfie?

70
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,863
A person on welfare.

71
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,533
-What?
-It means, a person on welfare.

72
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,952
"Welfie" for short.

73
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,627
Na-yeon, that was wrong.
Don't ever say that again.

74
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,795
And Gyeong-su.

75
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,755
When you hit people,
you're the one who ends up losing.

76
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,341
-Do you understand?
-No, I don't.

77
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,260
Listen, we can't be fighting
each other in a moment like this.

78
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,970
We don't know what's going on
out there with those--

79
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,138
Are they zombies?

80
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,432
What about the other teachers?

81
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,101
Has anyone called the cops?

82
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,311
Don't worry, I'm sure someone already has.

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,021
I just don't have
my phone on me, right now.

84
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,940
We called them, but they're not coming.

85
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,609
Neither the police nor first responders.

86
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,404
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
We just have to wait a little longer.

87
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,156
Ms. Park. Hyeon-ju's hands were cold too.

88
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,075
So were I-sak's.

89
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,036
What if all of this started with Hyeon-ju?

90
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,788
She went to the hospital.

91
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,416
What if it spread in there as well?

92
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,501
Maybe that's why no one's coming.

93
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,629
But wait. They still work, right?

94
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,381
Uh, internet. The internet.

95
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,675
-Let's see. Sorry, Ms. Park.
-Oh.

96
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,427
-Here. Sit.
-Thanks.

97
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,179
It should work. Is it on?

98
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,347
I think so.

99
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,599
What's the problem?
Why is it not turning on?

100
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,101
-It just did.
-Oh, sorry.

101
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,603
School ones are so slow.

102
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,774
Maybe it's not online?

103
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,234
It must be.

104
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,777
It's gonna take all day.

105
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,154
Is it still loading?

106
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,156
-Su-hyeok, did you see it?
-I don't think it's working.

107
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,198
What?

108
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,408
In the science lab.

109
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,163
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE
BROADCASTING ROOM - NAM-RA

110
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,373
Well, I was actually in the art room.

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,084
What's in the science lab?

112
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,628
Uh, well…

113
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,297
It worked.

114
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,550
-Okay. Open the browser.
-The browser.

115
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,720
Look up "zombie virus."

116
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,222
-Yeah, "zombie virus."
-But…

117
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,725
-No. Try "Hyosan."
-See what's trending.

118
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,059
No.

119
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,978
-I'm checking the news first.
-Look up the emergence alerts.

120
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,313
-The news.
-There'll be no articles yet.

121
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,398
-Yeah, go to the news.
-What are we looking up?

122
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,944
See you later.

123
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,213
-Are you okay? Let me help you.
-Come on.

124
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,631
Stand up. Can you stand?

125
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,843
-Call an ambulance.
-Let's get out of the way first.

126
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,261
-See that?
-What's going on?

127
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,019
Sir, are you all right? Do you need help?

128
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,660
Oh, shit.

129
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:06,963
No. No, please!

130
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,653
I'll try Facebook.

131
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,449
Or Instagram.

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,909
Do you have followers?

133
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,160
Let's do Facebook.

134
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,996
Hmm…

135
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,792
Okay.

136
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,044
How many friends do you have?

137
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,130
Look at your notifications.1,700?

138
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,716
Strange.

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,927
Okay, let's check messages first.

140
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,433
-What the hell?
-Oh, shit.

141
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,645
What was that?

142
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,855
Get over here. Come here.

143
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,608
Did someone not make it in?

144
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,152
No. No one.

145
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,947
Wait. Don't go too close!

146
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,032
Cheong-san.

147
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,950
Be careful.

148
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,625
Do you see anything?

149
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,049
It's just the wind.

150
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,842
That scared me.

151
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,183
Look, it's coming in!
Watch out, watch out!

152
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,062
Cheong-san, get back. Get back here.

153
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,564
Look out, look out!

154
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,150
Cheong-san!

155
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,778
-Cheong-san!
-Get back here!

156
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,071
Wait. w-w-wait, wait!

157
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,283
-Push it! Push it off.
-Did you get it?

158
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,409
Push it!

159
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,577
Push it off.

160
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,872
Push it off!

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,208
Push it! Come on.

162
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,001
Go! Harder!

163
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,172
-Watch out!
-Remove her hand!

164
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,217
Shit!

165
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,344
Stay back!

166
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,859
Don't go near it!

167
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,654
-Should I go?
-Stay back.

168
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,489
No. Hold on.

169
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,865
Go, Dae-su.

170
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,036
Give me.

171
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,180
Shit. We're completely fucked.

172
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,391
Just push it!

173
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,851
Push it! Push it off!

174
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,186
Push it away already!

175
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,481
-It's coming in.
-Su-hyeok! Watch out for your hand!

176
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,234
Su-hyeok! Fuck it!

177
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,699
Is it gone?

178
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,543
That was crazy.

179
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,795
I'm so dead.

180
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,132
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

181
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,594
Where did it come from?

182
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,265
-Hey, you good?
-That was scary. I'm good.

183
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,687
Hey.

184
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,689
You…

185
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,779
RESCUE

186
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,740
HYOSAN CITY COUNCIL

187
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,412
You have to understand
he's the youngest aide we have.

188
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,624
When he got back from the Council building
he just collapsed and started convulsing.

189
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,628
Captain. He smells like a rotting corpse.

190
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,505
And then he got back up, and went like…

191
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,674
…and just attacked Assemblywoman
out of nowhere.

192
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,301
So we tied him up to that chair.

193
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,887
But we didn't know
if we should call the police. You know?

194
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,055
Why are you telling them that?

195
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,307
He'll bite his tongue.

196
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,768
-We have to gag him.
-Copy.

197
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,524
-Ready?
-Yes.

198
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,443
One, two, three.

199
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
-Did it get you?
-It's okay. A little.

200
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
Wrap him up!

201
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,202
Now.

202
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,167
<i>Message from headquarters. Come in.</i>

203
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,588
Rescue Team One.

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,465
<i>Level-three disaster in Hyosan.</i>

205
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,260
<i>Report to temporary headquarters.</i>

206
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,178
Did you say level-three disaster?

207
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,721
<i>I repeat.</i>

208
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,349
<i>Level-three disaster in Hyosan.</i>

209
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,351
<i>Report to temporary headquarters.</i>

210
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,769
What is it?

211
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,479
-<i>This is the director's order.</i>
-Where are they sending you?

212
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,731
-<i>Mobilize immediately. That is all.</i>
-Uh…

213
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,608
The fire department headquarters

214
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,986
was moved out of the city
for an emergency.

215
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,573
The Disaster and Safety Control
will manage the situation.

216
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
Is evacuation really necessary?

217
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,744
All right. All right, all right. Hang on.

218
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,124
Okay, so they think
it's an acute infection.

219
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,419
They're saying there will be
an evacuation order for Hyosan soon.

220
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,798
Gyeong-su, you're bleeding.

221
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,758
I am?

222
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,013
Right, it's because

223
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,931
Su-hyeok hit me with a fucking mop.

224
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,392
Stay back. Stay where you are.

225
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,269
You were bitten, weren't you, Gyeong-su?

226
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,729
I wasn't. I wasn't.

227
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,022
Didn't you see Su-hyeok hit me?

228
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,943
What is your fucking problem with me?

229
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,403
You were bitten!

230
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,991
I-sak got a nosebleed
just before she turned.

231
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,826
On-jo. You saw it, right?

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,162
That's the same thing
that happened to I-sak.

233
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,455
Gyeong-su.

234
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,665
I-I'm telling you! I swear I wasn't bit!

235
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,712
Shit.

236
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,172
Look.

237
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,674
Your hand. Explain that?

238
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,092
What is it?

239
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,096
I got it from the computer.
Didn't you see that?

240
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,809
Don't you trust me?

241
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,022
I can't believe this.
I got this trying to save all of you.

242
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,739
It's not a bite. It's a scratch.

243
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,116
Whoever wants to check, come look.

244
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,453
It's a scratch?

245
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,873
Yeah, definitely. Just a scratch.

246
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,042
-Ms. Park, look.
-Mm.

247
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,546
Well, it really doesn't look like a bite.
Thank god. It's a scratch.

248
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,131
He's okay.

249
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,762
Done yet?

250
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,515
I said, are you done with me now?

251
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,228
Wait. This means the computer's gone.

252
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,437
No internet…

253
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,857
Couldn't you have thrown something else
instead of the computer?

254
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,901
What was I supposed to do?
It's trying to get in.

255
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,822
No, you did good. Thank you. Don't be mad.

256
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,116
Hey, Na-yeon.

257
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,618
Look. Say sorry. End this.

258
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,453
Why should I?

259
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,414
He did it to save us all.

260
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,082
Why can't you just say that you're sorry?

261
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,667
Because I'm not sorry.

262
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,044
I saw everything.

263
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,337
I saw the creature grabbed you.

264
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,050
<i>I'm right.</i>

265
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,885
He could be infected.

266
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,429
Na-yeon, enough.

267
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,597
It really did.
That thing grabbed his hand.

268
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,684
Wait, can touching his hand infect him?

269
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,227
I have no idea but maybe.

270
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,354
I held I-sak's hand when she fell.

271
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,189
Why is nothing happening to me?

272
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,066
Because he has a cut on his hand.

273
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,652
And since there's an open wound,
it's probably gonna be different.

274
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,029
-That's fucking--
-Don't.

275
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,740
Stop blaming me.
Why don't you just think for yourselves?

276
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,284
Na-yeon.

277
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,537
I know you always hated Gyeong-su,

278
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,664
but I think you're really crossing
the line here.

279
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,374
This is about life and death.

280
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,792
She's always like this.

281
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,130
If it weren't for him,
we would definitely all be dead right now.

282
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,507
And now, he might be the one
killing all of us.

283
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,301
Now you're the one who's killing me.

284
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,802
-Just shut up, Na-yeon.
-Look at my hand, I'm totally fine.

285
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,721
-Don't you see that?
-Hey, that's enough, all of you! Okay?

286
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,638
We're ending this.

287
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,931
-Ms. Park--
-Enough.

288
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,974
-But she--
-No!

289
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,693
Let's do this.

290
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,739
Gyeong-su, you're going to wait
in the recording room for ten minutes.

291
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,032
I know it'll be hard,

292
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,284
but at least it's better
than people thinking you're infected.

293
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,537
No one else thinks that I'm infected.
It's only her.

294
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,415
Gyeong-su, would you please do it?

295
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,586
Fuck ten. I'll do half…

296
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
I'll just do a full hour.

297
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,050
There's really no point doing an hour
since it takes less than five minutes.

298
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,802
-Stop overreacting.
-It's just to be sure.

299
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,554
Is that enough?

300
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,475
And if nothing happens,
you'll apologize, right?

301
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,394
Yeah.

302
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,524
And everyone else
is okay with that, right?

303
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,817
Yes.

304
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,445
If we do this,
who's gonna step up next time?

305
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,863
We all be too scared.

306
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,491
You're right, but…

307
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,872
Let's consider this a way
to learn to trust each other.

308
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,211
I do… trust Gyeong-su.

309
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
See you in an hour.

310
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,095
Want me to come with you?

311
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,107
What a stubborn asshole.

312
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,276
He only needs to do ten.

313
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,652
He's not that stubborn.

314
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,445
Compared to her.

315
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,051
-Go get it.
-No. I won't.

316
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,136
You stupid little…

317
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,512
Stop. Please.

318
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,181
Go, asshole.

319
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,810
Move. Please don't.

320
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,882
Hey, kid. Down here. Come.

321
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,038
Fuck.

322
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,027
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

323
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,946
<i>Maybe they're drawn to smell.</i>

324
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,365
They do always go after you.

325
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,366
I don't smell.

326
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,868
You sweat a lot, Dae-su.

327
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,578
I sweat, but I don't smell.

328
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,206
What's that smell?

329
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,208
Your sweat.

330
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,963
I think they're more sensitive
to sound than smell.

331
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,840
-Sound?
-Yeah, sound.

332
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,925
This isn't a movie.

333
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,137
That's just how zombies are, you know?

334
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,930
And didn't you see their eyes?

335
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,932
They can't see with those eyes.

336
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,601
-Ms. Park.
-Hmm?

337
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,895
Sound, smell, I don't know.

338
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,897
Some kids probably left school, right?

339
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,941
It's sound.

340
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,319
Mm-hm. Yeah, I think so.

341
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,446
Here, Su-hyeok.

342
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,448
Give me the mirror.

343
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,867
Maybe we're the lucky ones then?

344
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,998
The fact that we're alive

345
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
makes us lucky.

346
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,129
Really?

347
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,465
Mm-hm.

348
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,300
Wipe your face.

349
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,541
Are you okay?

350
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,461
I keep thinking about I-sak.

351
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,380
You held on…

352
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,216
until the last possible second.

353
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,012
Stop. That doesn't help.

354
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,723
You didn't do anything wrong.

355
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,935
Stay strong.

356
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,105
Your dad or someone else…

357
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,233
will come save us.

358

00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,374
Oh, for heaven's sake.

361
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,586
Do you have to put
your son's face on the sign?

362
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,797
Is there something wrong
with using his face?

363
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,134
You'll end up becoming
an evil mother-in-law.

364
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,344
All protective of your precious son.

365
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,805
Nagged your daughter-in-law constantly.

366
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,310
Anyway, uh…

367
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,022
better go submit these forms.

<i>The series of incidents</i>
<i>occurring in Hyosan</i>

369
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,371
<i>appear to be due to a mass outbreak</i>

370
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,708
<i>We'll speak to the</i>

371

<i>can you tell us what's going on?</i>

372
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,880
<i>Considering the level of spread,</i>

373
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,716
<i>it appears to be</i>
<i>a highly infectious disease.</i>

374
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,760
<i>Those infected</i>
<i>became unusually aggressive.</i>

375
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,180
<i>Victims showed similar symptoms,</i>

376
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,057
<i>so we suspect secondary infection</i>
<i>is possible.</i>

377
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,102
<i>As you've heard, this is very dangerous.</i>

<i>As advised by the KDCA,</i>

<i>Breaking news. Just in.</i>

388
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,465
<i>The National Security Council has decided</i>

389
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,969

393
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,648
Okay.

394
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,444
Are you all right?

395
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,530
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

396

l should be back soon.

397
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,874
A virus?

398
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,751
What kind of virus?

399
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,547
<i>I don't think it's airborne,</i>
<i>but it hasn't been confirmed.</i>

400
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,967
It seems like you
get infected if you get bit,

401
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,469
<i>so don't get bit or make physical contact.</i>

402

408
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,868
Yeong-hwan, hey, are you okay?

409
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,080
Captain, what do I do?

410
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,791

Oh, shit.

415
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,514
Is he dead?

416

-Tie him up!

419

Oh, shit.

452
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,361
-Put me down.
-Okay.

453
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,196
Be careful. Careful.

454
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,697
Okay.

Well, first…

-You got a cigarette?
-No, I don't smoke.

-Don't mess with me.
-I don't.

465

Why are you being rude to upperclassman?

466
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,183
Wanna die?

467
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,811
What the hell do you want?

468
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,314
Hey. Who said you can talk like that
to an upperclassman?

469
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,865
-Sorry.
-No.

470
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,325

always such douchebags?

472

473
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,958
Watch yourself.

474
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,294
You're really going
to fight over these now, huh?

475

What are you, stupid?
Just get along already.

476
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,383
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,677
I said I was sorry, okay?

478
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,887
We got to go.

479
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,346
How can we leave?

480
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,099
If they see us,
they're gonna attack us all.

481
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,018
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

482
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,144
I'm not going.

483
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,147
-You?
-Leave me alone.

484
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,648
I do whatever I feel like.

485
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,776
Heartless bitch.

486
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,614
Here. Make weapons.

487
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,782
Come on.

488
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,368
Give me that.

489
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,106
Freak.

490
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,691
Han Gyeong-su.

491
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,444
I'll kill you.

492
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,585
What a fucking idiot.

493
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,921
What are you doing?

494
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,967
Thirty minutes.

495
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,803
What's that?

496
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,055
It's been 30 minutes. Come out.

497
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,279
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but he still doesn't want to come out.

498
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,907
I'll see what I can do.

499
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,577
What's wrong with him?

500
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,708
Looks okay to me.

501
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,668
He's fine. I knew it.

502
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,922
I don't understand
why he's being so stubborn?

503
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:28,923
He won't come out?

504
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,387
He's always like this.

505
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,763
He's too stubborn.

506
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:38,891
Huh?

507
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,271
So what did he say?

508
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,397
He won't come out?

509
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,233
He said he's staying the full hour.

510
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,735
He's pissed.

511
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,862
I'll go in.

512
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,946
Why would you go?

513
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,907
If anyone should, it's Na-yeon.

514
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,746
Why should I?

515
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,873
He's like this because of you.

516
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,083
-What did I do?
-Like you don't know?

517
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,877
Was it wrong to suspect him?

518
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,296
You did too. Everyone did.
It wasn't just me.

519
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,050
I always believe him.

520
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,092
Me too.

521
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,928
Well, I didn't. She's right.

522
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,222
But I didn't insult him like you did.

523
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,891
Why are you picking on me?

524
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,225
'Cause you deserve it.

525
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,727
That's enough, Ji-min.

526
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,030
You remember your promise, right?

527
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,783
After 30 minutes you'd apologize.

528
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,618
Okay.

529
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,457
It's been 30 minutes.

530
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,086
All right.

531
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,675
She's doing it. Holy shit.
She's really doing it.

532
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,597
Hey.

533
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,725
I'm talking to you.

534
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,689
You're ignoring me?

535
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,151
What do you want?

536
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,195
Oh, yo. They're talking.
That's good. Right?

537
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,822
Why don't you answer me?

538
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,157
Apologize and get out.

539
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,908
How's your cut doing?

540
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,618
Why do you care?

541
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,412
Show me.

542
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,625
Oh, shit. She's touching him.

543
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,712
Well, that's pretty bold of her.

544
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:24,515
I suspected you
because the situation called for it.

545
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,893
And I was really mad earlier.

546
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,105
I'm still mad at you.

547
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,649
I guess…

548
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,110
She's Gyeong-su type?

549
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,905
I have no idea.

550
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,950
You know I've always looked down on you.

551
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,498
It's fine. It's all in the past.
Let's just go.

552
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,833
I'm not apologizing.

553
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,211
You deserve to be looked down on.

554
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,756
Our complex banned you welfies,
but you force your way in.

555
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,966
And how dare you push me?

556
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,593
Listen, you fucking…

557
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,178
You thought I'd apologize?

558
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,430
Kiss, kiss.

559
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,141
This is so crazy.

560
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,101
Everyone is taking your side.

561
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,064
I was cornered
because of a nobody like you.

562
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,358
Stay the full hour.

563
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,694
I hope you never come out again.

564
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,531
Fucking welfie.

565
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,283
Oh, they're coming.
They're coming.

566
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,284
Hey!

567
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,912
How cute was that? So cute-- Whoa, whoa!

568
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,871
-Gyeong-su!
-Come here you piece of--

569
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,081
-Wait, wait, what?
-Gyeong-su, what's wrong?

570
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,167
You're fucking…
you're such a fucking cheat.

571
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,679
-I don't understand why I have to take it?
-Did you really say that?

572
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,764
You promised me you'd apologize to him.

573
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,891
-Dude, forget about her.
-I did nothing wrong.

574
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,893
You only think about yourself.

575
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,980
You said to close the door
before anyone could get in.

576
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,731
You said it would be safer for us.

577
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,941
That's not right.

578
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,320
We almost died
when Gyeong-su pulled Coach Kang in.

579
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,863
Why aren't you mad at him?

580
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,283
That was not his fault.

581
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,285
How is he supposed to know that
that was gonna happen?

582
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,288
-That's enough. Quiet, everyone.
-We'd be quiet if she were gone.

583
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,459
You're all so annoying.

584
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,129
What if I'm right about this?

585
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,841
Then will you finally admit
I saved you all, huh?

586
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,803
I don't understand.
How can you still be like this?

587
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,059
Look.

588
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,479
Guess I was right after all.

589
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,405
What?

590
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,580
Gyeong-su.

591
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,383
<i>Day 26 of infection.</i>

592
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,179
I told you didn't I?
You still think I'm wrong?

593
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,974
The strong cells are attacking
the hosts weak cells.

594
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,811
Every single cell
is struggling just to survive…

595
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,357
they're attacking each other.

596
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,027
<i>This virus in essence</i>
<i>is like the will to live.</i>

597
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,364
<i>It consumes all cells almost instantly.</i>

598
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,164
Hey, hey. What's wrong with me?
Something's wrong.

599
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,042
Oh, shit.

600
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,252
What's wrong?

601
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,297
It's not true.

602
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,218
Come on. Get rid of him.
Get rid of him now!

603
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,512
-I'm not--
-Gyeong-su. Stay where you are.

604
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,431
Stay back.

605
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,851
I swear fucking I'm not.

606
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,562
I'm sorry, Gyeong-su.

607
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,023
Please, stay back.

608
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,408
I've turned, right?

609
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,828
Cheong-san, what do I do?

610
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,002
No, no. This doesn't make any sense.

611
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,254
Why would you…

612
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,213
Cheong-san.

613
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,131
Let go.

614
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,801
This cannot be true.

615
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,928
Why would you suddenly…

616
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,390
<i>The infected human</i>
<i>feels extreme fear…</i>

617
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,479
and then they attack in order to survive.

618
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,984
No, no. Gyeong-su you weren't--

619
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,319
Stay away. Don't come any closer!

620
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,704
What are you doing?

621
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,663
We need to kick him out.

622
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,999
We're all gonna die!

623
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,500
What…

624
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,296
What's happening…

625
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,089
Fuck.

626
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,555
Get out. I said, get out!

627
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,265
Shut the fuck up!

628
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,725
I'll leave by myself.

629
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,061
I'll leave. I'll go on my own.

630
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,647
Why would I bite you?

631
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,859
We're supposed to be fucking friends.
We're friends.

632
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,322
If I-- If I leave,
it will be better for everyone.

633
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,995
Gyeong-su… why don't you just go back

634
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,705
into the recording room
until we can figure out--

635
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,956
If he stays in here
he's gonna kill us all.

636
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,957
Na-yeon!

637
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,584
I'm just trying to stay alive.

638
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,299
I'll leave.

639
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,399
I'll get out of here on my own.
Don't worry.

640
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,403
I'll get out of here.

641
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,491
Gyeong-su.

642
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,619
It's okay.

643
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,248
Thank you for everything.

644
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,334
Stay alive.

645
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,094
-<i>Are you all right, Gyeong-su?</i>
-Stay alive.

646
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,304
<i>What an idiot.</i>

647
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,934
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

648
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,646
Why are you doing that?
You're scaring me. Stop,

649
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,818
Stop it. Cheong-san,
why are you doing this?

650
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,070
Stop it! Please stop!

CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

652
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,616
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW BEGINNING

653
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,852
-Lift it.
-Okay.

654
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,812
Here.

655
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,564
One more.

656
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,616
Fire and Disasters Headquarters
said not to touch the infected.

657
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,412
As you can see, it's highly contagious--

658
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,331
We were notified too, no need to explain.

659
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,918
How long do we have to stay here?

660
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,879
They're sending over a helicopter,
but it's gonna take time.

661
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,048
So it looks like
you'll have to wait a bit longer.

662
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,052
Did you notify them
that I was here as well?

663
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,011
What?

664
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,890
I'm asking if it's taking time
to get a chopper

665
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,475
even though they know I'm here?

666
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,102
No, I did not tell them who was here.

667
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,771
You should've told them.

668
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,065
That way, they'll send one
right away to pick us up.

669
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,698
Per rules of rescue, the weak and ill
take priority over VIPs.

670
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,077
We'll hear back soon,
so please be patient like everyone else.

671
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,414
Shit.

672
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,919
ON-JO'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

673

<i>The person you have called</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

674
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,352
This is Captain Nam So-ju.

675
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,564
If anyone knows the status
of Hyosan High School,

676
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,441
please respond.

677
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:33,201
If anyone knows anything
about the area near Hyosan High School

678
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,161
please respond.

679
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,338
Please respond.

KOREA
RESCUE

681
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,937
That asshole.

682
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,897
Gyeong-su…

683
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,025
…why did you have to turn?

684
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,237
I told you all.

685
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,031
He was infected.

686
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,951
Well, are you happy now?

687
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,621
You were all wrong.
Only I was right.

688
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,248
What would you even do without me?

689
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,376
Hey.

690
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:26,964
Maybe you did it.

691
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,590
What?

692
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,183
I saw everything.

693
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,520
Na-yeon…

694
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,066
What? What did you see?

695
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,317
You are the one who did it.

696
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,152
Who did what?

697
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,279
I didn't do anything to Gyeong-su.

698
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,864
I didn't say anything about Gyeong-su.

699
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,075
Knock it off.

700
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,827
What do you talking about?

701
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,870
I didn't do anything.

702
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,290
While we were all watching Gyeong-su,
you were in the back alone.

703
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,378
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but he still doesn't want to come out.

704
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,800
I'll see what I can do.

705
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,303
What's wrong with him?

706
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,143
Looks okay to me.

707
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,439
Why is he not coming out then?

708
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,898
He won't come out?

709
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,859
I don't understand
why he's being so stubborn?

710
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,069
He's too stubborn.

711
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,113
He's always like this.

712
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,701
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

713
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,373
No, I didn't.

714
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,500
You wiped that
on the scratches on Gyeong-su's hand.

715
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,712
-I did not.
-It's in your pocket.

716
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,255
-So what?
-Take it out.

717
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,965
-No.
-Take it out.

718
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,050
I said no.

719
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,802
Should I take it out?

720
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,013
Fuck you!

721
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,848
Who the hell do you think you are?

722
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,725
Class president?

723
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,645
You never treated me like president.

724
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,272
Nam-ra, that's enough.

725
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,486
Nam-ra, do you realize
what you're saying right now?

726
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,488
If that is true,

727
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,741
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

728
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,326
It's true.

729
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,287
Na-yeon did it.

730
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,665
She killed him.

731
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,376
You fucking cunt.

732
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,379
There.

733
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,422
Happy?

734
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,804
This is blood.

735
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,764
I wiped Gyeong-su's hand.

736
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,141
This is his blood?

737
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,810
You can't tell?

738
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,646
Then put it on your wound.

739
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,068
Wipe yourself with it
if you're so confident.

740
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,946
Like his blood is so clean?

741
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,697
He was a zombie.

742
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:03,078
He was just fine until you infected him
with your handkerchief.

743
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,038
Na-yeon, you--

744
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,915
Damn it! It wasn't me!

745
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,256
Don't do it. Stop it.

746
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,465
Let go.

747
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,801
I said to stop it.

748
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:18,927
Give it to me.

749
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,887
Leave me alone! Fuck!

750
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,516
I should just die too then, huh?

751
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,393
That's what you want, isn't it?

752
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,943
Why is Gyeong-su better than me?

753
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,906
That dirty welfie pushed me.

754
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,245
Na-yeon, you didn't…

755
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,081
So, you did do it.

756
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,666
How could you just fucking--

757
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,334
I didn't kill him, okay?

758
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,963
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

759
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,090
He's still alive.

760
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,176
He didn't die, he just turned.

761
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,510
Are you kidding me right now?

762
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,262
Stop ganging up on me.

763
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,474
When I said he smelled, you all laughed.

764
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,852
You all made fun of him too.

765
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,562
Don't try to act innocent now.

766
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,689
-Na-yeon…
-Cheong-san, stop.

767
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,900
How could you kill him?

768
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:15,901
Stop it.

769
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,202
You're…

770
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,206
a murderer.

771
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:53,939
I…

772
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,983
I have no friends at all.

773
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,155
I don't need any of you.

774
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,532
Fuck you.

775
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,087
Hey!

776
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,104
Listen…

777
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,402
No matter what happens, you stay alive.

778
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,738
Also, you must never take a life.

779
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,960
If you cause
someone else to die,

780
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,297
life becomes completely meaningless.

781
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,717
All right?

782
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,862
Ms. Park! Wait.

783
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,573
Dae-su, don't go.

784
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,533
She's gone.

785
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,064
Fuck!

786
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,103
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

787
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,106
