1
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,726
Helsinki, get out
of the dining hall. Go to the museum.

2
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,708
I need
to build a trench in here.

3
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:14,875
Helsinki, do you copy?

4
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,041
Helsinki, are you there?

5
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,791
Fatty!

6
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,125
I'm... I'm alive.

7
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,166
Get out of there right now!

8
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,625
My leg is trapped.

9
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,375
Open wound.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's blood.

11
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,666
Lots of blood.

12
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,791
<i>Don't fall asleep.
We're almost there.</i>

13
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,166
I promise you
that once we get out of here,

14
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,541
I'll take you out to eat
three nights in a row,

15
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,541
and I'll show you why Argentinian meat
is the best in the world.

16
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,375
And then what?

17
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,000
Can you take me to the movies?

18
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,791
Of course, but only if you don't
fall asleep. Promise me you'll stay awake.

19
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,166
I'm still awake.

20
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,500
Squadrons three and nine, now!

21
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,708
Move! Let's go!

22
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,375
They're here.

23
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:29,541
<i>We've seen the military before,
but we're not sure what this is about.</i>

24
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,291
<i>It looks like
they're planning to enter the building.</i>

25
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,416
<i>We've witnessed a terrifying explosion...</i>

26
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,541
This is the Professor.
The stormwater tank is safe.

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,875
Give me a report
on the situation, Palermo!

28
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,291
They blew off the roof!
Bogotá, Rio, and I are on our way up!

29
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,416
<i>Helsinki's trapped.</i>

30
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,041
Lisbon, situation.

31
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,666
Second floor, with Stockholm.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,833
Tokyo, situation.

33
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,000
About to go onto the rooftop. Denver,
Manila, and I. We'll get them from behind.

34
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,000
- Don't open that door!
- What?

35
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
- And Helsinki?
- They'll kill you.

36
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,250
They're coming down!

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,458
Cover the flanks!
Stay together! Keep the formation!

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,375
If you don't go out,
they'll kill Helsinki. Get out!

39
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,458
Do we go out or not?

40
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,000
There are 100 snipers
covering the rooftop. They're soldiers.

41
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,723
<i>You can't get to them from the rear.
They'll shoot you in the head.</i>

42
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,041
Professor, you're sacrificing a man!

43
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,041
There's one way to save Helsinki.
We have to attack on two fronts.

44
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,125
<i>We'll use the hole on the rooftop.
But to do that,</i>

45
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,226
you have to be able to get out
without being killed. I know how.

46
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,708
<i>Go get the hostages.</i>

47
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,791
Arteche, cover the right flank!

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
Fire at three!

49
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,750
Come on!

50
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
Gandía, Gandía, come on!

51
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,458
Come on! Move!

52
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,291
Take cover!

53
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,375
Fire right now!

54
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,500
Everyone take cover!

55
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,833
<i>We thought we were at war
so many times before this.</i>

56
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:07,333
<i>But only because
we didn't know what a war actually was.</i>

57

<i>Frederiksborg Castle.</i>

67
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,083
<i>The security is pretty tight.</i>

68
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,958
<i>You can't enter or exit the building
without going through two metal detectors</i>

69
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,791
<i>and two security guards with machine guns.</i>

70
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,541
<i>All that before even reaching the party.</i>

71
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,416
<i>It'll be the perfect evening:
luxury cars, tuxedos, cocktails,</i>

72
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,458
<i>classical music, and 12 kilos of gold.</i>

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,416
Tatiana's fingers will make magic.

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,375
And we'll basically
be spending all our time enjoying it.

75
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,250
Why?

76
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,291
Because the most difficult part of the job
will already be done.

77
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,500
In fact, it'll be done by you,
one day earlier.

78
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,041
- Me?
- Mm. You, yeah.

79
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,916
You're the only one among us
who looks unremarkable and, frankly, dull.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,916
In fact, you look like a piano tuner.

81
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,500
- You know what this is?
- Well...

82
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,625
It's a magnetic card reader,
a skimmer, a cloner.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,916
Exactly!

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,833
<i>This will be in the piano.
I'm guessing, right?</i>

85
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:20,333
Yeah, this is the one they normally use
to clone credit cards and ATMs, I heard.

86
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:25,166
- Tatiana suddenly will be indisposed.
- Stage fright, you know?

87
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,958
I need some air.

88
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,458
And that'll leave you on your own
before a monumental grand piano.

89
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,041
So you'll need help.

90
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,791
I need a break.

91
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,041
- Could you help him?
- Sure.

92
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,500
<i>To use one of these
magnetic card cloners specifically,</i>

93
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,708
you need to wait 30 seconds
and be at least 10 centimeters

94
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,500
from the card you need to clone,
of course.

95
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,791
<i>They wear them as lanyards
on their necks.</i>

96
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,875
Please, don't move. It's very important.

97
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,958
Okay.

98
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,541
But it's nothing
that can't be solved by a tricky B-flat.

99
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,041
Thank you.

100
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,958
Then your tuning tool cart
will be the next step.

101
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,458
It's where we'll hide our replicas.

102
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,666
It'll be lined in barium sulfate,

103
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,916
which means that even if you go
through X-ray, they won't see a thing.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,708
<i>The guards will escort you
until the replicas are in a safe place.</i>

105
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,615
<i>From that moment,
our only concern will be Hans.</i>

106
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:35,083
- Hans?
- The guard of the hall with the gold.

107
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,333
He's always by the door,
never abandons it.

108
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,250
That man, he has no wife,

109
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,458
he has no dog, he has no kids.

110
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,833
His father's mind has gone.
What's his weak spot?

111
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,250
I don't know. Um...
Maybe some other relative?

112
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,875
What are you talking about?
His dad has lost his mind.

113
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,958
His dad.

114
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,125
Lost his mind.

115
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,708
He's in a nursing home.
Sadly doesn't recognize anyone.

116
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,958
- Bring in Cristoff.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

117
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,541
Rafael.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,166
The briefcase.

119
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,583
Thanks.

120
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,708
We're in.

121
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,958
Liberation of Cristoff.

122
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Walk towards the music.

123
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,375
Towards the music.

124
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,125
Cristoff is on the move.

125
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
- Cameras?
- I'm accessing the system.

126
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,666
Music.

127
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,416
Music.

128
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,541
I got it.

129
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,416
It's a loop.

130
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Music.

131
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
<i>Imagine Hans's astonishment,</i>

132
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,375
who thinks his father
is at the nursing home,

133
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,208
in slippers and watching <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>,
and all of a sudden...

134
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:04,291
Music... music.

135
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,166
Music.

136
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,583
This is Bear 3.

137
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,708
Emergency in Room 1.
I need immediate replacement in Room 1.

138
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,833
Copy, Bear 3. On my way.

139
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Rock and roll.

140
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,541
Oh, there's one thing I forgot to mention.

141
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,166
I don't have the slightest clue
about what we'll find behind this door.

142
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,291
Music.

143
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,833
You never know what
you might find in a hidden security room.

144
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,750
Isn't it exquisite?

145
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,041
Get to work.

146
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,250
The safes are blocked.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Excuse me.

148
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,916
In that...
is the key to opening them all.

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,375
Very well. Which one
of these boxes has the gold?

150
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:49,041
We can find that information. It's all
a matter of coding. I can hack it.

151
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,750
That box is attached to the wall.
It's a fixed structure.

152
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,541
Because it's the walls that move.

153
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,666
This is the most fascinating
security system I've ever seen.

154
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,583
He just found his father.

155
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,208
Son, don't get distracted.
You only have one minute left.

156
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,583
I can't do it in one minute.

157
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,791
Jakov, emergency.

158
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
<i>We'll need three more minutes.</i>

159
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,291
I can't do it in three minutes either.

160
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,708
Okay, okay, no big deal.

161
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,791
If you can't do it in three minutes,
you can take your time in prison.

162
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,375
Excuse me. I'm a doctor.
I think this gentleman doesn't feel well.

163
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,250
He's disoriented.
It's nothing serious. Thanks.

164
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
Come on, Dad.

165
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,750
- Come on!
- Found the gold. I'm cracking the code.

166
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,875
- Okay, how long?
- I don't know.

167
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,875
Jakov,

168
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,958
two more minutes.

169
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,666
I got it!

170
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,375
Excuse me. Out there...

171
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
One minute, Jakov.

172
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,958
He crossed the line
with some ladies.

173
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,666
What?

174
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,583
The president of the foundation
almost called the police.

175
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,625
What did he do?

176
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,083
He said

177
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,541
inappropriate things.

178
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,625
What things?

179
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,416
About...

180
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,666
genitals.

181
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,458
Did you see if he was
with someone or how he got here?

182
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,750
Move aside.

183
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,666
Come here, Dad.

184
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,875
Andrés,
Hans is suspicious now.

185
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,291
<i>He's coming your way.</i>

186
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,208
Excuse me.

187
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,791
Jakov, it's finished.

188
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,250
We're leaving.

189
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,583
The adrenaline, the endorphins...

190
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,458
You feel powerful, don't you, son?

191
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,708
Amazing.

192
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,500
What I'm about to teach you
is really the most important thing.

193
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:57,916
There we go.

194
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Hmm.

195
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,208
What are you doing? No.

196
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
Come on.

197
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,541
Dad, Dad!

198
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,166
- What did you just do?
- Educated you!

199
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,541
You educated me? I can't believe it.

200
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,875
You just tossed 12 kilos of gold.
That's 15 million euros.

201
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,750
How that fuck is that educating me?

202
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,916
Look at you.

203
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,958
Only a true thief feels like he owns
someone else's property.

204
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
Now you know that you're really one of us.

205
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,791
So, next time,

206
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:50,125
you can leave all of that arrogance
and moral superiority behind

207
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,166
and never call your father
a cynic ever again.

208
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,208
And now... let's enjoy.

209
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:01,750
Because I came here
to listen to Tatiana's concert.

210
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,708
Bravo!

211
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,083
<i>We'll be living
every thief's dream:</i>

212
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,916
<i>leaving the heist to applause,
with people taking pictures of us.</i>

213
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,666
<i>We'll be happy,</i>

214
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,208
<i>relaxed, determined,</i>

215
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,750
<i>and so in love.</i>

216
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,458
<i>And above all,</i>

217
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>suspicion free.</i>

218
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,250
<i>We'll leave the country undetected,
in a beautiful small boat,</i>

219
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,750
<i>celebrating Tatiana's success,</i>

220
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,333
<i>towards Malmö, Sweden.</i>

221
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,958
Is something wrong?

222
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,208
Just a tantrum.

223
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,833
I never know
if he's tired, hungry, or gassy.

224
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,375
My love, are you prepared?

225
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,708
You know I am.

226
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,083
Let's see!

227
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,083
Did you expect to take it
through the front door?

228
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,166
I never took you to play tennis...

229
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,708
or to ride a bike uphill,
or to go rowing someplace.

230
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,416
Because doing those kinds of things

231
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,000
wouldn't teach you anything
you don't already know.

232
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,375
But here you learn.

233
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,666
If you really want something in life,

234
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,125
you have to steal it from somebody else.

235
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,708
That's the story of the world, my son.

236
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
We're here, Fatty. Don't worry.

237
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,708
Don't worry, Helsinki. I'm here.

238
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:28,958
<i>Arteche.</i>

239
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,166
Arteche!

240
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,500
I can't hear anything, Major.
Tosco's injured.

241
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,708
His pulse is really weak.

242
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,958
It got to the femoral.

243
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,833
We have to make a fucking tourniquet.

244
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,583
Don't worry, Fatty. Just breathe.
We're getting you out of here.

245
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,958
Higher, higher. Put it higher.
Higher. Come on. Come on!

246
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,375
Sagasta, do you copy?

247
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:01,000
- <i>What the fuck is going on?</i>
- It was...a hostile rocket.

248
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,708
I want a damage report now!

249
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,416
Shut your fucking mouth, Colonel.
I got wounded soldiers in here.

250
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,750
Canalejas, we have to make a trench
to secure this perimeter.

251
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,625
Hey, look at me.
This is gonna hurt. Are you ready?

252
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,958
Three, two, one. Now!

253
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,750
Bring the anti-explosive robot.
We're going in any moment now.

254
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,208
Everybody get up!

255
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,291
You're all in luck.

256
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,750
We're gonna do a fire drill,
like we did back in high school.

257
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,250
- Everyone stay quiet and form a line.
- You're now the infantry.

258
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,000
Matías, grab the bag with our gear.
We're going to the roof.

259
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,083
Copy.

260
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,625
Let's go!

261
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,291
Palermo,
cut that fucking leg, Palermo.

262
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,208
Cut it.

263
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,250
Hey, look at me.

264
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,166
I'm not gonna cut your leg off,
you hear me? I'm not gonna do it.

265
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,250
Palermo,

266
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,625
I shattered my femur, shinbone,

267
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,166
my knee.

268
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,333
They're gonna cut it in the hospital.
You know that perfectly well, Palermo.

269
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,958
This will make you feel better.
We'll get you out.

270
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,500
So stop saying stupid shit, all right?

271
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,083
Don't worry, Fatty.
I'm here with you, okay?

272
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,916
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

273
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,916
He's right.

274
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,708
It's a marble statue,
weighs at least two tons.

275
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,583
We won't be able to move it, Palermo.

276
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,166
I'll cut it.

277
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,791
No, we're gonna find a lever
so we can move that fucking statue!

278
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,778
We need something big to move it.

279
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,125
We're at the back stairs.

280
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,458
The snipers have to think
you're all hostages.

281
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,750
Half of them
take off their masks when they're out.

282
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,833
You've got one minute to reach the top.

283
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,250
You're gonna play
the role of your lives, okay?

284
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,250
I want an Oscar-winning performance!

285
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,208
Is that clear? Come on!

286
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,833
That's it.

287
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:30,791
Go!

288
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,125
Ms. Tokyo, give me a moment,
my stomach hurts.

289
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,541
Keep going, we're almost there.

290
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,541
Pass me a bandage, Bogotá.

291
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,666
- Don't fall asleep.
- Hang in there.

292
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,226
- Don't worry.
- Hang in there.

293
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,333
It's looking better.

294
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,500
No?

295
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,166
Helsinki, hey, hey, hey.

296
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,166
Hey, you're with me, right?

297
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,291
- Palermo.
- Open your eyes.

298
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,125
Keep your eyes open, Helsinki.

299
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,500
No, Helsinki. Look at me.
Look at me, Fatty. Please look at me.

300
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:04,250
Helsinki, look at me. Come on.
Fatty, look at me, for fuck's sake, Mirko!

301
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,791
Don't go, Helsinki. Look at me.

302
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,666
Palermo, what about that beam?

303
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:18,791
Cover us.

304
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,166
Thank you.

305
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,458
Lisbon. We need covering fire.

306
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,166
<i>Going out. Everyone ready?</i>

307
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:33,791
- I'm not going. They'll kill us.
- They're not gonna kill you, Miguel.

308
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,916
I might because you're so annoying,
but they're not gonna kill you. Got it?

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,333
They won't kill any of you

310
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,500
because half of you are gonna
take off your masks. Is that clear?

311
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,875
Make sure
they clearly see you're hostages.

312
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,833
You'll take your mask off,
you'll take it off... and you too, hon.

313
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:48,916
Okay, great.

314
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,583
Get them on.

315
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,875
Professor.

316
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,958
The bomb squad. They're getting ready
to enter through the ground floor.

317
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,838
They're getting ready
for an attack.

318
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,396
Why did you let the governor out?
Got something up your sleeve?

319
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,875
We hid a mic in the handcuffs.

320
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:18,000
I thought we had a chance
if they removed the handcuffs

321
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,916
before they went through
the radio wave detector.

322
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,833
We're getting him out.
And I'll tell you why.

323
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,583
And?

324
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,208
We've got Tamayo by the balls.

325
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,166
Contact Pakistan.

326
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,708
You're the sexiest woman in the world,
but I love you for your brains.

327
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:45,041
Right. Yeah. I'm a little busy now,
so let's save the flirting for later.

328
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,291
- Okay?
- Sounds great.

329
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,875
Benjamín, call your men.

330
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,041
We're going to start the foundry.

331
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:59,083
Marseille, I need you to get some things.
Buy, um... pacifiers, diapers, a crib...

332
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,000
Whatever she needs.

333
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,166
Are you breastfeeding
or should I bring a bottle?

334
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,083
Um... breast and bottle, right?
We're going all in here.

335
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,000
And get something for his foot.

336
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,083
I don't think he remembers I shot him.

337
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,750
By the way, Inspector,
maybe it'd be a good idea if...

338
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,291
you gave your cartridge rounds
to Marseille.

339
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,291
For the security of everyone.

340
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,375
Thank you.

341
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,083
<i>Professor, we're on the roof.</i>

342
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:47,375
Very good. Tokyo, it's important
they don't see you coming up armed.

343
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,541
Keep the intervention equipment
inside the bag with the weapons.

344
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,750
<i>Tie the bag to the end of one rope
and the other to one of you.</i>

345
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:57,708
You need to make it to the edge of
the hole while hidden among the hostages.

346
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,625
Matías, we need your help.

347
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,000
As soon as I say "stampede,"

348
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,708
you shoot from the door
to distract the snipers.

349
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,458
Then Tokyo pulls the rope
and retrieves the bag. Got it?

350
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,750
Palermo, Stockholm and I are in position.

351
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,208
Lisbon, smoke in five,

352
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>four,</i>

353
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,708
<i>three,</i>

354
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,875
<i>two,</i>

355
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:26,875
one.

356
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,666
Good luck.

357
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Now!

358
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,666
Smoke!

359
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,083
Covering fire!

360
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,625
I have no visual!

361
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,583
Come on, Rio.

362
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,791
<i>Tokyo, now.</i>

363
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,750
Don't shoot!

364
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla!
I'm a hostage!

365
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,025
They're on the roof.
They're taking their masks off.

366
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,791
If anyone goes near
the destroyed roof, shoot.

367
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,833
Copy. We'll cover the area.

368
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:16,583
The robot.
Go in through the front door now.

369
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,083
They can't hold back
the commandos and the hostages.

370
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>- </i>Now's our moment.
- Count on it.

371
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,833
Don't shoot!

372
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,333
Everyone's outside, Professor.

373
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,625
Come on!

374
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,166
Bandage, right now!

375
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,250
We're running out of smoke. Hurry up!

376
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,541
Let's get out of here!

377
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,583
- Come on!
- Come on!

378
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,250
Bogotá! You okay?

379
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,166
Hang in there!

380
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,916
Waiting on a green light for stampede.

381
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,666
Palermo, give the order.

382
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,166
Give the order now!

383
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,916
- Not yet. We almost got Helsinki out.
- We don't have much time.

384
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,583
Once he's free, we'll be the bait
to lure them out of the trench.

385
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,916
Chuikov!

386
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,375
Don't get close to the hole
until I tell you to.

387
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,041
Don't shoot!

388
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:51,083
- Be ready to enter the building.
- Copy.

389
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,916
<i>In position, sir.</i>

390
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,875
UNKNOWN NUMBER

391
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,708
Sir. All units ready.

392
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,833
Give me a moment.

393
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,166
Who is this?

394
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,041
<i>Go ahead, Professor.</i>

395
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,750
First of all, don't even lift a finger

396
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,416
because I assure you, you don't want
anyone to hear this conversation.

397
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,041
<i>Tell me, Colonel,
do you do yoga or anything like that?</i>

398
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,125
Capoeira.

399
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,625
So <i>that's</i> how you got your flexibility.

400
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,625
Your flexibility to dodge problems,
to dodge regulations and responsibilities.

401
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,958
You must be an excellent lover
with such flexibility.

402
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,291
Actually, I am. But I'm starting
to get disgusted by this conversation.

403
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,375
<i>Tell me what the fuck you want.</i>

404
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:49,708
Go ahead.

405
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:54,125
<i>They didn't resuscitate anyone.
They killed him in cold blood.</i>

406
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,875
<i>The best thing that could happen is for
that man to die in the next ten minutes.</i>

407
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,875
<i>They gave us a gift. I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!</i>

408
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,583
<i>We'll shoot them in the back
even if they're on their knees!</i>

409
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,541
<i>But before we do,</i>

410
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,333
<i>I need everyone to believe
they're fucking murderers.</i>

411
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,416
What are you trying to do?

412
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,791
- All I want is a fair war.
- That doesn't exist.

413
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,291
Tamayo, you sent
eight elite soldiers inside the bank.

414
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,333
I have ten robbers inside.
I think it's quite balanced.

415
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,333
<i>I don't wanna see any other movement.</i>

416
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,776
You actually think
you're gonna stop me with that recording?

417
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:32,208
Colonel, you started out this race
to save yourself without scruples

418
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,791
or ethics.

419
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:37,125
All I'm asking
is that you keep doing the same.

420
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,083
<i>Either you hold back the second attack,</i>

421
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,000
or I prove that it was you

422
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,541
<i>who fabricated false evidence
against Alicia Sierra,</i>

423
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,708
who ordered the money transactions
from reserved funds,

424
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:49,833
and on top of that,

425
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:53,250
I'll transfer ten million to a company
in the Dutch Antilles in your name.

426
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,708
And I assure you that operation
will link you directly to me.

427
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,416
Put a hold on the intervention.

428
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,333
That's not the order I was expecting.

429
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,333
You don't get calls from the president.

430
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,708
You're not held accountable
before the government, right?

431
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,833
Then I think you should
go get some fucking cookies

432
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,916
and let me give the orders around here.

433
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,666
- Help!
- Tokyo!

434
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:53,041
What's wrong? Are you okay?

435
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,934
- I'm good.
- What is it? What happened?

436
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,958
- Nothing happened.
- Are you okay?

437
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,041
This... This might be
a little too much for me,

438
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,791
but I'm okay, I'm all right.

439
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:07,083
I... I used to rob gas stations, man,
and now the whole army is after me.

440
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,833
Don't worry about it. We're together.

441
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,875
I know, don't worry about it.
We're together. It'll be fine.

442
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:12,875
Go, go, go, go!

443
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,041
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

444
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,226
Look at me.

445
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,541
Don't close your eyes, okay?
Just look at me. Just look at me.

446
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,541
- Tell me something.
- What?

447
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,625
Whatever you want.

448
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,500
- Why'd you come here?
- What?

449
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:30,458
Well, because... Because the other heist
had just turned out so well.

450
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,291
But not this one.

451
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,291
And I wanted to spend time
with this moron, but...

452
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,375
But from the moment
I got into the monastery,

453
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:42,125
I swear, right there I realized
that this was not gonna go well.

454
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,708
What do you mean?

455
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:54,375
<i>Because you were there
with your wife, with a child, like...</i>

456
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>like a perfect family, you know?</i>

457
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,583
And I felt so naive.

458
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,125
Why would you say that?

459
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,041
Because I've been in love
with him all my life.

460
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:09,083
Stop messing around.
It's no time for jokes, okay?

461
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,916
It's not a joke, buddy.

462
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,500
It's not a joke.
The thing is, since we're gonna die,

463
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,416
because this is getting ugly, you know?

464
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,041
- Listen to me.
- No, telling you makes me feel calmer.

465
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,625
No, you gotta listen.

466
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,625
Nobody's going to die today, you hear me?

467
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,375
- Say it.
- Today nobody is dying.

468
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,250
- Nobody is dying, okay?
- Okay.

469
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,416
Life goes on, right?

470
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:45,166
- Life goes on.
- Yeah, it does.

471
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,250
Drag him the fuck out!

472
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,208
Professor, we got Helsinki.

473
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:01,083
Matías, prepare to shoot on my command.

474
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,500
Yes, Professor.

475
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,708
Tokyo, Manila, Denver, stand by.

476
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,916
Ready.

477
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,583
Let's go, stay with me, okay?

478
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,583
Matías, stampede.

479
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,333
<i>By the door! Open fire!</i>

480
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,333
Fire!

481
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,666
They're approaching the hole.
Requesting permission to shoot.

482
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,125
You can't.
For fuck's sake, they're hostages!

483
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:53,875
Orders, sir.

484
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,916
<i>Visibility's getting worse.
I need permission to shoot.</i>

485
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,416
Civilians are running away
from the line of fire. Permission denied.

486
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:56,583
Bogotá, Rio, let them get close.

487
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,625
They're backing off.
Push them across the room, now!

488
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,500
Tokyo.

489
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,833
<i>They left their cover. Wait for my order.</i>

490
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,541
Not yet.

491
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,958
- Now!
- Now!

492
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,401
Fire at six!

493
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,208
Let's go!

494
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,208
Holy shit.

495
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:43,166
We get an hour break
and everyone just wants to fuck?

496
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,416
What is this place?
A summer camp for teenagers?

497
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,166
If Rio were here,
what do you think you'd be doing?

498
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,625
Think you need
a few more pictures of Jesus in here?

499
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:57,083
They're my boyfriends.
And also my bodyguards.

500
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,375
They protect Helsinki and me.

501
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:03,916
Shit.

502
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,500
This guy shouldn't be allowed
to leave this room.

503
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:11,083
I'm sorry to say it, but if I die,
I don't wanna see any of these guys.

504
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:12,916
Yeah.

505
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,875
What do you think happens?

506
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,958
What, after they shoot us
in the head?

507
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,791
Do you think we go someplace?

508
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,958
Well,

509
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,041
no.

510
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,125
Seriously?

511
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,625
Nada.

512
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,416
You think so?

513
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,791
That everything's over?

514
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:45,833
Not everything, no. You leave your memory.

515
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,541
And how do you wanna be remembered?

516
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,708
Well, I don't know. I guess, uh...

517
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,833
I think I'd like people to say that...

518
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,875
that they shared things with me.

519
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,375
But, you know, like something that's real.

520
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,708
I don't know, like,
for instance, friendship.

521
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:18,208
Okay, you know how people say,
"Yeah, I got a lot of friends"?

522
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,708
So what?

523
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,666
Just having friends isn't enough.
You gotta really feel them.

524
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:29,416
You think Helsinki won't remember me
every Christmas for the rest of his life?

525
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,500
I'll always remember you saying...

526
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,666
"I'm going."

527
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,666
I'm going where?

528
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,833
Going into the lion's den to rescue Rio.

529
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,000
Come on.

530
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,333
Babe...

531
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,125
I do think there's something.

532
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,583
Actually,

533
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:13,916
I believe...

534
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,000
you keep on living in the final thought
you have the moment before you die.

535
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,125
So when the chaos happens,
I always think about when I was happiest.

536
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,625
So I'll stay and live

537
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,416
in those memories forever.

538
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,541
I think that's a beautiful plan.

539
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,875
- What? Oh no. Not him. Who's that?
- Um, who do you think?

540
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,750
- Come on! No way.
- Of course it is!

541
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,500
Aikido in there, Professor!

542
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,041
- No.
- Aikido all the way through, man!

543
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,625
Fuck no! Oh my God.

544
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,666
Who's in charge here?

545
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,416
Major Sagasta.

546
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,333
Well, Sagasta, you're surrounded.

547
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,791
Leave your weapons
in the center of the room.

548
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,541
You come and get them, you fucking fairy!

549
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,416
<i>Sagasta, situation.</i>

550
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,416
Send in the second team.
The whole gang is here with me.

551
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,791
<i>Even the mailman and his mother
could walk in the front door now.</i>

552
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,875
Sagasta, you have to resist.

553
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,041
There won't be a second team coming in.

554
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,375
They snuck in under your fucking nose
and now you sell us out.

555
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:40,791
Over and out.

556
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,875
Arteche, what do you think?

557
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:53,000
We're between two flanks,
we need to get rid of one.

558
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,666
Sagasta, you've got ten seconds.

559
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,125
Gandía, can you activate
the museum's safety lock?

560
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,250
Affirmative. There's a fingerprint scanner
in the room.

561
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,000
Seven seconds!

562
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,375
Okay, four corners.
Wait for my order.

563
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,750
Five seconds!

564
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:24,791
Four!

565
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,625
Three!

566
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,375
Two!

567
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,500
It's okay.
All right, dropping the weapons.

568
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:40,000
Put your hands on your head!
Down on the ground, now!

569
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,166
Okay.

570
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,958
We're going to drop our weapons.

571
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,666
I don't like this one bit.

572
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,041
Now!

573
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,083
Grenade!

574
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,583
Take cover!

575
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,375
Fuck!

576
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,375
- Tell me what's happening.
<i>- Grenades!</i>

577
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:33,833
- They've pushed us back into the museum.
- Don't lose sight of Tokyo's group.

578
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,166
Tokyo, keep going!

579
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,833
Not possible. No visual.

580
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:10,083
They're lowering the doors.
There's a safety lock.

581
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,166
A safe lock?

582
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,375
There's no way, it's not in the plans.

583
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,541
Then they made them
after drawing the plans

584
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,083
'cause there's definitely a door
shutting in front of me.

585
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,916
Go! Come on!

586
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,708
Move!

587
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,333
Make a trench in the kitchen.

588
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:49,541
<i>♪ Will you run or will you fight? ♪</i>

589

590
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,416

591
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,833
Tokyo!

592
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,541
A little bird just told me

593
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:43,000
that Nairobi is saving you
a place in heaven.

594
