167
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,750
[in Rhûnnic] Go!

168
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,833
Go now!

169
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,291
[Nori, in English] We tried to find you.

170
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,958
My dear friends.

171
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,375
Is he the fella you were looking
for out here all along?

172
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,291
Dark Wizard?

173
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:36,791
That is a name I do not embrace.

174
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,750
Placed upon me by Men long ago,

175
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,750
out of ignorance and fear of our kind.

176
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:48,833
I hope my actions today will lead you
to know better of me.

177
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,000
This the sort of action you mean?

178
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,166
You pity him whose blade
was at your throat?

179
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,833
Yes.

180
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,958
Pity will not defeat Sauron.

181
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,166
And if you were to defeat Sauron,
would that suffice?

182
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,750
Or would you seek to become his successor?

183
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:20,125
Walk with me, and in time,
we will both be his successors.

184
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,333
I would sooner
walk this desert forevermore,

185
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,250
nameless and forgotten.

186
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,750
Then you give me little choice,
old friend.

187
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,208
[Dark Wizard yells]

[dramatic music playing]

190
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,333
Everybody out!

191
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,375
[Stoors shouting and screaming]

192
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,833
I only hope losing those you care for most

193
00:15:55,916 --> 00:16:01,166
will give you a taste of the suffering
all Middle-earth will know,

194
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,791
should Sauron prove victorious.

195
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,541
No!

196
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,541
When your senses have returned,
I will be waiting.

197
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,375
[Stoors screaming]

198

[tense music playing]

199
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,250
Nori! Nori.

200
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
[bells tolling]

201
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:05,000
We expect answers.
What is the meaning of this?

202
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,375
I was ordered only to gather you here.

203
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,083
I've no answers to give.

204
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,916
[marching footsteps approach]

205
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,250
[crowd murmuring]

206
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,916
Leaders of The Faithful.

207
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,916
I thank you all for coming
at this late hour.

208
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,083
To what end?

209
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,875
We have learned why Míriel
was able to bewitch the sea.

210
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,541
It would seem she has an ally
of cunning powers.

211
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,208
An ally who has already
bruised Númenor once

212
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,125
and is now gathering strength
to make us bleed.

213
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,000
Absurd.

214
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:54,291
The Sea Queen has no allies
but the Valar who uphold her.

215
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,333
Sauron?

216
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,500
All so-called Faithful are now declared

217
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,208
traitors of Westernesse!

[crowd clamoring]

219

are called upon to oppose this threat.</i>

Traitor!

224
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,000
[man] Pharazôn, you cannot do this!

225
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,625
[guard] Come on, traitor.

00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,916
Father!

228
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,000
Father, please.

229
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,000
There's no time to explain.

230
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,125
They're coming for you.

231
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,750
Check in there. Clear them out.

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,416
[guard shouting]

233
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,333
Are there any Faithful in there?

234
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,666
No. Move along.

235
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,250
[guard 1] Hm.

236
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,541
Shall I tell Ar-Pharazôn
of your insolence?

237
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,333
[guard 2] Do not resist.
Don't push back. Move!

238
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,041
Move along.

239
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
[guard 1] Hm.

240
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,875
Right. All of them.
And up there too. All of it.

241
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,958
[Elendil] We must leave for the West.
There are Faithful there.

242
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,708
My son Anárion amongst them.

243
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,333
I know a ferryman
who can get us outside the city.

244
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,833
You must travel only by night.

245
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,583
The stars shall be your friends
and make safe your steps.

246
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,833
[Elendil] And yours.

247
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,666
One does not need eyes
to lead in the dark.

248
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,208
What cowardice have I ever shown
to make you think

249
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,958
I would even consider
making safe my own skin

250
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,583
at the peril of yours?

251
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,666
My place is here. You know it is.

252
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:05,125
Then where is mine, if not with you?

253
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,666
It is called Narsil.

254
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,583
[Elendil] The white flame.

255
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,708
Reclaim your Lordship.

256
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,416
And with this sword, your destiny.

[Galadriel, in English] Go!

There's no way out, Elf. [groans]

[Galadriel] This way.

I'm the one your Lord-father wants.

Set them free. And I will go willingly.

Give me one reason, Elf.

They will be here any moment.

Have you ever seen Orcs
in the heat of combat?

290
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,041
A frenzy comes over them.

291
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,666
A blood-hunger.

292
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:05,125
When Gondolin fell,
they say it went on, and on.

For weeks.

295

Tell me where you have hidden the Rings.
And I will end your suffering now.

296
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,291
[Celebrimbor] It must be nearly noontide.

297
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:25,541
One used to hear the kingfishers,
flying to the river.

298
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,625
It is a pity how you have silenced them.

299
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,125
All I have done has been for you.

300
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:40,125
Yours was the fire
that crafted the marvels of the age.

301
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:43,416
I wish only to share them with the world.

302
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,625
Please.

303
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,833
Let me.

304
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,791
But the Rings are beyond your reach.

305
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,958
As I shall be, ere long.

306
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,083
For soon I shall go
to the shores of the morning.

307
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:09,208
Borne hence,
by a wind that you can never follow!

308
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,333
[whimpers]

309
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,291
There are ways of keeping you alive.

310
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,083
[in Sindarin] Friend.

311
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,416
[in English] Must I show you my mastery
of that craft as well?

312
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,000
Craft. [chuckles]

313
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,291
Your only craft is treachery.

314
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:52,166
So pure, it shall betray
the very hand that forges it.

315
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:55,708
Your words are empty.

316
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,041
No.

317
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,125
No, hear me. Hear me!

318
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,541
Shadow of Morgoth.

319
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,125
Hear the dying words of Celebrimbor.

320
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:16,166
The Rings of Power shall destroy you.

321
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,291
And in the end, I foresee,

322
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:26,041
one alone shall prove your utter ruin!

323
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:27,875
[shouts]

[groans]

325
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,333
You're wrong. I am their creator.

326
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,791
I am their master.

327
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,416
No.

328
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,583
You are their... prisoner.

329
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,500
Sauron, Lord...

330
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,333
...of the Rings.

331
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you him? Are you Sauron?

About it being your fault and all.

346
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,958
I wanted to know how you carry it.

347
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:20,875
Poorly.

348

I've carried it poorly.

Why?

351
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,750
Seems there's grander things here
than I thought.

352
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,583
Enough to make me realize
how small I'd become.

362
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,458
To replace the ones Theo lent me.

363

You can, uh, set it up there.

Hagen started laying the foundation
a few days ago.

366

When he laid the cornerstone...

367
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:16,166
he asked the gods to keep our love strong,
as long as the home stood.

368
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,250
I'm happy for you.

369
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,791
I always thought his kindness
was what love felt like.

370
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,916
But when he said it, I felt ill.

371
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,000
I felt like...

372
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,541
Why are you telling me this?

373
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,833
I...

374
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,458
Come with me.

375
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,250
Come with me to Númenor.

376
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,458
Low men of Pelargir. Salutations.

377
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,916
I'm Theo. Son of Bronwyn.

378
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,666
Bring the surveyor's equipment.

379
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,041
Perhaps you didn't hear.

380
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,166
This is Theo. His mother was Bronwyn.

381
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,583
Of course she was. And who are you?

382
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,708
He's the leader of half the colony.

383
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,583
Here to help me uphold the agreement
we made with your Queen.

384
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,125
Agreement's changed.

385
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,083
We'll build the watchtower
in sight of the river.

Fell a few houses if we need to.

387

It's a disgrace,

Is that Kemen?

390
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,791
Your sister will be so pleased
to hear we found you.

391
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:11,250
I never gave up hope, even when everyone
said there were no survivors left.

392
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,583
There wouldn't be, if not for Berek.

393
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,583
I trust there's room on the ship.

394
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,000
Plenty.

395
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,750
Then one more should be no trouble.

396
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,208
No passage for low men.

My sister's a guild member.

399

Surely an exception can be made.

400
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

401

And yours... is wanted for treason.

It might've been worse.

Any low man wishing to remain here

will deliver a regular allotment of timber
from the surrounding forests

for the construction
of His Majesty's armada.

What about the supplies you promised?
The food for winter?

No timber, no supplies.

for you. After all, they're only trees.

01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,916
The survivors have fled
to a valley North of here.

663
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:13,958
And Elrond?

664
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,208
He led them.

665
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:19,708
Dispatch word.

666
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:25,083
Tell him, Khazad-dûm stands ready
to offer aid once more.

667
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:28,416
We have troubles of our own, my love.

668
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,958
Your father's passing
has left us in a tangle.

669
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:40,250
The Lords of the Blue Mountains
paid him vast tributes

670
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,291
and they're demanding to collect.

671
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:44,958
But there's more.

672
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:49,250
Rumors fly that you were
not your father's preferred heir.

673
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:53,500
That some of the other Dwarf-lords
are advancing claims.

674
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:58,916
And, um, your brother
seems to be gathering support.

675
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,541
[Galadriel shuddering]

676
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,416
[wind whooshing]

677
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,166
[birds chirping]

678
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,375
[gasping]

679
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,500
[Gil-galad] Pity.

680
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:27,125
I've never known you
to be such peaceable company.

681
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:30,291
I believe I was growing accustomed to it.

682
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,583
[groans]

683
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,000
Rest.

684
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,541
We are safe here.

685
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:50,583
-What is this place?
-[Elrond] A sanctuary.

686
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:56,291
Protected... by the Elven Rings.

687
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:08,916
[sighs]

688
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:22,958
Commander.

689
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:24,791
Arondir.

690
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:32,708
I have gathered the others, High King.
They await your decision.

691
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,583
Sauron's armies are roving across Eriador.

692
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:45,166
All Middle-earth is within his reach now.
Even Lindon.

693
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:50,791
We must decide whether to attack
and bring the fight to him...

694
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:54,583
or to fall back, to prepare our defenses.

695
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,750
The sword or the shield.

696
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,541
[Elrond] Many of Eregion's bravest fell.

697
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,916
The few who survived are all but broken.
In body or spirit.

698
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,708
They have little strength left
with which to fight.

699
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,125
They barely had strength to flee.

700
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:17,208
What course would you advise,
Commander Galadriel?

701
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:21,708
[sighs]

702
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:31,750
I would remember the counsel

703
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:37,125
of our dear friend, Celebrimbor,

704
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,083
<i>Greatest of Elven-smiths.</i>

705
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,333
<i>And remind our people...</i>

706
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,375
<i>that it is not strength
that overcomes darkness,</i>

707
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,750
<i>but light.</i>

708
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:06,916
[gasps]

709
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:10,083
And the sun yet shines.

710
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:18,083
[indistinct chatter]

711
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,750
[blade swishes]

712
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:06,500
[crowd cheering]

713
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
[closing theme music playing]
