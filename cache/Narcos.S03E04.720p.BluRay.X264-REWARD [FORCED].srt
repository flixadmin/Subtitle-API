1
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,902
Please, pay attention!

2
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,698
I need you to put your mobile phones,
beepers, and radios in the container.

3
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,245
Please. I'll take that.

4
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,017
- Thank you.
- OK.

5
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,105
For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

6
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,399
My colleagues and I will take the lead.

7
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,235
And the target?

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,029
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

9
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,963
Gentlemen, you heard!

10
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,341
I need you to be tight and right.

11
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,135
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

12
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,678
Let's go.

13
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,635
So, what are we doing here?

14
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,640
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

15
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:44,970
<i>Applauded by the multitude
present on 10th street,</i>

16
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:51,185
<i>president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...</i>

17
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,363
It's too early.

18
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,783
I rise early. I'm up with the sun.

19
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,118
Up all right!

20
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,183
Hi!

21
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,685
How did it go, honey?

22
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,730
Very good! Look, what a beauty.

23
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,955
<i>Look at that pass. Goal!</i>

24
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,833
Dammit, what sort of defence is that?
Piece of shit!

25
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,418
I'm paying your fucking salaries!

26
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,801
Thank you.

27
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,021
I can help you expand your businesses...

28
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,568
I could help you make millions.

29
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,230
Two units: Calderón's and mine.

30
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,442
Breach one here. Breach two... here.

31
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,654
Feistl, Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

32
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,367
- All right, let's do this already.
- OK.

33
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:16,455
If anyone kills the godfather,
I kill you.

34
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,208
We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar.

35
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,251
I want him alive.

36
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,753
Understood?

37
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,866
Go.

38
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,198
What do you think? What do we do?

39
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,909
I think there could be hideouts here.

40
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,829
- We have to check the house again.
- All right.

41
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:45,586
Gentlemen, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

42
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,678
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

43
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,180
I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

44
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:01,685
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

45
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,862
Sir.

46
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,451
I need you to do something important.

47
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,995
When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

48
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,331
He knows where you have to go.

49
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,044
Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

50
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,506
Cordova. Give it to Cordova.

51
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,054
- Be careful.
<i>- Of course, sir.</i>

52
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,192
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

53
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,199
You're a man of your word.

54
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,447
So close to heaven and so far from God.

55
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,325
Impressive.

56
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

57
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,169
Don't be an asshole, Pacho.

58
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,715
El Paso, Texas
is what I wanted you to see.

59
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,759
Fucking NAFTA changed everything, Pacho.

60
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,388
It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

61
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,765
More than two million trucks
have crossed already.

62
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,269
Many of them ours.
Filled to the brim.

63
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,522
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

64
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,316
Less than ten per cent.

65
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,277
It's insane.
They don't have the manpower.

66
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,446
Assholes opened the floodgates

67
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,450
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.

68
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,455
This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

69
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,331
No, man. What I'm saying is,

70
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,502
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

71
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,463
And you're going to regret it.

72
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,383
You want some?

73
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,183
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

74
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:51,104
No. No way. Why betray?
They want to get out.

75
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,109
I'm proposing that we start
something new, you and I.

76
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,530
Just imagine it:
You send it to me, I get it across.

77
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,577
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

78
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,789
Think about it, all right?

79
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,792
Think about it.
Just don't take too long,

80
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,377
because in six months,
I need to secure a new supply.

81
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,007
Hopefully, it will be with you.

82
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,646
Give it another once-over?

83
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,758
Thirty seconds.

84
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,060
Hey! You can't park there!

85
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,729
Damn truck.

86
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,649
These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

87
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,817
What's up? You can't park here.

88
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,861
Let me just grab the cables
and I'll move it.

89
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,237
Move the fucking truck.

90
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,915
- That's the one Lady Di uses.
- Really?

91
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,962
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

92
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,134
- Careful.
- Sorry, wait just a moment.

93
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,137
Let me get the door.

94
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,263
Look.

95
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,111
Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!

96
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,362
Quickly! Move it!

97
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,406
What's going on?

98
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,868
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, ladies, I won't say it again.

99
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,414
You can't come in here. Get out.

100
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,007
He's fucking running!

101
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,611
Get up! Look at my face!

102
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,863
Let's go.

103
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,951
- Sit down, Miss.
- I already told you, Gilberto is not home.

104
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,244
Did he contact anyone?

105
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,746
- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

106
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,751
Mrs Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

107
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,921
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

108
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,385
The question is, will you cooperate?

109
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,583
Are you all right?

110
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,086
Yes.

111
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,841
It's good here.

112
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,727
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

113
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,195
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

114
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,614
Welcome to my world.

115
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,284
Well...

116
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,221
Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

117
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,016
These people are angry.

118
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,771
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

119
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,234
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

120
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,989
Different? How?

121
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,910
You're crippled. You don't carry a gun.

122
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,290
Most people don't carry guns.

123
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,712
Yeah... but you're not most people.

124
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,298
And that's why it's so weird.

125
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,009
Interesting.

126
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,053
That you never carry a gun.

127
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,558
I see. Why do you think that is?

128
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,852
I don't know.

129
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,854
Maybe you're scared.

130
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,905
Fear... of what you could do with it.

131
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,160
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

132
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,183
Pedrito, go in the house!

133
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,354
Good afternoon, Mrs Salazar.

134
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,940
Calm down, Mrs Salazar.
Calm down.

135
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,445
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

136
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,532
Go right back to where you came from,

137
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,494
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

138
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,413
she can come looking for him.

139
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,748
I just came to talk.

140
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,168
If you don't like what I have to say,

141
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,336
I'll go back to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

142
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,505
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

143
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:39,053
Your boss murdered my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

144
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,683
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

145
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,520
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

146
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,440
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

147
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,859
Protecting?

148
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,154
Is that what they call it now?

149
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,698
And he will be protected as well.

150
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:03,786
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

151
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,665
You promise. How nice of you.

152
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,669
Who told you I would do that?

153
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,423
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

154
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,509
That bitch made her choice.

155
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,556
Mrs Salazar... please accept my offer.

156
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,102
The next men who come... won't be asking.

157
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,771
There will be war.

158
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,862
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

159
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,687
What is this?

160
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,283
- Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

161
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,119
You know what's happening here?

162
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,037
Yes, I think I know.

163
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,540
I'm giving you one chance

164
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:34,127
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

165
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,593
You think you're clever?

166
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,889
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

167
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,684
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

168
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,438
Perhaps.

169
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,035
He's here. We'll find him.

170
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,373
Watch him.

171
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,965
I'm unarmed.
I didn't come for a fight.

172
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,718
We're going to send your fucking head
back to Miguel in a fucking box.

173
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,096
- Walk, motherfucker.
- Let's go.

174
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,355
Bring out the car.

175
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,192
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

176
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,780
- Very good.
- Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

177
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,619
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I'll shoot you.

178
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,121
I'm getting in first, you hear?

179
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,998
Real still.

180
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,876
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want?

181
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,544
Relax.

182
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
- Stop!
- Mama!

183
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,632
What else, motherfucker?

184
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,594
Fucking asshole!

185
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:43,900
Drop the weapon.

186
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,241
Drop the weapon.

187
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,123
Don't shoot.

188
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,125
I'm a man of peace.

189
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,854
Let's go.

190
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,248
Hey! Stop!

191
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,334
Colonel! Calderón has taken off.

192
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,010
- Do you have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

193
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,272
They got Gilberto and they're moving
towards the aerial base.

194
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,232
The whole workforce is on this.

195
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,820
<i>They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert.</i>

196
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,155
<i>Understood?</i>

197
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,008
Move it, asshole.

198
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,143
They'll try to take us on the road.

199
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,228
Guns out!

200
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:32,234
<i>Cleaning, cooking, working.</i>

201
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,072
Hello.

202
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:40,409
<i>- Don Miguel... something's happened.</i>
- What happened?

203
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,079
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him.

204
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,665
They got your brother.

205
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,574
<i>We've got a visual.</i>

206
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,413
Surround him in the market!

207
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,562
Look! There he goes! Faster!

208
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,149
Let's get him on the next turn!

209
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,365
Hold your fire!

210
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,290
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

211
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,543
Driver!

212
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,505
Out further!

213
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,758
Further!

214
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,809
Get out.

215
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,811
Open the back.

216
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,189
- OK. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

217
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,913
Open it.

218
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,221
Those American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong fucking truck!

219
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,848
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

220
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,810
I took care of security.

221
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:15,439
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

222
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,859
Send Salcedo's beeper another message.

223
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,962
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

224
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:42,967
Come in.

225
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,846
- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

226
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,770
- Is it true?
- Yes.

227
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,690
They got him.

228
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,151
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

229
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,404
Once something happens, I'll call you.

230
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,489
No, sir, I have to help.

231
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,326
Come.

232
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,580
You know your dad
doesn't want you mixed up in this.

233
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,250
We have to have faith that your dad
won't be taken out of Cali.

234
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,376
And if he is?

235
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,797
Why did we waste all of that money
on my education? I'm a lawyer.

236
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,883
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

237
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,426
I want to help him.

238
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,679
Let's hope that's not necessary.

239
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,888
Sir, please don't come any closer.

240
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,601
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

241
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,938
You know it.

242
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,398
And that means prison.

243
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,113
What you do today...

244
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,408
what you do this moment...

245
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,202
defines you.

246
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,996
For the rest of your lives.

247
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,585
Are you police or not?

248
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,222
That's better.

249
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,622
Shit!

250
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,294
<i>What's up? It's me.</i>

251
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,130
- About fucking time.
<i>- I was out of range.</i>

252
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,091
<i>They have arrested Gilberto.</i>

253
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,886
- What?
- They got him, Jorge.

254
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,638
They got Gilberto.

255
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,433
You were monitoring the raid.

256
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,602
<i>But they never mentioned
Gilberto's name.</i>

257
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,439
Even so, we checked all the tapes.
It's impossible.

258
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,447
<i>Brother...</i>

259
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,700
They got him.
They took him away.

260
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,120
We got beat.

261
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,330
Get back here quick.

262
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,313
Take that.

263
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,492
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

264
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,035
Congratulations.

265
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,164
But you know this won't hold up.

266
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,917
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

267
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,088
Smile, Gilberto.

268
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,382
You're about to be on TV.

269
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,472
Mr Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

270
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,184
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

271
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,476
Enough. Let's go.

272
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,229
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali?

273
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,273
Mr Rodríguez.

274
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,679
- My love!
- Mummy!

275
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,060
- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

276
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,982
How cute.
Looks a lot like his dad.

277
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,196
Come on.
Mum will read you a story in a bit.

278
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,781
Go. I'll be right there.

279
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,993
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

280
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,501
Sir, we don't know
how much the DEA knows.

281
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,505
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

282
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,885
I'll stay here for now.

283
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,932
We all need to talk.

284
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,313
What did you expect?

285
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,858
A warrant by definition
authorizes the police...

286
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,069
Wait, wait, wait...

287
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,530
Let's not lie to ourselves.
This operation was run

288
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,867
by the Drug Enforcement Administration
of the United States.

289
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,953
The takedown, Mr Attorney General,
was National Police.

290
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,373
The transport was by our police.

291
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,750
The booking was by our police.

292
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,585
So a war started by National Police?

293
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,505
Look, as Attorney General,

294
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,052
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

295
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,638
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

296
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:54,226
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

297
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,187
The President of Colombia,
Ernesto Samper.

298
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,278
I hate to be late to a good debate.

299
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,949
You know us, might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

300
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,956
I've been apprised by Minister Botero
about our newly-incarcerated Cali godfather.

301
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,169
- With all due respect, Mr President?
- Go ahead, Miguel.

302
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:26,091
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

303
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,263
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr Rodríguez Orejuela.

304
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,267
Colombia is a nation of laws.

305
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,019
Not of concessions.

306
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:42,649
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organisation in the world,

307
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,569
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

308
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,784
Mr Rodríguez is entitled to the same
due process as any Colombian citizen.

309
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,288
Let's see where due process gets him.

310
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,667
For now...

311
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,712
his arrest stands.

312
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,047
Thank you, gentlemen.

313
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,027
Thank you very much.

314
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,480
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

315
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,023
Relax, Dad.

316
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,777
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

317
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:16,826
Besides, I thought you could use
a friendly face.

318
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:22,332
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

319
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:29,548
How does it look?

320
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,593
The warrants are old.

321
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,138
- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

322
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:42,060
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00pm
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

323
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,229
8:00am at the latest, I'll be out.

324
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,108
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

325
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:53,154
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

326
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,575
I don't get it.

327
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,785
This is a mistake, a blunder.

328
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,497
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

329
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,250
That's what you want to believe.

330
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,502
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

331
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,383
- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real.

332
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,635
And what about all I've paid?

333
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,514
Sons of bitches
can't leave me confined here.

334
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,855
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

335
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,523
It was Calderón.

336
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,862
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

337
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:36,906
- And his fucking family and his children.
- David, please.

338
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,661
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

339
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,915
- Cordova...
- Sir, just as we realised...

340
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,375
By the time you realised,

341
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,006
Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

342
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,675
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

343
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,677
When it comes to the DEA,
Cordova counts on me.

344
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,268
Wait. Cordova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

345
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,771
Yes, sir.

346
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,607
Then you should've been there.

347
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,362
Your men should've been there.

348
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:21,743
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck.

349
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,121
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

350
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:31,670
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us are safe.

351
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,421
Not your families...

352
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,094
and not mine.

353
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,763
My family.

354
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,855
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defence Minister Botero.

355
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,234
Colonel, please.

356
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,695
Thanks.

357
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,465
What are you talking about?

358
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,797
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

359
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,468
Good luck.

360
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,012
Colonel...

361
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,183
I'm sorry.

362
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:42,360
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

363
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,407
You did everything right, Peña.

364
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,202
But now you're all alone.

365
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,320
We need to talk about your security.

366
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,240
Let me be in charge.

367
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,368
I'll protect you, Dad.

368
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,166
Now's not the time for a change.

369
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,216
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

370
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,890
What if he doesn't come back?

371
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:31,344
- They got Gilberto.
<i>- I don't understand.</i>

372
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,430
I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

373
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,140
<i>So did I.</i>

374
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,435
And what now?

375
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,480
<i>This could get messy.
Stay where you are.</i>

376
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,149
<i>Right now, we look out for ourselves.</i>

377
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,736
<i>Pacho... be smart.</i>

378
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,282
<i>For now, we wait.</i>

379
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:56,035
You stay there a while longer.

380
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,705
We have to keep everything running.

381
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:04,961
<i>The health of the business has never been
more important. Understand?</i>

382
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,171
Yes. Of course.

383
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,427
You listening to me, motherfucker?
