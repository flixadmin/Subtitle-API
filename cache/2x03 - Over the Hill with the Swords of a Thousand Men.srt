So, um...

12
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,650
sorry?

13
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,240

- Easy, easy, easy, kid.
- I'll fucking kill you!

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,340
- Relax.
- Fucking hell. Kid's stark raving.

18
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,180
No, no, no.

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,930
Breathe. Breathe.

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,510
Do you mind?

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,680
- Fucking hell.
- Kid, breathe.

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,060
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
- Okay?
- Okay.

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,270
- All right.
- I'm fine.

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,400
- All right.

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,520
What's the ETA?

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,820
A team's on the way.
They'll be a few hours.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,650
- A few hours?
- I'm a civilian.

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,410
I can't just push a button anymore.

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,070
The target's secure? No one's seen him?

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,990
We're three fucking miles offshore, Grace.
What do you think?

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,460
I think if there's a way to screw this up
you'll find it.

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,290
Look, I just want me wife back.

34
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,420
I know.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,670
Bring Langley the terrorist,
and you'll have her.

36
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,010
Hey, you ever hear
of an old Supe called Liberty?

37
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,100
The fuck's that gotta do with anything?

38
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm not sure yet.

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,560
How's your crew holding up?

40
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,310
Yeah, all good.

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,650
We are having a few laughs here,
I'll tell you that.

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,150
The target is the girl's brother?

43
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,230
Yeah, so?

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,110
You don't think
it compromises her allegiances?

45
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,030
Well...

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,490
if it comes to that...

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,240
I'll neutralize her.

48
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,870
The compassion you show your team
is truly touching.

49
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,340
It's just a figure of speech, mate.

51
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,580
You remember in the camp...

52
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,210
You were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

53
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,760
and I snuck into the storage room
to steal you rice?

54
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,970
I took care of you.

55
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,400
I still will.

56
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,660
I also remember the time
they came after you for stealing.

57
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,370
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

58
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,710
You might be my big sister.

59
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,420
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
You know...

61
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,800
the Americans will torture me.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,510
I won't let them.

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,100
How will you stop them?

64
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,650
You have to let me go.

65
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,570
I won't attack anyone.

66
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,650
I won't hurt anyone.

67
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm your brother...

68
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,830
We only have each other now.

69
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,710
Please.

70
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,850
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,420
Thank you.

72
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,940
- I gotta go, man. I'm out.
- All right.

73
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,610
- Yo, yo.
- Later, man.

74
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,670
Breakfast is served.

75
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,090
Want one or two, buddy?

76
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,840
- Just one.
- Yeah, just one.

77
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,470
- You want maple syrup?
- Um...

78
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,800
Yes, please.

79
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,440
Little more.

80
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,650
Thank you. Love it.

81
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,670
This is nice.

82
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,630
- Mama?
- Yeah?

83
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,010
Quiero Raisin Bran, por favor.

84
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,090
- What is that?
- That's Spanish.

85
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,720
Monday mornings,
we have breakfast in español.

86
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,100
Hey, Ryan.

87
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,850
You wanna stay in here and learn Spanish,

88
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,980
or do you wanna come outside
and have some fun with your old man?

89
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,820
- I think that he needs to...
- Is it okay if I go?

90
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,570
Yeah, of course it's okay. Right, Mom?

91
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,820
- Come on.
- Sure.

92
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,120
There you go, champ.

93
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,210
You guys fucking ready?

94
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,590
Okay, we pan up.

95
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,760
We see Homelander
flying towards Martinez's Miami mansion.

96
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
And Martinez makes a run for it.

97
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,390
Octavio accelerates,
but Homelander laser-blasts out the tires.

98
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,140
Bzzt! Unh!

99
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,350
Martinez gets out of the car,

100
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
dazed.

101
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,690
Looks up.

102
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,230
Homelander: "You're under arrest."

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,650
And he slaps the handcuffs
on Martinez. The cops take him away.

104
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,950
Homelander turns to the other heroes:
"We should work together more often."

105
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,950
"You mean like a team-up?"

106
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,540
"Exactly.

107
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,870
All seven of us."

108
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Holy shit.

109
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Holy shit.

110
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,090
That is the moment The Seven became...

111
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,850
The Seven.

112
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,720
Rousing music.

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,230

114
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,770
Title card. Dawn of the Seven.

Cut to black.

116
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,240
- That is amazing.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,110
Wow, I am very impressed.

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
Thank you so much.

119
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,830
And, gang, that's just the teaser.

120
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,450
Look, this is not just a superhero...

121
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,660
You look like shit.

122
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,660
- Yes!
- Had a big night.

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,750
And I wanna shoot
the whole thing handheld.

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,170
Very Greengrass, very grounded.

125
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,340
I wanna take the audience

126
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,760
and literally put them,
boom, right there in the action.

127
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,260
- What's the plan on Translucent?
- That's a great question.

128
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,260
We're gonna take a stuntman,
put him in a jumpsuit, and CG him out.

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,890
And... fuck, I don't wanna jinx this,

130
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,310
but Lin-Manuel Miranda
wants to do the voice.

131
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,390
I love Hamilton!

132
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,850
The world loves Hamilton!

133
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
- Think...?
- Excuse me.

134
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,770
- I'm sorry to interrupt this lovefest.
- No.

135
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,650
- I just wanna be a part of it.
- Understood.

136
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,110
This...

137
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,650
- Great work.
- Thank you so much.

138
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,450
This script is a great start.

139
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,910
Really good bones.

140
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,580
I just have a few headlines.

141
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,870
Totally. Listen, we can tweak dialogue
right up to the day of production.

142
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,170
Yeah, it's not really tweaks.
It's more... global.

143
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,050
Okay, yeah. What are we, um...?

144
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,170
What are we thinking?

145
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,470
Um...

146
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,510
Like...

147
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,930
you write all women
as either unknowable Hitchcock bitches

148
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,140
or Michael Bay fuck dolls.

149
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,810
I mean, I get that a lifetime
of jerking off to Transformers

150
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,890
didn't exactly make you popular
with the ladies,

151
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,860
but a little effort would be nice,
you know what I'm saying?

152
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,730
Um, excuse me, but I do have two sisters,

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,860
thank you very much.

154
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,030
- Of course you do.
- And excuse me,

155
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,160
but Homelander really loves the script.

156
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,070
-Yes.

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,780
Okay. Where is he?

158
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Ashley?

159
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,040
Um, okay.

160
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,040
Fuck.

161
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay. Just, you know,
continue doing what you're doing.

162
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,470
I just have to get to my——
I have to—— I have a—...

163
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,890
I just have to get to my next thing.
I have a...

164
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,510
I have a noon...

165
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,810
Can someone open this, please?

166
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

167
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,480
I got a few more headlines.

168
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,610
Mr Edgar.

169
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
Sir, if this is all true,

170
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,990
I will get a strategy together
with Crisis Management and PR.

171
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,240
We're fine for now, Ashley.

172
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,370
Sir, is it true?

173
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,250
- We're investigating.
- What they're saying?

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,460
Sir, I have to tell you something.

175
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,500
We have to tell Homelander,
and I have to admit something to you. i...

176
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,710
You don't have the faintest idea
where Homelander is.

177
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,260
He will know when I want him to know.

178
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,180
Just keep the rest of the infants on 99
in check, will you?

179
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,730
And if you're just tuning in,
we have some major breaking news.

180
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,440
Superheroes are not born but made,

181
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,610
in fact, created by a chemical serum,
Compound V,

182
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,160
produced and administered
by Vought international,

183
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,250
the company that has been
the corporate face of superheroes

184
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,330
for decades.

185
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,000
Now, we don't know...

186
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,210
What did you do?

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,250
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on.

188
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,550
I saw you with the V in your hand.

189
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,590
Yeah, and you let me walk away with it.

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,840
So... this is kind of on you too.

191
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,470
If I go down, you come with me.

192
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,020
Pretty sure they'd kill us both.

193
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
You don't get it.

194
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,650
You don't fuck with the money.

195
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,820
You never fuck with the money.

196
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,360
We're gonna lose everything.

197
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,450
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses.

198
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,250
There are more important things.

199
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,330
You know, the only people that say that...

200
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,590
are the people who grew up with money.

201
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:28,260
...proving Vought has been administering
Compound V to children for decades.

202
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,260
Our very own reporting suggests

203
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,470
the parents also received
a very generous payment...

204
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,810
Started when I was 9.

205
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,730
...were treated with Compound V...

206
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,100
I was at the mall.

207
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,150
...Vought scientists throughout
their childhood under the guise...

208
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,230
We...

209
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,070
We passed the pet store...

210
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,160
and I heard the goldfish
begging for their lives.

211
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,460
They were begging.

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,130
Then after that, I...

213
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,510
The beach, the aquarium, Red Lobster.

214
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,730
I thought I was going crazy, you know?

215
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,650
But my mom said it was a gift.

216
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,450
That I was born this way.

217
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,580
But it wasn't.

218
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
It didn't have to be this way.

219
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
I could've been normal.

220
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,010
...suggests that
the first manifestation of powers

221
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,880
can cause fear and anxiety
in the affected children,

222
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,680
especially if they are not carefully
guided through the process.

223
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,600
So far,
Vought has refused to release a statement.

224
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,060
Likewise, Dr Jonah Vogelbaum,
former CSO at the company,

225
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,360
refusing comment.

226
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,820
He's been in seclusion

227
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,530
-since an undisclosed accident left him...
—Hey.

228
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,610
Is this you?

229
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
You did it.

230
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,330
We did it. Um...

231
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,580
Call me.
Call me back when you get a chance.

232
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,420
...on their stock price,
which is already falling today.

233
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,330
Did What?

234
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,000
...huge trend
that could be potentially catastrophic

235
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,840
to Vought's bottom line.

236
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,210
- This news comes just as this company...
- You did this?

237
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,050
-...was taking in record profits...
—Yeah.

238
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,390
Starlight did, mostly, pretty sure.

239
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,260
But I just gave her an old alley-oop.

240
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,430
- However...
- Hughie.

241
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,730
- Hughie! Yes! Dude.
- Okay.

242
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,060
The kid. Look at what you fucking did!

243
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,900
- My God.
- You lads touching your tips?

244
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,610
- Look at what the kid just did.
- Me and Starlight, but yeah.

245
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,530
- Petit Hughie?
- The fucking kid.

246
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,360
- Shit.
- Okay, okay.

247
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,450
- Yeah!
- No, no, no.

248
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,530
Nice one.

249
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,540
That's all you got?

250
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
We've been trying
to do this shit for years,

251
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,380
Vought's finally fucking going down,
the kid did it, and "Nice one"?

252
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,300
All right, real nice one.

253
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,760
You can't even give me this, can you?

254
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,890
Not one goddamn win.

255
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
I'll tell you what.

256
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,640
When we're all done here,

257
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,350
I'll buy you a nice big family-size bottle
of top-shelf lube,

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,440
and I'll tickle your balls
till you beg me to stop.

259
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,690
And even then I won't.

260
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,070
I just won't do it.

261
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,070
But right now,
we got a Supe terrorist below deck,

262
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,910
and shit could go sideways just like:

263
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,080
So all of you
keep your fucking eyes on the ball.

264
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Yeah?

265
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,550
Don't worry about him.

266
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,760
Yeah, fuck him.

267
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
You did great.

268
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,280
Isn't this great?

269
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,190
Yeah.

270
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,610
Your mom ever bring you up here?

271
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,910
- No.
- Nah.

272
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Of course not.

273
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,500
See, that is why a boy needs his father.

274
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,000
Hey, I think it's time.

275
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,380
Yeah. You ready?

276
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,430
Ready for what?

277
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
To jump.

278
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Wait, you can't be serious.
I'm not gonna jump.

279
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,110
Ryan, you're my son.

280
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,780
You can fly, just like me.

281
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,040
I don't want to.

282
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,290
You take a big deep breath, you step off,
and your body will just do the rest.

283
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
It'll just take over.

284
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,000
But I can't fly.
I'll just fall right off of here.

285
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,460
Hey, hey, hey, buddy.

286
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,260
You're gonna love it. I promise.

287
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm nothing like you. I can't fly.

288
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,600
You can. You can.

289
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
I promise you can.

290
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,520
Dad, please.

291
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,270
Please don't make me jump.

292
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,060
Aw.

293
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
Buddy.

294
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,070
You called me "Dad."

295
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,340
Ryan? God.

296
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,460
Ryan! Hey, hey, hey!

297
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,470
- What did you do?
- It's fine.

298
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,260
It's a 20-foot drop. Relax.

299
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,470
Inhuman fucking monster. Come here.

300
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,180
- Don't help him up. Let him do it himself.
- Come here. Hey.

301
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,060
Hey. Ryan, I need you to wake up.

302
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,480
Baby? Can you hear me? I'm right here.

303
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,560
- I don't think he's breathing.
- He's fine.

304
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,770
- I don't think he's...
- Mom'?

305
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,610
- Hi. Hi.
- Look. See?

306
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
- Hi, sweetie.
- Told you.

307
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Are you hurt?

308
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,700
- Does anything feel broken? Let me see.
- For God's sake.

309
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,570
Come on, look at him.
Not a scratch on him.

310
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,490
You know why? 'Cause he's my son.

311
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,750
And you...
You're raising him to be a pussy.

312
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,710
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

313
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,630
I'm his father.

314
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,590
You don't get to say that
after what you did.

315
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,550
What I did to you

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,090
was give you a son
that you are raising like a little girl.

317
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,590
Let go of me.

318
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,390
He's mine.

319
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,890
Get your hands off of her!

320
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,030
Good boy.

321
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,070
You see? I told you.

322
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,280
- You're just like me, Ryan.
- No, I'm not like you!

323
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,870
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you! Leave us alone!

324
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,790
Hey, it's okay. I'm not angry.

325
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,250
Ryan.

326
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,670
Go away!

327
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,540
- Buddy, it's okay...
- Leave us alone!

328
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,050
Ryan, this is a good thing.

329
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,700
These are horrible powdered cheese things,

330
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,950
but if you're hungry...

331
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,790
Fuck you.

332
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,170
So you do speak English.

333
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Thirsty?

334
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,520
You know,
the way you talk with your sister

335
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,900
is no sign language I ever seen.

336
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,530
I just wanna help her.

337
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,990
I can help her.

338
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,540
You understand?

339
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,260
The night our parents were murdered,

340
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,430
Kimiko just stopped talking.

341
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Can't talk.

342
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,260
She's never made a sound since.

343
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
In the camp,

344
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,940
we were alone week after week,

345
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,770
just the two of us, for years.

346
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,620
We came up with a language

347
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,330
so we could get through it.

348
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,870
It saved us.

349
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,830
Both of us.

350
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,470
Will you teach me?

351
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,890
Please.

352
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Fuck you.

353
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,620
I think your sister is very special.

354
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,500
And she loves you very much.

355
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,720
I don't know anything
about this Compound V monkey business.

356
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,190
If someone gave it to my little Maeve,
I sure as hell didn't know.

357
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,190
Bullshit, he didn't know.

358
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,940
I remember this one weekend
where he made me do three mall appearances

359
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,280
and a photo shoot for Teen Vogue,
all to get the cash for my braces,

360
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,570
which he then blew
at the five-dollar table at Circus Circus.

361
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,450
Maybe this is what we've been waiting for.

362
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,450
What do you mean?

363
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,040
They've lied to you,
from the beginning, all of them.

364
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,960
You don't owe them anything.

365
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,540
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

366
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,420
Elena, if we do that,
you know what'll happen.

367
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,090
I'll call you back.

368
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm not, interrupting, am I?

369
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,890
No, of course not.

370
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,430
Great.

371
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,780
It's funny, you know...

372
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,200
of all the people here,

373
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,000
I've known you the longest.

374
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Yeah.

375
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,840
Sometimes...

376
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,970
it just seems
like you're the only person I can lean on.

377
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,470
Yeah, I... I feel the same way.

378
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
You do?

379
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,270
Of course.

380
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
You...

381
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,540
Fuck.

382
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,710
Life?

383
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,090
It's crazy.

384
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,510
Who's Elena?

385
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
Elena's an old friend.

386
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,640
Since when do you have friends?

387
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,600
I was just venting
about all this fucking bullshit.

388
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
What bullshit?

389
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,480
Wait, you haven't heard?

390
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,940
Where have you been?

391
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,830
What the fuck?

392
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,710
This is the NYPD.

393
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,710
This boat's been reported stolen.
You're all under arrest.

394
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,630
I repeat, this is the NYPD.
This boat's been reported stolen.

395
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,920
I thought you said
this boat belongs to a friend.

396
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,760
Well, a stranger is just a friend
you ain't met yet.

397
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,520
- Don't fuck this up.
- I ain't gonna fuck it up.

398
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,180
Vought's almost toast.
We're almost home free.

399
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,310
I said,
I ain't gonna fuck it up, all right?

400
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,150
Ahoy, gents.

401
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,770
I am the captain of My Big Wet Dream.

402
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm holding papers signed by the owner
for the lease of this vessel.

403
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,240
So there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

404
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,830
Look out!

405
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,290
Get his hands!

406
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,380
Mayday!

407
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,550
Time to go.

408
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,270
- What are you doing? We gotta help them.
- They're already dead.

409
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,440
You don't know that.
They... We have to try.

410
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,650
Literally everyone
is on their way here right now.

411
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,520
We stay here, we die too.

412
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Fuck.

413
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,290
What?

414
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,460
I wasn't the one who fucked that up.

415
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,690
I know how you feel. I'm a freak too.

416
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,150
You shoot a fucking bow and arrow.

417
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm amphibious.

418
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,360
Okay, just give me the phone.

419
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,740
Cancel the call.

420
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,620
Postmating Papa John's isn't gonna help.

421
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,620
How do you know what helps?
You don't know anything about me.

422
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,620
Let's just recite the 15 Tenets together.

423
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,920
No. Fuck you and your creepy shit, Eagle.
I'm hungry.

424
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,420
Deep. It's time.

425
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,590
Time for what?

426
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,680
For you.
It's your time to get back into The Seven.

427
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,760
- What?
- This came from Alastair himself.

428
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,730
Holy shit.

429
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,230
Who?

430
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,190
Alastair Adana. The leader of the Church.

431
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,150
He sits in the first chair.

432
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,190
Cool.

433
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,660
Guys, with everything going on, I just...
I don't think I can do it right now.

434
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,530
No, Deep. This is your journey.

435
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,990
You're ready.

436
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,950
You have been ready all along.

437
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,920
Now get out there and be a hero.

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,630
My dad always used to say,
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."

439
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,390
Vought lied to us about Compound V.
What else are they lying to us about?

440
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,310
We're down 68 percent in morning trading,
20 percent in the last 15 minutes.

441
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,060
- It hits 19, start a buyback.
- Yes, sir.

442
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,890
Jesus. What about the pharmaceuticals?

443
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,730
Pfizer's dismayed at our lack of ethics.

444
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,320
Lawsuits,
breach of fiduciary duty, nondisclosure.

445
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,150
Exposure for fraud,
assault, infliction of bodily harm.

446
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,990
- All policy exclusions, no coverage.
- We have two options.

447
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,620
Option one, deny. High risk, high reward.

448
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,870
But if we deny and they nail us,

449
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,410
if there's a legit whistleblower,
there's no coming back.

450
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,540
That's bankruptcy, criminal charges,
ten to 15 for everyone in this room.

451
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,460
Option two, mea culpa.

452
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,250
They've called it.

453
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,380
Trading's halted.

454
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,010
Stan.

455
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,140
We gotta put out a statement.
Which one is it?

456
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Stan.

457
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,020
A power-drink can, Frenchie?

458
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,440
- You're a goddamn idiot.
- I was trying to help her.

459
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,740
Where the hell are your mates?

460
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,030
- New deal. You gotta bring him in.
- Grace, we 're three miles offshore.

461
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,160
You just crashed a police helicopter.
Not exactly keeping a low profile.

462
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,790
All right. Where do you want us to go?

463
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,580
CIA safe house, Hazlet. Be there in 30.

464
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,710
- And, Butcher?
- Yeah?

465
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,840
Please be careful.

466
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
I Will.

467
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,970
Fuck me.

468
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,100
Please leave your name
and number and a message after the beep.

469
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,480
Hey. Hey, Annie, it's me again.

470
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,490
I was just wondering,
have you ever seen the music video

471
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,320
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

472
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,620
There's this kid,
and he's climbing up a bridge,

473
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,490
and he's gonna kill himself.

474
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,580
But then Billy Joel steps out
with his harmonica and tells him to stop.

475
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,540
"You just have to wait
for your second wind."

476
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,880
And now I feel like I'm that kid...

477
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,630
and I'm gonna drown and...

478
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,640
And thank God
I found my second wind, because it's you.

479
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,390
You're my second wind.

480
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,610
Um...

481
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,190
Look, I know it's exciting
taking down Vought

482
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,400
and being like James Bond and everything,

483
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,780
but you gotta be careful because
that stuff can go to shit really quick...

484
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,330
and you wind up
hurting the people that you love.

485
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,790
Like the way that I hurt you.

486
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,670
Um...

487
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,170
Anyhoo, that's all I wanted to say.

488
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,340
Second wind.

489
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,510
Fuck.

490
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,720
Okay, thanks. Bye.

491
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,040
I know I don't come up to 99 enough,

492
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,500
and I apologise for that.

493
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,590
But times like this tend
to give us clarity, don't they?

494
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,140
You and me are partners, after all.

495
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,390
A symbiotic part of a larger thing,

496
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,310
a living thing named Vought.

497
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,070
And that's how we'll get through this.
Together as Vought.

498
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,780
But, sir...

499
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,990
I gotta say...

500
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,750
we didn't know about this Compound V shit.

501
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,120
None of us.

502
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,420
Is that so?

503
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,460
Well, we're all victims here, A-Train,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.

504
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,380
I promise.

505
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,590
Right now,
catching this super-terrorist is the...

506
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,720
Villain.

507
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,390
Super-villain.

508
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,020
Sure, whatever.

509
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,650
It must be our priority,
and it changes the conversation.

510
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,270
So you want us to go out there? Now?

511
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,450
I mean, we still need to be prepped
by Legal and PR.

512
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,030
- We'll be eaten alive.
- There's no time for that.

513
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,620
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
we have to damage-control your fuckup.

514
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,330
Hey, guys.

515
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Enough.

516
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,550
We gotta pull together here.

517
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,420
- Thank you, Homelander.
- Shh. Not you.

518
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,590
Us.

519
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
The Seven.

520
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,140
See, it doesn't matter
who made us or how we got here.

521
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,270
The point is...

522
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
we are here.

523
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,230
Together.

524
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,820
Family.

525
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,950
You guys...

526
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,030
you are my real family.

527
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,960
This guy? He doesn't care about us.

528
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,500
We're not his partners. We're his product.

529
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,000
So who gives a shit
if Vought burns to the fucking ground?

530
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,920
You should think

531
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,760
- before you say something you don't mean.
- Really? Should I?

532
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,220
We are not Vought.

533
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,970
You see, companies,
they come and go, but talent...

534
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,310
talent is forever.

535
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,110
The world still needs superheroes.

536
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,110
And that, family, that's what we are.

537
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,950
So let's get out there
and do what it is we do.

538
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,530
Let's take this cocksucker down.

539
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,040
Fuck Vought?

540
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,210
I did not see that coming from you.

541
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,670
Maybe you don't know me that well.

542
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,250
Maybe I don't.

543
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,850
- How far?
- A mile. Right there.

544
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,270
- What the fuck was that?
- What the hell was that?

545
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,450
Take the wheel.

546
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,430
We lost power.

547
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,690
Everyone, off the boat. Now.

548
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,490
Frenchie, grab the winch.

549
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,530
Come on. Let's go, let's go. Get in.

550
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,290
- Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.
- Fuck.

551
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,580
Come on.
Frenchie, start it up. Go, go, go.

552
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,750
Go, go, go.

553
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,890
Look, there! Head for the storm drain!

554
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,990
Shit.

555
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,710
- Butcher! What are you doing?
- Butcher!

556
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,010
Butcher!

557
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,040
Fucking diabolical.

558
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,470
Where's Hughie?

559
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,130
Hughie!

560
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,010
Jeez.

561
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
You all right?

562
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,690
Come on, son. We've gotta leg it.

563
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,900
Deep's here,
and The Seven won't be far behind.

564
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,150
Um, you know what? Okay, you guys
go ahead. You guys go ahead. I'm good.

565
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,780
What?

566
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,530
I'm just gonna sit here and wait,
if you don't mind.

567
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,120
What the fuck are you waiting for?

568
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,700
My second wind.

569
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,340
All right, listen. Come on.

570
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,050
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

571
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,090
Jeez.

572
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,930
All right, fine. Suit yourself.

573
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,930
All right. Come on, let's go.

574
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,190
We can't leave the kid, man.

575
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,190
Pinocchio's staying put. Have at it.

576
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Hey, kid.

577
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,250
What are you doing here?

578
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,590
You ain't going...

579
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,930
I ain't going.

580
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,430
They're gonna be here any second.

581
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,810
Probably.

582
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,240
- Asshole.
- Yep.

583
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
This way.

584
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Frenchie.

585
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Hey, Butcher.

586
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,310
Petit Hughie.

587
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,560
Hey, the kid's falling apart.
You know that, right?

588
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,730
Well, what do you expect?
He's a fucking civilian.

589
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,690
No, no, no.
It's not just him. It's all of us.

590
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,990
Move the feet.
Just move the feet. Come on.

591
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,410
Move.

592
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,870
We're at our breaking point,
at each other's throats,

593
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,750
and you keep pushing us and pushing.

594
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,620
- It's like...
- Yeah. Right over the fucking finish line.

595
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,050
We just need to keep our shit together
a little bit longer. Okay?

596
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,760
We hand that cunt over,
and I get Becca and you get your girls.

597
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,050
- We're right fucking there.
- Butcher, Butcher.

598
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,550
Hughie's not gonna make it,

599
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,060
and you need that kid,

600
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,100
more than any one of us.

601
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,480
He's your canary.

602
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,860
My canary?

603
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,360
You let your canary die,

604
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,190
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

605
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,870
Fuck me. What a load of bollocks.

606
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,790
Look, I tried, all right?

607
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,920
The kid doesn't want a part of me.

608
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So fuck him.

609
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,550
Come on.

610
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,520
Lucy. I promise
we'll harvest your blubber.

611
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,440
Jesus Christ.

612
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Deep.

613
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,570
- Homelander.
- Hey.

614
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,530
- Hey.
- What happened?

615
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,530
- They killed her. They killed her, man.
- What?

616
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,910
I was trying to help out.
I got some intel on the boat.

617
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,370
We started to cut them off,
and they ran right into her.

618
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,910
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.
I tried to cut them off.

619
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,000
Okay. You're saying
there's people with the terrorist?

620
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,170
Look at me.
You're saying they're not alone.

621
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,000
- I think so.
- Did you get a good look at them?

622
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,800
Not really.
I was too busy worrying about Lucy.

623
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,590
Jesus. Right. Lucy.

624
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,760
But I think they went off
in the storm drains.

625
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,010
Can't be too far.

626
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,260
Who invited you, exactly?

627
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,350
Starlight.

628
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,060
Listen, what I did was unforgivable.

629
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,230
I'm going to do everything
in my power to renew my light.

630
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,900
Not just for you but for all
the female people I've offended.

631
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,530
Renew your light? Did you just fucking
join the Church of the Collective?

632
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,660
- Maybe.
- You're an idiot.

633
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,120
Hey, easy on the religious persecution,
okay, new girl?

634
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,330
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back into The Seven,

635
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,410
but I know my road is long and hard.

636
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,670
Are you serious?

637
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:16,010
There is no fucking way
you're coming back.

638
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,260
- There's no need for language.
- All right, enough.

639
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,640
We do not have time for this.

640
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:28,310
Look, I am with you, sister, but first
we have to go get the terrorist, okay?

641
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,940
Everyone in the tunnels.

642
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,900
- Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
- Not you.

643
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,320
Anyone gets eyeballs on the target,
he's mine, understood?

644
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
Go get them.

645
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Noir.

646
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,540
All right, you need to hang back a bit.

647
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,750
- Okay?
- Okay.

648
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,750
Still got some work to do with the ladies,
but it's gonna be okay.

649
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,630
- You'll be back in no time.
- Really?

650
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,710
Sure.

651
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,920
One other thing, you...
You ripped your vest.

652
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,550
- What?
- Your gill is showing.

653
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,470
Cover it up.

654
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,060
It's disgusting.

655
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,380
Come on. Come on.

656
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,430
You okay?

657
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,230
Yep. I just need a little rehab.

658
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,440
I'll be fine.

659
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,150
Yeah.

660
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,240
I know you will, A—Train.

661
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,740
You got my message.

662
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,210
Annie, I...

663
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,780
Come on.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

664
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,530
This guy? Again?

665
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,160
-I did not know... —Shut it.

666
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,910
What, do you got rocks
in your fucking head?

667
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,990
Come here.

668
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
All right.

669
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,040
I'd like you to do something for me, okay?

670
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Kill him.

671
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,510
Wait...

672
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,180
No, he... He's wanted.

673
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,390
Shouldn't we take him to the police?

674
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,970
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

675
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,270
Kill him. Right now.

676
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,520
Chicks. Right, Hughie?

677
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,980
For God's sakes. Come on. It's easy.

678
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,610
Hands in the air,
like you just don't care.

679
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,110
Kill him.

680
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
Do it.

681
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,960
More incentive? Okay.

682
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,550
You kill him,
or I'll fucking kill you both.

683
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,090
Do it.

684
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,820
Oi, cunt.

685
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:51,490
William?

686
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,030
What a surprise.

687
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,870
Hey, you know, I had a great breakfast
with your wife this morning.

688
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,370
Pancakes.

689
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,540
Delicious.

690
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,920
Yeah.

691
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,050
Eat this, motherfucker.

692
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:33,070
Please. Don't.

693
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,880
Come on, Hughie.
Before that cunt gets out.

694
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,300
Come on.

695
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,190
Please.

696
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,450
I love you.

697
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,030
I love you, too.

698
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,490
Hey, guys!

699
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,240
Call the foul!

700
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,470
Dad...

701
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,560
Dad, are you okay? Dad?

702
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,330
Aw.

703
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,750
Can't do your magic little hand thingy
anymore? How come?

704
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,400
Open your eyes.

705
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,900
Open your eyes.

706
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,860
I like to see the light go out.

707
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,120
Fucking yellow bastard.

708
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,020
I said he was mine.

709
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,780
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

710
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,440
I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

711
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,860
As you can imagine,

712
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,360
this has been a very difficult day
for the Vought family.

713
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,830
Our focus now will be to learn the truth.

714
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,750
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation into Compound V.

715
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:37,920
But let me be clear.
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

716
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,880
We believe it was the work
of a small disaffected group of scientists

717
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,220
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

718
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,770
But sadly,
there are more important matters at hand.

719
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,100
Everyone at Vought

720
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,520
sends their thoughts and prayers

721
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,770
to those families
that were affected today.

722
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,360
Though it is important to acknowledge

723
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,360
that this tragic event
could have been far worse.

724
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,030
Today's attack underscores

725
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,200
just how dangerous the threat
of super-terrorists has become.

726
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,000
And at a time like this,
America needs its heroes more than ever.

727
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
We live in a dangerous world.

728
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:20,380
Our brave heroes
were already fighting terrorists overseas,

729
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,880
but now America faces this war
on a different front: right here at home.

730
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,800
These enemies will stop at nothing

731
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,300
to infiltrate our borders
and attack our citizens.

732
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:34,390
Our superheroes
are the last line of defense.

733
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,270
And today's death toll
would've been much higher

734
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:42,270
had it not been for the brave actions
of our newest hero, Stormfront,

735
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,070
who stopped the terrorist
before he could take more innocent lives.

736
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,570
I don't want to imagine
what would've happened

737
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,780
if Stormfront hadn't been there...

738
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,970
America is truly blessed to have her.

739
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,180
Ladies and gentlemen, Stormfront.

740
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,280
Thank you, but we all know

741
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,950
who the real heroes
of this group are, right?

742
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,790
The people you see behind you.

743
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,250
The people who are struggling every day.

744
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,620
Let's give them all a hand.

745
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,480
- How did you know What to do?
- Stormfront, here!

746
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,110
Stormfront, over here, please!

747
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,570
Stormfront, look over here!

748
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,590
